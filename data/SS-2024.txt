Standard Specifications FOR ROAD, BRIDGE, AND MUNICIPAL CONSTRUCTION
M 41-10

2024 Foreword
These Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction have been developed to serve as a baseline for the work delivered to the public by the Washington
State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). The Standard Specifications are incorporated into the written agreement (Contract) between WSDOT as Contracting
Agency and the Contractor, except where the Contract indicates that a particular specification has been revised or replaced with a special provision to resolve projectspecific issues. The decision to revise or replace a standard specification with a special provision is made during the design process and is based upon the sound engineering judgment of the project designer.
These Standard Specifications reflect years of refinement through the literally hundreds of projects the Department delivers each year. In addition, the standards are the result of countless hours of development and review by both our internal WSDOT staff as well as our industry partners through the joint WSDOT/Associated General Contractors’
Standing Committees.
Finally, these standards reflect the contracting philosophy and balance of risk-allocation that the Department has adopted through the years. We believe that this balance of risks provides us the lowest final cost solution to our transportation needs. For example, shifting risk to the Contractor can provide more certainty on final cost, but may result in higher initial cost. On the other hand, accepting more risk by the owner can result in lower initial costs, but less certainty on the final cost. We at the Department of Transportation believe that we have reached the optimum point of balance for risk, and we will continue to consider this balance on all future specification revisions.
The language above indicates that these specifications are to be used only as a guideline during the design process, and that is true. Once they have been incorporated into a
Contract, however, they become the legal and enforceable language of that Contract. The
Standard Specifications, and the Project Special Provisions, along with any attachments in the Contract documents, define a Contract and are no longer seen as guidelines.
Rather, they are the written agreement, subject to revision only through the change order process.
This preface is for informational purposes only and is not to be used to interpret or affect the terms.

Bid Procedures and Conditions 1-02.1
Prequalification of Bidders

1-02
The Contracting Agency will provide a Bid Proposal Form only after a prospective Bidder submits a “Standard Questionnaire and Financial Statement”. This questionnaire enables the Contracting Agency to decide whether or not the Bidder is qualified to perform
Highway, road, or other public work. The questionnaire shall be sworn to before a person authorized to take oaths.
On the basis of this questionnaire, the Contracting Agency will either specify the type and amount of Work it considers the prospective Bidder prequalified to perform or advise the prospective Bidder of the reasons they failed to be prequalified. To remain prequalified, the Bidder must submit an updated questionnaire once a year and supplements whenever required by the Contracting Agency.
A submittal deadline applies to prospective Bidders not prequalified or from whom a supplemental questionnaire is due. To receive consideration for issuance of a Bid Proposal
Form on a specific project, the questionnaire (or supplement) must be received by the
Prequalification Engineer no less than 15 days prior to the scheduled Bid opening.
The Contracting Agency may withdraw a Bidder’s prequalification or reduce its amount if: 1.
The extent of other work the Bidder has under Contract (Contracting Agency or otherwise) justifies such action, or 2.
Past or present work on a Contracting Agency Contract has been less than satisfactory.

If a Bidder’s questionnaire does not contain sufficient information, the Contracting Agency may refuse to provide a Bid Proposal Form and disregard any Bid submitted. After opening
Bids, the Contracting Agency may decide that a prequalified Bidder is not responsible and may refuse to accept the Bid on that basis. Such a refusal will be conclusive unless the Bidder appeals within five days to the Superior Court of Thurston County. Appeals shall be heard within ten days after filed and shall provide at least five days’ notice to the
Contracting Agency.
The Bidder shall ensure that the combination of the Bid amount and other Contract work with the Contracting Agency does not exceed the prequalification amount. If this combination does exceed the prequalification amount, the Contracting Agency may determine the Bidder to be not responsible and refuse to Award a Contract.
Two or more prospective Bidders may, in a joint venture, prequalify and Bid jointly on a single Contract. Each shall have filed a “Standard Questionnaire and Financial Statement”.
Together they shall also file a standard form of “Individual Project Statement of Joint
Venture” and a joint venture agreement in a form acceptable to the Contracting Agency.
To Bid jointly on a continuous joint venture on more than one Contract, two or more prospective Bidders shall submit: 1.
A “Standard Questionnaire and Financial Statement” compiled for the joint venture; 2.
A “Standard Questionnaire and Financial Statement” for each member (if the
Contracting Agency has no copy on file); and

3.
A copy of the “Joint Venture Agreement” signed by each member of the joint venture and naming each person authorized to sign documents on its behalf. (If any member is a corporation, a corporate resolution shall accompany the agreement. This resolution shall authorize the joint venture agreement and name the officer(s) authorized to sign the joint venture agreement or Contract on behalf of the corporation.)
The Contracting Agency will treat the continuing joint venture as a new firm and decide its prequalification on that basis.
All joint ventures and each of its members are subject to Section 1-02.14.

Has satisfied itself as to the adequacy of time allowed for the completion of the physical Work on the Contract.
Failure of the Bidder to take the actions described and acknowledged in this clause shall not relieve the Bidder from responsibility for estimating properly the difficulty and cost of successfully performing the Work, or from proceeding to successfully perform the Work without additional expense to the Contracting Agency.
The Bidder agrees that the Contracting Agency shall not be liable to it on claims for additional payment or additional time or any claim whatsoever if the claim directly or indirectly results from the Bidder’s failure to investigate and familiarize itself sufficiently with the conditions under which the Contract is to be performed.
The Bidder shall be familiar and comply with all Federal, State, tribal, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations which might affect those engaged in the Work. The
Contracting Agency will not consider a plea of misunderstanding or ignorance of such requirements.
Bid prices shall reflect what the Bidder anticipates to be the cost of completing the Work, including methods, materials, labor, and equipment. Except as the Contract may provide, the Bidder shall receive no payment for costs that exceed those in the Bid prices.
Prospective Bidders are advised that projects with Work on or adjacent to water may require insurance coverage in compliance with: 1.

Agency to be necessary in submitting Bids or if the Contracting Agency concludes that the lack of the information would be prejudicial to other prospective Bidders.
Information provided by the Contracting Agency for inspection by the Bidders as
Reference Information will be made available for inspection at the location specified in the Special Provisions. The availability of Reference Information from the Contracting
Agency shall not relieve the Bidder or the Contractor from risks or their duty to make examinations and investigations as required by this section or other responsibility under the Contract or as may be required by law.
Prospective Bidders are advised that the Contracting Agency may include a partially completed Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) Transfer of Coverage (Ecology form ECY 020-87a) for the Construction Stormwater General Permit (CSWGP) as part of the Bid Documents. When the Contracting Agency requires the transfer of coverage of the CSWGP to the Contractor, an informational copy of the Transfer of
Coverage and the associated CSWGP will be included in the appendices. As a condition of Section 1-03.3, the Contractor is required to complete sections I, III, and VIII of the

U.S. dollars and cents. The Proposal shall include: 1.
A unit price for each item (omitting digits more than two places to the right of the decimal point), 2.
An extension for each unit price (omitting digits more than two places to the right of the decimal point), and

3.
The total Contract price (the sum of all extensions).
In the space provided on the signature sheet, the Bidder shall confirm that all Addenda have been received.
The Bidder shall submit with the Bid a list of: 1.
Subcontractors who will perform the work of structural steel installation, rebar installation, heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and plumbing as described in
RCW 18.106 and electrical as described in RCW 19.28, and 2.
The Work those subcontractors will perform on the Contract as described in
RCW 39.30.060.
Shall not list more than one subcontractor for each category of work identified, except, when subcontractors vary with Bid alternates, in which case the Bidder shall identify which subcontractor will be used for which alternate.
If no subcontractor is listed, the Bidder acknowledges that it does not intend to use any subcontractor to perform those items of work.
The Bidder shall submit with their Bid a completed Contractor Certification Wage Law
Compliance form (WSDOT Form 272-009). Failure to return this certification as part of the Bid Proposal package will make this Bid Nonresponsive and ineligible for Award. A
Contractor Certification of Wage Law Compliance form is included in the Proposal Forms.
Proposals of corporations shall be signed by the officer or officers having authority to sign them. If a Bidder is a copartnership, the Proposal shall be signed by an authorized member of the copartnership.

Bid Deposit
A deposit of at least 5 percent of the total Bid shall accompany each Bid. This deposit may be cash, certified check, cashier’s check, or a proposal bond (Surety bond). For projects that are selected by the Contracting Agency to be Bid electronically, the proposal bond may be in either a physical format, or an electronic format via Surety2000.com or Insurevision.com and BidExpress®. When a physical Bid deposit or proposal bond is furnished to accompany an electronic Proposal Form, the Bid deposit shall be received by the Contracting Agency at the location specified for receipt of Bids prior to the time set for receipt of Bids. Proposal bonds shall be on a form acceptable to the Contracting
Agency and shall be signed by the Bidder and the Surety. A proposal bond shall not be

Bid Procedures and Conditions conditioned in any way to modify the minimum 5 percent required. The Surety shall: (1) be registered with the Washington State Insurance Commissioner, and (2) appear on the current Authorized Insurance List in the State of Washington published by the Office of the Insurance Commissioner.
The failure to furnish a Bid deposit of a minimum of 5 percent with the Bid or as a physical supplement to the electronic Proposal Form shall make the Bid nonresponsive and shall cause the Bid to be rejected by the Contracting Agency. 1-02.8 1-02.8(1)
Noncollusion Declaration and Lobbying Certification
Noncollusion Declaration

When required by Section 112(c) Title 23, United States Code, a declaration shall be provided certifying that the Bidder has not taken part in collusion or other action that would restrain competitive Bidding.
The Code of Federal Regulations 23 CFR 635.112(f)(1) requires that: “Each Bidder shall file a sworn or unsworn statement executed by, or on behalf of the person, firm, association, or corporation submitting the Bid, certifying that such persons, firm, association, or corporation has not either directly or indirectly, entered into any agreement, participated in collusion, or otherwise taken action in restraint of free competitive Bidding in connection with the submitted Bid. Failure to submit the sworn or unsworn statement as part of the Bid Proposal package will make the Bid nonresponsive and not eligible for Award consideration”. In addition, 23 CFR 635.112(f)(1) requires that the Contracting Agency provide the form for the declaration to prospective Bidders and that the declaration shall be executed by such persons, firm, association, or corporation under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States.
Therefore, by including the Non-collusion Declaration as part of the signed bid Proposal, the Bidder is deemed to have certified and agreed to the requirements of the Declaration. 1-02.8(2)
Lobbying Certification
Section 319 of Public Law 101-121 prohibits payment of Federal Funds for contract lobbying by the Contractor and any subcontractor whose contract exceeds $100,000.
A Certification for Federal-Aid Contracts (WSDOT Form 272-040) is provided in the
Proposal Form for Contracts exceeding $100,000 to address this requirement.
By signing the proposal, the Bidder will be deemed to have signed and agreed to the conditions and requirements of the Certification for Federal-Aid Contracts.
The Contractor shall ensure that a Certification for Federal-Aid Contracts (WSDOT Form 272-040) is included in every contract with any subcontractor whose contract exceeds $100,000. By signing the contract any subcontractor will be deemed to have signed and agreed to the conditions and requirements of the Certification for Federal-Aid Contracts.
The Contractor shall keep evidence in their files that such subcontractor has committed to this requirement.
Section 319 of Public Law 101-121 also provides that, if any funds other than Federal appropriated funds have been paid or will be paid to any person for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of a Federal agency, a Member of
Congress, an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of Congress in connection with this Federal Contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement, the
Contractor shall complete and submit to the Contracting Agency the current version of
Standard Form LLL, DISCLOSURE OF LOBBYING ACTIVITIES, in accordance with the instructions on the form. All subcontractors whose contract exceeds $100,000 shall disclose in the same manner as the Contractor, except that, Standard Form LLL shall be submitted to the Contractor for processing to the Contracting Agency.

Award and Execution of Contract
Consideration of Bids
After opening and reading Proposals, the Contracting Agency will check them for correctness of extensions of the prices per unit and the total price. If a discrepancy exists between the price per unit and the extended amount of any Bid item, the price per unit will control. The total of extensions, corrected where necessary, will be used by the
Contracting Agency for Award purposes and to fix the amount of the Contract Bond.
The right is reserved by the Contracting Agency to waive informalities in the bidding, accept a Proposal of the lowest responsible Bidder, reject any or all Bids, republish the call for Bids, revise or cancel the Work, or require the Work to be done in another way if the best interest of the Contracting Agency is served.
A Bidder who wishes to claim error after the Bids have been publicly opened and read as required by RCW 47.28.090 shall promptly notify the Contracting Agency that an error occurred. The Bidder shall submit a notarized affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury signed by the Bidder and accompanied by the work sheets used in the preparation of the Bid, requesting relief from the responsibilities of Award. The affidavit or declaration shall describe the specific error(s) and certify that the work sheets are the ones used in preparing the Bid.
The affidavit or declaration shall be submitted no later than 5:00 p.m. on the first business day after Bid opening or the claim will not be considered. The Contracting Agency will review the affidavit or declaration and the certified work sheets to determine the validity of the claimed error and if the error is of the kind for which the law allows relief from forfeiture of the Bid deposit. If the Contracting Agency concurs in the claim of error and determines that the error is of the kind that allows relief from forfeiture, the Bidder will be relieved of responsibility and the Bid deposit of the Bidder will be returned. If the
Contracting Agency does not concur in the error or determines that the error is not the kind for which the law allows relief, the Contracting Agency may Award the Contract and if the Bidder refuses to execute the Contract, the Bidder’s Bid deposit shall be forfeited as required by RCW 47.28.100. 1-03.1(1)

Identical Bid Totals
After opening Bids, if two or more lowest responsive Bid totals are exactly equal, then the tie-breaker will be determined by drawing as described in this section. Two or more slips of paper will be marked as follows: one marked “Winner” and the other(s) marked “unsuccessful”. The slips will be folded to make the marking unseen. The slips will be placed inside a box. One authorized representative of each Bidder shall draw a slip from the box. Bidders shall draw in alphabetic order by the name of the firm as registered with the Washington State Department of Licensing. The slips shall be unfolded and the firm with the slip marked “Winner” will be determined to be the successful Bidder and eligible for Award of the Contract. Only those Bidders who submitted a Bid total that is exactly equal to the lowest responsive Bid are eligible to draw. 1-03.2
Award of Contract
Normally, Contract Award or Bid rejection will occur within 45 calendar days after Bid opening. If the lowest responsible Bidder and the Contracting Agency agree, this deadline may be extended. If they cannot agree on an extension by the 45 calendar day deadline, the Contracting Agency reserves the right to Award the Contract to the next lowest responsible Bidder or reject all Bids. The Contracting Agency will notify the successful
Bidder of the Contract Award in writing.

Washington.
Until the Contracting Agency executes a Contract, no Proposal shall bind the Contracting
Agency, nor shall any Work begin within the project limits or within Contracting Agencyfurnished sites. The Contractor shall bear all risks for Work begun outside such areas and for all materials ordered before the Contract is executed by the Contracting Agency.
If the Bidder experiences circumstances beyond their control that prevents return of the Contract documents within 20 calendar days after the Award date, the Contracting
Agency may grant up to a maximum of 20 additional calendar days for return of the documents, provided the Contracting Agency deems the circumstances warrant it. 1-03.4
Contract Bond
The successful Bidder shall provide an executed Contract Bond for the full Contract amount. This Contract Bond shall: 1.

Be on a Contracting Agency-furnished form; 2.
Be signed by an approved Surety (or Sureties) that: a.
Is registered with the Washington State Insurance Commissioner; and b.
Appears on the current Authorized Insurance List in the State of Washington published by the Office of the Insurance Commissioner, 3.
Be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the Contract by the Contractor within the prescribed time; 4.
Be conditioned upon the payment of taxes, increases, and penalties incurred on the project under titles 50, 51, and rcw 47.; and 5.
Guarantee that the Surety shall indemnify, defend, and protect the Contracting
Agency against all claims of direct or indirect loss resulting from the failure: a.
Of the Contractor (or the employees or subcontractors) to faithfully perform the
Contract; or

b.
Of the Contractor (or the subcontractors) to pay all laborers, mechanics, all subcontractors, material persons, and all other persons who provides supplies or provisions for carrying out the Work.
The Contracting Agency may require Sureties or Surety companies on the Contract Bond to appear and qualify themselves. Whenever the Contracting Agency deems the Surety or Sureties to be inadequate, it may, upon written demand, require the Contractor to furnish additional Surety to cover all remaining Work. Until the added Surety is furnished, payments on the Contract will stop.

Enterprise information if required in the Contract, or failure or refusal to sign the Contract, or failure to register as a contractor in the state of Washington, or failure to return the completed Transfer of Coverage for the Construction Stormwater General Permit to the Contracting Agency when provided shall result in forfeiture of the proposal bond or deposit of this Bidder. If this should occur, the Contracting Agency may then Award the Contract to the second lowest responsible Bidder or reject all remaining Bids. If the second lowest responsible Bidder fails to return the required documents as stated above within the time provided after Award, the Contract may then be Awarded successively in a like manner to the remaining lowest responsible Bidders until the above requirements are met or the remaining Proposals are rejected. 1-03.6

Coordination of Contract Documents, Plans, Special Provisions,
Specifications, and Addenda
The complete Contract includes these parts: the Contract Form, Bidder’s completed
Proposal Form, Contract Plans, Contract Provisions, Standard Specifications, Standard
Plans, Addenda, various certifications and affidavits, supplemental agreements, change orders, and subsurface boring logs (if any). These parts complement each other in describing a complete Work. Any requirement in one part binds as if stated in all parts.
The Contractor shall provide all Work or materials clearly implied in the Contract even if the Contract does not mention it specifically.
Any inconsistency in the parts of the Contract shall be resolved by following this order of precedence (e.g., 1 presiding over 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; 2 presiding over 3, 4, 5, and 6; and so forth): 1.

Addenda, 2.
Proposal Form, 3.

On the Contract Plans, Working Drawings, and Standard Plans, figured dimensions shall take precedence over scaled dimensions.
This order of precedence shall not apply when Work is required by one part of the
Contract but omitted from another part or parts of the Contract. The Work required in one part must be furnished even if not mentioned in other parts of the Contract.
Whenever reference is made in these Specifications or the Special Provisions to codes, rules, specifications, and standards, the reference shall be construed to mean the code, rule, specification, or standard that is in effect on the Bid advertisement date, unless otherwise stated or as required by law.
If any part of the Contract requires Work that does not include a description for how the
Work is to be performed, the Work shall be performed in accordance with standard trade practice(s). For purposes of the Contract, a standard trade practice is one having such regularity of observance in the trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed by the Contractor in doing the Work.
In case of ambiguities or disputes over interpreting the Contract, the Engineer’s decision will be final as provided in Section 1-05.1.

Changes
The Engineer reserves the right to make, at any time during the Work, such changes in quantities and such alterations in the Work as are necessary to satisfactorily complete the project. Such changes in quantities and alterations shall not invalidate the Contract nor release the Surety, and the Contractor agrees to perform the Work as altered. Among others, these changes and alterations may include: 1.
Deleting any part of the Work. 2.
Increasing or decreasing quantities.

3.
Altering Specifications, designs, or both. 4.
Altering the way the Work is to be done. 5.
Adding new Work. 6.
Altering facilities, equipment, materials, services, or sites, provided by the
Contracting Agency. 7.
Ordering the Contractor to speed up or delay the Work.
The Engineer will issue a written change order for changes unless the remainder of this section provides otherwise.
If the alterations or changes in quantities significantly change the character of the
Work under the Contract, whether or not changed by any such different quantities or alterations, an adjustment, excluding loss of anticipated profits, will be made to the
Contract. The basis for the adjustment shall be agreed upon prior to the performance of the Work. If a basis cannot be agreed upon, then an adjustment will be made either for or against the Contractor in such amount as the Engineer may determine to be fair and equitable. If the alterations or changes in quantities do not significantly change the character of the Work to be performed under the Contract, the altered Work will be paid for as provided elsewhere in the Contract. The term significant change shall be construed to apply only to the following circumstances:
A. When the character of the Work as altered differs materially in kind or nature from that involved or included in the original proposed construction; or
B. When an item of Work, as defined elsewhere in the Contract, is increased in excess of
125 percent or decreased below 75 percent of the original Contract quantity. For the purpose of this Section, an item of Work will be defined as any item that qualifies for adjustment under the provisions of Section 1-04.6.
For item 1, an equitable adjustment for deleted Work will be made as provided in
Section 1-09.4.
For item 2, if the actual quantity of an item, exclusive of added or deleted amounts included in agreed change orders, increases or decreases by more than 25 percent from the original Plan quantity, the unit Contract prices for that item may be adjusted in accordance with Section 1-04.6.
For all changes except item 1 (deleted Work) or item 2 (increasing or decreasing quantities), the Engineer will determine if the change should be paid for at unit
Contract price(s). If the Engineer determines that the change increased or decreased the Contractor’s costs or time to do any of the Work including unchanged Work, the
Engineer will make an equitable adjustment to the Contract. The equitable adjustment
2024 Standard Specifications

Scope of the Work will be by agreement with the Contractor. However, if the parties are unable to agree, the Engineer will determine the amount of the equitable adjustment in accordance with
Section 1-09.4 and adjust the time as the Engineer deems appropriate. Extensions of time will be evaluated in accordance with Section 1-08.8. The Engineer’s decision concerning equitable adjustment and extension of time shall be final as provided in Section 1-05.1.
The Contractor shall proceed with the Work upon receiving: 1.
A written change order approved by the Engineer, or 2.
An oral order from the Engineer before receiving the written change order.
Within 14 calendar days of delivery of the change order the contractor shall endorse and return the change order, request an extension of time for endorsement or respond in accordance with Section 1-04.5. The Contracting Agency may unilaterally process the change order if the Contractor fails to comply with these requirements or when the
Contractor protests in accordance with Section 1-04.5. Changes normally noted on field stakes or variations from estimated quantities, except as provided in subparagraph A or
B above, will not require a written change order. These changes shall be made at the unit prices that apply. The Contractor shall respond immediately to changes shown on field stakes without waiting for further notice.
The Contractor accepts all requirements of a change order by: (1) endorsing it, (2) not responding within the allotted time, or (3) not protesting in accordance with Section 1-04.5. A change order that is not protested in accordance with Section 1-04.5 shall be full payment and final settlement of all claims for Contract time and for all costs of any kind, including costs of delays, related to Work either covered or affected by the change.
The Contractor shall obtain written consent of the Surety or Sureties if the Engineer requests such consent.
Change Orders will be transmitted electronically to the Contractor for signature. The
Contractor shall apply all signatures electronically using the software provided by the
Contracting Agency. Within 21 days of execution of the Contract, the Contractor shall submit a Type 1 Working Drawing consisting of the names, email addresses, and textmessage capable phone numbers for the authorized change order signers and shall bear the name, phone number and email of the officer providing this authorization. Delegation of authority to sign Change Orders shall be by the officer authorized to sign the Contract in accordance with Section 1-02.1. 1-04.4(1)

Minor Changes

Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP) 1-04.4(2)A
General
A VECP is a Contractor proposed change to the Contract Provisions that will accomplish the project’s functional requirements in a manner that is equal to or better than the requirements in the Contract. The VECP may be: (1) at a less cost or time, or (2) either no cost savings or a minor increase in cost with a reduction in Contract time. The net savings or added costs to the Contract Work are shared by the Contractor and
Contracting Agency.
The Contractor may submit a VECP for changing the Plans, Specifications, or other requirements of the Contract. The Engineer’s decision to accept or reject all or part of the proposal is final and not subject to arbitration under the arbitration clause or otherwise subject to litigation.
The VECP shall meet all of the following: 1.
Not adversely affect the long term life cycle costs. 2.
Not adversely impact the ability to perform maintenance. 3.
Provide the required safety and appearance.

4.
Provide substitution for deleted or reduced Condition of Award Work, Apprentice
Utilization and Training.
VECPs that provide a time reduction shall meet the following requirements: 1.
Time saving is a direct result of the VECP. 2.
Liquidated damages penalties are not used to calculate savings. 3.
Administrative/overhead cost savings experienced by either the Contractor or
Contracting Agency as a result of time reduction accrue to each party and are not used to calculate savings. 1-04.4(2)B
VECP Savings 1-04.4(2)B1
Proposal Savings

The incentive payment to the Contractor shall be one-half of the net savings of the proposal calculated as follows: 1. (gross cost of deleted work) – (gross cost of added work) = (gross savings) 2. (gross savings) – (Contractor’s engineering costs) – (Contracting Agency’s costs) = (net savings) 3. (net savings) / 2 = (incentive pay)
The Contracting Agency’s costs shall be the actual consultant costs billed to the
Contracting Agency and in-house costs. Costs for personnel assigned to the Engineer’s office shall not be included. 1-04.4(2)B2
Added Costs to Achieve Time Savings
The cost to achieve the time savings shall be calculated as follows: 1. (cost of added work) + (Contractor’s engineering costs - Contracting Agency’s engineering costs) = (cost to achieve time savings) 2. (cost to achieve time savings) / 2 = (Contracting Agency’s share of added cost)
If the timesaving proposal also involves deleting work and, as a result, creates a savings for the Contracting Agency, then the Contractor shall also receive one-half of the savings realized through the deletion.

The Contracting Agency and Contractor shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Board Members from and against all claims, damages, losses and expenses, including but not limited to attorney’s fees arising out of and resulting from the actions and recommendations of the Board. 1-04.6
Variation in Estimated Quantities
Payment to the Contractor will be made only for the actual quantities of Work performed and accepted in conformance with the Contract. When the accepted quantity of Work performed under a unit item varies from the original Proposal quantity, payment will be at the unit Contract price for all Work unless the total accepted quantity of the Contract item, adjusted to exclude added or deleted amounts included in change orders accepted by both parties, increases or decreases by more than 25 percent from the original
Proposal quantity. In that case, payment for Contract Work may be adjusted as described herein.
The adjusted final quantity shall be determined by starting with the final accepted quantity measured after all Work under an item has been completed. From this amount, subtract any quantities included in additive change orders accepted by both parties. Then,
2024 Standard Specifications

M 41-10
Page 1-37 1-04
Scope of the Work to the resulting amount, add any quantities included in deductive change orders accepted by both parties. The final result of this calculation shall become the adjusted final quantity and the basis for comparison to the original Proposal quantity. 1.
Increased Quantities – Either party to the Contract will be entitled to renegotiate the price for that portion of the adjusted final quantity in excess of 1.25 times the original Proposal quantity. The price for excessive increased quantities will be determined by agreement of the parties, or, where the parties cannot agree, the price will be determined by the Engineer based upon the actual costs to perform the Work, including reasonable markup for overhead and profit. 2.
Decreased Quantities – Either party to the Contract will be entitled to an equitable adjustment if the adjusted final quantity of Work performed is less than 75 percent of the original Bid quantity. The equitable adjustment shall be based upon and limited to three factors: a.
Any increase or decrease in unit costs of labor, materials or equipment, utilized for Work actually performed, resulting solely from the reduction in quantity; b.
Changes in production rates or methods of performing Work actually done to the extent that the nature of the Work actually performed differs from the nature of the Work included in the original plan; and c.
An adjustment for the anticipated contribution to unavoidable fixed cost and overhead from the units representing the difference between the adjusted final quantity and 75 percent of the original Plan quantity.
The following limitations shall apply to renegotiated prices for increases and/or equitable adjustments for decreases: 1.
The equipment rates shall be actual cost but shall not exceed the rates set forth in the
AGC/WSDOT Equipment Rental Agreement (referred to in Section 1-09.6) that is in effect at the time the Work is performed.

2.
No payment will be made for extended or unabsorbed home office overhead and field overhead expenses to the extent that there is an unbalanced allocation of such expenses among the Contract Bid items. 3.
No payment for consequential damages or loss of anticipated profits will be allowed because of any variance in quantities from those originally shown in the Proposal form, Contract Provisions, and Contract Plans. 4.
The total payment (including the adjustment amount and unit prices for Work performed) for any item that experiences an equitable adjustment for decreased quantity shall not exceed 75 percent of the amount originally Bid for the item.
If the adjusted final quantity of any item does not vary from the quantity shown in the
Proposal by more than 25 percent, then the Contractor and the Contracting Agency agree that all Work under that item will be performed at the original Contract unit price.
When ordered by the Engineer, the Contractor shall proceed with the Work pending determination of the cost or time adjustment for the variation in quantities.
The Contractor and the Contracting Agency agree that there will be no cost adjustment for decreases if the Contracting Agency has entered the amount for the item in the
Proposal form only to provide a common Proposal for Bidders. 1-04.7
Differing Site Conditions (Changed Conditions)

During the progress of the Work, if preexisting subsurface or latent physical conditions are encountered at the site, differing materially from those indicated in the Contract, or if preexisting unknown physical conditions of an unusual nature, differing materially from those ordinarily encountered and generally recognized as inherent in the Work provided for in the Contract, are encountered at the site, the party discovering such conditions shall
Page 1-38
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Scope of the Work 1-04 promptly notify the other party in writing of the specific differing site conditions before they are disturbed and before the affected Work is performed.
Upon written notification, the Engineer will investigate the conditions to determine if conditions materially differ and cause an increase or decrease in the cost or time required for the performance of any Work under the Contract, an adjustment, excluding loss of anticipated profits, will be made and the Contract modified in writing accordingly. The
Engineer will provide the Contractor a Written Determination whether an adjustment of the Contract is warranted.
No Contract adjustment which results in a benefit to the Contractor will be allowed unless the Contractor has provided the required written notice.
The equitable adjustment will be by agreement with the Contractor. However, if the parties are unable to agree, the Engineer will determine the amount of the equitable adjustment in accordance with Section 1-09.4. Extensions of time will be evaluated in accordance with Section 1-08.8.
If the Engineer determines that different site conditions do not exist and no adjustment in costs or time is warranted, such determination shall be final as provided in Section 1-05.1.
If there is a decrease in the costs or time required to perform the Work, failure of the
Contractor to notify the Engineer of the differing site conditions shall not affect the
Contracting Agency’s right to make an adjustment in the costs or time.
If the Contractor does not agree with the Engineer’s Written Determination, the
Contractor shall pursue the protest procedures in accordance with Section 1-04.5.
No claim by the Contractor shall be allowed unless the Contractor has followed the procedures provided in Sections 1-04.5 and 1-09.11. 1-04.8

Progress Estimates and Payments
Engineer-issued progress estimates or payments for any part of the Work shall not be used as evidence of performance or quantities. Progress estimates serve only as basis for partial payments. The Engineer may revise progress estimates any time before final acceptance. If the Engineer deems it proper to do so, changes may be made in progress estimates and in the final estimate. 1-04.9
Use of Buildings or Structures
The Engineer will decide whether any building or Structure on the Right of Way may remain during the Work and whether the Contractor may use such a building or Structure. 1-04.10
Use of Materials Found on the Project
With the Engineer’s written approval, the Contractor may use on the project: stone, gravel, sand, other materials from on-site excavation, or timbers removed in the course of the Work. Approval will not be granted if: 1.
The excavated materials or timber fail to meet Contract requirements; 2.
The excavated materials or timber are required for other use under the Contract; 3.
The excavated materials are required for use as Selected Materials under Section 2-03.3(10); or 4.
Such use is not in the best interests of the Contracting Agency as determined by the
Engineer, whose decision shall be final as provided in Section 1-05.1.

Any material disturbed by, but not used in, the Work shall be disposed of as provided elsewhere in the Contract or as ordered by the Engineer in accordance with
Section 1-04.4.

The Engineer represents the Contracting Agency with full authority to enforce Contract requirements. If the Contractor fails to respond promptly to the requirements of the
Contract or orders from the Engineer: 1.

The Engineer may use Contracting Agency resources, other contractors, or other means to accomplish the Work; and 2.
The Contracting Agency will not be obligated to pay the Contractor and will deduct from the Contractor’s payments all costs that result from any other means used to carry out the Contract requirements or Engineer’s orders.
At the Contractor’s risk, the Engineer may suspend all or part of the Work according to
Section 1-08.6.
Nothing in these Specifications or in the Contract requires the Engineer to provide the
Contractor with direction or advice on how to do the Work. If the Engineer approves or recommends methods or manners for doing the Work or producing materials, the approval or recommendation shall not: 1.
Guarantee that following the method or manner will result in compliance with the
Contract, 2.
Relieve the Contractor of any risks or obligations under the Contract, or 3.
Create a Contracting Agency liability.

When the Contractor believes they have received an oral order, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer in writing and within 3 calendar days. After the Contractor notifies the Engineer, the Contracting Agency will respond with a Written Determination within
14 calendar days. If the Engineer determines that a change to the Contract is warranted, a written change order will be processed in accordance with Section 1-04.4. If the
Contractor disagrees with the Written Determination, the Contractor may protest in accordance with Section 1-04.5. Failure to follow procedures of this section will result in a waiver of claim. 1-05.1(2)

Requests for Information (RFI)
No Claim shall be allowed because of ambiguities in the Contract if: 1.
The Contractor discovers an ambiguity but fails to notify the Contracting Agency, or 2.
The Contractor failed to discover a patent ambiguity that would be discovered by a reasonably prudent Contractor.
If the Contractor discovers an ambiguity in the Contract or desires an explanation or interpretation of the Contract, they shall request the explanation or interpretation in writing by way of a Request for Information (RFI). The RFI shall clearly define the ambiguity and have enough detail for the Engineer to provide an explanation or interpretation. If such detail is not provided, the Engineer will return the RFI as incomplete. Should the RFI require a change to the Contract, the Contractor will indicate in their RFI that it includes a request for change (RFC).
A RFI shall not be used nor constitute a notice required in accordance with Sections 1-04.5 and 1-04.7.
The Contractor may submit a RFI for the one of following reasons: 1.
The Contractor believes there is information missing from the Contract Documents (Missing Information). 2.
The Contractor believes a clarification of one or more of the Contract requirements is necessary (Clarification). 3.
The Contractor needs to repair or otherwise correct a deficiency in the Work that requires a Change to the Contract to be acceptable (RFC – Construction Deficiency/
Repair procedure). Requests submitted for this reason shall be submitted in accordance with Section 1-05.7(1).

4.
The Contractor needs to substitute a material that provides an equal or better level of performance as the one specified in the Contract (RFC – Material Substitution).
Requests shall indicate the location(s), quantity, and shall describe how the material provides an equal or better level of performance as the material originally specified. 5.
The Contractor may submit a RFI that requests a change to the Contract requirements for a reason other than one listed in items 1-4 of this section (RFC –
Other). To be considered, the request must not meet the requirements of a Value
Engineering Change Proposal. To be considered, the request shall qualify as a Minor
Change in accordance with Section 1-04.4(1) and shall describe how the change is and shall describe how the change is beneficial to the project.
The Engineer will respond, in writing, to RFIs within 14 calendar days in the order they are received. If the Engineer cannot respond within 14 calendar days due to the nature and complexity of the RFI, the Engineer will respond to the RFI stating how many additional days are needed for a full response. This does not relieve the Contractor of its responsibility to request a time extension in accordance with Section 1-08.8.
If the Contractor needs to prioritize a RFI it shall indicate so as part of the RFI. Oral explanations, interpretations, or instructions given by anyone other than the Engineer will not be binding on the Contracting Agency. A response to a RFI shall be considered a
Written Determination.

M 41-10 Control of Work 1-05
If the Contractor’s Request for Information requires a change order, the Engineer’s response will indicate whether they are authorizing the Contractor to proceed with the changed work prior to an executed change order. Without this authorization, the
Contractor shall not proceed with the changed work until a Change Order has been processed. If the Contractor believes the response requires a change order and the
Engineer does not specifically state that a change order is necessary, the Contractor shall submit their Protest in accordance with Section 1-04.5. Proceeding without Protest shall waive the Contractor’s rights to Claim.
The Contractor shall bear all risk and costs of Work delays caused by rejection or nonapproval of RFIs that Requests for Change (RFC). The Contractor agrees the Engineer is under no obligation to accept an RFC. The Engineer’s decision to accept or reject all or part of a RFI that requests a change is final and not subject to Protest.
Unit Bid prices shall cover all costs of submitting RFIs. 1-05.2
Authority of Assistants and Inspectors
Assistants and Inspectors have the authority to determine if the Work and materials meet the Contract requirements, reject defective material and suspend Work that is being done improperly, subject to the final decisions of the Engineer.
Assistants and Inspectors are not authorized to accept Work, to accept materials, to issue instructions, or to give advice that is contrary to the Contract. Work done or material furnished that does not meet the Contract requirements shall be at the Contractor’s risk and shall not be a basis for a claim even if the Inspectors or assistants purport to change the Contract.
Assistants and Inspectors may advise the Contractor of faulty Work or materials or infringements of the terms of the Contract; however, failure of the Engineer or the assistants or Inspectors to advise the Contractor does not constitute acceptance or approval. 1-05.3

Working Drawings
The Contract may require the Contractor to submit Working Drawings for the performance of the work. Working Drawings shall be submitted by the Contractor electronically to the Engineer in PDF format; drawing details shall be prepared in accordance with conventional detailing practices. Unless allowed by the Engineer, the default page size shall be 8½ by 11 inches for text and calculations and 11 by 17 inches for drawings.
Working Drawings will be classified under the following categories: 1.
Type 1 – Submitted for Contracting Agency information. Submittal must be received by the Contracting Agency a minimum of 7 calendar days before Work represented by the submittal begins. 2.
Type 2 – Submitted for Contracting Agency review and comment. Unless otherwise stated in the Contract, the Engineer will require up to 20 calendar days from the date the Working Drawing is received until it is returned to the Contractor. The Contractor shall not proceed with the Work represented by the Working Drawing until comments from the Engineer have been addressed. 3.
Type 2E – Same as a Type 2 Working Drawing with Engineering as described below. 4.
Type 3 – Submitted for Contracting Agency review and approval. Unless otherwise stated in the Contract, the Engineer will require up to 30 calendar days from the date the Working Drawing is received until it is returned to the Contractor.

Control of Work
All Working Drawings shall be considered Type 3 Working Drawings except as specifically noted otherwise in the Contract. Unless designated otherwise by the Contractor, submittals of Working Drawings will be reviewed in the order they are received by the
Engineer. In the event that several Working Drawings are received simultaneously, the
Contractor shall specify the sequence in which they are to be reviewed. If the Contractor does not submit a review sequence for simultaneous Working Drawing submittals, the review sequence will be at the Engineer’s discretion.
Working Drawings requiring Engineering or calculations, Type 2E and 3E, shall be prepared by (or under the direction of) a Licensed Professional in accordance with State of Washington Title 18 RCW (Business and Professions) WAC 196, and WAC 308. the
Licensed Professional’s signature and seal, date of signature, and registration number shall appear on the cover page. The cover page shall also include the Contract number,
Contract title and sequential index to calculation page numbers.
If more than the specified number of calendar days is required for the Engineer’s review of an individual Working Drawing or resubmittal, an extension of time will be considered in accordance with Section 1-08.8.
Review or approval of Working Drawings shall neither confer upon the Contracting
Agency nor relieve the Contractor of responsibility for the accuracy of the drawings or their conformity with the Contract. The Contractor shall bear all risk and all costs of any
Work delays caused by rejection or nonapproval of Working Drawings.
Unit Bid prices shall cover all costs of Working Drawings. 1-05.4

Conformity with and Deviations from Plans and Stakes
The Special Provisions may require that the Contractor be contractually responsible for part or all of the project surveying. For survey requirements not the responsibility of the
Contractor, the Engineer will lay out and set construction stakes and marks needed to establish the lines, grades, slopes, cross-sections, and curve superelevations. These stakes and marks will govern the Contractor’s Work. The Contractor shall take full responsibility for detailed dimensions, elevations, and slopes measured from them.
All Work performed shall be in conformity with the lines, grades, slopes, cross-sections, superelevation data, and dimensions as shown in the Plans, or as staked. If the Plans,
Special Provisions, or these Specifications, state specific tolerances, then the Work shall be performed within those limits. The Engineer’s decision on whether the Work is in conformity shall be final, as provided in Section 1-05.1.
The Contractor shall not deviate from the approved Plans and Working Drawings unless the Engineer approves in writing.
When the Contracting Agency is responsible for roadway surveying, and the Contractor trims the Subgrade with an automatic machine guided by reference lines, the Engineer will set control stakes for line and grade only once after grading is complete. To gain better control with unusual pavement widths or for other reasons, the Engineer may set more control stakes without added cost to the Contractor. The Contractor shall set reference lines from these control stakes for trimming Subgrade, for surfacing, and for controlling the paving machines.
The Contractor shall work to preserve stakes, marks, and monuments set by the Engineer.
The Contracting Agency will deduct from payments due the Contractor all costs to replace such stakes, marks, and monuments carelessly or willfully damaged or destroyed by the
Contractor’s operation.
The Contractor shall provide enough safe areas to permit the Engineer to set those points and elevations that are the responsibility of the Contracting Agency and to perform random checks of the surveying performed by the Contractor.

Page 1-44
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Control of Work 1-05
The Contractor shall keep the Engineer informed of staking requirements to provide the Engineer with adequate time to set the stakes for which the Contracting Agency is responsible. Contractor requests for stakes shall be made at least 3 working days before the Engineer needs to begin the staking operation. 1-05.5
Tolerances
Geometrical tolerances shall be measured from the points, lines, and surfaces defined in
Contract documents.
A plus (+) tolerance increases the amount or dimension to which it applies, or raises a deviation from level. A minus (-) tolerance decreases the amount or dimension to which it applies, or lowers a deviation from level. Where only one signed tolerance is specified (+ or -), there is no specified tolerance in the opposing direction.
Tolerances shall not be cumulative. The most restrictive tolerance shall control.
Tolerances shall not extend the Work beyond the Right of Way or other legal boundaries identified in the Contract documents. If application of tolerances causes the extension of the Work beyond the Right of Way or legal boundaries, the tolerance shall be reduced for that specific instance.
Tolerances shall not violate other Contract requirements. If application of tolerances causes the Work to violate other Contract requirements, the tolerance shall be reduced for that specific instance. If application of tolerances causes conflicts with other components or aspects of the Work, the tolerance shall be reduced for that specific instance. 1-05.6

Inspection of Work and Materials
The Engineer may inspect all Work and materials for conformity with Contract terms. To ensure the Engineer’s safety and access during these inspections, the Contractor shall provide any equipment needed, such as walkways, railings, ladders, and platforms.
When the Engineer requests, the Contractor shall (without charge) provide samples of materials used or to be used in the Work. If the Contractor uses materials tested and approved for one project in an unrelated project, the Contracting Agency may deduct its testing and inspection costs from payments due the Contractor. The Engineer may order the Contractor to remove and replace materials used without inspection and the
Contractor shall bear the cost of doing so.
Inspections, tests, measurements, or other actions by Contracting Agency employees serve only one purpose: to assure the Engineer that Work, materials, progress rate, and quantities comply with Contract terms. Such work by Contracting Agency employees shall not relieve the Contractor of its responsibility for completing the Work or for determining if Contract requirements are being met. The Contractor shall correct all substandard Work or materials. The Engineer will reject unsuitable Work or materials even though inspected or paid for in a progress estimate.
If the Engineer requests, then the Contractor shall remove or uncover any requested area of the completed Work. After the Engineer inspects it, the Contractor shall restore the area to the standard the Contract requires. The Contractor shall bear the cost of uncovering, removing, and restoring the exposed Work: (a) if it proves unacceptable, or (b) if it was placed without authority or without due notice to the Engineer. The Contracting
Agency will pay these costs by agreed price or by force account if the Work proves to be acceptable and the Contractor had performed the original Work with the authority of and due notice to the Engineer.
The Contractor, if advised to do so by the Engineer, shall permit inspection of the Work from a representative of Railroad Companies, utilities, facilities of a public agency, or federal, state, or municipal agencies.

The Engineer will reject equipment that repeatedly breaks down or fails to produce results within the required tolerances. The Contractor shall have no claim for additional payment or for extension of time due to rejection and replacement of equipment.
Upon completion of the Work, the Contractor shall completely remove all loose dirt and vegetative debris from equipment before removing it from the job site. 1-05.10
Guarantees
The Contractor shall furnish to the Contracting Agency all guarantees or warranties furnished as a customary trade practice in connection with the purchase of equipment, materials, or items incorporated into the project. 1-05.11

Final Inspection
The Engineer will not make the final inspection until the physical Work required by the
Contract, including final cleanup and all extra Work ordered by the Engineer, has been completed. The Physical Completion Date for the Contract will be determined as provided in Section 1-08.5. 1-05.12
Final Acceptance
The Contractor must perform all the obligations under the Contract before a Completion
Date and final acceptance can occur. Failure of the Contractor to perform all the obligations under the Contract shall not bar the Contracting Agency from unilaterally accepting the Contract as provided in Section 1-09.9. The Secretary accepts the completed Contract and the items of Work shown in the final estimate by signature of the Final Contract Voucher Certification. The date of that signature constitutes the acceptance date. Progress estimates or payments shall not be construed as acceptance of
Work under the Contract.

Financial Incentive
As an incentive to produce superior quality material, a pay factor greater than 1.00 may be obtained with the maximum pay factor being 1.05. A lot containing non-Specification material will be accepted provided the Composite Pay Factor reaches the minimum value specified elsewhere. A lot containing non-Specification material that fails to obtain at least the specified minimum Composite Pay Factor will be rejected by the Engineer. The
Engineer will take one or more of the following actions when rejected material has been incorporated into the Work: 1.

Require complete removal and replacement with Specification material at no additional cost to the Contracting Agency. 2.
At the Contractor’s written request, allow corrective work at no additional cost to the
Contracting Agency and then an appropriate price reduction that may range from no reduction to no payment. 3.
At the Contractor’s written request, allow material to remain in place with an appropriate price reduction that may range from a designated percentage reduction to no payment.
Lots for which at least three samples have been obtained, and all of the test results meet one of the appropriate criteria listed below, will receive at least a 1.00 Composite Pay
Factor: 1.
All test results are within the allowable limits specified for the item, or 2.
All test results that only have a lower Specification limit are greater than or equal to that limit, or 3.
All test results that only have an upper Specification limit are less than or equal to that limit.
Computation of the quality level in these instances will be for determining the amount of a bonus that might be warranted.
Lots represented by less than three samples or unsampled lots will be exempt from statistical based acceptance. 1-06.2(2)C

Removed and Rejected Materials
The Contractor may, prior to sampling, elect to remove defective materials and replace them with new material at no expense to the Contracting Agency. Any such new material will be sampled, tested, and evaluated for acceptance as a part of the sublot in accordance with this statistical sampling and testing procedure.
The Engineer may reject a sublot that tests show to be defective. Such rejected material shall not be used in the Work, and the results of tests run on the rejected material will not be included in the original lot acceptance tests. 1-06.2(2)D
Quality Level Analysis 1-06.2(2)D1
General

Taxes
Under certain conditions, the Contracting Agency will adjust payment to compensate for tax changes. First, the changes shall involve federal or state taxes on materials or fuel used in or consumed for the project. Second, the changes shall increase or decrease
Contractor-paid taxes by more than $500. For items in the original Contract, the tax change must occur after the Bid opening date. For negotiated Contracts or items in a supplemental agreement, the tax change must take place after the execution date of the Contract or agreement. Within these conditions, the Contracting Agency will adjust compensation by the actual dollar amounts of increase or decrease caused by the tax changes. If the Engineer requests it, the Contractor shall certify in writing that the
Contract price does not include any extra amount to cover a possible change in taxes.
The Contracting Agency may audit the records of the Contractor as provided in Section 1-09.12, to verify claims for compensation because of changes in laws or taxes. 1-07.2
State Taxes
The Washington State Department of Revenue has issued special rules on the state sales tax. Sections 1-07.2(1) through 1-07.2(3) are meant to clarify those rules. The Contracting
Agency will not adjust its payment if the Contractor bases a Bid on a misunderstood tax liability.
The Contracting Agency may deduct from its payments to the Contractor, retainage or lien the bond, in the amount the Contractor owes the State Department of Revenue, whether the amount owed relates to the Contract in question or not. Amounts so deducted will be paid into the proper State fund on the contractor’s behalf. For additional information on tax rates and application refer to applicable RCWs, WACs or the Department of
Revenue website. 1-07.2(1)

State Sales Tax: WAC 458-20-171 – Use Tax
For Work designated as Rule 171, Use Tax, the Contractor shall include for compensation the amount of taxes paid in the various unit Bid prices or other Contract amounts.
Typically, these taxes are collected on materials incorporated into the project and items such as the purchase or rental of; tools, machinery, equipment, or consumable supplies not integrated into the project.
The Summary of Quantities in the Contract Plans identifies those parts of the project that are subject to Use Tax under Section 1-07.2(1). 1-07.2(2)
State Sales Tax: WAC 458-20-170 – Retail Sales Tax
For Work designated as Rule 170, Retail Sales Tax, the Contractor shall collect from the
Contracting Agency, Retail Sales Tax on the full Contract price. The Contracting Agency will automatically add this Retail Sales Tax to each payment to the Contractor and for this reason; the Contractor shall not include the Retail Sales Tax in the unit Bid prices or in any other Contract amount. The Contractor (Prime or subcontractor) shall include sales or use tax on the purchase or rental of tools, machinery, equipment, or consumable supplies not integrated into the project, in the unit bid prices.
The Summary of Quantities in the Contract Plans identifies those parts of the project that are subject to Retail Sales Tax under Section 1-07.2(2). 1-07.2(3)
Services
Contracts wholly for professional or other applicable services are generally not subject to
Retail Sales Tax and therefore, the Contractor shall not collect Retail Sales Tax from the
Contracting Agency on those Contracts. All incidental taxes paid as part of providing the services shall be included in the payments under the Contract.

Wages
General

This Contract is subject to the minimum wage requirements of RCW 39.12 and to
RCW 49.28 (as amended or supplemented). On Federal-aid projects, Federal wage laws and rules also apply. The hourly minimum rates for wages and fringe benefits are listed in the Contract Provisions. When Federal wage and fringe benefit rates are listed, the rates match those identified by the U.S. Department of Labor’s “Decision Number” shown in the Contract Provisions.
The Contractor, subcontractors, and all individuals or firms required by RCW 39.12, WAC 296-127, or the Federal Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA) to pay minimum prevailing wages, shall not pay any worker less than the minimum hourly wage rates and fringe benefits required by RCW 39.12 or the DBRA. Higher wages and benefits may be paid.
By including the hourly minimum rates for wages and fringe benefits in the Contract
Provisions, the Contracting Agency does not imply that the Contractor will find labor available at those rates. The Contractor shall be responsible for amounts above the minimums that will have to be paid.
When the project is subject to both State and Federal hourly minimum rates for wages and fringe benefits and when the two rates differ for similar kinds of labor, the Contractor shall not pay less than the higher rate unless the State rates are specifically preempted by
Federal law. When the project involves highway Work, heavy Work, and building Work, the Contract Provisions may list a Federal wage and fringe benefit rate for the highway
Work, and a separate Federal wage and fringe benefit rate for both heavy Work and building Work. The area in which the worker is physically employed shall determine which
Federal wage and fringe benefit rate shall be used to compare against the State wage and fringe benefit rate.
If employing labor in a class not listed in the Contract Provisions on state funded projects only, the Contractor shall request a determination of the correct wage and benefits rate for that class and locality from the Industrial Statistician, Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (State L&I), and provide a copy of those determinations to the Engineer.
If employing labor in a class not listed in the Contract Provisions on federally funded projects, the Contractor shall request a determination of the correct wage and benefit for that class and locality from the U.S. Secretary of Labor through the Engineer. Generally, the Contractor initiates the request by preparing standard form 1444 Request for

The Contractor shall ensure that all firms (all Suppliers, Manufacturers, or Fabricators) that fall under the provisions of RCW 39.12 because of the definition “Contractor” in WAC 296‑127-010, complies with all the requirements of RCW 39.12.
The Contractor shall be responsible for compliance with the requirements of the DBRA and RCW 39.12 by all firms (all subcontractors, Suppliers, Manufacturers, or Fabricators) engaged in a part of the Work necessary to complete this Contract. Therefore, should a violation of this Subsection occur by any firm that is providing Work or materials for completion of this Contract whether directly or indirectly responsible to the
Contractor, the Contracting Agency will take action against the Contractor, as provided by the provisions of the Contract, to achieve compliance, including but not limited to, withholding payment on the Contract until compliance is achieved.
In the event the Contracting Agency has an error (omissions are not errors) in the listing of the hourly minimum rates for wages and fringe benefits in the Contract Provisions, the Contractor, subcontractors, or other firms that are required to pay prevailing wages, shall be required to pay the rates as determined to be correct by State L&I (or by the U.S.
Department of Labor when that agency sets the rates). A change order will be prepared to ensure that this occurs. The Contracting Agency will reimburse the Contractor for the actual cost to pay the difference between the correct rates and the rates included in the
Contract Provisions, subject to the following conditions: 1.

The affected firm relied upon the rates included in the Contract Provisions to prepare its Bid and certifies that it did so; 2.
The allowable amount of reimbursement will be the difference between the rates listed and rates later determined to be correct plus only appropriate payroll markup the employer must pay, such as, social security and other payments the employer must make to the Federal or State Government; 3.
The allowable amount of reimbursement may also include some overhead cost, such as, the cost for bond, insurance, and making supplemental payrolls and new checks to the employees because of underpayment for previously performed Work; and 4.
Profit will not be an allowable markup.
Firms that anticipated, when they prepared their Bids, paying a rate equal to, or higher than, the correct rate as finally determined will not be eligible for reimbursement.
There are many work-ready pre-apprentices who are currently looking for work in the highway construction trades all across the state of Washington. Contractors may have apprenticeship utilization commitments as part of their business practices and as part of their Contract. Contractors may be subject to hiring commitments such as
Equal Employment Opportunity, union commitments, and apprenticeship utilization requirements on Contracts receiving Federal or State funds. As part of a Contractor’s
Good Faith Efforts, contacting the Office of Equal Opportunity’s On the Job Training
Support Services (OJT/SS) Program Coordinator is highly encouraged. The OJT/SS
Program Coordinator can connect Contractors with Washington State Apprenticeship
Training Council recognized Pre-Apprenticeship training providers throughout the state, who give training to individuals in highway construction trades. These training providers can identify work-ready individuals in the necessary trades. Contractors who have been awarded WSDOT Contracts should be prepared to discuss their recruitment plans and how coordination with the OJT/SS Program Coordinator will be incorporated into that effort if needed. The Contractor may contact the OJT/SS Program Coordinator at 360-704-6314, or by email at ojtssinfo@wsdot.wa.gov.

The first-tier subcontractor may also seek recovery against the Contractor under applicable prompt pay statutes in addition to any other remedies provided by the first-tier subcontract or by law. 1-08.1(7)D
Contractor or Subcontractor Withholding “Withholding” (or to Withhold) is the act by the Contractor of making a payment to one of its subcontractors that is less than the payment amount requested by its subcontractor, or the act by a subcontractor of making a payment to its lower-tier subcontractor that is less than the payment amount requested by its lower-tier subcontractor. Withholding includes but is not limited to offsets, back charges, deferrals, adjustments for incorrect invoicing, unsatisfactory performance, damages, and delay costs, and can be either agreed or disputed amounts. Such an amount shall be considered an unresolved Withholding unless the invoice clearly indicates agreement with the purpose and amount of the Withholding.
Retainage will not be considered a Withholding unless it is disputed by the subcontractor.
In the event of a Withholding, the entity Withholding the payment shall provide written notice to the entity from which payment is Withheld. This notice should be sent as soon as the decision to Withhold is made, but in no case shall it be later than the date payment would otherwise be due. At the same time the Withholding notice is sent, a copy of the
Withholding notice shall be sent to the Engineer. The Contractor shall send the Engineer copies of all Withholding notices it receives from materials suppliers and subcontractors of any tier, within three calendar days of their receipt.
A Withholding notice shall include an accounting of payments to date, the value and reason(s) for the Withheld amount, and an explanation of what must be done to have the
Withheld amount released. If the cause of the Withholding is an improper invoice, the notice shall indicate the exact nature of the impropriety.
The entity from which payment is Withheld shall be paid within eight calendar days after it completes the remedial action identified. 1-08.1(7)E

Contracting Agency Withholding Regarding Prompt Pay
Withholding will not be considered resolved until the Contracting Agency receives written confirmation, by the entity from which the payment was Withheld, that either: 1.
The Withholding has been paid, or 2.
It agrees with the Withholding purpose and amount, and the issue is closed.
Page 1-106

Friday shall be counted a nonworking day. The days between December 25 and January 1 will be classified as nonworking days.
An unworkable day is defined as a half or whole day the Engineer declares to be unworkable because of weather or conditions caused by the weather that prevents satisfactory and timely performance of the Work shown on the critical path of the
Contractor’s approved progress schedule. Other conditions beyond the control of the
Contractor may qualify for an extension of time in accordance with Section 1-08.8.
Contract time shall begin on the first working day following the 21st calendar day after the date the Contracting Agency executes the Contract. If the Contractor starts Work on the project at an earlier date, then Contract time shall begin on the first working day when on-site Work begins. The Contract Provisions may specify another starting date for
Contract time, in which case, time will begin on the starting date specified.
Each working day shall be charged to the Contract as it occurs, until the Contract Work is physically complete. If Substantial Completion has been granted and all the authorized working days have been used, charging of working days will cease. By each Thursday at 5:00 P.M., the Engineer will provide the Contractor a statement that shows the number of working days: (1) charged to the Contract the week before; (2) specified for the
Physical Completion of the Contract; and (3) remaining for the Physical Completion of the Contract. The statement will also show the nonworking days and all half or whole days the Engineer declares as unworkable. The statement will be identified as a Written
Determination by the Engineer. If the Contractor does not agree with the Written
Determination of working days, the Contractor shall pursue the protest procedures in accordance with Section 1-04.5. By failing to follow the procedures of Section 1-04.5, the
Contractor shall be deemed as having accepted the statement as correct.
The Engineer will give the Contractor written notice of the Physical Completion Date for all Work the Contract requires. That date shall constitute the Physical Completion Date of the Contract but shall not imply the Secretary’s acceptance of the Work or the Contract.
The Engineer will give the Contractor written notice of the Completion Date of the
Contract after all the Contractor’s obligations under the Contract have been performed by the Contractor. The following events must occur before the Completion Date can be established: 1.

The physical Work on the project must be complete; and 2.
The Contractor must furnish all documentation required by the Contract and required by law, to allow the Contracting Agency to process final acceptance of the Contract.
The following documents must be received by the Engineer prior to establishing a

Suspension of Work
The Engineer may order suspension of all or any part of the Work if: 1.
Unsuitable weather prevents satisfactory and timely performance of the Work; or 2.
The Contractor does not comply with the Contract; or 3.
It is in the public interest.
When ordered by the Engineer to suspend or resume Work, the Contractor shall do so immediately.
If the Work is suspended for reason (1) above, the period of Work stoppage will be counted as unworkable days. But if the Engineer believes the Contractor should have completed the suspended Work before the suspension, all or part of the suspension period may be counted as working days. The Engineer will set the number of unworkable days (or parts of days) by deciding how long the suspension delayed the entire project.
If the Work is suspended for reason (2) above, the period of Work stoppage will be counted as working days. The lost Work time, however, shall not relieve the Contractor from the Contract responsibility.
If the performance of all or any part of the Work is suspended, delayed, or interrupted for an unreasonable period of time by an act of the Contracting Agency in the administration of the Contract, or by failure to act within the time specified in the Contract (or if no time is specified, within a reasonable time), the Engineer will make an adjustment for increases in the cost or time for the performance of the Contract (excluding profit) necessarily caused by the suspension, delay, or interruption. However, no adjustment will be made for suspensions, delays, or interruptions if (1) the performance would have been suspended, delayed, or interrupted by other causes, including the fault or negligence of the Contractor, or (2) an equitable adjustment is provided for or excluded under another provision of the Contract.
If the Contractor believes that the performance of the Work is suspended, delayed, or interrupted for an unreasonable period of time and such suspension, delay, or interruption is the responsibility of the Contracting Agency, the Contractor shall immediately submit a written notice of protest to the Engineer within 14 calendar days of the start of the suspension delay or interruption requesting an equitable adjustment. No adjustment shall be allowed for costs incurred more than 14 calendar days before the date the Engineer receives the Contractor’s written notice of protest. The Engineer will issue a Written
Determination to the Contractor and adjust payment and time in accordance with this section, if warranted. If the Contractor does not agree with the Written Determination, then the Contractor shall pursue the protest procedures in accordance with Section 1-04.5. The Contractor shall keep full and complete records of the costs and additional time of such suspension, delay, or interruption and shall permit the Engineer to have access to those records and any other records as may be deemed necessary by the
Engineer to assist in evaluating the protest.
The Engineer will determine if an equitable adjustment in cost or time is due as provided in this section. The equitable adjustment for increase in costs, if due, shall be subject to the limitations provided in Section 1-09.4, provided that no profit of any kind will be allowed on increases in costs caused by the suspension, delay, or interruption.
Request for extensions of time will be evaluated in accordance with Section 1-08.8.
The Engineer’s determination as to whether an adjustment should be made will be final as provided in Section 1-05.1.
By failing to follow procedures of Section 1-04.5, the Contractor completely waives claims for protested Work.

Maintenance During Suspension
Before and during suspensions (as described in Section 1-08.6) the Contractor shall protect the Work from damage or deterioration. Suspension shall not relieve the
Contractor from anything the Contract requires unless this section states otherwise.
At no expense to the Contracting Agency, the Contractor shall provide through the construction area safe, smooth, and unobstructed roadways and pedestrian access routes for public use during the suspension (as required in Section 1-07.23 or the Special
Provisions). This may include a temporary road, alternative pedestrian access route or detour.
If the Engineer determines that the Contractor failed to pursue the Work diligently before the suspension, or failed to comply with the Contract or orders, then the Contractor shall maintain the temporary Roadway in use during suspension. In this case, the Contractor shall bear the maintenance costs. If the Contractor fails to maintain the temporary
Roadway, the Contracting Agency will do the Work and deduct all resulting costs from payments due to the Contractor.
If the Engineer determines that the Contractor has pursued the Work diligently before the suspension, then the Contracting Agency will maintain the temporary Roadway (and bear its cost). This Contracting Agency-provided maintenance work will include only routine maintenance of: 1.

The Traveled Way, Auxiliary Lanes, Shoulders, and detour surface; 2.
Roadway drainage along and under the traveled Roadway or detour; and 3.
All barricades, signs, and lights needed for directing traffic through the temporary
Roadway or detour in the construction area.
The Contractor shall protect and maintain all other Work in areas not used by traffic. All costs associated with protecting and maintaining such Work shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.
After any suspension during which the Contracting Agency has done the routine maintenance, the Contractor shall accept the traveled Roadway or detour as is when
Work resumes. The Contractor shall make no claim against the Contracting Agency for the condition of the Roadway or detour.
After any suspension, the Contractor shall resume all responsibilities the Contract assigns for the Work. 1-08.8
Extensions of Time
The Contractor shall submit requests for time extensions to the Engineer in writing no later than 14 calendar days after the delay occurs. No adjustment shall be allowed for contract time incurred more than 14 calendar days prior to the date the Engineer receives the Contractor’s written request of time extension. The requests for time extension shall be limited to the effect on the critical path of the Contractor’s approved schedule attributable to the change or event giving rise to the request.
The Engineer may request additional information regarding the request, to ascertain the basis and amount of the time requested. In addition, the Engineer may request, and the
Contractor shall provide within 14 calendar days after Engineer’s request, an updated schedule that supports the request and demonstrates that the change or event: (1) had a specific impact on the critical path, and except in cases of concurrent delay, was the sole cause of such impact, and (2) could not have been avoided by resequencing of the
Work or by using other reasonable alternatives. Contractor may request additional time to respond to the supplemental information requested by the Engineer. If a request combined with previous extension requests, equals 20 percent or more of the original
Contract time then the Contractor’s letter of request must bear consent of Surety. In evaluating requests for time extension, the Engineer will consider how well the Contractor

Prosecution and Progress used the time from Contract execution up to the point of the delay and the effect the delay had on any completion times included in the Special Provisions. The Engineer will evaluate and issue a Written Determination within 21 calendar days of receiving the request or supplemental information.
The authorized time for Physical Completion will be extended for a period equal to the time the Engineer determines the Work was delayed because of: 1.
Adverse weather causing the time requested to be unworkable, provided that the
Engineer had not already declared the time to be unworkable and the Contractor has filed a written protest according to Section 1-08.5. 2.
Actions, neglect, or default of the Contracting Agency, its officers, or employees, or of other contractors employed by the Contracting Agency. 3.
Fire or other casualty for which the Contractor is not responsible. 4.
Strikes. 5.
Other conditions for which these Specifications permit time extensions such as: a.

In Section 1-04.4 if a change increases the time to do any of the Work including unchanged Work. b.
In Section 1-04.5 if increased time is part of a protest that is found to be a valid protest. c.
In Section 1-04.7 if a changed condition is determined to exist that caused a delay in completing the Contract. d.
In Section 1-05.3 if the Contracting Agency does not approve properly prepared and acceptable drawings within the time defined in Section 1-05.3. e.
In Section 1-07.13 if the performance of the Work is delayed as a result of damage by others. f.
In Section 1-07.17 if the removal or the relocation of a utility by forces other than the Contractor caused a delay. g.
In Section 1-07.24 if a delay results from all the Right of Way necessary for the construction not being purchased and the Special Provisions does not make specific provisions regarding unpurchased Right of Way. h.
In Section 1-07.28(4) if the Railroad Company changes railroad restrictions. i.
In Section 1-08.6 if the performance of the Work is suspended, delayed, or interrupted for an unreasonable period of time that proves to be the responsibility of the Contracting Agency. j.
In Section 1-09.11 if a dispute or claim also involves a delay in completing the
Contract and the dispute or claim proves to be valid.

k.
In Section 1-09.6 for Work performed on a force account basis. 6.
If the actual quantity of Work performed for a Bid item was more than the original
Plan quantity and increased the duration of a critical activity. Extensions of time will be limited to only that quantity exceeding the original Plan quantity. 7.
Exceptional causes not specifically identified in items 1 through 6, provided the request letter proves the Contractor had no control over the cause of the delay and could have done nothing to avoid or shorten it.
Working days added to the Contract by time extensions, when time has overran, shall only apply to days on which liquidated damages or direct engineering have been charged, such as the following:
If Substantial Completion has been granted prior to all of the authorized working days being used, then the number of days in the time extension will eliminate an equal
Page 1-116
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10

Prosecution and Progress 1-08 number of days on which direct engineering charges have accrued. If the Substantial
Completion Date is established after all of the authorized working days have been used, then the number of days in the time extension will eliminate an equal number of days on which liquidated damages or direct engineering charges have accrued.
The Engineer will not allow a time extension for causes listed above if it resulted from the
Contractor’s default, collusion, action or inaction, or failure to comply with the Contract.
The Contracting Agency considers the time specified in the Special Provisions as sufficient to do all the Work. For this reason, the Contracting Agency will not grant a time extension for: 1.
Failure to obtain all materials and workers unless the failure was the result of exceptional causes as provided above in Subsection 7; 2.
Changes, protests, increased quantities, or changed conditions (Section 1-04) that do not delay the completion of the Contract or prove to be an invalid or inappropriate time extension request; 3.
Delays caused by nonapproval of drawings or plans as provided in Section 1-05.3; 4.
Rejection of faulty or inappropriate equipment as provided in Section 1-05.9; 5.
Correction of thickness deficiency as provided in Section 5-05.5(1)B.

If the Contractor does not agree with the Engineer’s Written Determination, the
Contractor shall pursue the protest procedures in accordance with Section 1-04.5. By failing to follow the procedures of Section 1-04.5, the Contractor completely waives claims for protested Work. 1-08.9
Liquidated Damages
Time is of the essence of the Contract. Delays inconvenience the traveling public, obstruct traffic, interfere with and delay commerce, and increase risk to Highway users. Delays also cost tax payers undue sums of money, adding time needed for administration, engineering, inspection, and supervision.
Accordingly, the Contractor agrees: 1.
To pay the liquidated damages identified in the Special Provisions for each working day beyond the number of working days established for Physical Completion, and 2.
To authorize the Engineer to deduct these liquidated damages from any money due or coming due to the Contractor.
When the Contract Work has progressed to the extent that the Contracting Agency has full use and benefit of the facilities, both from the operational and safety standpoint, all the initial plantings are completed and only minor incidental Work, replacement of temporary substitute facilities, plant establishment periods, or correction or repair remains to physically complete the total Contract, the Engineer may determine the
Contract Work is substantially complete. The Engineer will notify the Contractor in writing of the Substantial Completion Date. For overruns in Contract time occurring after the date so established, liquidated damages identified in the Special Provisions will not apply.
For overruns in Contract time occurring after the Substantial Completion Date, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the basis of direct engineering and related costs assignable to the project until the actual Physical Completion Date of all the Contract Work. The
Contractor shall complete the remaining Work as promptly as possible. Upon request by the Engineer, the Contractor shall furnish a written schedule for completing the physical
Work on the Contract.
Liquidated damages will not be assessed for days for which an extension of time is granted. No deduction or payment of liquidated damages will, in any degree, release the
Contractor from further obligations and liabilities to complete the entire Contract.

Termination of Contract
Termination for Default
The Contracting Agency may terminate the Contract upon the occurrence of one or more or the following events: 1.
If the Contractor fails to supply sufficient skilled workers or suitable materials or equipment; 2.
If the Contractor refuses or fails to prosecute the Work with such diligence as will ensure its Physical Completion within the original Physical Completion time plus extensions of time which may have been granted to the Contractor by change order; 3.
If the Contractor is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if the Contractor or a third party files a petition to take advantage of a debtor’s act or to reorganize under the bankruptcy or similar laws concerning the Contractor, or if a trustee or receiver is appointed for the Contractor or for any of the Contractor’s property on account of the Contractor’s insolvency, and the Contractor or its successor in interest does not provide adequate assurance of future performance in accordance with the Contract within 15 calendar days of receipt of a request for assurance from the Contracting Agency; 4.
If the Contractor disregards laws, ordinances, rules, codes, regulations, orders or similar requirements of any public entity having jurisdiction;

5.
If the Contractor disregards the authority of the Contracting Agency; 6.
If the Contractor performs Work which deviates from the Contract, and neglects or refuses to correct rejected Work; or 7.
If the Contractor otherwise violates in any material way any provisions or requirements of the Contract.
Once the Contracting Agency determines that sufficient cause exists to terminate the
Contract, written notice shall be given to the Contractor and its Surety indicating that the
Contractor is in breach of the Contract and that the Contractor is to remedy the breach within 15 calendar days after the notice is sent. In case of an emergency such as potential damage to life or property, the response time to remedy the breach after the notice may be shortened. If the remedy does not take place to the satisfaction of the Contracting
Agency, the Engineer may, by serving written notice to the Contractor and Surety either: 1.
Transfer the performance of the Work from the Contractor to the Surety; or 2.
Terminate the Contract and at the Contracting Agency’s option prosecute it to completion by contract or otherwise. Extra costs or damages to the Contracting
Agency shall be deducted from money due or coming due to the Contractor under the Contract.

If the Engineer elects to pursue one remedy, it will not bar the Engineer from pursuing other remedies on the same or subsequent breaches.
Upon receipt of a notice that the Work is being transferred to the Surety, the Surety shall enter upon the premises and take possession of all materials, tools, and appliances for the purpose of completing the Work included under the Contract and employ by contract or otherwise any person or persons satisfactory to the Engineer to finish the Work and provide the materials without termination of the Contract. Such employment shall not relieve the Surety of its obligations under the Contract and the bond. If there is a transfer to the Surety, payments on estimates covering Work subsequent to the transfer shall be made to the extent permitted under law to the Surety or its agent without any right of the
Contractor to make any claim.

If the Engineer terminates the Contract or provides such sufficiency of labor or materials as required to complete the Work, the Contractor shall not be entitled to receive any further payments on the Contract until all the Work contemplated by the Contract has been fully performed. The Contractor shall bear any extra expenses incurred by the
Contracting Agency in completing the Work, including all increased costs for completing the Work, and all damages sustained, or which may be sustained, by the Contracting
Agency by reason of such refusal, neglect, failure, or discontinuance of Work by the
Contractor. If liquidated damages are provided in the Contract, the Contractor shall be liable for such liquidated damages until such reasonable time as may be required for
Physical Completion of the Work. After all the Work contemplated by the Contract has been completed, the Engineer will calculate the total expenses and damages for the completed Work. If the total expenses and damages are less than any unpaid balance due the Contractor, the excess will be paid by the Contracting Agency to the Contractor. If the total expenses and damages exceed the unpaid balance, the Contractor and the Surety shall be jointly and severally liable to the Contracting Agency and shall pay the difference to the Contracting Agency on demand.
In exercising the Contracting Agency’s right to prosecute the Physical Completion of the
Work, the Contracting Agency shall have the right to exercise its sole discretion as to the manner, method, and reasonableness of the costs of completing the Work. In the event that the Contracting Agency takes Bids for remedial Work or Physical Completion of the project, the Contractor shall not be eligible for the Award of such Contracts.
In the event the Contract is terminated, the termination shall not affect any rights of the
Contracting Agency against the Contractor. The rights and remedies of the Contracting
Agency under the Termination Clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this Contract. Any retention or payment of monies to the
Contractor by the Contracting Agency will not release the Contractor from liability.
If a notice of termination for default has been issued and it is later determined for any reason that the Contractor was not in default, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the notice of termination had been issued pursuant to Termination for Public Convenience in Section 1-08.10(2). This shall include termination for default because of failure to prosecute the Work, and the delay was found to be excusable under the provisions of Section 1-08.8. 1-08.10(2)

Termination for Public Convenience
The Engineer may terminate the Contract in whole, or from time to time in part, whenever: 1.
The Contractor is prevented from proceeding with the Work as a direct result of an
Executive Order of the President with respect to the prosecution of war or in the interest of national defense; or an Executive Order of the President or Governor of the State with respect to the preservation of energy resources; 2.
The Contractor is prevented from proceeding with the Work by reason of a preliminary, special, or permanent restraining order of a court of competent jurisdiction where the issuance of such restraining order is primarily caused by acts or omissions of persons or agencies other than the Contractor; or 3.
The Engineer determines that such termination is in the best interests of the
Contracting Agency. 1-08.10(3)
Termination for Public Convenience Payment Request
After receipt of Termination for Public Convenience as provided in Section 1-08.10(2), the Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Agency a request for costs associated with the termination. The request shall be prepared in accordance with the claim procedures outlined in Sections 1-09.11 and 1-09.12. The request shall be submitted promptly but in no event later than 90 calendar days from the effective date of termination.

The terms listed below shall be defined as follows in all measurements under this section: “Lump Sum” (when used as an item of payment): complete payment for the Work described for that item in the Contract. “Gauge” (in measurement of plates): the U.S. Standard Gauge. “Gauge” (in measurement of galvanized sheets used to manufacture corrugated metal pipe, metal plate pipe culverts and arches, and metal cribbing): that specified in
AASHTO M 36, M 167, M 196, M 197, or M 219. “Gauge” (in measurement of wire): that specified in AASHTO M 336M. “Ton”: 2,000 pounds of avoirdupois weight.
Items of payment that have “Lump Sum” or “Force Account” in the Bid item of Work shall have no specific unit of measurement requirement.
For each basis of measurement listed below, the Engineer will use the method of measurement described. For Bid items or materials measured on the basis of:
Hour – Measured for each hour that Work is actually performed. Portions of an hour will be rounded up to a half hour.
Square Yard or Square Foot – The measurement shall be a calculation from the neat dimensions shown in the Plans or as altered by the Engineer. If there is an exception within the measured area where the item of Work is not performed (such as a drainage vault within a measured sidewalk) and if the exception area is greater than 9 square feet, then the area of the exception will be subtracted from the payment area calculated from the neat dimensions.
Linear Foot – A length measured along an element unless the Plans require otherwise.
Weight – Weighed as required in Section 1-09.2.
Volume (of excavation and embankment) – Measured by the average-end-area method or by the finite element analysis method utilizing digital terrain modeling techniques.
All or some computations may be based on ground elevations and other data derived photogrammetrically. The Engineer may correct for curvature.
Volume (in the hauling vehicle) – Measured at the point of delivery. Hauling vehicles may be of any size or type the Engineer approves provided that the body is of such shape that the actual contents may be readily and accurately determined. If the Engineer requires, the Contractor shall level loads at the delivery point to facilitate measurement.
For each item listed below, the Engineer will use the method of measurement described.
Structures – Measured on the neat lines shown in the Plans or as altered by the Engineer.
When a complete Structure or structural unit is specified as the unit of measurement, the unit shall include all fittings and accessories.

Specific Requirements for Batching Scales
Each batching scale shall be designed to support a weighing container. The arrangement shall make it convenient for the operator to remove material from the weighing container while watching readout devices. A weighing container mounted on a platform scale shall have its center of gravity directly over the platform centerline. Batching scales used for concrete or hot mix asphalt shall not be used for batching other materials.
Readout devices used for batching or hopper scales shall be marked at intervals evenly spaced throughout and shall be based on the scale’s nominal rated capacity. These intervals shall not exceed one-tenth of 1 percent of the nominal rated capacity. Before use at a new site and then at 6-month intervals, all batching and hopper scales shall be: approved under rules of the Weights and Measures Section of the Washington State
Department of Agriculture or serviced and tested with at least 10,000 pounds by an agent of its manufacturer. In each case, the Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a copy of the final test results. 1-09.2(3)

Specific Requirements for Platform Scales
Each platform scale shall be able to weigh the entire hauling vehicle or combination of connected vehicles at one time. No part of the vehicle or vehicle combination will be permitted off the platform as it is weighed. A tare weight shall be taken of each hauling vehicle at least once daily.

Page 1-124
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Measurement and Payment 1-09 at intervals of no more than 40 pounds. Test records shall show results to the nearest
20 pounds. During weighing operations, weights shall be read and recorded to the nearest
100 pounds. Before use at a new site and then at 6-month intervals, platform scales shall be: approved under rules of the Washington State Department of Agriculture’s Weights and Measures Section, or serviced and tested with at least 10,000 pounds by an agent of its manufacturer. In each case, the Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a copy of the final test results. 1-09.2(4)
Specific Requirements for Belt Conveyor Scales
The Engineer may approve conveyor-belt weighing of untreated materials if the method and device meet all general requirements for weighing equipment. The recording tape, odometer, totalizer, calibration adjustment, and clock-time imprinter shall be kept locked and the Engineer shall retain all keys. All belt-conveyor scales shall comply with the requirements for Belt-Conveyor Scales in the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) Handbook No. 44, except where these Specifications modify those requirements.
A static load test shall be made: each day after the belt-conveyor has run continuously for about 30 minutes, and again, immediately after the air temperature changes significantly.
If the static load test reveals a need for adjustment, the Contractor shall perform a chain test. The Contractor shall make the computation of the test chain calibration, the calibration procedures and results, and related records available for the Engineer’s review.
The test chain shall be clearly marked with its calibration, carried in a suitable container, and kept immediately available for testing. 1-09.2(5)

Measurement
Scale Verification Checks – The Engineer will verify the accuracy of each batch, hopper, or platform scale. Verification checks for “commercial scale operations” will be at the option of the Engineer. Verification checks for “Contractor-provided scale operations” will be twice per project per year with one check near the beginning of the scale utilization and one near the end of scale utilization.
Verification checks may not be routinely conducted for weighed material, whose proposal quantity multiplied by the unit Bid price, has a value less than $20,000.
The verification will consist of one of the following methods and be at the Contractor’s option: 1.
Weigh a loaded truck on a separate certified platform scale designated by the
Contractor, for the purpose of scale verification. 2.
Weigh a vehicle that weighs at least 10,000 pounds on a separate certified scale and then check the project scale with it. 3.
Establish a certified fixed load weighing at least 10,000 pounds as a check-weight.
The certification shall consist of an affidavit affirming the correct weight of the fixed load.
Should the scale verification check reveal a weight difference of more than 0.5 percent, a second scale verification check shall be performed immediately. If the weight differences of both comparison checks exceed the 0.5-percent limit and the scale has been overweighing, the Contractor shall immediately stop weighing and the scale shall be recertified at the Contractor’s expense. If the weight difference of both comparison checks exceed the 0.5 percent limit and the scale is underweighing, it shall be adjusted immediately. Contractor will not be compensated for resulting losses from under weighing.
Belt Scales – To test the accuracy of a belt-conveyor scale, the Contractor shall weigh five or more payloads from sequential hauling units and compare these weights with weights of the same payloads taken on a separate certified platform scale. If the test results
2024 Standard Specifications

M 41-10
Page 1-125 1-09
Measurement and Payment fluctuate, the Engineer may require more than five check loads. Conveyor weights will be based on tonnage values taken from the sealed odometer at the beginning and end of each check period.
If scale verification checks show the scale has been under weighing, it shall be adjusted immediately. The Contractor shall not be compensated for resulting losses from under weighing.
If scale verification checks show the scale has been overweighing, its operation will cease immediately until adjusted. 1-09.2(6)

Unless specified otherwise, the Contracting Agency will pay for no materials received by weight unless they have been weighed as required in this section or as required by another method the Engineer has approved in writing.
The Contractor shall not be compensated for resulting losses from under weighing that is revealed by scale verification checks.
If scale verification checks reveal that the scale is overweighing, then payment for all material weighed since the last valid scale verification check will be adjusted. The
Contracting Agency will calculate the combined weight of all materials weighed after the last verification check showing accurate results. This combined weight will then be reduced for payment by the percentage of scale error that exceeds 0.5 percent unless the
Contractor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Engineer that the defect in the scale was present for a lesser period of time.
Unit Contract prices for the various pay items of the project cover all costs related to weighing and proportioning materials for payment. These costs include but are not limited to: 1.

Furnishing, installing, certifying, and maintaining scales; 2.
Providing a weigher to operate a Contractor-provided scale; 3.
Providing a weigher to operate a commercial scale, if necessary; 4.
Providing self-printing tickets, if necessary; 5.
Rerouting a truck for verification weighing; 6.
Assisting the Engineer with scale verification checks; 7.
Other costs associated with meeting the requirements of this section.
All costs to comply with this Section, unless otherwise stated, are incidental to the
Contract and are the responsibility of the Contractor. The Contractor shall include all related costs in the Bid prices of the Contract. 1-09.3
Scope of Payment

The payment provided for in the Contract shall be full payment to the Contractor for: 1.
Furnishing all materials and performing all Work under the Contract (including changes in the work, materials, or Plans) in a complete and acceptable manner; 2.
All risk, loss, damage, or expense of whatever character arising out of the nature or prosecution of the work; and 3.
All expense incurred resulting from a suspension or discontinuance of the Work as specified under the Contract.
The payment of an estimate or retained percentage shall not relieve the Contractor of the obligation to correct defective Work or materials.
Unless the Plans and Special Provisions provide otherwise, the unit Contract prices for the various Bids items shall be full payment for all labor, materials, supplies, equipment, tools,
Page 1-126
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Measurement and Payment 1-09 and all other things required to completely incorporate the item into the Work as though the item were to read “In Place”.
If the “Payment” clause in the Specifications, for an item included in the Proposal, covers and considers all Work and material essential to that item, then the Work or materials will not be measured or paid for under any other item that may appear elsewhere in the
Proposal or Specifications.
Certain payment items appearing in these Specifications contain a fill in indicated by an underbar at the end or within the Payment Item. The Plans and Proposal will include additional information to fill in the underbar, such as: 1.

The words “For Structure”, “For Concrete Barrier”, “For Bridge”, etc., with the intent of clarifying specific use of the item; or 2.
The words “Site (Site Designation)”, with the intent of clarifying where a specific item of Work is to be performed. 3.
Words indicating the type of product to be used.
Modification of payment items in this manner shall in no way change the intent of the
Specifications relating to these items. 1-09.4
Equitable Adjustment
The equitable adjustment provided for elsewhere in the Contract shall be determined in one or more of the following ways: 1. 2.
If the parties are able to agree, the price will be determined by using: a.
Unit prices; or b.
Other agreed upon prices;

If the parties cannot agree, the price will be determined by the Engineer using: a.
Unit prices; or b.
Other means to establish costs.
The following limitations shall apply in determining the amount of the equitable adjustment: 1.
The equipment rates shall be actual cost but shall not exceed the rates set forth in the AGC/WSDOT Equipment Rental Agreement in effect at the time the Work is performed as referred to in Section 1-09.6, and 2.
To the extent that delay or failure of performance was concurrently caused by the
Contracting Agency and the Contractor, the Contractor shall be entitled to a time extension for the portion of the delay or failure of performance concurrently caused, provided the Contractor makes such a request pursuant to Section 1-08.8; however, the Contractor shall not be entitled to an adjustment in Contract price. 3.
No claim for anticipated profits on deleted, terminated, or uncompleted Work will be allowed. 4.
No claim for consequential damages of any kind will be allowed. 1-09.5
Deleted or Terminated Work

The Engineer may delete Work by change order as provided in Section 1-04.4 or may terminate the Contract in whole or part as provided in Section 1-08.10(2). When the
Contract is terminated in part, the partial termination shall be treated as a deletion change order for payment purposes under this section.
Payment for completed items will be at unit Contract prices.

Page 1-127 1-09
Measurement and Payment
When an item is deleted in whole or in part by change order or when the Contract is terminated in whole or in part, payment for deleted or terminated Work will be made as follows: 1.
Payment will be made for the actual number of units of Work completed at the unit
Contract prices unless the Engineer determines the unit prices are inappropriate for the Work actually performed. When that determination is made by the Engineer, payment for Work performed will be as mutually agreed. If the parties cannot agree the Engineer will determine the amount of the equitable adjustment in accordance with Section 1-09.4;

2.
Payment for partially completed lump sum items will be as mutually agreed. If the parties cannot agree, the Engineer will determine the amount of the equitable adjustment in accordance with Section 1-09.4; 3.
To the extent not paid for by the Contract prices for the completed units of Work, the
Contracting Agency will pay as part of the equitable adjustment those direct costs necessarily and actually incurred by the Contractor in anticipation of performing the
Work that has been deleted or terminated; 4.
The total payment for an item in the case of a deletion or partial termination shall not exceed the Bid price as modified by approved change orders less the estimated cost (including overhead and profit) to complete the Work and less amounts paid to the
Contractor for the item; 5.
The total payment where the Contract is terminated in its entirety shall not exceed the total Contract price as modified by approved change orders less those amounts paid to the Contractor before the effective date of the termination; and 6.
No claim for damages of any kind or for loss of anticipated profits on deleted or terminated Work will be allowed because of the termination or change order.
Contract time shall be adjusted as the parties agree. If the parties cannot agree, the
Engineer will determine the equitable adjustment for Contract time.
Acceptable materials ordered by the Contractor prior to the date the Work was terminated as provided in Section 1-08.10(2) or deleted as provided in Section 1-04.4 by the Engineer, will either be purchased from the Contractor by the Contracting Agency at the actual cost and shall become the property of the Contracting Agency, or the
Contracting Agency will reimburse the Contractor for the actual costs connected with returning these materials to the suppliers. 1-09.6

Force Account
The terms of the Contract or of a change order may call for Work or material to be paid for by force account. If so, then the objective of this Specification is to reimburse the
Contractor for all costs associated with the Work, including costs of labor, small tools, supplies, equipment, specialized services, materials, applicable taxes and overhead and to include a profit commensurate with those costs. The amount to be paid shall be determined as described in this section. 1.
For Labor – Labor reimbursement calculations shall be based on a “Project Labor List” (List) prepared and submitted by the Contractor and by any subcontractors before
Force Account work begins. Once a List is approved by the Engineer, it shall be used to calculate force account labor payment until a new List is submitted and approved.
The Engineer may compare the List to payrolls and other documents and may, at any time, require the Contractor to submit a new List. The Contractor may submit a new
List at any time without such a requirement. Prior payment calculations shall not be adjusted as a result of a new List.
To be approved, the List must be accurate and meet the requirements of this section. It shall include regular time and overtime rates for all employees (or work
Page 1-128
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10

Measurement and Payment 1-09 classifications) expected to participate in force account Work. The rates shall include the basic wage and fringe benefits, the current rates for Federal Insurance
Compensation Act (FICA), Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) and State
Unemployment Tax Act (SUTA), the company’s present rates for Medical Aid and
Industrial Insurance premiums and the planned payments for travel and per diem compensation.
In the event that an acceptable initial List or requested revised List is not received by the time that force account calculations are begun, the Engineer will develop a List unilaterally, utilizing the best data available, that will be used until a Contractor’s List is received and approved. Again, prior calculations, prepared using the Engineer’s List, will not be revised as a result of differences with the Contractor’s List.
In addition to compensation for direct labor costs defined above, the Contracting
Agency will pay Contractor 29 percent of the sum of the costs calculated for labor reimbursement to cover project overhead, general company overhead, profit, bonding, insurance required by Sections 1-07.10 and 1-07.18, Business & Occupation tax, and other costs incurred, except paid sick leave. The Contracting Agency will pay the Contractor an additional 2 percent of the sum of the costs calculated for labor reimbursement to cover the cost of paid sick leave. This amount will include all costs of safety training and health tests, but will not include such costs for unique force account Work that is different from typical Work and which could not have been anticipated at time of Bid. 2.
For Materials – The Contracting Agency will reimburse invoice cost for materials.
For the purpose of this provision, “Materials” shall include those items incorporated into the Work, supplies used during the Work and items consumed. This cost shall include freight and handling charges and applicable taxes. Before Work is started, the
Engineer may require the Contractor to obtain multiple quotations for the materials to be utilized and select the vendor with prices and terms most advantageous to the
Contracting Agency.
The Contracting Agency will provide a list of the types and quantities of materials witnessed by the Contracting Agency as being utilized in force account Work. The list will be furnished promptly after the material is incorporated, on a daily basis unless agreed otherwise. The Contractor may propose corrections to the list and will supply prices for the materials and other costs and return the list to the Contracting Agency.
To support the prices, the Contractor shall attach valid copies of vendor invoices. If invoices are not available for materials from the Contractor’s stocks, the Contractor shall certify actual costs by affidavit. The Engineer will review the prices and
Contractor-proposed corrections and, if reasonable, approve the completed list. Once approved, the prices will be utilized in the calculation of force account reimbursement for materials.
If, in the case of non-invoiced materials supported by Contractor affidavit, the price appears to be unreasonable, the Engineer will determine the cost for all or part of those materials, utilizing the best data available.
The Contracting Agency reserves the right to provide materials. In this case, the
Contractor will receive no payment for additional costs, overhead, or profit arising from the value of the materials themselves. Labor and equipment necessary for handling and placing the Agency furnished material will be compensated as described in this Specification.
In addition to compensation for direct materials cost, the Contracting Agency will pay the Contractor 21 percent of the sum of the costs calculated for materials reimbursement to cover project overhead, general company overhead, profit, bonding, insurance, required by Sections 1-07.10 and 1-07.18, Business & Occupation tax, and all other costs incurred.

Measurement and Payment
For Equipment – The Contracting Agency will reimburse the Contractor for the cost of equipment utilized in the Work. The equipment provided by the Contractor shall be of modern design and in good working condition. For the purpose of this provision, “provided” shall mean that the equipment is owned (either through outright ownership or through a long-term lease) and operated by the Contractor or subcontractor or that the equipment is rented and operated by the Contractor or subcontractor. Equipment that is rented with operator shall not be included here, but shall be considered a service and addressed according to Subsection 4 of this provision.
The amount of payment for Contractor-owned equipment that is utilized shall be determined according to the version of the AGC/WSDOT Equipment Rental
Agreement which is in effect at the time the force account is authorized. The rates listed in the Rental Rate Blue Book (as modified by the current AGC/WSDOT
Equipment Rental Agreement) shall be full compensation for all fuel, oil, lubrication, ordinary repairs, maintenance, and all other costs incidental to furnishing and operating the equipment except labor for operation.
Payment for rented equipment will be made on the basis of a valid invoice, covering the time period of the Work. Before Work is started, the Engineer may require the
Contractor to obtain multiple quotations for the rental of equipment to be utilized and select the vendor with prices and terms most advantageous to the Contracting
Agency. In the event that prior quotations are not obtained and the vendor is not a firm independent from the Contractor or subcontractor, then after-the-fact quotations may be obtained by the Engineer from the open market in the vicinity and the lowest such quotation may be used in place of submitted invoice.
In addition to the payments for Contractor-owned and rented equipment, one or more lump-sum payments may be made for small tools. The amount to be paid shall be determined as outlined in the AGC/WSDOT Equipment Rental Agreement.
The Contracting Agency will add 21 percent to equipment costs to cover project overhead, general company overhead, profit, bonding, insurance, required by Sections 1-07.10 and 1-07.18, Business & Occupation tax, and all other costs incurred. This markup will be over and above those equipment costs and will not be adjusted for equipment overhead amounts included in the Blue Book rates.
Copies of the AGC/WSDOT Equipment Rental Agreement will be maintained on the Contracting Agency’s website at https://wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/ construction/equipment-rental-agreement.pdf.

4.
For Services – Compensation under force account for specialized services shall be made based on an invoice from the providing entity. Before Work is started, the
Engineer may require the Contractor to obtain multiple quotations for the service to be utilized and select the provider with prices and terms most advantageous to the
Contracting Agency. If prior quotations are not obtained, and the service invoice is submitted by a subcontractor, then after-the-fact quotations may be obtained by the
Engineer from the open market in the vicinity and the lowest such quotation may be used in place of the submitted invoice. The following activities will be considered services and shall be compensated based on an invoice from the entity: a.
Biohazard abatement services b.
Camera Inspection services for Sewer/Storm Sewer c.
Commissioning services including manufacturing startup services d.
Contaminated water and soil disposal fees including lab analysis e.
Geotechnical Engineering services

The Contracting Agency will pay the Contractor an additional 21 percent of the sum of the costs included on invoices for services to cover project overhead, general company overhead, profit, bonding, insurance, required by Sections 1-07.10 and 1-07.18, Business & Occupation tax, and all other costs incurred. 5.
For Mobilization – Force account mobilization is defined as the preparatory Work performed by the Contractor including procurement, loading and transportation of tools and equipment, and personal travel time (when such travel time is a contractual obligation of the Contractor or a customary payment for the Contractor to all employees). Mobilization also includes the costs incurred during demobilization.
Pro‑rata adjustments may be made when the mobilization applies to both force account and other Contract Work. The Contracting Agency will pay for mobilization for off-site preparatory Work for force account items provided that notice has been provided sufficiently in advance to allow the Engineer to witness the activity, if desired.
All costs experienced during mobilization activities for labor, equipment, materials or services shall be listed in those sections of the force account summary and paid accordingly. 6.
For Markup on Subcontractor’s Work – When Work is performed on a force account basis by an approved subcontractor, the Contractor will be allowed an a markup, from the table below, applied to the costs computed for Work done by each subcontractor through Subsections 1, 2, and 3, to compensate for all administrative costs, including project overhead, general company overhead, profit, bonding, insurance required by Sections 1-07.10 and 1-07.18, Business & Occupation tax, and all other costs incurred.
Work performed by each subcontractor on each force account and calculated through Subsections 1-3 will be marked up at the following percentages:
On amounts up to and including $50,000
12 percent

On amounts between $50,000 and $200,000
10 percent
On amounts greater than or equal to $200,000
7 percent
The amounts and markup rates shall be calculated separately for each subcontractor on each force account item established.
The payments provided above shall be full payment for all Work done on a force account basis. The calculated payment shall cover all expenses of every nature, kind, and description, including those listed above and all others incurred on the Work being paid through force account. Nothing in this provision shall preclude the Contractor from seeking an extension of time or time-related damages to unchanged Work arising as a result of the force account Work. The amount and costs of all Work to be paid by force account shall be computed by the Engineer, and the result shall be final as provided in
Section 1-05.1.

Measurement and Payment
An item that has been Bid at a unit price or lump sum in the Proposal will not be paid as force account unless: 1.
A change as defined in Section 1-04.4 has occurred and the provisions require a payment adjustment. 2.
A Contract item paid by force account requires Work that is normally included in a lump sum Contract item. In such a case, the Work normally included in a lump sum
Contract item will be paid by force account under the force account Contract item.
Items that are included in the Proposal as Force Account or that are added by change order as Force Account may, by agreement of the parties at any time, be converted to agreed unit prices or lump sums applicable to the remaining Work. 1-09.7
Mobilization
Mobilization consists of preconstruction expenses and the costs of preparatory Work and operations performed by the Contractor typically occurring before 10 percent of the total original Contract amount is earned from other Contract items. Items which are not to be included in the item of Mobilization include but are not limited to: 1.
Portions of the Work covered by the specific Contract item or incidental Work which is to be included in a Contract item or items.

2.
Profit, interest on borrowed money, overhead, or management costs. 3.
Costs incurred for mobilizing equipment to perform force account Work.
Based on the lump sum Contract price for “Mobilization”, partial payments will be made as follows: 1.
When 5 percent of the total original Contract amount is earned from other Contract items, excluding amounts paid for materials on hand, 50 percent of the amount Bid for mobilization, or 5 percent of the total original Contract amount, whichever is the least, will be paid.
When 10 percent of the total original Contract amount is earned from other Contract items, excluding amounts paid for materials on hand, 100 percent of the amount Bid for mobilization, or 10 percent of the total original Contract amount, whichever is the least, will be paid. 3.
When the Substantial Completion Date has been established for the project, payment for mobilization in excess of 10 percent of the total original Contract amount, if any, will be paid.
Nothing herein shall be construed to limit or preclude partial payments otherwise provided by the Contract. 1-09.8
Payment for Material on Hand
The Contracting Agency may reimburse the Contractor for materials purchased before their use in the Work if they: 1.

Meet the requirements of the Plans and Specifications; 2.
Are delivered to or stockpiled near the project or other Engineer-approved storage sites; and 3.
Consist of: sand, gravel, surfacing materials, aggregates, reinforcing steel, bronze plates, structural steel, machinery, piling, timber and lumber (not including forms or falsework), large signs unique to the project, prestressed concrete beams or girders, or other materials the Engineer may approve.
Page 1-132
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Measurement and Payment 1-09
The Contracting Agency may reimburse the Contractor for traffic signal controllers as follows: 1.
Fifty percent when the traffic signal controller and all components are received and assembled into a complete unit at the State Materials Laboratory. 2.
One hundred percent when the traffic signal controller is approved for shipment to the project by the State Materials Laboratory.
The Contractor shall provide sufficient written evidence of production costs to enable the Engineer to compute the cost of Contractor-produced materials (such as sand, gravel, surfacing material, or aggregates). For other materials, the Contractor shall provide invoices from material suppliers. Each invoice shall be detailed sufficiently to enable the
Engineer to determine the actual costs. Payment for materials on hand shall not exceed the total Contract cost for the Contract item.
If payment for material on hand is based upon an unpaid invoice, the Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a paid invoice within 60 calendar days after the Contracting
Agency’s payment. If the paid invoice is not furnished within this time, the payment amount will be deducted from the next progress estimate and withheld until the paid invoice is supplied.
The Contracting Agency will not pay for material on hand when the invoice cost is less than $2,000. As materials are used in the Work, credits equaling the partial payments for them will be taken on future estimates. Partial payment for materials on hand shall not constitute acceptance. Materials will be rejected if found to be defective, even if partial payment for it has been made. 1-09.9

Payments
The basis of payment will be the actual quantities of Work performed according to the
Contract and as specified for payment.
The Contractor shall submit a breakdown of the cost of lump sum Items to enable the Engineer to determine the Work performed on a monthly basis. Lump sum item breakdowns shall be submitted prior to the first progress payment that includes payment for the Bid Item in question. A breakdown is not required for lump sum Items that include a basis for incremental payments as part of the respective Specification. Absent a lump sum breakdown, the Engineer will make a determination based on information available.
The Engineer’s determination of the cost of Work shall be final.
Payments will be made for Work and labor performed and materials furnished under the
Contract according to the price in the Proposal unless otherwise provided.
Partial payments will be made once each month, based upon partial estimates prepared by the Engineer. The determination of payments under the Contract will be final in accordance with Section 1-05.1. Unless otherwise provided, payments will be made from the Motor Vehicle Fund.
Failure to perform obligations of the Contract may be decreed by the Contracting Agency to be adequate reason for withholding payments until compliance is achieved.
The Contractor shall sign electronically using the software provided by the Contracting
Agency and return the Final Contract Voucher Certification (FCVC) as indicated in this section. Within 21 days of execution, the Contractor shall submit a Type 1 Working
Drawing designating who will sign the FCVC, including their full name, email address, and text-message capable phone number. The designee shall be an authorized signer in accordance with Section 1-02.1.
Upon completion of all Work and after final inspection (Section 1-05.11), the amount due the Contractor under the Contract will be paid based upon the final estimate made by the Engineer and presentation of a Final Contract Voucher Certification to be signed by the Contractor. The Contractor's signature on such voucher shall be deemed a

Measurement and Payment release of all claims of the Contractor unless a Certified Claim is filed in accordance with the requirements of Section 1-09.11 and is expressly excepted from the Contractor’s certification on the Final Contract Voucher Certification. The date the Secretary signs the Final Contract Voucher Certification constitutes the final acceptance date (Section 1-05.12).
If the Contractor fails, refuses, or is unable to sign and return the Final Contract Voucher
Certification or other documentation required for completion and final acceptance of the Contract, the Contracting Agency reserves the right to establish a Completion Date (for the purpose of meeting the requirements of RCW 60.28) and unilaterally accept the Contract. Unilateral final acceptance will occur only after the Contractor has been provided the opportunity, by written request from the Engineer, to voluntarily submit such documents. If voluntary compliance is not achieved, formal notification of the impending establishment of a Completion Date and unilateral final acceptance will be provided by email with delivery confirmation from the Secretary to the Contractor, which will provide 30-calendar days for the Contractor to submit the necessary documents. The 30-calendar day period will begin on the date the email with delivery confirmation is received by the Contractor. The date the Secretary unilaterally signs the Final Contract Voucher
Certification shall constitute the Completion Date and the final acceptance date (Section 1-05.12). The reservation by the Contracting Agency to unilaterally accept the Contract will apply to Contracts that are Physically Completed in accordance with Section 1-08.5, or for Contracts that are terminated in accordance with Section 1-08.10. Unilateral final acceptance of the Contract by the Contracting Agency does not in any way relieve the
Contractor of their responsibility to comply with all Federal, State, tribal, or local laws, ordinances, and regulations that affect the Work under the Contract.
Payment to the Contractor of partial estimates, final estimates, and retained percentages shall be subject to controlling laws. 1-09.9(1)
Retainage
Pursuant to RCW 60.28, a sum of 5 percent of the monies earned by the Contractor will be retained from progress estimates. Such retainage shall be used as a trust fund for the protection and payment (1) to the Contracting Agency with respect to taxes imposed pursuant to Title 82 RCW, and (2) the claims of any person arising under the Contract.
Monies retained under the provisions of RCW 60.28 shall, at the option of the
Contractor, be: 1.

Retained in a fund by the Contracting Agency; or 2.
Deposited by the Contracting Agency in an escrow (interest-bearing) account in a bank, mutual saving bank, or savings and loan association (interest on monies so retained shall be paid to the Contractor). Deposits are to be in the name of the Contracting Agency and are not to be allowed to be withdrawn without the
Contracting Agency’s written authorization. The Contracting Agency will issue a check representing the sum of the monies reserved, payable to the bank or trust company.
Such check shall be converted into bonds and securities chosen by the Contractor as the interest accrues.
At the time the Contract is executed the Contractor shall designate the option desired.
The Contractor in choosing option (2) agrees to assume full responsibility to pay all costs that may accrue from escrow services, brokerage charges or both, and further agrees to assume all risks in connection with the investment of the retained percentages in securities. The Contracting Agency may also, at its option, accept a bond in lieu of retainage.

Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (in accordance with Section 1-07.10) shows the Contractor is current with payments of industrial insurance and medical aid premiums. 5.
All claims, as provided by law, filed against the retainage have been resolved. In the event claims are filed and provided the conditions of 1, 2, 3, and 4 are met, the
Contractor will be paid such retained percentage less an amount sufficient to pay any such claims together with a sum determined by the Contracting Agency sufficient to pay the cost of foreclosing on claims and to cover attorney’s fees. 1-09.10
Payment for Surplus Processed Materials

After the Contract is completed, the Contractor will be reimbursed actual production costs for surplus processed material produced by the Contractor from Contracting Agencyprovided sources if its value is $3,000 or more (determined by actual production costs).
The quantity of surplus material eligible for reimbursement of production costs shall be the quantity produced (but an amount not greater than 110 percent of Plan quantity or as specified by the Engineer), less the actual quantity used. For Hot Mix Asphalt, the Plan quantity and quantity used will be adjusted for the quantity of Asphalt and quantity of
RAP or other materials incorporated into the mix. The Contracting Agency will determine the actual amount of surplus material for reimbursement.
The Contractor shall not dispose of surplus material without permission of the
Engineer. Surplus material shall remain the property of the Contracting Agency without reimbursement to the Contractor if it is not eligible for reimbursement. 1-09.11

Traffic Control Labor
The Contractor shall furnish all personnel for flagging, for the execution of all procedures related to temporary traffic control and for the setup, maintenance and removal of all temporary traffic control devices and construction signs necessary to control vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic during construction operations.
Vests and other high-visibility apparel shall be in conformance with Section 1-07.8. 1-10.3(1)A
Flaggers
Flaggers shall be posted where shown on traffic control plans or where directed by the Engineer. All flaggers shall possess a current flagging card issued by the State of
Washington, Oregon, Montana, or Idaho. The flagging card shall be immediately available and shown to the Contracting Agency upon request.
Flagging stations shall be shown on traffic control plans at locations where construction operations require stopping or diverting public traffic. Flagging stations shall be staffed only when flagging is required. This staffing may be continuous or intermittent, depending on the nature of the construction activity. Whenever a flagger is not required to stop or divert traffic, the flagger shall move away from the flagging station to a safer location.
During hours of darkness, flagging stations shall be illuminated in a manner that flaggers can easily be visible and discernable as a flagger from 1000 feet by oncoming motorists.
Flagger station illumination shall meet the requirements of the MUTCD and these
Specifications.
The Contractor shall provide portable lighting equipment capable of sufficiently illuminating a flagging station without creating glare for oncoming motorists or for the flagger while meeting the mobility requirements of the operation. The equipment shall be located on the same side of the roadway as the flagger, positioned 5 to 10 feet from the edge of the traveled lane and be aimed at the flagging station.
Page 1-146

2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Temporary Traffic Control 1-10
Flaggers shall be equipped with portable two-way radios, with a range suitable for the project. The radios shall be capable of having direct contact with project management (foremen, superintendents, etc.).
The Contractor shall furnish Stop/Slow paddles conforming to the requirements of
Section 9-35.1 for all flagging operations. 1-10.3(1)B
Other Traffic Control Labor
In addition to flagging duties, the Contractor shall provide personnel for all other traffic control procedures required by the construction operations and for the labor to install and remove any traffic control devices shown on traffic control plans. The Work shall consist of operating a pilot vehicle during one-way piloted traffic control, operating a traffic control vehicle or a chase vehicle during a rolling slowdown operation, operating any of the moving traffic control equipment, or adjusting signing during a mobile operation as described in Section 1-10.3(2)D, operating a vehicle or placing/removing traffic control devices required by a traffic control plan or performing preliminary work to prepare for placing and removing these devices, and relocation of any traffic control devices as
Work progresses. 1-10.3(2)
Traffic Control Procedures 1-10.3(2)A
Alternating One-Lane, Two-Way Traffic Control
As shown on a traffic control plan or directed by the Engineer, on two-lane roadways, traffic may be placed in a single open lane under the control of flaggers, Automated
Flagger Assistance Devices (AFADs), or temporary traffic signals to alternate the direction of traffic.
Side roads will be controlled by flaggers, AFADs, signals or closed. If flaggers and a pilot car are used, driveways and private roads may be controlled by signing informing drivers to wait for a pilot car. Flagger, AFAD or signal stations shall be illuminated at night.
If flaggers are used at an intersection, a flagger is required for each leg of the intersection and each direction of traffic should be reduced to one open lane approaching a flagger.
Contractor vehicles shall not use the open traffic lane except while following the same rules and routes required of the public traffic.
Alternating one-lane, two-way traffic controls shall remain in place until work is completed or the roadway can be opened in a safe operating condition. 1-10.3(2)B

Rolling Slowdown
Rolling slowdown traffic control operations use a rolling blockade of vehicles traveling at slow speeds to create a gap in traffic to enable completion of work activities requiring access across or over all the directional lanes of a roadway. It is critical no traffic gets between the rolling blockade and work area. Rolling slowdown operations are not to be used for routine Work that can be addressed by standard lane or shoulder closure traffic control. When a short-term roadway closure is needed for an infrequent, nonrepetitive
Work operation such as a sign bridge removal or utility wire crossing, the Contractor may implement a rolling slowdown on a multilane roadway, as part of an accepted traffic control plan.
The Contractor shall submit Type 2 Working Drawings consisting of a traffic control plan detailing the expected delay time, interchange ramp control, and rolling slowdown distance. A portable changeable message sign shall be placed ahead of the starting point of the traffic control to warn traffic of the slowdown. The sign shall be placed far enough ahead of the Work to avoid any expected backup of vehicles.
A rolling slowdown blockade requires one traffic control vehicle with flashing amber lights for each lane to be slowed, plus a traffic control vehicle to serve as a chase vehicle following traffic ahead of the blockade. These traffic control vehicles shall enter the
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10
Page 1-147 1-10
Temporary Traffic Control roadway and form a moving blockade to reduce traffic speeds and create a clear area ahead of the blockade. When the chase vehicle reaches the work area, work may begin.
All on-ramps and entrances to the Roadway between the moving blockade and Work operation shall be temporarily closed with traffic control vehicles and Freeway-to-Freeway on-ramps to be closed with standard traffic control devices. A portable changeable message sign shall be used far enough ahead of the operation to warn of slowed traffic.
Communications between the Work operation and the moving blockade vehicles shall establish and adjust the speed of the blockade and closure times needed based on the work progress.
The Contractor shall submit Type 2 Working Drawings consisting of a traffic control plan detailing the calculated location where the traffic control vehicles shall begin the slowdown and the speed at which the moving blockade will travel based on the estimated time needed for closure. The duration of the rolling slowdown operation shall not exceed
15 minutes. The plan will also include the locations of portable changeable message signs, blockade vehicles, chase vehicle and ramp control vehicles needed for the operation.
The location where the traffic control vehicles shall begin the slowdown and the speed at which the moving blockade will be allowed to travel will be calculated to accommodate the estimated time needed for closure. The chase control vehicle shall follow the slowest vehicle ahead of the blockade. When the chase vehicle passes, the Contractor may begin the Work operation. In the event that the Work operation is not completed when the moving blockade reaches the site, all Work except that necessary to clear the
Roadway shall cease immediately and the Roadway shall be cleared and reopened as soon as possible. 1-10.3(2)C

Lane Closure Setup/Takedown
Where allowed by the Contract and shown on the traffic control plans or directed by the
Engineer, the Contractor shall set up traffic control measures to close one or more lanes of a Freeway or multi-lane roadway 45 mph or higher. When this is to occur, the following sequence shall be followed: 1.
If shown on the traffic control plan place portable changeable message sign(s). 2.
Advance warning signs are set up on the Shoulder of the Roadway opposite the lane to be closed. 3.
Advance warning signs are set up on the same Shoulder as the lane to be closed. 4.
A transportable attenuator, with sequential arrow sign in arrow mode, is moved into the lane being closed to protect workers. Only the operator is allowed in the vehicle. 5.
Channelization devices and sequential arrow signs are placed to mark the closure taper as shown on the traffic control plan. 6.
The transportable attenuator is repositioned within the closed lane, now with sequential arrow sign in caution mode, in advance of workers installing the remaining devices.
If additional lanes are to be closed, this shall be done in sequence with previous lane closures using the same sequence of activities. A transportable attenuator with sequential arrow sign is required during the process of closing each additional lane and is to be replaced with a sequential arrow sign without attenuator after the lane is closed. Each closed lane shall be marked with a separate sequential arrow sign at all times.
Channelization devices shall not be moved by traffic control personnel across an open lane of traffic. If an existing setup or staging of traffic control devices require crossing an open lane of traffic, the traffic control devices shall be taken down completely and then set up in the new configuration.
Traffic control for lane closures shall be removed in the reverse order of its installation.

The blasting plan shall contain the full details of the drilling and blasting patterns and controls the Contractor proposes to use for both the controlled and production blasting. The blasting plan submittal is required for all blasting operations and shall contain at least the following information: a.
Station limits of proposed shot. b.
Plan and section views of proposed drill pattern including free face, burden, blast hole spacing, blast hole diameter, blast hole angles, lift height, and subdrill depth. c.
Loading diagram showing type and amount of explosives, primers, initiators, and location and depth of stemming. d.
Initiation sequence of blast holes including delay times and delay system. e.
Manufacturer’s data sheets for all explosives, primers, and initiators to be employed.

Review of the blasting plan by the Engineer shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for the accuracy and adequacy of the plan when implemented in the field. 4.
Controlled Blasting – When blasting to establish slopes 0.5:1 or steeper, and more than 10 feet high, the Contractor shall use controlled blasting. The Engineer may require the Contractor to use controlled blasting to form the faces of other slopes, even if the slopes could be formed by nonblasting methods.
Controlled blasting refers to the controlled use of explosives and blasting accessories in carefully spaced and aligned drill holes to provide a free surface or shear plane in the rock along the specified backslope. Controlled blasting techniques covered by this
Specification include presplitting and cushion blasting.
In addition to the blasting plan submittal, when using controlled blasting the
Contractor shall: a.
Prior to commencing full-scale blasting operations, the Contractor shall demonstrate the adequacy of the proposed blast plan by drilling, blasting, and excavating short test sections, up to 100 feet in length, to determine which combination of method, hole spacing, and charge works best. When field conditions warrant, the Contractor may be ordered to use test section lengths less than 100 feet.
Unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer, the Contractor shall begin the tests with the controlled blast holes spaced 30 inches apart, then adjust if needed, until the Engineer accepts the spacing to be used for full-scale blasting operations. b.
The Contractor shall completely remove all overburden, soil, and loose or decomposed rock along the top of the excavation for a distance of at least
30 feet beyond the end of the production hole drilling limits, or to the end of the cut, before drilling the presplitting holes.

c.
The controlled blast holes shall be not less than 2½ inches nor more than 3 inches in diameter. d.
The Contractor shall control drilling operations by the use of the proper equipment and technique to ensure that no hole deviates from the plane of the planned slope by more than 9 inches either parallel or normal to the slope. Drill holes exceeding these limits will not be paid for unless satisfactory slopes are being obtained.
Page 2-8
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Roadway Excavation and Embankment 2-03 e.
Controlled blast holes shall extend a minimum of 30 feet beyond the limits of the production holes to be detonated, or to the end of the cut as applicable. f.
The length of controlled blast holes for any individual lift shall not exceed 20 feet unless the Contractor can demonstrate to the Engineer the ability to stay within the above tolerances and produce a uniform slope. If greater than 5 percent of the presplit holes are misaligned in any one lift, the Contractor shall reduce the height of the lifts until the 9-inch alignment tolerance is met. Upon satisfactory demonstration, the length of holes may be increased to a maximum of 60 feet with written acceptance of the Engineer. g.
When the cut height requires more than one lift, a maximum 2-foot offset between lifts will be permitted to allow for drill equipment clearances. The
Contractor shall begin the controlled blast hole drilling at a point that will allow for necessary offsets and shall adjust, at the start of lower lifts, to compensate for any drift that may have occurred in the upper lifts.

h.
Before placing charges, the Contractor shall determine that the hole is free of obstructions for its entire depth. All necessary precautions shall be exercised so that the placing of the charges will not cause caving of material from the walls of the holes. i.
The maximum diameter of explosives used in presplit holes shall not be greater than ½ the diameter of the presplit hole. j.
Only standard explosives manufactured especially for controlled blasting shall be used in controlled blast holes, unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer. Bulk ammonium nitrate and fuel oil (ANFO) shall not be loaded in the presplit holes. k.
If fractional portions of standard explosive cartridges are used, they shall be firmly affixed to the detonating cord in a manner that the cartridges will not slip down the detonating cord nor bridge across the hole. Spacing of fractional cartridges along the length of the detonating cord shall not exceed 30 inches center to center and shall be adjusted to give the desired results. l.
Continuous column cartridge type of explosives used with detonating cord shall be assembled and affixed to the detonating cord in accordance with the explosive manufacturer’s instructions, a copy of which shall be submitted as a Type
1 Working Drawing. m. The bottom charge of a presplit hole may be larger than the line charges but shall not be large enough to cause overbreak. The top charge of the presplitting hole shall be placed far enough below the collar, and reduced sufficiently, to avoid overbreaking and heaving. n.
The upper portion of all presplit holes, from the top most charge to the hole collar, shall be stemmed. Stemming materials shall be sand or other dry angular material, all of which passes a ⅜-inch sieve. o.
If presplitting is specified, the detonation of these holes shall be fired first. p.
If cushion blasting is specified, the detonation of these holes shall be fired last on an instantaneous delay after all other blasting has taken place in the excavation.

q.
Production blast holes shall not be drilled closer than 6 feet to the controlled blast line, unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer. The bottom of the production holes shall not be lower than the bottom of the controlled blast holes.
Production holes shall not exceed 6 inches in diameter, unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer. Detonation of production holes shall be on a delay sequence toward a free face. r.
The use of horizontal blast holes for either production or controlled blasting is prohibited.

Excavation Below Subgrade
Rock Excavation – When the Contractor finds rock or other hard material at the Subgrade elevation, it shall be excavated the full width of the Roadbed to at least 6 inches below
Subgrade, then backfilled with rock fragments, gravel, or other free-draining material not more than 4 inches in diameter.
If the Contractor uses a Subgrade trimmer, the backfill shall be rock, gravel, or other free-draining material not more than 2 inches in diameter. The Contractor shall save the finer free-draining material from excavations or borrow pits to use in backfilling the top
6 inches of the Subgrade. All such material shall be approved by the Engineer.
Sub excavation – At any time, the Engineer may order excavation below Subgrade to remove soft and uncompactible material. The replacement material shall be free-draining and granular, or other materials as determined by the Engineer.
Draining Rock Pockets – If blasting below Subgrade leaves a rock pocket that will not drain, the Contractor shall dig a trench from the pocket bottom to the roadside ditch, then backfill both the pocket and the trench with rock fragments, gravel, or other material approved by the Engineer, at no expense to the Contracting Agency.
Compaction – If the density of the natural earth under any area of the Roadway is less than that required in Section 2-03.3(14)C, Method B, the Engineer may order the
Contractor to perform any or all of the following: 1.

Scarify the earth to a depth of 6 inches. 2.

Sluicing
The Contractor shall not excavate by sluicing unless the Special Provisions specifically call for it. 2-03.3(5)
Slope Treatment
The tops of all Roadway cut slopes, except solid rock cuts, shall be rounded in accordance with the Standard Plans. Unless otherwise noted in the Plans or Special Provisions, Class A slope treatment shall be utilized.
If a layer of earth covers a rock cut, the slope shall be rounded above the rock as if it were an earth slope.
When the Contractor removes stumps or any embedded material from the rounded area, the void shall be backfilled and stabilized to prevent erosion.
All Work required to complete slope treatment, including excavation, haul, and slope rounding, shall be included in the unit Bid price for Roadway excavation. 2-03.3(6)

Deposit of Rock for the Contracting Agency’s Use
At the Engineer’s direction, the Contractor shall deposit excavated rock at the roadside or elsewhere. If this requires the Contractor to use material that would otherwise have gone into an embankment, the Contracting Agency will pay for the extra cubic yards of excavation needed to complete the embankment. Any such rock deposit shall be
Contracting Agency property. The Contractor shall be responsible for safekeeping the deposit until the Contracting Agency has removed it or until the Contract is completed.

If excavation yields more material than needed for nearby embankments, the Contractor shall dispose of the excess in keeping with the Special Provisions or as the Engineer directs. 2-03.3(7)B
Haul

When the Contract includes a payment item for haul, the Contracting Agency will pay as follows for hauling excess excavation to a disposal site: 1.
If the Contracting Agency provides a site, but the Contractor chooses to haul elsewhere, the Contracting Agency will pay for the actual distance up to but not exceeding the distance that would have been necessary using the Contracting Agency site. 2.
If the Contracting Agency does not provide a site, the Contracting Agency will pay for the actual distance up to but not exceeding the distance necessary to haul to a site
1 mile from the project limits. 2-03.3(7)C
Contractor-Provided Disposal Site
If the Contracting Agency provides no waste site, but requires disposal of excess excavation or other materials, the Contractor shall arrange for disposal at no expense to the Contracting Agency, except as provided in Section 2-03.3(7)B, item 2.
The Contractor shall acquire all permits and approvals required for the use of the disposal sites before any waste is hauled off the project. The Contractor shall submit a Type
1 Working Drawing consisting of copies of the permits and approvals for any disposal sites to be used. The cost of any such permits and approvals shall be included in the Bid prices for other Work.
Disposal of excess material within a wetland area will not be allowed without a Section
404 permit issued by the U.S. Corps of Engineers and approval by the local agency with jurisdiction over the wetlands.
The Contractor shall protect, indemnify, and save harmless the Contracting Agency from any damages that may arise from the Contractor’s activities in making these arrangements. Such indemnity shall be in accordance with RCW 4.24.115 as amended by CH. 305, Laws of 1986. Any action required to satisfy any permit and/or any approval requirements in a Contractor-provided disposal site shall be performed by the Contractor at no additional expense to the Contracting Agency.

Selected Material
When the Contract or the Engineer calls for it, selected material shall be used for finishing the top part of the Subgrade, for structural or other backfill, or for other purposes. Unless the Special Provisions specify otherwise, the Engineer may identify as “selected” any material excavated within the right-of-way, including the excavation of local borrow.
Direct Hauling – If it is practical, the Contractor shall haul selected material immediately from excavation to its final place on the Roadbed. The Contracting Agency will pay for such Work at the unit Contract prices for excavating, hauling, watering, and compacting.
Delayed Excavation – If it is impractical to haul selected material to its final place at once, the Contractor shall delay excavation until the placement will be workable. The
Contracting Agency will not pay extra for delayed excavation.
Stockpiling – The Engineer may allow the Contractor to stockpile selected materials if delaying the excavation will hamper grading or force impractical movements of equipment. In this case, the Engineer will direct where and when the Contractor shall excavate, stockpile, haul, and place the selected materials.
Sections 2-03.4 and 2-03.5 describe how the Contracting Agency will measure and pay for excavating and hauling these stockpiled selected materials. The neat line volume of material removed will provide the basis for measuring material taken from the stockpile. 2-03.3(11)

Slides
If a slide occurs on a finished slope before final acceptance of the Work, the Contractor shall remove or replace the slide material. The Contractor shall also refinish the slope to the condition and with the materials required by the Engineer.
The Contracting Agency will pay for the excavation at the unit Contract price and for resloping on a force account basis. The Engineer may authorize payment for the excavation by agreed price or force account if: 1.
The slide material cannot be measured accurately, or 2.
Excavation of slide material requires equipment not available on the project.
If the Contractor undercuts or destroys a slope, or has failed to implement erosion control devices as shown in the Contract or in the TESC plan, it shall be resloped to the original alignment or to a new one established by the Engineer at no expense to the
Contracting Agency. 2-03.3(12)
Overbreak
Overbreak includes that part of any material excavated, displaced, or loosened outside the staked or reestablished slope or grade. Such material is considered overbreak whether its movement resulted from blasting, from the character of the material itself, or from any other cause. Overbreak, however, does not include material from slides as described in
Section 2-03.3(11).
If the Engineer does not approve use of the overbreak, the Contractor shall remove, haul, and dispose of it at no expense to the Contracting Agency. In this case, the Contractor shall follow the procedure for handling surplus described in Section 2-03.3(7).
If the Engineer approves, the Contractor may use overbreak: 1.

To complete an embankment when the excavated material unexpectedly falls short of the amount required. The Contracting Agency will pay the Roadway excavation
Contract price for the volume of material the overbreak replaces, and will pay the
Contract price for haul. However, no payment will be made if overbreak is used when other material is available within the neat lines of the Roadway prism. 2.
To replace borrow excavation originally planned for an embankment. The Contracting
Agency will pay for overbreak used this way at the unit Contract price for Roadway or

Borrow
Borrow is the excavation of material outside the Roadway prism or outside the limits of any other excavation area required by the Contract. Before any borrow site can be used, it must be measured and approved by the Engineer. Any material excavated from a borrow site before the site is measured will not be paid for. The widening of Roadway cuts and ditches will be considered Roadway excavation, not borrow.
If the Contract documents designate borrow sources, the Contractor may utilize those sources or may obtain borrow from other sites. If borrow is obtained from a Contractorprovided site, there will be no additional cost to the Contracting Agency beyond the Contract unit price for the excavated borrow material. There will be no payment for aeration of the borrowed material from a Contractor-provided site, even if the
Contract contains an item for aeration and even if the Contract documents designate borrow sources.
If neither the Plans nor the Special Provisions name a source for borrow, the Contractor shall provide a source at no expense to the Contracting Agency.
The Contractor shall reclaim all borrow sites, Contracting Agency-owned, Contracting
Agency-supplied, or obtained by the Contractor, in keeping with Section 3-03. 2-03.3(14)

Embankment Construction
The Contracting Agency classifies embankment construction as: 1.
Rock Embankment – In which the material in all or any part of an embankment contains 25 percent or more, by volume, gravel or stone 4 inches or more in diameter.
Section 2-03.3(14)A. 2.
Earth Embankment – Made of any material other than that used in rock embankment.
Section 2-03.3(14)B.
Unstable Base – If the Engineer believes the natural earth base will impair an embankment or make it unstable, the Contractor shall stabilize or remove and dispose of the base material in keeping with this section or Section 2-03.3(14)E.
Hillside Terraces – The Contractor shall terrace the original ground or embankment when the slope of the surface is 2H:1V or steeper unless otherwise directed by the Engineer.
The face of each terrace shall be a minimum of 1 foot and a maximum of 5 feet in height and shall be vertical or near vertical as required to remain stable during material placement and compaction. The bench of the terrace shall slope outward to drain and shall not be inclined steeper than 0.05 foot per foot. Terraces damaged during work shall be reestablished. The Engineer may order the Contractor to place gravel backfill, pipe drains or both to drain any seepage.
All costs for building terraces shall be included in the prices for other Work.
Soft Base – On wet or swampy ground, the Contractor shall haul and spread embankment material by methods that will disturb the base as little as possible. If the Engineer approves, the Contractor may place the lower part of the fill by dumping and spreading successive loads to form a uniform layer just thick enough to support equipment used to place and compact upper layers.
Normally the Contractor shall not increase the planned depth of the embankment over a soft base merely to permit the use of heavier equipment. But if the Contractor proves that the planned depth will not support light hauling vehicles, the Engineer may approve a deeper fill. The Contractor shall not claim extra pay if these restrictions require the use of lighter equipment or different construction methods than originally planned for use on the soft base.

Contractor may dispose of rocks larger than the average size instead of placing them in the embankment.
Compacting – The Contractor shall use a 50-ton compression roller or a vibratory roller having a dynamic force of at least 40,000 pounds impact per vibration and at least 1,000 vibrations per minute. In either case, the roller shall make one full coverage for each
6 inches, or any fraction of 6 inches, of lift depth.
When lift depth is 18 inches or less, the Contractor may use a 10-ton compression roller or a vibratory roller having a dynamic force of at least 30,000-pounds impact per vibration and at least 1,000 vibrations per minute. In either case, the roller shall make four full coverages for each 6 inches, or any fraction of 6 inches, of lift depth.
Rollers must exert reasonably even pressure over the area covered. The Contractor shall limit the speed of compression rollers to no more than 4 mph, and the speed of vibratory rollers to no more than 1½ mph.
If possible, the Contractor shall compact the material even further by routing empty and loaded hauling equipment evenly over the entire width of the embankment.
When the Engineer believes rolling to be physically impractical, rolling may be omitted on part or all of a layer.
Should excessive moisture threaten the stability of the embankment the Engineer may order the Contractor to alter the operation. This may include alternating layers of wet and dry materials, drying materials before placing, or halting Work in the problem areas. In this case the Contracting Agency will not increase payment, but will pay the unit Contract prices for the pay items that apply.
Top Layer – The Contractor shall build each rock embankment up to 6 inches below
Subgrade. The top 6-inch layer of embankment shall be of rock, gravel, or other freedraining material that does not exceed 4 inches in diameter. When the Plans require use of a Subgrade trimmer, these materials in the top layer may not exceed 2 inches in diameter.
When practical, and as approved by the Engineer, the Contractor shall save the finer freedraining material from excavations or borrow pits for use in topping rock fills. If selected materials suitable for topping are available, the Contracting Agency will pay for them as described in Section 2-03.3(10). If such materials are not available on site, the Contracting
Agency will pay for imported materials by including them in the unit Contract price for gravel borrow or borrow excavation, each including haul. If the Proposal does not include these items, the Contracting Agency will pay as provided in Section 1-04.4. 2-03.3(14)B

Earth Embankment Construction
The Contractor shall place earth embankments in horizontal layers of uniform thickness.
These layers shall run full width from the top to the bottom of the embankment. Slopes shall be compacted to the required density as part of embankment compaction.
During grading operations, the Contractor shall shape the surfaces of embankments and excavations to uniform cross-sections and eliminate all ruts and low places that could hold water. The Contractor shall raise the center of an embankment above the sides. When the surface of an embankment intersects a side hill, the surface shall be sloped away at a rate not to exceed 20:1.

Compacting Earth Embankments
This section describes three methods (A, B, and C) for building earth embankments. The
Contractor shall use Method B unless the Special Provisions require another method.
Method A – Each embankment shall be made of layers no more than 2 feet thick. The
Contractor shall compact each layer by routing loaded haul equipment over its entire width. If the Engineer approves, the Contractor may use end dumping to begin placing a side hill fill too narrow for hauling equipment. When the fill is wide enough, the remaining layers shall be compacted by the loaded hauling equipment.
Method B – The top 2 feet of each embankment shall be compacted to 95 percent of the maximum density as determined by the compaction control tests described in Section 2-03.3(14)D. All material below the 2-foot level shall be compacted to 90 percent of the same maximum density.
In the top 2 feet, horizontal layers shall not exceed 4 inches in depth before compaction.
No layer below the top 2 feet shall exceed 8 inches in depth before compaction.
The Contractor shall use compacting equipment approved by the Engineer.
Method C – Each layer of the entire embankment shall be compacted to 95 percent of the maximum density as determined by the compaction control tests described in Section 2-03.3(14)D.
Under Methods B or C, the Engineer may permit the Contractor to increase layer thickness up to 18 inches before compaction, provided: 1. 2. 3.

The layer is more than 2 feet below the top of the embankment,
An approved vibratory roller is used, and
The required density is obtained throughout the full depth and width of each layer.
Whatever the method used, any embankment inaccessible to large compacting equipment shall be compacted with small mechanical or vibratory compactors.
Moisture Content – The Contractor shall adjust moisture content during compaction to produce a firm, stable and unyielding embankment. The embankment shall be free from pumping and rutting due to excessive moisture and is the Contractor’s responsibility to manage and adjust as necessary.
The Contracting Agency will consider all costs for drying embankment material to be incidental to other Work, including excessive moisture due to inclement weather. If, however, the Contract includes an aeration item, the Contracting Agency will pay for such
Work as specified in Sections 2-03.4 and 2-03.5.
The Contractor shall repair, at no expense to the Contracting Agency, any partial or complete embankment that loses stability because of continued hauling across it. Evidence of lost stability includes pumping, rutting or lateral displacement of embankment. The Contractor shall also alter hauling equipment or procedures to prevent further damage. 2-03.3(14)D
Compaction and Moisture Control Tests
Maximum density and optimum moisture content shall be determined by one of the following methods: 1.

Materials with less than 30 percent by weight retained on the No. 4 sieve shall be determined using FOP for AASHTO T 99 Method A.

WSDOT SOP 615. 2-03.3(14)E

Unsuitable Foundation Excavation
When the Contract or the Engineer requires it, the Contractor shall excavate unstable natural ground before building any embankment over it. This unstable material may include peat, muck, swampland, buried logs and stumps, or other material not fit for an embankment base. The Contractor shall excavate such material to the boundaries set by the Engineer.
The Work will not be considered unsuitable foundation excavation if the materials: 1. 2. 3.
Came from the Roadway cut, ditch, or channel-change prisms.
Resulted from Structure excavation Class A or B.
Are covered in Section 2-03.3(3).
If the Contract provides no Bid item for unsuitable foundation excavation, the Contracting
Agency will pay as provided in Section 1-04.4. 2-03.3(14)F
Vacant 2-03.3(14)G
Backfilling

When water fills an area after the removal of soft or unstable materials, the Contractor shall, if possible, drain the site so that any backfill may be compacted. If drainage is not possible, the Contractor shall use granular material for backfilling in water, including areas where blasting has displaced the soft material. The Special Provisions may require other backfilling methods.
The costs of pumping or digging temporary drainage ditches shall be incidental to and included in other items of Work that apply. 2-03.3(14)H
Prefabricated Vertical Drains
The Contractor shall furnish all necessary labor, equipment and materials, and perform all operations necessary for the installation of prefabricated vertical drains in accordance with the details shown in the Plans and with the requirements of these Specifications.
The prefabricated drain shall consist of a continuous plastic drainage core wrapped in a nonwoven geotextile material as specified in the Contract.
The drains shall be free of defects, rips, holes, or flaws. During shipment and storage, the drain shall be wrapped in a heavy-duty protective covering. The storage area shall protect the drain material from sunlight, mud, dirt, dust, debris, and detrimental substances.
Manufacturer certification shall be provided for all drain materials delivered to the project.
Vertical drains shall be staked by the Contractor and constructed prior to embankment construction.
Prior to installation of vertical drains, a sand drainage blanket shall be placed on the ground surface for use as a working platform. This platform shall have a minimum depth of 2 feet and shall consist of uncompacted material meeting the requirements of
Section 9-03.13(1).

Page 2-16
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Roadway Excavation and Embankment 2-03
Vertical drains shall be installed with equipment that will cause a minimum of subsoil disturbance. A mandrel or sleeve shall be advanced through the subsoil using vibratory, constant load, or constant rate of advance methods. The mandrel shall have a maximum cross‑sectional area of 14 square inches, shall protect the prefabricated drain material from tears, cuts, and abrasions during installation, and shall be provided with an “anchor” plate or rod. The “anchor” plate or rod shall provide sufficient strength to prevent the soil from entering the bottom during installation and shall anchor the bottom of the drain at the required depth when the mandrel is removed. Use of falling weight impact hammers or jetting will not be allowed within the compressible subsoil to be drained.
The prefabricated drains shall be installed vertically from the working surface to the required elevations and in a sequence that will not require equipment to travel over previously installed drains. The Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a suitable means of verifying the plumbness of the equipment and determining the depth of the drain at any time. The equipment shall not deviate more than 0.25 inches per foot from vertical.
Splices or connections in the prefabricated drain material shall be done in a professional manner to ensure continuity of the wick material. The prefabricated drain shall be cut to leave at least 6 inches protruding above the working platform at each drain location.
Where obstructions are encountered which cannot be penetrated the Contractor shall abandon the hole. A maximum of two attempts shall be made to install a new drain within
18 inches of the obstructed hole. Drains that otherwise deviate from the Plan location by more than 6 inches, or that are damaged or improperly installed, will be rejected.
Installation of the drains should consider and be coordinated with the geotechnical instrumentation shown in the Plans. Special care shall be taken when installing drains near instrumentation already in place. Replacement of instrumentation damaged by the
Contractor will be the responsibility of the Contractor.
The Contractor shall demonstrate that the equipment, method, and materials produce a satisfactory installation in accordance with these Specifications. For this purpose, the Contractor shall be required to install trial drains at different locations within the
Work area.
The Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working Drawing consisting of details of the sequence and method of installation. The submittal shall, at a minimum, contain the dimensions and length of mandrel, a detailed description of the proposed method(s) for overcoming obstructions, and the proposed method(s) for splicing drains.
Approval by the Engineer will not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to install prefabricated vertical drains in accordance with the Plans, Special Provisions, and these
Specifications. If, at any time, the Engineer considers the method of installation does not produce a satisfactory drain, the Contractor shall alter the method and equipment as necessary. 2-03.3(14)I

Embankments at Bridge and Trestle Ends
This Work consists of filling around the ends of trestles and bridges, the area defined in
Section 1-01.3. The Contractor shall begin and complete this Work as soon as possible after each bridge is completed or when the Engineer requires.
The Contractor shall select fill material from the excavation sources elsewhere on the project. Bridge Approach Embankments shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of the maximum density as determined by the tests described in Section 2-03.3(14)D. In any embankment area where piles will be installed, the Contractor shall remove all solid material, rocks, broken concrete, etc., larger than 3 inches across that would interfere with pile driving.

Roadway Excavation and Embankment
To prevent the bridge from being distorted or displaced, the Contractor shall place backfill evenly around all sides and parts of the Structure. The Contractor shall not backfill any abutment prior to placing the Superstructure. After the Superstructure is in place, use of small compactors may be required to compact the backfill around the Structure.
Embankments and backfill behind the abutments shall be brought up in layers and compacted concurrently. The difference in backfill height against each abutment shall not exceed 2 feet unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer.
The Contractor may request to place the abutment backfill (either full or partial height) prior to placement of the Superstructure by submitting Type 2E Working Drawings consisting of calculations confirming that the abutment is stable, both for overturning and sliding, without the Superstructure in place. The stability calculations shall assume a loading of 30 lbs/ft3 equivalent fluid pressure and include at least a 2-foot surcharge for the backfill placement equipment. If the abutment backfill is allowed to be placed prior to completion of the Superstructure, the Contractor shall bear any added cost that results from the change.
The Contractor shall build the embankment under the bridge to the dimensions shown in the Standard Plans or detailed in the Plans.
Cost related to all Work described in this section shall be incidental to other Work and included in the unit Contract prices that apply. 2-03.3(14)J

Before excavating channels or ditches, the Contractor shall clear and grub the area in accordance with Section 2-01. 2-03.3(15)
Aeration
The Contracting Agency may include aeration as a Contract item if material from test holes in excavation or borrow sites is too wet to compact properly. Even if the Contract includes such an item, the Contractor shall make every effort to reduce the need for aeration. The Contractor shall do so by using methods known to be effective in building embankments with wet materials. Such methods include open ditching to drain excavation areas or alternating layers of wet and dry materials. These and similar methods will be incidental to excavation and their costs shall be included in the unit Contract price for
Roadway excavation, for borrow excavation (including haul), and for haul.
If aeration is not a Contract item, its cost shall be incidental to and included in the excavation and embankment items.
Aeration Equipment – The Engineer may direct the Contractor to use aeration equipment in these areas: Roadway excavation, borrow sites, or embankments. The Contracting
Agency does not guarantee the moisture-reducing effectiveness of any single type of equipment. The Engineer may, however, require the use of any type that will best aerate a given area.
If the Contractor uses any of the following types of equipment, it shall meet these minimum requirements: 1.

Heavy-Duty Power Grader – This machine shall have a moldboard measuring 12 feet long, 24 inches high, and ¾ inch thick. Each grader shall carry its maximum number of standard scarifier-rippers or discs. 2.
Heavy-Duty Gang Plow – It shall have at least five 16-inch bottoms. Its tractor shall be able to move no less than 1½ mph while plowing at least 9 inches deep through fairly wet material. 3.
Heavy-Duty Tandem Discs – This machine shall cut a swath at least 8 feet wide with discs no less than 28 inches in diameter. Its tractor shall be able to turn fairly wet material at least 6 inches deep while moving at 2 mph or more. 4.

Snow Removal
If snow deep enough to interfere with the Work covers a cut or an embankment, the
Contractor shall remove and deposit it outside the slope stakes. Snow removal must be done at least 100 feet ahead of excavation and embankment Work. The Contractor shall remove snow at no expense to the Contracting Agency. 2-03.3(18)
Stepped Slope Construction
When the Plans or the Engineer requires it, the Contractor shall shape slopes cut in soft rock to a stepped pattern conforming closely to the typical cross-section in the Plans.
Stepped slopes shall meet these requirements: 1.
Each step shall be 1 to 2 feet high.

2.
The horizontal depth of each step will depend on its relationship to the staked slope ratio. The approximate midpoint of each horizontal tread shall occur on the staked slope line. 3.
The treads shall be approximately level in all directions. 4.
The ends of the steps shall be blended into the natural ground, with loose material removed from transitional areas. 5.
If the Contractor cannot rip a rock outcropping within a cut, the steps shall be blended into the rock. 6.
Large rocks and material that may fall into the ditch line or onto the Roadway shall be removed, but scaling is not required.
The compaction and seeding requirements of Section 8-01.3(2) shall not apply to stepped slope construction.
The Contracting Agency will measure stepped slope excavation by the area defined by the staked slope line. The unit Contract price per cubic yard for Roadway or borrow excavation shall be full pay for all labor and equipment required to build stepped slopes. 2-03.3(19)
Removal of Pavement, Sidewalks, Curbs, and Gutters
The requirements of Section 2-02.3(3) shall also apply when pavements, sidewalks, curbs, and gutters lie within an excavation. 2-03.4

Measurement
Roadway excavation, channel excavation, ditch excavation, unsuitable foundation excavation, and common borrow items will be measured by the cubic yard. All excavated material will be measured in the position it occupied before the excavation was performed. An original ground measurement will be taken using cross-section or digital terrain modeling survey techniques. For Roadway excavation, channel excavation, and ditch excavation items, the original ground will be compared with the planned finished section shown in the Plans. Slope/ground intercept points defining the limits of the measurement will be as staked. For unsuitable foundation excavation and common borrow items, the original ground will be compared with a survey of the excavation area taken after the Work is completed. When the Contracting Agency requires excavated material to be stockpiled, re-excavated and moved again, a second measurement will be made, adding quantity for the same item used in the original excavation. The second measurement will be a comparison of the original cross-section of the stockpile with a cross-section of the stockpile area after the second excavation is completed.
If the excavation item does not include Haul, then the measurement provisions of Section 2-04 shall apply.
Gravel borrow and select borrow will be measured by the cubic yard or ton. Measurement by cubic yard will be made in the hauling vehicle.
Page 2-20
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Roadway Excavation and Embankment 2-03
Sand drainage blanket will be measured by the ton with deductions made for the weight of moisture above 8 percent.
Embankment compaction (Methods B and C in Section 2-03.3(14)C) will be measured by the cubic yard. An original ground measurement will be taken using cross-section or digital terrain modeling survey techniques. Quantities will be determined based on a comparison of the original ground measurement with the finished embankment section as staked. No allowance will be made for material that settles. No deduction will be taken for other items constructed within the embankment (bridge abutments, piers, columns, backfill, wall backfill, pipes, etc.). The Contracting Agency will exclude from compaction measurement material that is wasted or placed under water and not compacted in layers as provided by Sections 2-03.3(14)A and 2-03.3(14)C. In cuts, where excavation has been made below the planned Subgrade elevation, and in fills where excavation has been made below original ground, compaction will be measured by the cubic yard in the cross-section of compacted backfill material. When material below grade in cuts or in original ground beneath fills is scarified and recompacted, embankment compaction will be measured by its compacted depth, up to a maximum of 6 inches. There is no specific unit of measure and no measurement will be made for method A compaction as described in Section 2-03.3(14)C.
Controlled blasting of rock face will be measured by the linear foot of hole drilled. Holes will be measured from the top of the rock surface to the elevation of the Roadway ditch or to a bench elevation set by the Engineer. Quantities shown in the Plans are based on 30-inch hole spacing. Actual quantities will depend on field conditions and results from test sections.
Prefabricated vertical drains will be measured by the linear foot. Trial drains will be measured and included in the payment quantity for the prefabricated vertical drains. The drains will be measured from the top of the working platform to the bottom of each hole. 2-03.5

Measurement
The Contracting Agency will measure haul in units of haul where one unit equals 100-cubic yards of excavated material hauled 100 feet.
Excavated material will be measured in its original position. The Engineer will provide a copy of the location mass diagram upon request.
Haul On Right of Way – To compute units of haul, the Contracting Agency will measure haul distance parallel to the centerline (or base line) of the Highway. Lateral distance (cross‑hauling) will not be measured.
Quantities to be measured in this way include: (1) material from the Roadway prism or prisms; (2) borrow from widened cuts; (3) waste deposited in the Right of Way or alongside it; and (4) material from Auxiliary Lanes – Frontage Roads, speed change lanes, paralleling and loop ramps, cross roads, and other lanes that supplement through-traffic movements.
If the Plans show more than one centerline or base line (as in a multi-lane Highway), the
Plans or Special Provisions will describe the line by which haul will be computed.
Waste Haul Off Right of Way – The Contracting Agency will measure the cross-section and length of any waste embankment to calculate waste quantities. If the Plans or Special
Provisions do not specify a haul route, the Contracting Agency will compute haul along the long axis of the waste embankment, thence along a line running perpendicular to the Highway center line, starting at the center line and ending at the nearest end of the waste embankment.
However, when a route is specified, haul distance will be measured along that route.
If the Contractor chooses to use a route shorter than that computed or specified, the
Contracting Agency will base payment on the length of the route actually used. 2-04.5

Description
This Work consists of preparing graded Roadbed for surfacing or surfaced Roadbed for paving. 2-06.2 2-06.3
Construction Requirements 2-06.3(1)
Subgrade for Surfacing
In preparing the Roadbed for surfacing, the Contractor shall: 1.
Remove from the Roadbed, immediately before placing surfacing materials, all brush, weeds, vegetation, grass, and other debris. 2.
Dispose of all debris as the Engineer directs. 3.
Drain water from all low spots or ruts. 4.
Shape the entire Subgrade to a uniform surface running reasonably true to the line, grade, and cross-section as staked.

5.
If necessary, the Contractor shall process the Subgrade in cut areas to remove materials too coarse for mechanical trimming and recompaction. 6.
Compact the Subgrade to a depth of 6 inches. Compaction shall achieve 95 percent of the maximum density determined under the tests described in Section 2-03.3(14)D. If the underlying material is too soft to permit proper compaction of the Subgrade, the
Contractor shall loosen, aerate (or excavate and remove), and compact the Subgrade until the top layer can be compacted as required. 7.

The geosynthetic shall be covered at all times during shipment and storage such that it is fully protected from ultraviolet radiation including sunlight, site construction damage, precipitation, chemicals that are strong acids or strong bases, flames including welding sparks, temperatures in excess of 160ºF, and any other environmental condition that may damage the physical property values of the geosynthetic.
Unless specified otherwise in the Plans, the geotextile required for underground drainage shall be “Moderate Survivability” and “Drainage Class C” and permanent erosion control applications shall be “High Survivability” and “Drainage Class C”. 2-12.3
Construction Requirements
The area to be covered by the geosynthetic shall be graded to a smooth, uniform condition free from ruts, potholes, and protruding objects such as rocks or sticks.
The geosynthetic shall be spread immediately ahead of the covering operation. The geosynthetic shall not be left exposed to sunlight during installation for a total of more than 14 calendar days. The geosynthetic shall be laid smooth without excessive wrinkles.
Under no circumstances shall the geosynthetic be dragged through mud or over sharp objects which could damage the geosynthetic. The cover material shall be placed on the geosynthetic such that the minimum initial lift thickness required will be between the equipment tires or tracks and the geosynthetic at all times. Construction vehicles shall be limited in size and weight, to reduce rutting in the initial lift above the geosynthetic, to not greater than 3 inches deep to prevent overstressing the geosynthetic. Turning of vehicles on the first lift above the geosynthetic will not be permitted.
Soil piles or the manufacturer’s recommended method, shall be used as needed to hold the geosynthetic in place until the specified cover material is placed.
Should the geosynthetic be torn, punctured, or the overlaps or sewn joints disturbed, as evidenced by visible geosynthetic damage, Subgrade pumping, intrusion, or Roadbed distortion, the backfill around the damaged or displaced area shall be removed and the damaged area repaired or replaced by the Contractor at no expense to the Contracting
Agency. The repair shall consist of a patch of the same type of geosynthetic placed over the damaged area. The patch shall overlap the existing geosynthetic from the edge of any part of the damaged area by the minimum required overlap for the application.
If geotextile seams are to be sewn in the field or at the factory, the seams shall consist of one row of stitching unless the geotextile where the seam is to be sewn does not have a selvage edge. If a selvage edge is not present, the seams shall consist of two parallel rows of stitching, or shall consist of a J-seam, Type SSn-1, using a single row of stitching. The two rows of stitching shall be 1.0 inch apart with a tolerance of plus or minus 0.5 inch and shall not cross except for restitching. The stitching shall be a lock-type stitch. The minimum seam allowance, i.e., the minimum distance from the geotextile edge to the stitch line nearest to that edge, shall be 1½ inches if a flat or prayer seam, Type SSa-2, is used. The minimum seam allowance for all other seam types shall be 1.0 inch. The seam, stitch type, and the equipment used to perform the stitching shall be as recommended by the manufacturer of the geotextile and as approved by the Engineer.

Soil Stabilization
The geotextile shall either be overlapped a minimum, of 2 feet at all longitudinal and transverse joints, or the geotextile shall be sewn together. The initial lift thickness shall be
12 inches or more. Compaction of the first lift above the geotextile shall be by Method A according to Section 2-03.3(14)C. No vibratory compaction will be allowed on the first lift. 2-12.3(4)
Permanent Erosion Control and Ditch Lining
Unless otherwise shown in the Plans, the geotextile shall either be overlapped a minimum of 2 feet at all longitudinal and transverse joints, or the geotextile joints shall be sewn together. If overlapped, the geotextile shall be placed so that the upstream strip of geotextile will overlap the next downstream strip. When placed on slopes, each strip shall overlap the next downhill strip.
Placement of aggregate and riprap or other cover material on the geotextile shall start at the toe of the slope and proceed upwards. The geotextile shall be keyed at the top and the toe of the slope as shown in the Plans. The geotextile shall be secured to the slope, but shall be secured loosely enough so that the geotextile will not tear when the riprap or other cover material is placed on the geotextile. The geotextile shall not be keyed at the top of the slope until the riprap or other cover material is in place to the top of the slope.
All voids in the riprap or other cover material that allow the geotextile to be visible shall be backfilled with quarry spalls or other small stones, as designated by the Engineer, so that the geotextile is completely covered. When an aggregate cushion between the geotextile and the riprap or other cover material is required, it shall have a minimum thickness of
12 inches.
An aggregate cushion will be required to facilitate drainage when hand placed riprap, as specified in Section 9-13.1(4), is used with the geotextile.

Potable water shall be provided to the Contracting Agency’s laboratory trailer(s) for use during plant operations when requested by the Engineer. 3-01.2(3)
Stripping Quarries and Pits
Stripping of quarries and pits shall consist of the removal, after clearing and grubbing, of the surface material and overburden that is unsuitable for the kind of material to be borrowed or produced for use. Materials from stripping, to be used later as provided on the site reclamation plan specified in Section 3-03, shall be deposited within the quarry or pit site at such a location as not to interfere with future development within the site. 3-01.2(4)
Production Requirements
All oversize stones, rock fragments, or boulders occurring in the source, up to and including those measuring 18 inches in the greatest dimension, shall be utilized in the manufacture of crushed material.
If the grading or quality of raw material in sources used for the manufacture of products covered by this section is such that the fracture, grading, or quality of the product specified cannot be obtained by utilizing the natural material, fine portions of the raw material shall be rejected to the extent necessary to produce products meeting all requirements of these Specifications. Failure of the Contracting Agency to include a scalping requirement in the Special Provisions shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for rejecting fine portions of the material if such becomes necessary to produce products meeting all requirements of these Specifications. Scalping shall be performed after the pit-run or quarry‑run material has passed through the primary crusher.
When scalping over a screen of a specified size is required in the Special Provisions, the scalping screen shall be of such size and capacity that enough of the fine material will be removed to produce Work that conforms to the Specifications.
Washing and reclaiming of the reject material and subsequent addition of this material to finished products will not be allowed unless specifically authorized in writing by the
Engineer.
Surplus screenings accumulated during the crushing and screening of specified Roadway materials will be considered separate and distinct from reject material resulting from scalping operations.
Both fine and coarse concrete aggregates shall be thoroughly washed in order to remove clay, loam, alkali, bark, sticks, organic castings, or other deleterious matter. Washing will be required in the production of other materials if necessary to produce products meeting all the quality requirements of these Specifications.
When producing screened gravel or sand materials, the Contractor shall remove all oversize material by screening at the pit site. The Contractor’s operations in the pit shall be conducted so that the grading of individual loads will be uniform. In general, the Contractor shall utilize the most suitable materials available and shall make as many moves of the loading equipment as may be necessary to fulfill these requirements.
Where pit-run materials meet Specifications, screening or processing will not be required.

Final Cleanup
Upon completion of the Contractor’s operation, the quarry or pit shall be cleared of all rubbish, temporary structures, and equipment, and shall be left in a neat and presentable condition. The pit or quarry shall be reclaimed in accordance with the approved site reclamation plan specified in Section 3-03. 3-01.3
State Furnished Material Sources
Unless specified in the Special Provisions, no Contracting Agency material sources are provided and the Contractor shall bear full responsibility for furnishing all materials. 3-01.3(1)
Quality and Extent of Material
Contracting Agency furnished material sources will be shown in the Plans and described in the Special Provisions. The quality of material in such sources will be acceptable in general, but the Contractor shall determine the amount of Work required to produce the material meeting these Specifications. It shall be understood that it is not feasible to ascertain from samples, the limits for an entire source, and that variations shall be considered as usual and are to be expected. The Engineer may order procurement of material from any portion of a source and may reject portions of the source as unacceptable.
Since many material sources are acquired in fee by the Contracting Agency for use on future projects as well as for this Contract, it is in the public interest to preserve the future usefulness and adequacy of a source insofar as may be practical. To achieve this end, the Contractor shall not perform Work within the source until receiving the Engineer’s approval of the Contractor’s work plan within the limits of the source. 3-01.3(2)

When More Than One Site is Provided
When more than one quarry or pit site is provided in the Special Provisions, the
Contractor may obtain material from any of the sources. The Contracting Agency will specify the quantity of raw material available, as determined by tests, in each quarry or pit site. If the Contractor sets up in a site, and it is found that the quantity of raw material from that site, when the site is exhausted, is less than that specified by the Contracting
Agency, then the provisions of Section 3-01.3(5) will apply. 3-01.3(3)
Reject Materials
All scalpings that are unsatisfactory for use under these Specifications or Special
Provisions shall be considered as reject material, subject to disposal as approved by the
Engineer. Reject material shall be placed at such a location as not to interfere with future development within the site. 3-01.3(4)
Surplus Screenings
The surplus screenings accumulated during the production of the specified materials shall be stockpiled at a location within the site provided and become the property of the Contracting Agency. The stockpile site shall be prepared and constructed by the
Contractor in accordance with the provisions of Section 3-02. All costs incurred in producing, hauling, and stockpiling the surplus screenings shall be incidental to the production of the specified materials and shall be included by the Contractor in the unit

Moving Plant
If, in the opinion of the Engineer, there should be insufficient suitable material in any quarry or pit site made available by the Contracting Agency, the Contracting Agency will acquire at its expense an additional source, in which event the Contractor will be required to move the crushing plant to the new quarry or site. Under such conditions, the
Contracting Agency will pay for the Contractor’s costs for the move on a force account basis. Payment will be limited to the labor, equipment, and materials required for the move, and no allowance will be made for payment of standby costs for the crushing plant nor other equipment that may be temporarily idle as a result of the move.
The clearing, grubbing, and preparing of the new quarries or pit sites as specified in
Section 3-01.2(2) will be paid for in the manner provided in these Specifications for “Clearing”, “Grubbing”, and “Stripping Including Haul”. If there is no Bid item applicable, the payment for the preparation of the new site will be as provided in Section 1-04.4.
If the moving of the plant due to shortage of the supply of material necessitates a longer haul on materials than required from the original source, the Contracting Agency will reimburse the Contractor for the additional haul at the rate of $0.25 per ton-mile haul.
The unit ton-mile shall be the equivalent of 1 ton of material hauled a distance of 1 mile.
The haul distance will be measured in ½-mile units, fractional half-miles being allowed as full half-miles. If the requirement for moving of the crushing plant results in a delay of performance of Work which is critical to completion of the project, as shown by the
Contractor’s approved progress schedule, the Engineer will authorize a suspension of
Work for the time required for the move.
The above allowances, insofar as they may be applicable, shall be full pay for all claims of any kind or description by reason of the necessity of changing from one site to another due to shortage of the supply from sources made available by the Contracting Agency.
Before moving a crushing plant as outlined above, the Contractor shall secure from the
Engineer an order in writing to do so. Should the Contractor fail to secure such order, it shall be considered sufficient proof that the move was immaterial insofar as to cost, and no allowance or pay will be made by reason of such move. 3-01.4 3-01.4(1)

Contractor Furnished Material Sources
Acquisition and Development
If, under the terms of the Contract, the Contractor is required to provide a source of materials, or if the Contractor elects to use materials from sources other than those provided by the Contracting Agency, the Contractor shall, at no expense to the
Contracting Agency, make all necessary arrangements for obtaining the material and shall ensure the quantity of suitable material is available. Preliminary samples shall be taken by or in the presence of the Engineer or a designated representative unless the Engineer permits otherwise. Approval of the source does not relieve the Contractor from meeting these Specification requirements, nor does it guarantee that the material will meet these requirements without additional or proper processing. The Engineer may require additional preliminary samples at any time.
Approval of a Contractor’s source offered in lieu of a Contracting Agency-provided source will be contingent upon the material therein being of equal quality, and no additional costs will accrue to the Contracting Agency as a result of such approval. Equivalency of quality will be based on those test values listed in the Special Provisions as being representative of material in the Contracting Agency-provided source. If no such values are listed, the minimum Specification requirements will apply. When measurement by weight is specified and when the specific gravity of material produced from the Contractor’s source is greater than that from the Contracting Agency-furnished source, additional materials required to construct the minimum specified surfacing depth shall be furnished by the Contractor at no expense to the Contracting Agency.

The Contractor shall notify the State Departments of Ecology, Fish and Wildlife, and
Natural Resources, in writing, of the intent to furnish the source, and shall, at no expense to the Contracting Agency, make all necessary arrangements with these agencies for the determinations of regulations that might be imposed upon the Contractor during removal of materials from the source.
The source shall be selected so that, after the materials have been removed, the pit will drain to a natural drainage course and no ponding will result. Should the source selected by the Contractor be one that would not drain as outlined herein, permission shall be obtained by the Contractor from the governing body of the city or county for the removal of materials from the pit or quarry.
The Contractor will not be permitted to operate a pit or a quarry site visible from a

Aggregates 3-04.3 3-04.3(1) 9-03
Construction Requirements
General
For the purpose of statistical and nonstatistical acceptance sampling and testing, all test results obtained for a material type will be evaluated collectively. Sublot sampling and testing will be performed on a random basis at the frequency of one sample per sublot.
Based on plan quantities, the sublot size will be determined to the nearest 100 tons (50 cy). The maximum sublot size will be as defined in Table 1. 3-04.3(2)
Point of Acceptance
The point of acceptance shall be as designated by the Engineer. Multiple sources shall not be placed within the same limits of each separate spreading operation or in such a way that the intermingling of different sources occurs. Individual compaction lifts may be of a different source. 3-04.3(3)
Sampling

The sampling of aggregate materials shall be performed on a random basis using WSDOT
T 716, Method of Random Sampling. Samples for acceptance testing shall be obtained by the Engineer, or their designated representative. If ordered by the Engineer, the
Contractor shall obtain the sample in the presence of the Engineer or their representative.
The aggregate material shall be sampled in accordance with WAQTC FOP for AASHTO
R 90 and Section 1-05.6. The sample size shall be equal to the minimum requirements of
WAQTC FOP for AASHTO R 90. 3-04.3(4)
Testing Results
The results of all acceptance testing performed in the field and the Composite Pay Factor (CPF) of the lot after three sublots have been tested will be available to the Contractor through WSDOT’s website. 3-04.3(5)
Nonstatistical Evaluation
Each lot of aggregate materials produced under nonstatistical evaluation and having all constituents falling within the specification limits shall be accepted with no further evaluation. When one or more constituents fall outside the specification limits, the material will be statistically evaluated. A minimum of three sublots will be sampled and tested, when less than three sublots exist additional samples shall be tested to provide a minimum of three sets of results for evaluation. The test results of the sublots shall be

Page 3-12
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Acceptance of Aggregate 3-04 evaluated in accordance with Section 1-06.2 using the price adjustment factors from
Table 2 to determine the appropriate CPF. The maximum CPF shall be 1.00. If the CPF is below 1.00 but is equal to or above 0.75, a price adjustment will be calculated in accordance with Section 3-04.3(8).
When the aggregate does not have established price adjustment factors, use the appropriate price adjustment factors from “Other Materials” as listed in Table 2. 3-04.3(6)
Statistical Evaluation
For statistical evaluation a lot is defined as 15 sublots, the final lot will be increased to a maximum of 25 sublots. All test results obtained for a material type will be evaluated in accordance with Section 1-06.2. Each lot of aggregate materials produced under statistical evaluation will be determined to be acceptable if the Composite Pay Factor (CPF) when calculated in accordance with Section 1-06.2(2) using the price adjustment factors from
Table 2 is 1.00 or greater. The Contractor shall be paid the unit bid price for aggregate materials with a CPF of 1.00 or greater. If the CPF is below 1.00 but is equal to or above 0.75, calculate the price adjustment in accordance with Section 3-04.3(8).
When the aggregate does not have established price adjustment factors, use the appropriate price adjustment factors from “Other Materials” as listed in Table 2. 3-04.3(7)
Rejected Work

3-04.3(7)A
General
Work that is defective and does not conform to Contract requirements shall be rejected. 3-04.3(7)B
Rejection by Contractor
The Contractor may, prior to sampling, elect to remove any defective material and replace it with new material. Any such new material will be sampled, tested, and evaluated for acceptance. 3-04.3(7)C
Rejection Without Testing 3-04.3(7)C1
Rejection Prior to Placement
The Engineer may, without sampling, reject loads or stockpiles that appear defective.
Material rejected before placement shall not be incorporated into the work. 3-04.3(7)C2
Rejection After Placement

Any Work rejected after placement shall be removed. 3-04.3(7)C3
Payment for Rejected Material
No payment will be made for the rejected materials unless the Contractor requests that the rejected material be tested. If the Contractor requests to have the rejected material tested, acceptance will be by Statistical Evaluation, and a minimum of three representative samples shall be obtained and tested.
If the CPF for the rejected material is less than 0.75, no payment will be made for the rejected material; in addition, the cost of sampling and testing shall be borne by the
Contractor. If the CPF is greater than or equal to 0.75, the cost of sampling and testing will be borne by the Contracting Agency. If the material is rejected before placement and the CPF is greater than or equal to 0.75, compensation for the rejected material will be at a CPF of 0.75. If rejection occurs after placement and the CPF is greater than 0.75, compensation for the rejected mix will be at the calculated CPF with an addition of
25 percent of the unit Contract price added for the cost of removal and disposal.

An entire lot with a CPF of less than 0.75 will be rejected. 3-04.3(8)
Price Adjustments for Quality of Aggregate
All aggregate material will be subject to price adjustments. The maximum attainable
CPF shall be 1.00. The aggregate Compliance Price Adjustment for acceptance of the aggregate will be calculated as follows:
Aggregate Compliance Price Adjustment = CPF – 1.00 (quantity of material) (unit bid price or Contingent Unit Price as shown in Table 1, whichever is higher)
For aggregate materials lacking a separate unit bid price, the unit bid prices shall be taken as the value listed in Table 1 for “Contingent Unit Price”.
If a component is not measured in accordance with these Specifications, its individual pay factor will be considered 1.00 in calculating the CPF. 3-04.4

Mixing
Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor may use either, or both, of the following described methods: 1.
Central Plant Mix Method – The surfacing material and water shall be mixed in an approved mixing plant as described in Section 4-04.3(1). The completed mixture shall be a thoroughly mixed combination of proportioned materials and water, uniform in distribution of particle sizes and moisture content. A mixture containing water in excess of the proportion established by the Engineer will not be accepted. 2.
Road Mix Method – After material for each layer of surfacing has been placed, the material shall be mixed until uniform throughout by motor graders or other equipment approved by the Engineer. Water to facilitate mixing and compacting shall be added in amounts approved by the Engineer. 4-04.3(4) 1.
Placing and Spreading
Central Plant Mix Method – After mixing, material for each layer of surfacing shall be transported to the Roadway in approved vehicles. Vehicles for hauling the mixture shall be capable of depositing the mixture within the receiving hopper of the spreading equipment, or in windrows of uniform size in front of the spreading equipment, with a minimum of segregation of the mix.
A motor grader may be used as the spreading machine or the spreading machine shall be capable of receiving the material by direct deposit in its hopper from the hauling vehicle or from a uniform windrow and be capable of spreading and screeding the material to a depth and surface that when compacted will be true to line, grade, depth of course, and cross-section without further shaping.

2.
Road Mix Method – Each layer of surfacing material shall be spread by equipment that is approved by the Engineer. Equipment that causes segregation of the surfacing material during the spreading operation will not be allowed. Similar types of spreading equipment shall be used throughout the limits of each separate spreading operation.
Spreading on small areas of less than 2,000 square yards or on areas irregular in shape, may be accomplished by other means as approved by the Engineer.
The following nominal depth of compacted material shall not be exceeded in any one course without the approval of the Engineer:
Ballast
Gravel Base
Crushed Surfacing 4-04.3(5)
0.50 foot
0.75 foot
0.35 foot

Shaping and Compaction
Immediately following spreading and final shaping, each layer of surfacing shall be compacted to at least 95 percent of maximum density determined by the requirements of Section 2-03.3(14)D before the next succeeding layer of surfacing or pavement is placed. The determination of field in-place density shall be made by a nuclear density gauge. When the thickness of surfacing is less than 0.15 foot, density testing will not be required and the Engineer will determine the number of coverages required for the particular compaction equipment available. Vibratory compactors and rollers shall obtain the specified density for each layer. A mist spray of water shall be applied as needed to replace moisture lost by evaporation. The completed layer shall have a smooth, tight, uniform surface true to the line, grade, and cross-section shown in the Plans, or as staked.
When using 100% Recycled Concrete Aggregate, the Contractor may submit a written request to use a test point evaluation for compaction acceptance testing in lieu of compacting to 95% of the standard density as determined by the requirements of Section 2-03.3(14)D. The test point evaluation shall be performed in accordance with SOP 738.

Keystone
When necessary, as determined by the Engineer, crushed surfacing top course shall be used for keystone to key the top surface of ballast, gravel base, crushed surfacing base course, or any other surfacing course that requires keying. The keystone shall be spread evenly on top of the surfacing course by means of approved spreading equipment. The surface shall be watered and, if necessary, bladed lightly until the keystone is worked into the interstices of the surfacing course without excessive displacement and shall be compacted. The operations of adding keystone, wetting, blading, and compacting shall be continued until the course has become thoroughly keyed and compacted.
When keystone is required, that is subject to public traffic, it shall be placed before terminating each day’s operation.
Keystone placed for the convenience of the Contractor, with approval of the Engineer, for the purpose of creating a denser surface on which to pave will be allowed within the top
0.20 foot of crushed surfacing base course, gravel base, or ballast. Keystone placed for this purpose will be paid for at the lower unit Contract price for either the base material being keyed or crushed surfacing top course. 4-04.3(7)

Miscellaneous Requirements
The surface of each layer of surfacing material shall be maintained true to line, grade, and cross-section by grading, watering, and rolling until placing the next succeeding course. The first course of surfacing material shall be placed on all available Subgrade before placing the succeeding course unless otherwise authorized by the Engineer. The
Contractor shall maintain a minimum distance of not less than one full station between the construction of any two courses of surfacing or ballast, unless otherwise approved.
Should irregularities develop in surfaces during or after compaction, they shall be remedied by loosening the surface and correcting the defects after which the entire area including the surrounding surface shall be thoroughly recompacted. All additional materials necessary to make the repairs shall be furnished by the Contractor at the unit
Contract price. 4-04.3(8)
Weather Limitations
When, in the opinion of the Engineer, the weather is such that satisfactory results cannot be obtained, the Contractor shall suspend operations until the weather is favorable. No surfacing materials shall be placed in snow or on a soft, muddy, or frozen Subgrade. 4-04.3(9)
Hauling
Hauling equipment shall be routed over the Roadway in a manner to be most effective in the compacting of the surfacing. Hauling over the surfacing in the process of construction will not be permitted when, in the opinion of the Engineer, the effect will be detrimental.
All loads shall be of uniform capacity unless deviation is expressly authorized by the
Engineer. 4-04.3(10)

Pavers
Use self-contained, power-propelled pavers provided with an internally heated vibratory screed that is capable of spreading and finishing courses of HMA in lane widths required by the paving section shown in the Plans.
When requested by the Engineer, provide written certification that the paver is equipped with the most current equipment available from the manufacturer for the prevention of segregation of the coarse aggregate particles. The certification shall list the make, model, and year of the paver and all equipment that has been retrofitted to the paver.
Operate the screed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations and in a manner to produce a finished surface of the required evenness and texture without tearing, shoving, segregating, or gouging the mixture. Provide a copy of the manufacturer’s recommendations upon request by the Contracting Agency. Extensions to the screed will be allowed provided they produce the same results, including ride, density, and surface texture as obtained by the primary screed. In the Traveled Way do not use extensions without both augers and an internally heated vibratory screed.
Equip the paver with automatic screed controls and sensors. The controls shall be capable of sensing grade from an outside reference line, sensing the transverse slope of the screed, and providing automatic signals that operate the screed to maintain the desired grade and transverse slope.

2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Hot Mix Asphalt 5-04
Equip the paver with automatic feeder controls, properly adjusted to maintain a uniform depth of material ahead of the screed.
Manual operation of the screed is permitted in the construction of irregularly shaped and minor areas. These areas include, but are not limited to, gore areas, road approaches, tapers and left-turn channelizations.
When specified in the Contract, provide reference lines for vertical control. Place reference lines on both outer edges of the Traveled Way of each Roadway. Horizontal control utilizing the reference line is permitted. Automatically control the grade and slope of intermediate lanes by means of reference lines or a mat referencing device and a slope control device. When the finish of the grade prepared for paving is superior to the established tolerances and when, in the opinion of the Engineer, further improvement to the line, grade, cross-section, and smoothness can best be achieved without the use of the reference line, a mat referencing device may be substituted for the reference line.
Substitution of the device will be subject to the continued approval of the Engineer. A joint matcher may be used subject to the approval of the Engineer. The reference line may be removed after completion of the first course of HMA when approved by the
Engineer. Whenever the Engineer determines that these methods are failing to provide the necessary vertical control, the reference lines will be reinstalled by the Contractor.
Furnish and install all pins, brackets, tensioning devices, wire, and accessories necessary for satisfactory operation of the automatic control equipment.
If the paving machine in use is not providing the required finish, the Engineer may suspend Work as allowed by Section 1-08.6. 5-04.3(3)D

Material Transfer Device or Material Transfer Vehicle
Use a material transfer device (MTD) or material transfer vehicle (MTV) to deliver the
HMA from the hauling equipment to the paving machine for all lifts in (or partially in) the top 0.30 feet of the pavement section used in traffic lanes. However, an MTD/V is not required for HMA placed in irregularly shaped and minor areas such as tapers and turn lanes, or for HMA mixture that is accepted by Visual Evaluation. At the Contractor’s request the Engineer may approve paving without an MTD/V; the Engineer will determine if an equitable adjustment in cost or time is due. If a windrow elevator is used, the
Engineer may limit the length of the windrow in urban areas or through intersections.
To be approved for use, an MTV: 1.

Rollers

Operate rollers in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. When requested by the Engineer, provide a Type 1 Working Drawing of the manufacturer’s recommendation for the use of any roller planned for use on the project. Do not use rollers that crush aggregate, produce pickup or washboard, unevenly compact the surface, displace the mix, or produce other undesirable results. 5-04.3(4)
Preparation of Existing Paved Surfaces
Before constructing HMA on an existing paved surface, the entire surface of the pavement shall be clean. Entirely remove all fatty asphalt patches, grease drippings, and other deleterious substances from the existing pavement. Thoroughly clean all pavements or bituminous surfaces of dust, soil, pavement grindings, and other foreign matter.
Thoroughly remove all cleaning or solvent type liquids spilled on the pavement before paving proceeds. Fill all holes and small depressions with an appropriate class of HMA.
Level and thoroughly compact the surface of the patched area.
Apply a uniform coat of asphalt (tack coat) to all paved surfaces on which courses of HMA are to be placed or abutted. Apply tack coat to cover the cleaned existing pavement with a thin film of residual asphalt free of streaks and bare spots. Apply a heavy application of tack coat to all joints. For Roadways open to traffic, limit the application of tack coat to surfaces that will be paved during the same working shift. Equip the spreading equipment with a thermometer to indicate the temperature of the tack coat material.
Do not operate equipment on tacked surfaces until the tack has broken and cured. Repair tack coat damaged by the Contractor’s operation, prior to placement of the HMA.
Unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer, use cationic emulsified asphalt CSS-1, CSS-1h, or Performance Graded (PG) asphalt for tack coat. The CSS-1 and CSS-1h may be diluted with water at a rate not to exceed one part water to one part emulsified asphalt. Do not allow the tack coat material to exceed the maximum temperature recommended by the asphalt supplier.

Pavement Repair
Excavate pavement repair areas and backfill these with HMA in accordance with the details shown in the Plans and as staked. Conduct the excavation operations in a manner that will protect the pavement that is to remain. Repair pavement not designated to be removed that is damaged as a result of the Contractor’s operations to the satisfaction of the Engineer at no cost to the Contracting Agency. Excavate only within one lane at a time unless approved otherwise by the Engineer. Do not excavate more area than can be completely backfilled and compacted during the same shift.
Unless otherwise shown in the Plans or determined by the Engineer, excavate to a depth of 1.0 feet. The Engineer will make the final determination of the excavation depth required.
The minimum width of a pavement repair area shall be 40 inches unless shown otherwise in the Plans. Prior to excavation, sawcut the perimeter of the pavement area to be removed unless the pavement in the pavement repair area is to be removed by a pavement grinder.
Excavated materials shall be the property of the Contractor and shall be disposed of in a Contractor-provided site off the Right of Way or used in accordance with
Sections 2-02.3(3) or 9-03.21.
Apply a heavy application of tack coat to all surfaces of existing pavement in the pavement repair area, in accordance with Section 5-04.3(4).
Place the HMA backfill in lifts not to exceed 0.35-foot compacted depth. Thoroughly compact each lift by a mechanical tamper or a roller. 5-04.3(5)

Producing/Stockpiling Aggregates, RAP, & RAS
Produce aggregate in compliance with Section 3-01. Comply with Section 3-02 for preparing stockpile sites, stockpiling, and removing from stockpile each of the following: aggregates, RAP, and RAS. Provide sufficient storage space for each size of aggregate,
RAP and RAS. Fine aggregate or RAP may be uniformly blended with the RAS as a method of preventing the agglomeration of RAS particles. Remove the aggregates, RAP and RAS from stockpile(s) in a manner that ensures minimal segregation when being moved to the
HMA plant for processing into the final mixture. Keep different aggregate sizes separated until they have been delivered to the HMA plant.
When hydrated lime is required by use of the marination treatment, the aggregates shall be stockpiled in accordance with Section 5-04.3(3)A. 5-04.3(5)A
Stockpiling RAP or RAS for High RAP/Any RAS Mixes
Do not place any RAP or RAS into a stockpile which has been sequestered for a High
RAP/Any RAS mix design. Do not incorporate any RAP or RAS into a High RAP/Any RAS mixture from a source other than the stockpile which was sequestered for approval of that particular High RAP/Any RAS mix design.
RAP that is used in a Low RAP/No RAS mix is not required to come from a sequestered stockpile. 5-04.3(6)
Mixing

The asphalt supplier shall introduce recycling agent and anti-stripping additive, in the amount designated on the QPL for the mix design, into the asphalt binder prior to shipment to the asphalt mixing plant.
Anti-strip is not required for temporary work that will be removed prior to Physical
Completion.
Use asphalt binder of the grade, and from the supplier, in the approved mix design.

Hot Mix Asphalt
Prior to introducing reclaimed materials into the asphalt plant, remove wire, nails, and other foreign material. Discontinue use of the reclaimed material if the Engineer, in their sole discretion, determines the wire, nails, or other foreign material to be excessive.
Size RAP and RAS prior to entering the mixer to provide uniform and thoroughly mixed
HMA. If there is evidence of the RAP or RAS not breaking down during the heating and mixing of the HMA, immediately suspend the use of the RAP or RAS until changes have been approved by the Engineer.
After the required amount of mineral materials, RAP, RAS, new asphalt binder and recycling agent have been introduced into the mixer, mix the HMA until complete and uniform coating of the particles and thorough distribution of the asphalt binder throughout the mineral materials, RAP and RAS is ensured.
Upon discharge from the mixer, ensure that the temperature of the HMA does not exceed the optimum mixing temperature shown on the accepted Mix Design Report by more than 25°F, or as allowed by the Engineer. When an additive is included in the manufacture of HMA, do not heat the additive (at any stage of production including in binder storage tanks) to a temperature higher than the maximum recommended by the manufacturer of the additive.
A maximum water content of 2 percent in the mix, at discharge, will be allowed providing the water causes no problems with handling, stripping, or flushing. If the water in the
HMA causes any of these problems, reduce the moisture content.
During the daily operation, HMA may be temporarily held in approved storage facilities.
Do not incorporate HMA into the Work that has been held for more than 24 hours after mixing. Provide an easily readable, low bin-level indicator on the storage facility that indicates the amount of material in storage. Waste the HMA in storage when the top level of HMA drops below the top of the cone of the storage facility, except as the storage facility is being emptied at the end of the working shift. Dispose of rejected or waste HMA at no expense to the Contracting Agency. 5-04.3(7)

Use HMA pavers complying with Section 5-04.3(3) to distribute the mix. On areas where irregularities or unavoidable obstacles make the use of mechanical spreading and finishing equipment impractical, the paving may be done with other equipment or by hand.
When more than one JMF is being utilized to produce HMA, place the material produced for each JMF with separate spreading and compacting equipment. Do not intermingle
HMA produced from more than one JMF. Each strip of HMA placed during a work shift shall conform to a single JMF established for the class of HMA specified unless there is a need to make an adjustment in the JMF. 5-04.3(8)
Aggregate Acceptance Prior to Incorporation in HMA
Sample aggregate for meeting the requirements of Section 3-04 prior to being incorporated into HMA.

M 41-10 Hot Mix Asphalt 5-04 in Section 3-04. Aggregate acceptance testing will be performed by the Contracting
Agency. Aggregate contributed from RAP and/or RAS will not be evaluated under
Section 3-04.
The Contracting Agency’s combined aggregate bulk specific gravity (Gsb) blend as shown on the HMA Mix Design will be used for VMA calculations until the Contractor submits a written request for a Gsb test. The new Gsb will be used in the VMA calculations for
HMA from the date the Project Engineer receives the written request for a Gsb retest.
The Contractor may request aggregate specific gravity (Gsb) testing be performed by the
Contracting Agency twice per project for the first 10,000 HMA tons produced, and once thereafter. The Gsb blend of the combined stockpiles will be used to calculate voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) of HMA produced after the new Gsb is determined.
For aggregate that will be used in HMA mixture which will be accepted by Statistical
Evaluation, the Contracting Agency’s acceptance of the aggregate will be based on: 1.

Samples taken prior to mixing with asphalt binder, RAP, or RAS; 2.
Testing for the materials properties of fracture, uncompacted void content, and sand equivalent; 3.
Evaluation by the Contracting Agency in accordance with Section 3-04, including price adjustments as described therein.

Mixture Visual Evaluation – Lots, Sampling, Testing, Price Adjustments
HMA mixture accepted by Visual Evaluation will not be broken into lots unless the
Engineer determines that testing is required. When that occurs, the Engineer will identify the limits of the questionable HMA mixture, and that questionable HMA mixture shall constitute a lot. Then, the Contractor will take samples from the truck, or the Engineer will take core samples from the roadway at a minimum of three random locations from within the lot, selected in accordance with WSDOT Test Method T 716, taken from the roadway in accordance with WSDOT SOP 734, and tested in accordance with WSDOT SOP 737.
The Engineer will test one of the samples for all constituents in Section 5-04.3(9)B3.
If all constituents from that test fall within the Job Mix Formula Tolerances (for Visual
Evaluation) in Section 9-03.8(7), the lot will be accepted at the unit Contract price with no further evaluation.

The Contracting Agency will endeavor to provide written notification (via email to the
Contractor’s designee) of acceptance test results through its web-based materials testing system Statistical Analysis of Materials (SAM) within 24 hours of the sample being made available to the Contracting Agency. However, the Contractor agrees: 1.

Quality control, defined as the system used by the Contractor to monitor, assess, and adjust its production processes to ensure that the final HMA mixture will meet the specified level of quality, is the sole responsibility of the Contractor. 2.
The Contractor has no right to rely on testing performed by the Contracting Agency, nor does the Contractor have a right to rely on timely notification by the Contracting
Agency of the Contracting Agency’s test results (or statistical analysis thereof), for any part of quality control and/or for making changes or corrections to the HMA mixture. 3.

Criteria for Determining Method of Evaluation for HMA Compaction1
Statistical Evaluation of HMA
Compaction is Required For:
Visual Evaluation of
HMA Compaction is
Required For: • HMA for which the • “HMA for Preleveling…” specified course thickness is • “HMA for Pavement greater than 0.10 feet, and
Repair…” the HMA is in: – traffic lanes, including but not limited to: • ramp lanes • truck climbing lanes • weaving lanes • speed change lanes

Test Point Evaluation of HMA Compaction is
Required For: • HMA not meeting the criteria for Statistical
Evaluation or Visual
Evaluation
1 This table applies to all HMA, and shall be the sole basis for determining the acceptance method for compaction.
The Contracting Agency may, at its sole discretion, evaluate HMA for compliance with the
Cyclic Density requirements of Section 5-04.3(10)B. 5-04.3(10)A
HMA Compaction – General Compaction Requirements
Immediately after the HMA has been spread and struck off, and after surface irregularities have been adjusted, thoroughly and uniformly compact the mix. The completed course shall be free from ridges, ruts, humps, depressions, objectionable marks, and irregularities and shall conform to the line, grade, and cross-section shown in the Plans. If necessary, alter the JMF in accordance with Section 9-03.8(7) to achieve desired results.
Compact the mix when it is in the proper condition so that no undue displacement, cracking, or shoving occurs. Compact areas inaccessible to large compaction equipment by mechanical or hand tampers. Remove HMA that becomes loose, broken, contaminated, shows an excess or deficiency of asphalt, or is in any way defective. Replace the removed material with new HMA, and compact it immediately to conform to the surrounding area.
The type of rollers to be used and their relative position in the compaction sequence shall generally be the Contractor’s option, provided the specified densities are attained.
An exception shall be that pneumatic tired rollers shall be used for compaction of the wearing course beginning October 1st of any year through March 31st of the following year. Coverage with a steel wheel roller may precede pneumatic tired rolling. Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, operate rollers in the static mode when the internal temperature of the mix is less than 175°F. Regardless of mix temperature, do not operate a roller in a mode that results in checking or cracking of the mat.
On bridge decks and on roadway approaches within five feet of a bridge/back of pavement seat, rollers shall not be operated in a vibratory mode, defined as a mode in which the drum vibrates vertically. However, unless otherwise noted on the plans, rollers may be operated in an oscillatory mode, defined as a mode in which the drum vibrates in the horizontal direction only. 5-04.3(10)B

HMA Compaction – Cyclic Density
Low cyclic density areas are defined as spots or streaks in the pavement that are less than
90 percent of the theoretical maximum density. At the Engineer’s discretion, the Engineer may evaluate the HMA pavement for low cyclic density, and when doing so will follow
WSDOT SOP 733. A $500 Cyclic Density Price Adjustment will be assessed for a 500-foot section with two or more density readings below 90 percent of the theoretical maximum density.

HMA Compaction Acceptance – Statistical Evaluation
HMA compaction which is accepted by Statistical Evaluation will be based on acceptance testing performed by the Contracting Agency, and statistical analysis of those acceptance tests results. This will result in a Compaction Price Adjustment. 5-04.3(10)C1 HMA Compaction Statistical Evaluation – Lots and Sublots
HMA compaction which is accepted by Statistical Evaluation will be evaluated by the
Contracting Agency dividing the project into compaction lots, and each compaction lot will be evaluated using stratified random sampling by the Contracting Agency sub-dividing each compaction lot into compaction sublots. All mixture in any individual compaction lot shall be of the same mix design. The compaction sublots will be numbered in the order in which the mixture (of a particular mix design) is paved.
Except for the final compaction lot, each compaction lot comprises a maximum of 15 compaction sublots. The final compaction lot of each mix design on the Contract will comprises a maximum of 25 sublots. For contracts with a plan quantity less than 300 tons of statistically accepted HMA for compaction, the minimum number of compaction sublots shall be three.
Each compaction sublot shall be uniform in size as shown in Table 15, except that the last compaction sublot of each day may be increased to a maximum of two times the compaction sublot quantity calculated. Minor variations in the size of a sublot shall not be cause to invalidate the associated test result.

The following will cause one compaction lot to end prematurely and a new compaction lot to begin: • For a compaction lot in progress with a compaction CPF less than 0.75 using an LSL = 92.0, a new compaction lot will begin at the Contractor’s request after the Engineer is satisfied that material conforming to the Specifications can be produced. See also
Section 5-04.3(11)F.
All HMA which is paved on a bridge and accepted for compaction by Statistical Evaluation will compose a bridge compaction lot. If the contract includes such HMA on more than one bridge, compaction will be evaluated on each bridge individually, as separate bridge compaction lots.
Bridge compaction sublots will be determined by the Engineer subject to the following: • All sublots on a given bridge will be approximately the same size. • Sublots will be stratified from the lot. • In no case will there be less than 3 sublots in each bridge compaction lot. • No sublot will exceed 50 tons. • Compaction test locations will be determined by the Engineer in accordance with
WSDOT Test Method T 716.

Comply with Section 1-06.2(1).
The location of HMA compaction acceptance tests will be randomly selected by the
Contracting Agency from within each sublot, with one test per sublot. The Contracting
Agency will determine the random sample location using WSDOT Test Method T 716.
Use Table 16 to determine compaction acceptance test procedures and to allocate compaction acceptance sampling and testing responsibilities between the Contractor and the Contracting Agency. HMA cores shall be taken or nuclear density testing shall occur after completion of the finish rolling, prior to opening to traffic, and on the same day that the mix is placed.
When using the nuclear density gauge for acceptance testing of pavement density, the
Engineer will follow WSDOT SOP 730 for correlating the nuclear gauge with HMA cores.
When cores are required for the correlation, coring will be by the Contracting Agency unless the Contract includes the item "HMA Core - Roadway". Testing will be by the
Contracting Agency. When a core is taken for gauge correlation at the location of a sublot, the relative density of the core will be used for the sublot test result and is exempt from retesting. 5-04.3(10)C3 HMA Statistical Compaction – Price Adjustments
For each HMA compaction lot (that is accepted by Statistical Evaluation) which has less than three compaction sublots, for which all compaction sublots attain a minimum of 92 percent compaction determined in accordance with FOP for AASHTO T 355 (or
WSDOT SOP 736 when provided by the Contract), the HMA will be accepted at the unit
Contract price with no further evaluation.
For each HMA compaction lot (that is accepted by Statistical Evaluation) which does not meet the criteria in the preceding paragraph, the compaction lot shall be evaluated in accordance with Section 1-06.2(2)D4 to determine the appropriate Composite Pay
Factor (CPF). All of the test results obtained from the acceptance samples from a given compaction lot shall be evaluated collectively. Additional testing by either a nuclear density gauge or cores will be completed as required to provide a minimum of three tests for evaluation.
For the statistical analysis in Section 1-06.2, use the following values: x = percent compaction for each sublot

For a compaction sublot that has been tested with a nuclear density gauge that did not meet the minimum of 92.0 percent of the theoretical maximum density in a compaction lot with a CPF below 1.00 and thus subject to a price reduction or rejection, the
Contractor may request that a core, taken at the same location as the nuclear density test, be used for determination of the relative density of the compaction sublot. The relative density of the core will replace the relative density determined by the nuclear density gauge for the compaction sublot and will be used for calculation of the CPF and acceptance of HMA compaction lot. When cores are taken at the request of the
Contractor, they shall be requested by noon of the next workday after the test results for the compaction sublot have been provided or made available to the Contractor. Traffic control shall be provided by the Contractor as requested by the Engineer. Failure by the
Contractor to provide the requested traffic control will result in forfeiture of the request for retesting. When the CPF for the compaction lot based on the results of the cores is less than 1.00, the Contracting Agency will deduct the cost for the coring from monies due or that may become due the Contractor. When the Contracting Agency performs the core sampling, the Contracting Agency will deduct $200 per core from monies due. When the Contractor performs the core sampling, it will be at their expense and no payment will be made under the HMA Core item. In either case, the Contractor shall pay for the cost of the traffic control. 5-04.3(10)D
HMA Compaction – Visual Evaluation

Visual Evaluation will be the basis of acceptance for compaction of the Bid items “HMA for Pavement Repair Cl. ___ PG ___” and “HMA for Prelevelling Class___ PG___”. This HMA shall be thoroughly compacted to the satisfaction of the Engineer. HMA that is used to prelevel wheel ruts shall be compacted with a pneumatic tire roller. 5-04.3(10)E
HMA Compaction – Test Point Evaluation
When compaction acceptance is by Test Point Evaluation, compact HMA based on a test point evaluation of the compaction train. Perform the test point evaluation in accordance with instructions from the Engineer. The number of passes with an approved compaction train, required to attain the maximum test point density, shall be used on all subsequent paving. 5-04.3(10)F
HMA Compaction Acceptance – Notification of Acceptance Test Results
The obligations and responsibilities for notifying the Contractor of compaction acceptance test results are the same as for mixture acceptance test results. See Section 5-04.3(9)E. 5-04.3(11)

Rejection Without Testing (Mixture or Compaction)
The Engineer may, without sampling, reject all batches, loads, or sections of Roadway that appears defective. Material rejected before placement shall not be incorporated into the pavement.
No payment will be made for the rejected materials or the removal of the materials unless the Contractor requests the rejected material to be tested. If the Contractor requests testing, acceptance will be by Statistical Evaluation, and a minimum of three samples will be obtained and tested. When uncompacted material is required for testing but not available, the Engineer will determine random sample locations on the roadway in accordance with WSDOT Test Method T 716, take cores in accordance with WSDOT
SOP 734, and test the cores in accordance with WSDOT SOP 737.
If the CPF for the rejected material is less than 0.75, no payment will be made for the rejected material; in addition, the cost of sampling and testing shall be borne by the
Contractor. If the CPF is greater than or equal to 0.75, the cost of sampling and testing will be borne by the Contracting Agency. If the material is rejected before placement and the CPF is greater than or equal to 0.75, compensation for the rejected material will be at a CPF of 0.75. If rejection occurs after placement and the CPF is greater than or equal to 0.75, compensation for the rejected material will be at the calculated CPF with an addition of 25 percent of the unit Contract price added for the cost of removal and disposal. 5-04.3(11)D

Rejection – A Partial Sublot (Mixture or Compaction)
In addition to the random acceptance sampling and testing, the Engineer may also isolate from a mixture or compaction sublot material that is suspected of being defective in relative density, gradation or asphalt binder content. Such isolated material will not include an original sample location. The Contracting Agency will obtain a minimum of three random samples of the suspect material and perform the testing. When uncompacted material is required for testing but is not available, the Engineer will select random sample locations on the roadway in accordance with WSDOT Test Method
T 716, take cores samples in accordance with WSDOT SOP 734, and test the material in accordance with WSDOT SOP 737. The material will then be statistically evaluated as an independent lot in accordance with Section 1-06.2(2). 5-04.3(11)E
Rejection – An Entire Sublot (Mixture or Compaction)
An entire mixture or compaction sublot that is suspected of being defective may be rejected. When this occurs, a minimum of two additional random samples from this sublot will be obtained. When uncompacted material is required for the additional samples but the material has been compacted, the Contracting Agency will take and test cores from the roadway as described in Section 5-04.3(11)D. The additional samples and the original sublot will be evaluated as an independent lot in accordance with Section 1-06.2(2). 5-04.3(11)F
Rejection - A Lot in Progress (Mixture or Compaction)
The Contractor shall shut down operations and shall not resume HMA placement until such time as the Engineer is satisfied that material conforming to the Specifications can be produced when: 1. the Composite Pay Factor (CPF) of a mixture or compaction lot in progress drops below 1.00 and the Contractor is taking no corrective action, or 2. the Pay Factor (PFi) for any constituent of a mixture or compaction lot in progress drops below 0.95 and the Contractor is taking no corrective action, or 3. either the PFi for any constituent or the CPF of a mixture or compaction lot in progress is less than 0.75. 5-04.3(11)G

When compressive strengths fail to satisfy one or both of the above requirements, the
Contractor may request acceptance of in-place concrete strength based on core results.
This method will not be used if the Engineer determines coring would be harmful to the integrity of the Structure. Cores, if allowed, will be obtained by the Contractor in accordance with FOP for AASHTO T 24 and delivered to the Contracting Agency for testing in accordance with AASHTO T 22. If the concrete in the Structure will be dry under service conditions, the core will be air-dried at a temperature of between 60°F and 80°F and at a relative humidity of less than 60 percent for 7 days before testing, and will be tested air dry.
Acceptance for each sublot by the core method requires that the average compressive strength of three cores be at least 85 percent of the specified strength with no one core less than 75 percent of the specified strength. When the Contractor requests strength analysis by coring, the results obtained will be accepted by both parties as conclusive and supersede all other strength data for the concrete sublot.
If the Contractor elects to core, cores shall be obtained no later than 50 days after initial concrete placement. The Engineer will concur in the locations to be cored. Repair of cored areas shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. The cost incurred in coring and testing these cores, including repair of core locations, shall be borne by the Contractor. 5-05.3(5)

When mixed in a batching plant, the mixing time shall not be less than 50 seconds nor more than 90 seconds.
The mixer shall be operated at a drum speed as shown on the manufacturer’s nameplate on the mixer. Concrete mixed less than the specified time shall be discarded and disposed of by the Contractor at no expense to the Contracting Agency. The volume of concrete mixed per batch shall not exceed the mixer’s rated capacity, as shown on the manufacturer’s standard rating plate on the mixer.
Each concrete mixing machine shall be equipped with a device for counting automatically the number of batches mixed during the day’s operation.
Retempering concrete by adding water or by other means will not be permitted. 5-05.3(5)A
Limitations of Mixing
Concrete shall not be mixed, placed, or finished when the natural light is inadequate, as determined by the Engineer, unless an adequate and approved artificial lighting system is operated.
Mixing and placing concrete shall be discontinued when a descending air temperature in the shade away from artificial heat reaches 40ºF and shall not be resumed until an ascending air temperature in the shade and away from artificial heat reaches 35ºF unless authorized in writing by the Engineer.
When mixing and placing is authorized during cold weather, the aggregates may be heated by either steam or dry heat prior to being placed in the mixer. The apparatus used shall heat the mass uniformly and shall be arranged to preclude the possible occurrence of overheated areas which might injure the materials. Unless otherwise authorized, the temperature of the mixed concrete shall be not less than 50ºF and not more than 90ºF at the time of discharge into the hauling conveyance.

Placing, Spreading, and Compacting Concrete 5-05.3(7)A
Slip-Form Construction
The concrete shall be distributed uniformly into final position by a self-propelled slip-form paver without delay. The alignment and elevation of the paver shall be regulated from outside reference lines established for this purpose, or by an electronic control system capable of controlling the line and grade within required tolerances. The paver shall vibrate the concrete for the full width and depth of the strip of pavement being placed and the vibration shall be adequate to provide a consistency of concrete that will stand normal to the surface with sharp well-defined edges. The sliding forms shall be rigidly held together laterally to prevent spreading of the forms.
The plastic concrete shall be effectively consolidated by internal vibration with transverse vibrating units for the full width of pavement and/or a series of equally spaced longitudinal vibrating units. The space from the outer edge of the pavement to the outer longitudinal unit shall not exceed 9 inches. The spacing of internal units shall be uniform and not exceed 18 inches.
The term internal vibration means vibration by vibrating units located within the specified thickness of pavement section.
The rate of vibration of each vibrating unit shall be not less than 7,500 cycles per minute, and the amplitude of vibration shall be sufficient to be perceptible on the surface of the concrete along the entire length of the vibrating unit and for a distance of at least 1 foot.
The frequency of vibration or amplitude shall be varied proportionately with the rate of travel to result in a uniform density and air content. The paving machine shall be equipped with a tachometer or other suitable device for measuring and indicating the actual frequency of vibrations.
The concrete shall be held at a uniform consistency. The slip-form paver shall be operated with as nearly a continuous forward movement as possible and all operations of mixing, delivering, and spreading concrete shall be coordinated to provide uniform progress with stopping and starting of the paver held to a minimum. If, for any reason, it is necessary to stop the forward movement of the paver, the vibratory and tamping elements shall also be stopped immediately. No tractive force shall be applied to the machine, except that which is controlled from the machine.
When concrete is being placed adjacent to an existing pavement, that part of the equipment which is supported on the existing pavement shall be equipped with protective pads on crawler tracks or rubber-tired wheels on which the bearing surface is offset to run a sufficient distance from the edge of the pavement to avoid breaking the pavement edge.

Stationary Side Form Construction
Side form sections shall be straight, free from warps, bends, indentations, or other defects.
Defective forms shall be removed from the Work. Metal side forms shall be used unless other forms are approved by the Engineer.
Side forms may be built up by rigidly attaching a section to either top or bottom of forms.
If such buildup is attached to the top of metal forms, the buildup shall be of metal.
Side forms shall be of sufficient rigidity, both in the form and in the interlocking connection with adjoining forms, that springing will not occur under the weight of grading and paving equipment or from the pressure of concrete. The Contractor shall provide sufficient forms so that there will be no delay in placing the concrete due to lack of forms.
Before placing side forms, the underlying material shall be at the proper grade. Side forms shall be placed to the required grade and alignment of the edge of the finished pavement.
Wood wedges may be used to adjust the form elevation provided they do not extend into the concrete. The forms shall be firmly supported during the entire operation of placing, compacting, and finishing the pavement.
Forms shall be drilled in advance of being placed to line and grade to accommodate tie bars where these are specified.
Immediately in advance of placing concrete and after all Subgrade operations are completed, side forms shall be trued and maintained to the required line and grade for a distance sufficient to prevent delay in placing concrete.
Side forms shall remain in place at least 12 hours after the concrete has been placed, and in all cases until the edge of the pavement no longer requires the protection of the forms. Curing compound shall be applied to the concrete immediately after the forms are removed.
Side forms shall be thoroughly cleaned and oiled each time they are used and before concrete is placed against them.
Concrete shall be spread, screeded, shaped, and consolidated by one or more selfpropelled machines. These machines shall uniformly distribute and consolidate concrete without segregation so that completed pavement will conform to required cross section with a minimum of handwork.
The number and capacity of machines furnished shall be adequate to perform the Work required at a rate equal to that of concrete delivery.
Concrete for the full paving width shall be effectively consolidated by means of surface vibrators, in combination with internal vibrators, or by some other method of consolidation that produces equivalent results without segregation.
When vibrators are used to consolidate concrete, the rate of vibration shall be not less than 3,500 cycles per minute for surface vibrators and shall be not less than 7,000 cycles per minute for internal vibrators. Amplitude of vibration shall be sufficient to be perceptible on the surface of the concrete more than 1 foot from the vibrating element.
The Contractor shall furnish a tachometer or other suitable device for measuring and indicating frequency of vibration.
Power to vibrators shall be connected so that vibration ceases when forward or backward motion of the machine is stopped.

Cement Concrete Pavement

On projects requiring less than 1,000 square yards of cement concrete pavement, for irregular areas or areas not accessible to slip-form pavers, the surface finish may be either longitudinal tined or transverse tined.
Transverse tining shall be done by texturing with a wire comb perpendicular to the centerline of the pavement. The wire comb tines shall be rectangular in cross section, 3/32 to 1/8 inch wide, on ½-inch centers ± 1/8 inch, and of sufficient length, thickness, and resilience to form grooves approximately 1/8 inch deep in the fresh concrete surface.
Final texture shall be uniform in appearance with substantially all of the grooves having a depth between 1/16 to 3/16 inch. Finishing shall take place with the elements of the wire comb as nearly perpendicular to the concrete surface as is practical, to eliminate dragging the mortar.
If the tining equipment has not been previously approved, a test section shall be constructed prior to approval of the equipment.
Regardless of the surface finish, if the pavement has a raised curb without a formed concrete gutter, the texturing shall end 2 feet from the curb line. 5-05.3(11)B
Cement Concrete Pavement Grinding Finish
The entire pavement surface shall be ground to produce a uniform corduroy like texture.
The final surface shall comply with Section 5-01.3(9)A.
Cement Concrete Pavement receiving a ground surface finish shall not be open to traffic until grinding is complete. 5-05.3(12)
Surface Smoothness

Pavement surface smoothness for this project will include International Roughness Index (IRI) testing. The Contractor shall perform IRI testing on each through lane, climbing lane, and passing lane, greater than 0.25 mile in length and these lanes will be subject to incentive/disincentive adjustments. Ride quality will be evaluated using the Mean
Roughness Index (MRI) calculated by averaging the IRI data for the left and right wheel path within the section.
Ramps, shoulders and tapers will not be included in MRI testing for pavement smoothness and will not be subject to incentive adjustments. All Work is subject to parallel and transverse 10-foot straightedge requirements, corrective work and disincentive adjustments.
Operate the inertial profiler in accordance with AASHTO R 57. Collect two longitudinal traces, one in each wheel path. Collect profile data after completion of all concrete paving on the project in a continuous pass including areas excluded from pay adjustments.
Provide notice to the Engineer a minimum of seven calendar days prior to testing.
Within 30 calendar days after the Contractor’s testing, the Engineer may perform verification testing. If the verification testing shows a difference in MRI greater than the percentages shown in Table 2 of AASHTO R 54 the following resolution process will be followed: 1.
The profiles, equipment and procedures will be evaluated to determine the cause of the difference. 2.
If the cause of the discrepancy cannot be resolved the pavement shall be retested with both profilers at a mutually agreed time. The two profilers will test the section within 30 minutes of each other. If the retest shows a difference in MRI equal or greater than the percentages shown in Table 2 of AASHTO R 54 the Engineer’s test results will be used to establish pay adjustments.

Surface smoothness of travel lanes not subject to MRI testing will be measured with a 10-foot straightedge no later than 5:00 p.m. of the day following the placing of the concrete. The completed surface of the wearing course shall not vary more than 1/8 inch from the lower edge of a 10-foot straightedge placed on the surface parallel to the centerline.
Smoothness perpendicular to the centerline will be measured with a 10-foot straightedge across all lanes with the same cross slope, including shoulders when composed of cement concrete pavement. The overlapping 10-foot straightedge measurement shall be discontinued at a point 6 inches from the most extreme outside edge of the finished cement concrete pavement. The completed surface of the wearing course shall not vary more than ¼ inch from the lower edge of a 10-foot straightedge placed on the surface perpendicular to the centerline. Deviations in excess of the above tolerances shall be corrected.
The Contractor shall evaluate profiles for acceptance, incentive payments, disincentive payments, or corrective action using the current version of ProVAL and provide the results including the profile data in unfiltered electronic Engineering Research Division (ERD) file format to the Engineer within 2 calendar days of completing testing each section of pavement. If the profile data files are created using an export option in the manufacturer’s software where filter settings can be specified, use the filter settings that were used to create data files for certification. Analyze the entire profile omitting the following: 1.
Areas specifically identified in the Contract. 2.
The first 100 feet after the start of the paving operations. 3.
The last 100 feet prior to the end of the paving operation. 4.
The first 100 feet on each side of bridge Structures and bridge approach slabs.

Corrective work for pavement smoothness may be taken by the Contractor prior to
MRI testing. After completion of the MRI testing the Contractor shall measure the smoothness of each 52.8-foot section with an MRI greater than 125 inches per mile with a 10-foot straightedge within 14 calendar days or as allowed by the Engineer. The
Contractor shall identify all locations that require corrective work and provide the straight edge measurements at each location that exceeds the allowable limit to the Engineer.
If all measurements in a 52.8-foot section comply with smoothness requirements, the
Contractor shall provide the maximum measurement to the Engineer and a statement that corrective work is not required. Unless allowed by the Engineer, corrective work shall be taken by the Contractor for pavement identified by the Contractor or Engineer that does not meet the following requirements: 1.

The completed surface shall be of uniform texture, smooth, uniform as to crown and grade, and free from defects of all kinds. 2.
The completed surface shall not vary more than ⅛ inch from the lower edge of a 10-foot straightedge placed on the surface parallel to the centerline. 3.
The completed surface shall vary not more than ¼ inch in 10 feet from the rate of transverse slope shown in the Plans.

For repairs following MRI testing the repaired area shall be checked by the Contractor with a 10-foot straightedge to ensure it no longer requires corrective work. With concurrence of the Engineer an inertial profiler may be used in place of the 10-foot straight edge.
If correction of the roadway as listed above either will not or does not produce satisfactory results as to smoothness or serviceability the Engineer may accept the completed pavement and a credit will be calculated in accordance with Section 5-05.5.
The credit will be in addition to the price adjustment for MRI. Under these circumstances, the decision whether to accept the completed pavement or to require corrective work as described above shall be vested entirely in the Engineer. 5-05.3(13)
Curing
Immediately after the finishing operations have been completed and as soon as marring of the concrete will not occur, the entire surface of the newly placed concrete shall be cured in accordance with one of the following methods the Contractor may elect. 5-05.3(13)A
Curing Compound
Liquid membrane-forming concrete curing compound Type 2 meeting the requirements of
Section 9-23.2 shall be applied to the entire area of the exposed surface of the concrete with an approved mechanical spray machine. The spray fog shall be protected from the wind with an adequate shield. It shall be applied uniformly at the rate of one gallon to not more than 150-square feet.
The compound shall be applied with equipment of the pressure tank or pump type equipped with a feed tank agitator which ensures continuous agitation of the compound during spraying operations. The nozzle shall be of the two-line type with sufficient air to properly atomize the compound.
The curing compound shall not be applied during or immediately after rainfall. If it becomes necessary to leave the pavement uncoated overnight, it shall be covered with polyethylene sheeting, which shall remain in place until weather conditions are favorable for the application of the curing compound.
In the event that rain falls on the newly coated pavement before the film has dried sufficiently to resist damage, or in the event of damage to the film from any cause, the
Contractor shall apply a new coat of curing compound in one or two applications to the affected area at the rate which, in the opinion of the Engineer, will result in a film of curing value equal to that specified in the original coat.

Page 5-68
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Cement Concrete Pavement 5-05
Before placing the curing compound in the spray tank, it shall be thoroughly agitated as recommended by the Manufacturer. The compound shall not be diluted by the addition of solvents nor be altered in any manner. If the compound has become chilled to the extent that it is too viscous for proper stirring or application or if portions of the vehicle have been precipitated from solution, it shall be heated to restore proper fluidity but it shall not be heated above 100ºF. All curing compound shall have approval prior to placing in the spray tanks.
The curing compound shall be applied immediately after the concrete has been finished and after bleed water that has collected on the surface has disappeared, or at a time designated by the Engineer. If hair checking develops in the pavement before finishing is completed, the Engineer may order the application of the curing compound at an earlier stage, in which event any concrete cut from the surface in finishing operations shall be removed entirely from the pavement. If additional mortar is then needed to fill torn areas, it shall be obtained ahead of the spraying operations. All areas cut by finishing tools subsequent to the application of the curing compound shall immediately be given new applications at the rate specified above.
The curing compound, after application, shall be protected by the Contractor from injury until the pavement has reached a minimum compressive strength of 2,500 psi.
All traffic, either by foot or otherwise, shall be considered as injurious to the film of the applied compound.
The Contractor shall provide on the job a sufficient quantity of white polyethylene sheeting to cover all the pavement laid in 3 hours of maximum operation. This sheeting shall be reserved exclusively for the protection of the pavement in case of rain or breakdown of the spray equipment used for applying the curing compound. The protective sheeting shall be placed over the pavement when ordered, and in the manner specified by the Engineer.
Areas from which it is impossible to exclude traffic shall be protected by a covering of sand or earth not less than 1 foot in thickness or by other suitable and effective means.
The protective covering shall be placed no earlier than 24 hours after application of the compound.
The Contractor shall assume all liabilities for and protect the Contracting Agency from any damages or claims arising from the use of materials or processes described herein. 5-05.3(13)B

White Polyethylene Sheeting
The sheeting shall be placed over the pavement immediately after finishing operations are completed, or at a time designated by the Engineer.
The sheeting shall be laid so that individual sheets overlap at least 2 feet, and the lapped areas shall be held in close contact with the pavement by weighting with earth or boards to prevent movement by the wind. The sheeting shall extend downward to cover the edges of the pavement and shall be secured to the Subgrade with a continuous bank of earth or surfacing material. All holes occurring in the sheeting shall be patched. The sheeting shall be maintained against injury and remain in place until the pavement has reached a minimum compressive strength of 2,500 psi. 5-05.3(13)C
Wet Curing
Wet curing shall be accomplished by applying a continuous fog or mist spray to the entire pavement surface until it has reached a minimum compressive strength of 2,500 psi. If water runoff is not a concern, continuous sprinkling is acceptable. Sprinkling shall not begin until the concrete has achieved initial set as determined by AASHTO T 197 or other approved method.

Qualification of Concrete Suppliers
Batch Plant Prequalification requires a certification by the National Ready Mix Concrete
Association (NRMCA). Information concerning NRMCA certification may be obtained from the NRMCA at 900 Spring Street, Silver Springs, MD 20910 or online at www. nrmca.org. The NRMCA certification shall be valid for a 2-year period from the date of certificate. The following documentation shall be submitted to the Engineer; a copy of the current NRMCA Certificate of Conformance, the concrete mix design(s) (WSDOT
Form 350-040), along with copies of the truck list, batch plant scale certification, admixture dispensing certification, and volumetric water batching devices (including water meters) verification.
For central-mixed concrete, the mixer shall be equipped with a timer that prevents the batch from discharging until the batch has been mixed for the prescribed mixing time. A mixing time of 1 minute will be required after all materials and water have been introduced into the drum. Shorter mixing time may be allowed if the mixer performance is tested in accordance with (AASHTO M157 Annex A1 Concrete Uniformity Requirements).
Tests shall be conducted by an independent testing lab or by a commercial concrete producer’s lab. If the tests are performed by a producer’s lab, the Engineer or a representative will witness all testing.
For shrink-mixed concrete, the mixing time in the stationary mixer shall not be less than
30 seconds or until the ingredients have been thoroughly blended.
For transit-mixed or shrink-mixed concrete, the mixing time in the transit mixer shall be a minimum of 70 revolutions at the mixing speed designated by the manufacturer of the mixer. Following mixing, the concrete in the transit mixer may be agitated at the manufacturer’s designated agitation speed. A maximum of 320 revolutions (total of mixing and agitation) will be permitted prior to discharge.
All transit-mixers shall be equipped with an operational revolution counter and a functional device for measurement of water added. All mixing drums shall be free of concrete buildup and the mixing blades shall meet the minimum Specifications of the drum manufacturer. A copy of the manufacturer’s blade dimensions and configuration shall be on file at the concrete producer’s office. A clearly visible metal data plate (or plates) attached to each mixer and agitator shall display: (1) the maximum concrete capacity of the drum or container for mixing and agitating, and (2) the rotation speed of the drum or blades for both the agitation and mixing speeds. Mixers and agitators shall always operate within the capacity and speed-of-rotation limits set by the manufacturer.
Mixers, when fully loaded, shall keep the concrete uniformly mixed. All mixers and agitators shall be capable of discharging the concrete at a steady rate. Only those transitmixers which meet the above requirements will be allowed to deliver concrete to a
Contracting Agency project covered by these Specifications.
In transit-mixing, mixing shall begin within 30 seconds after the cement is added to the aggregates.
Central-mixed concrete, transported by truck mixer/agitator, shall not undergo more than
250 revolutions of the drum or blades before beginning discharging. To remain below this limit, the suppler may agitate the concrete intermittently within the prescribed time limit. When water or admixtures are added after the load is initially mixed, an additional
30 revolutions will be required at the recommended mixing speed.

Concrete Structures examination reveals a problem, or if the Engineer wishes to test the quality of the concrete, slump tests may be performed with samples taken at approximately the ¼ and ¾ points as the batch is discharged. The maximum allowable slump difference shall be as follows:
If the average of the two slump tests is < 4 inches, the difference shall be < 1 inch or if the average of the two slump tests is >4 inches, the difference shall be < 1½ inches.
If the slump difference exceeds these limits, the equipment shall not be used until the faulty condition is corrected. However, the equipment may continue in use if longer mixing times or smaller loads produce batches that pass the slump uniformity tests.
All concrete production facilities will be subject to verification inspections at the discretion of the Engineer. Verification inspections are a check for: current scale certifications; accuracy of water metering devices; accuracy of the batching process; and verification of coarse aggregate quality.
If the concrete producer fails to pass the verification inspection, the following actions will be taken: 1.
For the first violation, a written warning will be provided. 2.
For the second violation, the Engineer will give written notification and the
Contracting Agency will assess a price reduction equal to 15 percent of the invoice cost of the concrete that is supplied from the time of the infraction until the deficient condition is corrected.

3.
For the third violation, the concrete supplier is suspended from providing concrete until all such deficiencies causing the violation have been permanently corrected and the plant and equipment have been reinspected and meets all the prequalification requirements. 4.
For the fourth violation, the concrete supplier shall be disqualified from supplying concrete for 1 year from the date of disqualification. At the end of the suspension period the concrete supplier may request that the facilities be inspected for prequalification. 6-02.3(4)B

A sublot is defined as the material represented by an individual strength test. An individual strength test is the average compressive strength of cylinders from the same sample of material.
Each sublot will be deemed to have met the specified compressive strength requirement when both of the following conditions are met: 1.
Individual strength tests do not fall below the specified strength by more than 12½ percent or 500 psi, whichever is least. 2.
An individual strength test averaged with the two preceding individual strength tests meets or exceeds specified strength (for the same class and exact mix I.D. of concrete on the same Contract).
When compressive strengths fail to satisfy one or both of the above requirements, the
Contractor may: 1. 2.
Request acceptance based on the Contractor/Suppliers strength test data for cylinders made from the same truckload of concrete as the Contracting Agency cylinders; provided: a.

The Contractor’s test results are obtained from testing cylinders fabricated, handled, and stored for 28 days in accordance with FOP for AASHTO R 100 and tested in accordance with AASHTO T 22. The test cylinders shall be the same size cylinders as those cast by the Contracting Agency. b.
The technician fabricating the cylinders is qualified by either ACI, Grade 1 or
WAQTC to perform this Work. c.
The Laboratory performing the tests in accordance with AASHTO T 22 has an equipment calibration/certification system, and a technician training and evaluation process in accordance with AASHTO R-18. d.
Both the Contractor and Contracting Agency have at least 15 test results from the same mix to compare. The Contractor’s results could be used if the
Contractor’s computed average of all their test results is within one standard deviation of the Contracting Agency’s average test result. The computed standard deviation of the Contractor’s results must also be within plus or minus 200 psi of the Contracting Agency’s standard deviation.
Request acceptance of in-place concrete strength based on core results. This method will not be used if the Engineer determines coring would be harmful to the integrity of the Structure. Cores, if allowed, will be obtained by the Contractor in accordance with
AASHTO T 24 and delivered to the Contracting Agency for testing in accordance with
AASHTO T 22. If the concrete in the Structure will be dry under service conditions, the core will be air dried at a temperature of between 60°F and 80°F and at a relative humidity of less than 60 percent for 7 days before testing, and will be tested air dry.
Acceptance for each sublot by the core method requires that the average compressive strength of three cores be at least 85 percent of the specified strength with no one core less than 75 percent of the specified strength. When the Contractor requests strength analysis by coring, the results obtained will be accepted by both parties as conclusive and supersede all other strength data for the concrete sublot.
If the Contractor elects to core, cores shall be obtained no later than 50 days after initial concrete placement. The Engineer will concur in the locations to be cored. Repair of cored areas shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. The cost incurred in coring and testing these cores, including repair of core locations, shall be borne by the Contractor.

Placing Concrete
The Contractor shall not place concrete: 1.
On frozen or ice-coated ground or Subgrade; 2.
Against or on ice-coated forms, reinforcing steel, structural steel, conduits, precast members, or construction joints; 3.
Under rainy conditions; placing of concrete shall be stopped before the quantity of surface water is sufficient to affect or damage surface mortar quality or cause a flow or wash the concrete surface; 4.
In a foundation until the Engineer has accepted its depth and characteristics; 5.
Until the Engineer has accepted the form and the placement of installed reinforcing; or 6.
In a Work area when vibrations from nearby Work may harm the concrete’s initial set or strength.
When a foundation excavation contains water, the Contractor shall pump it dry before placing concrete. If this is impossible, an underwater concrete seal shall be placed that complies with Section 6-02.3(6)B. This seal shall be thick enough to resist uplift.
All foundations, forms, and contacting concrete surfaces shall be moistened with water just before the concrete is placed. Standing water on the foundation, concrete surface, or forms shall be removed.
The Contractor shall place concrete in the forms as soon as possible after mixing. The concrete shall always be plastic and workable. For this reason, the Engineer may reduce the time to discharge even further. Concrete placement shall be continuous, with no interruption longer than 30 minutes between adjoining layers unless the Engineer allows a longer time. The Type 2 Working Drawing submittal shall include justification that the concrete mix design will remain fluid for interruptions longer than 30 minutes between placements. Each layer shall be placed and consolidated before the preceding layer takes initial set. After initial set, the forms shall not be jarred, and projecting ends of reinforcing bars shall not be disturbed.
In girders or walls, concrete shall be placed in continuous, horizontal layers 1½ to 2½ feet deep. Compaction shall leave no line of separation between layers. In each part of a form, the concrete shall be deposited as near its final position as possible.
Methods for placing and consolidating concrete shall not segregate aggregates or displace reinforcing steel. Methods shall leave a compact, dense, and impervious concrete with smooth faces on exposed surfaces. Plastering is not permitted. Defective concrete shall be removed at the Contractor’s expense.

Concrete Structures
To prevent aggregates from separating, the conveyor belt used to transport concrete shall not exceed 300 feet in length. If the mix needs protection from sun or rain, the Contractor shall cover the belt. When concrete pumps are used for placement, a Contractor’s representative shall, prior to use on the first placement of each day, visually inspect the pumps water chamber for water leakage. No pump shall be used that allows free water to flow past the piston.
If a concrete pump is used as the placing system, the pump priming slurry shall be discarded before placement. Initial acceptance testing may be delayed until the pump priming slurry has been eliminated from the concrete being pumped. Eliminating the priming slurry from the concrete may require that several cubic yards of concrete are discharged through the pumping system and discarded. Use of a concrete pump requires a reserve pump (or other backup equipment) at the site.
If the concrete will drop more than 5 feet, it shall be deposited through a sheet metal (or other accepted) conduit. If the form slopes, the concrete shall be lowered through accepted conduit to keep it from sliding down one side of the form. No aluminum conduits or tremies shall be used to pump or place concrete. If aluminum concrete truck end chutes are used, concrete shall be continuously discharged in a manner that minimizes contact time between the concrete and the chute.
Before placing bridge deck concrete on steel spans, the Contractor shall release the falsework under the bridge and let the span swing free on its supports. Concrete in flat slab bridges shall be placed in one continuous operation for each span or series of continuous spans.
Concrete for bridge decks and the stems of T-beams or box-girders shall be placed in separate operations if the stem of the beam or girder is more than 3 feet deep. First the beam or girder stem shall be filled to the bottom of the slab fillets. Bridge deck concrete shall not be placed until enough time has passed to permit the earlier concrete to shrink (at least 12 hours). If stem depth is 3 feet or less, the Contractor may place concrete in
1 continuous operation if the Engineer concurs.
Between expansion or construction joints, concrete in beams, girders, bridge decks, piers, columns, walls, and traffic and pedestrian barriers shall be placed in a continuous operation.
After the concrete has been consolidated and prior to the application of cure, all surfaces of concrete that are not placed against forms shall be struck off to the planned elevation or slope and the surface shall be finished by floating with a float to seal the surface.
No traffic or pedestrian barrier shall be placed until after the bridge deck is complete for the entire Structure. No concrete barriers shall be placed until the falsework has been released and the span supports itself. The Contractor may choose not to release the deck overhang falsework prior to the barrier placement. The Contractor shall submit a Type 2E
Working Drawing consisting of calculations indicating the loads induced into the girder webs due to the barrier weight and all live loads placed on the Structure do not exceed the design capacity of the girder component. This analysis is not required for bridges with concrete Superstructures. No barrier, curb, or sidewalk shall be placed on steel or prestressed concrete girder bridges until the bridge deck reaches a compressive strength of at least 3,000 psi.
The Contractor may construct traffic and pedestrian barriers by the slipform method.
However, the barrier may not deviate more than ¼ inch when measured by a 10-foot straightedge held longitudinally on the front face, back face, and top surface. Electrical conduit within the barrier shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of
Section 8-20.3(5).
When placing concrete in arch rings, the Contractor shall ensure that the load on the falsework remains symmetrical and uniform.

Weather and Temperature Limits to Protect Concrete 6-02.3(6)A1
Hot Weather Protection
The Contractor shall provide concrete within the specified temperature limits. Cooling of the coarse aggregate piles by sprinkling with water is permitted provided the moisture content is monitored, the mixing water is adjusted for the free water in the aggregate and the coarse aggregate is removed from at least 1 foot above the bottom of the pile.
Sprinkling of fine aggregate piles with water is not allowed. Refrigerating mixing water, or replacing all or part of the mixing water with crushed ice is permitted, provided the ice is completely melted by placing time.
If air temperature exceeds 90°F, the Contractor shall use water spray or other accepted methods to cool all concrete-contact surfaces to less than 90°F. These surfaces include forms, reinforcing steel, steel beam flanges, and any others that touch the concrete. 6-02.3(6)A2
Cold Weather Protection
Concrete shall be maintained at or above a temperature of 40°F during the first seven days of the Cold Weather Protection Period and at or above a temperature of 35°F during the remainder of the Cold Weather Protection Period. Cold weather protection requirements do not apply to concrete in shafts and piles placed below the ground line.
Prior to placing concrete in cold weather, the Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working
Drawing with a written procedure for cold weather concreting. The procedure shall detail how the Contractor will adequately cure the concrete and prevent the concrete temperature from falling below the minimum temperature. Extra protection shall be provided for areas especially vulnerable to freezing (such as exposed top surfaces, corners and edges, thin sections, and concrete placed into steel forms). Concrete placement will only be allowed if the Contractor’s cold weather protection plan has been accepted by the Engineer.
Prior to concrete placement, the Contractor shall review the 7-day temperature predictions for the job site from the Western Region Headquarters of the National
Weather Service (www.wrh.noaa.gov). When temperatures below 35°F are predicted, the
Contractor shall: 1.

Install temperature sensors in each concrete placement. One sensor shall be installed for every 100 cubic yards of concrete placed. Sensors shall be installed at locations directed by the Engineer, and shall be placed 1.5 inches from the face of concrete. 2.
Immediately after concrete placement, temperature sensors shall be installed on the concrete surface at locations directed by the Engineer. One sensor shall be installed for every 100 cubic yards of concrete placed.
Temperatures shall be measured and recorded a minimum of every hour for the duration of the Cold Weather Protection Period. Temperature data shall be submitted to the
Engineer as a Type 1 Working Drawing within three days following the end of the Cold
Weather Protection Period.
For each day that the concrete temperature falls below 40°F during the first seven days of the Cold Weather Protection Period, no curing time is awarded for that day and the Cold
Weather Protection Period is extended for one additional day. If the concrete temperature falls below 35°F during the Cold Weather Protection Period, the concrete may be rejected by the Engineer.

Placing Concrete in Foundation Seals
If the Plans require a concrete seal, the Contractor shall place the concrete underwater inside a watertight cofferdam, tube, or caisson. Seal concrete shall be placed in a compact mass in still water. It shall remain undisturbed and in still water until fully set. While seal concrete is being deposited, the water elevation inside and outside the cofferdam shall remain equal to prevent any flow through the seal in either direction. The cofferdam shall be vented at the vent elevation shown in the Plans. The thickness of the seal is based upon this vent elevation.
The seal shall be at least 18 inches thick unless the Plans show otherwise. The Engineer may change the seal thickness during construction which may require redesign of the footing and the pier shaft or column. Although seal thickness changes may result in the use of more or less concrete, reinforcing steel, and excavation, payment will remain as originally defined in unit Contract prices.
To place seal concrete underwater, the Contractor shall use a concrete pump or tremie.
The tremie shall have a hopper at the top that empties into a watertight tube at least
10 inches in diameter. The discharge end of the tube on the tremie or concrete pump shall include a device to seal out water while the tube is first filled with concrete. Tube supports shall permit the discharge end to move freely across the entire Work area and to drop rapidly to slow or stop the flow. One tremie may be used to concrete an area up to
18 feet per side. Each additional area of this size requires one additional tremie.
Throughout the underwater concrete placement operation, the discharge end of the tube shall remain submerged in the concrete and the tube shall always contain enough concrete to prevent water from entering. The concrete placement shall be continuous until the Work is completed, resulting in a seamless, uniform seal. If the concreting operation is interrupted, the Engineer may require the Contractor to prove by core drilling or other tests that the seal contains no voids or horizontal joints. If testing reveals voids or joints, the Contractor shall repair them or replace the seal at no expense to the
Contracting Agency. requirements of Section 6-02.3(4)C. 6-02.3(6)C

Dewatering Concrete Seals and Foundations
After a concrete seal is constructed, the Contractor shall pump the water out of the cofferdam and place the rest of the concrete in the dry. This pumping shall not begin until the seal has set enough to withstand the hydrostatic pressure (3 days for gravity seals and 10 days for seals containing piling or shafts). The Engineer may extend these waiting periods to ensure structural safety or to meet a condition of the operating permit.
If weighted cribs are used to resist hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of the seal, the
Contractor shall anchor them to the foundation seal. Any method used (such as dowels or keys) shall transfer the entire weight of the crib to the seal.
No pumping shall be done during or for 24 hours after concrete placement unless done from a suitable sump separated from the concrete Work by a watertight wall. Pumping shall be done in a way that rules out any chance of concrete being carried away. 6-02.3(6)D
Protection Against Vibration
Freshly placed concrete shall not be subjected to excessive vibration and shock waves during the curing period until it has reached a 2,000 psi minimum compressive strength for structural concrete and lower-strength classes of concrete.
After the first 5 hours from the time the concrete has been placed and consolidated, the
Contractor shall keep all vibration producing operations at a safe horizontal distance from the freshly placed concrete by following either the prescriptive safe distance method or the monitoring safe distance method. These requirements for the protection of freshly

After the concrete has reached a minimum compressive strength specified above, the safe horizontal distance restrictions would no longer apply. 6-02.3(6)D2
Monitoring Safe Distance Method
The Contractor may monitor the vibration producing operations in order to decrease the safe horizontal distance requirements of the prescriptive safe distance method. If this method is chosen, all construction operations that produce vibration or shock waves in the vicinity of freshly placed concrete shall be monitored by the Contractor with monitoring equipment sensitive enough to detect a minimum peak particle velocity (PPV) of 0.10 inches per second. Monitoring devices shall be placed on or adjacent to the freshly placed concrete when the measurements are taken. During the time subsequent to the concrete placement, the Contractor shall cease all vibration or shock producing operations in the vicinity of the newly placed concrete when the monitoring equipment detects excessive vibration and shock waves defined as exceeding the following PPVs:

Curing requirements of Section 6-02.3(9)C shall be maintained until 70% of the specified design strength is achieved.
Forms may be steel or plywood faced, providing they impart the required finish to the concrete. 6-02.3(9)C
Curing

Concrete in the precast units shall be cured by either moist or accelerated curing methods. The curing methods to be used by a manufacturing facility shall be preapproved in the WSDOT plant certification process. The methods to be used when cast on-site shall be as accepted in the On-site Pre-casting and Quality Control Plan. 1.
For moist curing, the surface of the concrete shall be kept covered or moist until such time as the compressive strength of the concrete reaches 70% of the specified design strength. Exposed surfaces shall be kept continually moist by fogging, spraying, or covering with moist burlap or cotton mats. Moist curing shall commence as soon as possible following completion of surface finishing. 2.
For accelerated curing, heat shall be applied at a controlled rate following the initial set of concrete in combination with an effective method of supplying or retaining moisture. Moisture may be applied by a cover of moist burlap, cotton matting, or other effective means. Moisture may be retained by covering the unit with an impermeable sheet.
Heat may be radiant, convection, conducted steam or hot air. Heat the concrete to no more than 100°F during the first 2 hours after placing the concrete, and then increase no more than 25°F per hour to a maximum of 175°F. After curing is complete, cool the concrete no more than 25°F per hour to 100°F. Maintain the concrete temperature above 60°F until the unit reaches stripping strength.
Concrete temperature shall be monitored by means of a thermocouple embedded in the concrete (linked with a thermometer accurate to plus or minus 5°F). The recording sensor (accurate to plus or minus 5°F) shall be arranged and calibrated to continuously record, date, and identify concrete temperature throughout the heating cycle. This temperature record shall be made available to the Engineer for inspection and become a part of the documentation required.
The Contractor shall never allow dry heat to directly touch exposed unit surfaces at any point. 6-02.3(9)D
Control Strength
The concrete strength at stripping and the verification of design strength shall be determined by testing cylinders made from the same concrete as the precast units.
The cylinders shall be made, handled, and stored in accordance with WSDOT FOP for
AASHTO R 100 and compression tested in accordance with AASHTO T 22 and AASHTO
T 231.
For accelerated cured units, concrete strength shall be measured on test cylinders cast from the same concrete as that in the unit. These cylinders shall be cured under timetemperature relationships and conditions that simulate those of the unit. If the forms are heated by steam or hot air, test cylinders will remain in the coolest zone throughout curing. If forms are heated another way, the Contractor shall provide a record of the curing time- temperature relationship for the cylinders for each unit to the Engineer.

The Contractor shall conduct the demonstration using the same type of equipment to be used for the production bridge decks, except that the Contractor may elect to finish the test slab with a hand-operated strike-board.
After the construction of the test slab and the demonstration of bridge deck construction operations is complete, the Contractor shall remove and dispose of the test slab in accordance with Sections 2-02.3 and 2-03.3(7)C. 6-02.3(10)D2 Preparation for Concrete Placement
Before placing bridge approach slab concrete, the subgrade shall be constructed in accordance with Sections 2-06 and 5-05.3(6).
Before concrete is placed, the finishing machine shall be operated over the entire length of the deck/slab to check screed deflection. Concrete placement may begin only if the
Engineer accepts after this test.
Immediately before placing concrete, the Contractor shall check (and adjust if necessary) all falsework and wedges to minimize settlement and deflection from the added mass of the concrete deck/slab. The Contractor shall also install devices, such as telltales, by which the Engineer can readily measure settlement and deflection. 6-02.3(10)D3 Concrete Placement
The placement operation shall cover the full width of the bridge deck or the full width between construction joints. The Contractor shall locate all construction joints over a beam or web that can support the deck/slab on each side of the joint. The joint shall not occur over a pier unless the Plans permit.

Not revibrate the concrete surface areas where workers have stopped prior to screeding; 5.
Remove concrete, if any, splashed onto reinforcing steel in adjacent segments before concreting them;

6.
Maintain a slight excess of concrete in front of the screed across the entire width of the placement operation. The Contractor shall coordinate the rate of placement such that the concrete is placed, consolidated, and struck off within 30 minutes from the time of placement, unless otherwise accepted by the Engineer at the pre-deck pour meeting; 7.
Operate the finishing machine to create a surface that is true and ready for final finish without overfinishing or bringing excessive amounts of mortar to the surface; and 8.
Leave a thin, even film of mortar on the concrete surface after the last pass of the finishing machine pan.
Workers shall complete all post screeding operations without walking on the concrete.
This may require work bridges spanning the full width of the deck/slab.
After removing the screed supports, the Contractor shall fill the voids with concrete (not mortar).
If the surface left by the finishing machine is porous, rough, or has minor irregularities, the Contractor shall float the surface of the concrete. Floating shall leave a smooth and even surface. Float finishing shall be kept to the minimum number of passes necessary to seal the surface. The floats shall be at least 4-feet long. Each transverse pass of the float shall overlap the previous pass by at least half the length of the float. The first floating shall be at right angles to the strike-off. The second floating shall be at right angles to the centerline of the span. A smooth riding surface shall be maintained across construction joints.

After floating, but while the concrete remains plastic, the Contractor shall test the entire deck/slab for flatness (allowing for crown, camber, and vertical curvature). The testing shall be done with a 10-foot straightedge held on the surface. The straightedge shall be advanced in successive positions parallel to the centerline, moving not more than one half the length of the straightedge each time it advances. This procedure shall be repeated with the straightedge held perpendicular to the centerline. An acceptable surface shall be one free from deviations of more than ⅛-inch under the 10-foot straightedge.
If the test reveals depressions, the Contractor shall fill them with freshly mixed concrete, strike off, consolidate, and refinish them. High areas shall be cut down and refinished.
Retesting and refinishing shall continue until a surface conforming to the requirements specified above is produced.

The nominal stress ranges, ∆f, at all fatigue critical details shall be obtained from a structural analysis of the expansion joint system applying the design vertical and horizontal load ranges specified in Section 6-02.3(13)C4 and distributed as specified in Section 6-02.3(13)C5. The expansion joint system shall be analyzed with a minimum gap opening corresponding to the midrange configuration (at least half of the maximum gap opening).

M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02
For each detail under consideration, the wheel loads shall be positioned transversely on a centerbeam to achieve the maximum nominal stress range at that detail. The vertical and horizontal wheel loads shall be applied as line loads to the top of the centerbeams at their centerlines. The design stress range in the centerbeam-to-support bar connection shall be calculated as specified below. The design nominal stress ranges, ∆f, multiplied by the appropriate load factors in Table 3.4.1-1 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design
Specifications, shall be used for fatigue design as specified at the end of this subsection. 6-02.3(13)C7 Welded or Bolted Single-Support-Bar Systems
The nominal stress range, ∆f, in the centerbeam at a welded or bolted stirrup shall be the sum of the longitudinal bending stress ranges at the critical section resulting from vertical and horizontal loading. The effects of stresses in any load-bearing attachments such as the stirrup or yoke shall not be considered when calculating the longitudinal stress range in the centerbeam. For bolted single-support-bar systems, stress ranges shall be calculated using the net section.
The nominal stress range, ∆f, in the stirrup or yoke shall be calculated without considering the effects of stresses in the centerbeam. The stress range shall be calculated by assuming a load range in the stirrup equal to 30% of the total vertical reaction force between the centerbeam and the support bar. The effects of horizontal loads may be neglected in the design of the stirrup. 6-02.3(13)C8 Welded Multiple-Support-Bar Systems
Three locations have been identified as initiation sites for fatigue cracking at a centerbeam-to-support bar welded connection. The types of cracking associated with these three locations are described below. The corresponding equations may be used to calculate the nominal stress range, ∆f. For the support bar, either the reduced moment at the critical cross section or the moment at the centerline of the connection may be used in these equations.
Centerbeam weld toe cracking is driven by a combination of longitudinal bending stress range, SRB, in the centerbeam, and vertical stress range, SRZ, at the top of the connection weld.
The longitudinal bending stress range, SRB, at the bottom of the centerbeam shall be calculated as:
SRB = MVcb / SXcb + MHcb / SYcb
The vertical stress range, SRZ, at the top of the connection weld shall be calculated as:
SRZ = RH∙ dcb / SWtop + RV / AWtop
Support bar weld toe cracking is driven by a combination of longitudinal bending stress range, SRB, in the support bar and vertical stress range, SRZ, at the bottom of the connection weld.
The longitudinal bending stress range, SRB, at the top of the support bar shall be calculated as:
SRB = MVsb / SXsb + 0.5 ∙ RH ∙ (dcb + hW + 0.5 ∙ dsb) / SXsb
The vertical stress range, SRZ, at the bottom of the connection weld shall be calculated as:
SRZ = RH ∙ (dcb + hW) / Swbot + RV / AWbot
Weld throat cracking is driven by a vertical stress range at the weld throat.

Concrete Structures
The vertical stress range, SRZ, at mid-height of the connection weld shall be calculated as:
SRZ = RV / Awmid + RH ∙ (dcb + 0.5 ∙ hW) / SWmid
In the above equations:
RV = vertical reaction at the connection weld
RH = horizontal reaction at the connection weld
MVcb = bending moment in the centerbeam due to applied vertical forces
MHcb = bending moment in the centerbeam due to applied horizontal forces
MVsb = bending moment in the support bar due to applied vertical forces
SXcb = section modulus at bottom of the centerbeam about horizontal axis
SYcb = section modulus of the centerbeam about vertical axis
SXsb = section modulus at top of the support bar about horizontal axis
AWtop = area of the weld at the top of the connection
AWmid = area of the weld at the middle of the connection
AWbot = area of the weld at the bottom of the connection
SWtop = section modulus of the weld at the top of the connection
SWmid = section modulus of the weld at the middle of the connection
SWbot = section modulus of the weld at the bottom of the connection hW = height of the weld dcb = depth of the centerbeam dsb = depth of the support bar
The nominal stress range, ∆f, at welded multiple-support-bar connection details shall be calculated for each case above as follows: ∆f = (S2RB + S2RZ)1/2
Where:

SRZ longitudinal stress range in the centerbeam or support bar, as calculated for each specific case above. vertical stress range in the centerbeam-to-support bar connection weld, as calculated for each specific case above.
All modular expansion joint system structural members, connections (bolted and welded), splices, and attachments shall satisfy the following: γ∆f = (ΔF)TH γ ∆f (ΔF)TH the load factor for the Fatigue I Limit State, as stipulated in Table 3.4.1-1 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. the nominal stress range as specified at the beginning of this subsection. constant amplitude fatigue threshold (CAFL) as specified in
Section 6-02.3(13)C9. 6-02.3(13)C9 Fatigue Resistance Characterization Requirements
The fatigue resistance of all details shall be characterized in terms of the detail categories specified in Table 6.6.1.2.5-1 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications.
Many details composing modular expansion joint systems may clearly correspond to specific structural details depicted in Figure 6.6.1.2.3-1 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge
Design Specifications. In these cases, the applicable fatigue categories specified in Table 6.6.1.2.3-1 may be used for design.
In cases where the Engineer establishes that a detail does not clearly correspond to a structural detail depicted in Figure 6.6.1.2.3-1, fatigue testing of specimens exhibiting that detail shall be conducted, in accordance with Sections 6-02.3(13)C11,

Modular expansion joint system structural steel members, connections (bolted and welded), splices, and attachments shall be designed to resist the Strength
I Limit State load combination specified in Table 3.4.1-1 of the AASHTO LRFD
Bridge Design Specifications. The vertical and horizontal loads specified in Section 6-02.3(13)C4 shall be applied simultaneously. These loads shall be distributed as specified in Section 6-02.3(13)C5. 6-02.3(13)C11 Fatigue Testing of Metallic Structural Components and Connections
This test procedure is acceptable for, and specifically applicable to, establishing the fatigue resistance of the centerbeam-to-support bar connection in modular expansion joint systems. It is applicable to single-support-bar and multiple-support-bar systems having either welded or bolted centerbeam-to-support bar connections. The same methodology may be applied to establish the fatigue resistance of other modular expansion joint metallic structural component details, including centerbeam splices.
Each fatigue test generates a discrete datum. Each datum comprises an applied constant amplitude nominal stress range, Sr, and the corresponding number of cycles, N, associated with either a predetermined extent of crack propagation, defined as failure, or with termination of the test, defined as runout. Ten data shall be acquired for each connection detail. All data shall be in the very long life range, corresponding as closely to the constant amplitude fatigue limit (CAFL) as practical. Specifically, the number of cycles, N, associated with each datum, shall be no less than one order of magnitude less than Nmin corresponding to the detail category specific CAFL specified in Section 6-02.3(13)C19.
For example, to characterize a detail as Detail Category C, the tested number of cycles, N, shall exceed 4.4 x 105 for each datum.
The constant amplitude nominal stress range shall be calculated at the anticipated initiation location of an incipient crack. Nominal stresses shall be calculated using conventional equations for analyzing bending and axial load. These equations are essentially the same as those used in strength design. The stress concentration effects of a weld, bolt hole, or other local features are not explicitly embodied in the conventional nominal stress equations.
The appropriate AASHTO detail category applicable to fatigue design shall be established by comparing acquired test data to fatigue resistance graphs representing the AASHTO detail categories. The constant amplitude fatigue limit (CAFL) applicable to fatigue design corresponds to the AASHTO detail category fatigue resistance graph representing a lower bound of the experimentally acquired data.
When testing is conducted exclusively in the infinite life regime and more stringent test data scatter requirements are satisfied, a unique CAFL (different from those CAFL corresponding to specific detail categories specified by AASHTO) may be established for fatigue design.
Specimens selected for testing shall be full-scale centerbeam and support bar assemblies or subassemblies representative of those installed in field applications. A subassembly is defined as a specimen having the same physical and geometric properties as an assembly but having a reduced number of centerbeams.
Each specimen shall consist of three continuous centerbeam spans over four equally spaced support bars. Centerbeam spans between adjacent support bar centerlines shall be a minimum of 3’-0” and a maximum of 4’-6”. Support bar spans shall be a minimum of 3’-0” and a maximum of 3’-8”. The centerbeam-to-support bar connection being tested shall be located at the midspan of each support bar.

Concrete Structures
All welded or bolted attachments used to secure equidistant springs to a support bar, centerbeam, or stirrup shall be fabricated as an integral part of the specimen. A rigid load path to the test fixture shall be provided to resist any horizontal forces or displacements which would normally be resisted through these attachments in a field installation. All miscellaneous welded or bolted attachments, including welded attachments used to secure the expansion joint strip seals to the centerbeams, shall also be fabricated as integral parts of the specimen.
Support bars of subassembly specimens that are components of single-support-bar swivel-joist type modular expansion joint systems shall be oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the centerbeam.
Prior to testing, each specimen shall be visually inspected for defects, loose fasteners or other aberrations which could plausibly affect the tested fatigue resistance. Defects and flaws shall be defined in accordance with the appropriate governing specification (ASTM
A6, AWS D1.5, etc.). Data acquired from specimens containing such anomalies shall not be excluded from consideration except as permitted in Section 6-02.3(13)C20. Observed anomalies shall also be reported with its corresponding data in the tabular format stipulated in Section 6-02.3(13)C22.
Each specimen shall be sufficiently instrumented to measure the static nominal strain range within that specimen for a specific applied load range. Best results can generally be obtained when the applied load range for the static calibration tests does not pass through zero load. Strain measurements shall be made at locations sufficiently distant from local effects, such as weld toes or bolt holes, which could significantly influence acquired test data.
As a minimum, eight strain gages shall be installed on the centerbeam top flange in the vicinity of each centerbeam-to-support bar connection. These gages shall be installed in pairs on each side of the connection at distances of one and two times the depth of the centerbeam from the centerline of the connection. Each pair of strain gages shall be located symmetrically about the centerline of the centerbeam. As a minimum, two strain gages shall also be installed on the support bar bottom flange in the vicinity of each centerbeam-to-support bar connection. One of these strain gages shall be installed on each side of the connection at a distance equal to the depth of the support bar from the centerline of the connection. These strain gages shall be installed along the centerline of the support bar. 6-02.3(13)C12 Fatigue Testing Test Fixtures
Test fixtures shall have the capability to adequately support and secure the specimen throughout the duration of the test. The fixture shall be designed and fabricated to such tolerances as required to assure that additional stresses will not be generated in the specimen as a consequence of fixture misalignment. Mismatches resulting from specimen fabrication errors shall be accommodated by shimming or other such means precluding the application of force to the specimen.
Typical elastomeric bearings and springs used to transfer vertical loads from the support bars to the support boxes may be replaced with steel bearings in the test fixture. This modification will enable fatigue testing at higher load ranges and different frequencies than those encountered during normal service conditions.
Load shall be applied through two 10-inch long patches. Each patch shall typically comprise a steel plate and a hard rubber bearing pad placed in contact with the bottom flange of the centerbeam. Each patch shall be located at midspan of each outer span.
In order to assure adequate seating of the specimen to the test fixture, a minimum of
10 kips shall be applied at each patch location. This requirement is waived for tests of single support bar systems conducted using load reversal. Once this load has been applied, all strain measuring devices shall be rebalanced to zero strain while the preload
Page 6-48

2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02 is maintained. An additional load approximately equivalent to the calculated load range shall be applied. Strain ranges shall be measured for the load range from 10 kips to the peak load. Each static calibration test shall be repeated three times while still maintaining a minimum 10 kips load at each load patch. The measured strain ranges from each repetition should vary by no more than 25% from the mean value. If the stress ranges are not repeatable, appropriate modifications shall be made to the test fixture. 6-02.3(13)C13 Static Calibration Test
Prior to fatigue resistance testing, a static calibration test shall be performed in order to validate the structural analysis model. The static calibration test shall be performed after attainment of stress range repeatability as described in Section 6-02.3(13)C12. The structural analysis model shall be considered validated when calculated strain ranges are within ±25% of the measured strain ranges at every strain gage location.
For the purpose of reporting nominal fatigue resistance stress ranges at specific details, stress ranges determined through structural analysis of the model shall be preferred over stress ranges acquired directly from test measurements. 6-02.3(13)C14 Fatigue Test Procedure
A minimum of ten data points shall be required to establish the fatigue resistance of each detail. The centerbeam-to-support bar connection shall be considered as a single detail.
Several data points may be obtained from a single specimen by repairing the cracked sections of that specimen and resuming testing. Such repairs shall have minimal effect on the stress ranges at unfailed details still being tested. Data points derived from tests in which a repaired detail cracks again shall be discarded.
All data shall be in the very long life range, corresponding as closely to the constant amplitude fatigue limit as practical, but in no case less than 200,000 cycles. Either finite life regime or infinite life regime testing may be conducted. For infinite life regime testing, the number of cycles, N, associated with each of the ten data shall be at least twice the number of cycles, Nmin, designated in the table in Section 6-02.3(13)C19.
Loads shall be applied using hydraulic actuators or other similar loading devices. The magnitude of the vertical load range, ∆Pv, shall be maintained and continuously monitored throughout the duration of the test. Vertical and horizontal load ranges shall be applied to the specimen simultaneously. The horizontal load range shall always be equal to 20% of the vertical load range, ∆Pv. This horizontal-to-vertical load ratio may be maintained by inclining the specimen 11.3 degrees with respect to the horizontal plane and applying load through vertically oriented actuators.
For multiple support bar systems, the loading mechanism shall be either exclusively tension or exclusively compression and shall be applied at a constant amplitude at any desired frequency. The applied load range shall be in a direction such that the reaction force between the centerbeam and support bar is always tensile. The load range shall not pass through zero load. Minimum preload shall be maintained throughout the duration of the test.
Single support bar systems may be loaded using the same procedures as those for multiple support bar systems. If premature stirrup failure occurs, an applied load range of 70% compression and 30% tension may be used.
The load ranges used in the test shall not be so large as to alter the observed failure mode from that which would be observed under service conditions. Under no circumstance shall imposed stress exceed the yield stress of the material in any portion of the specimen.
Each specimen shall be tested using at least two different load (stress) ranges.
If infinite life regime testing is conducted, the first load range should be chosen so that the applied stress range is just above the postulated CAFL. The load range in the subsequent test shall be decreased if failure resulted and increased if the test resulted in a runout. A

Concrete Structures suggested increment in load is such that the stress range is increased or decreased by 2 ksi. The applicable CAFL shall be selected from those CAFL values corresponding to the
AASHTO fatigue categories. The selected CAFL is the one just below the lowest stress range that resulted in cracking. 6-02.3(13)C15 Fatigue Test Failure Criteria
Failure in welded centerbeam-to-support bar connection specimens includes the following:
Centerbeam weld toe cracking originates at or near the centerbeam weld toe, propagates up into the centerbeam at some angle, and grows back over the connection. These cracks typically grow at an angle of about 45 degrees. A specimen shall be considered as failed due to this type of cracking when the crack has grown on any vertical face a length from the point of origin equal to half of the centerbeam depth.
Support bar weld toe cracking originates at or near the support bar weld toe, propagates down into the support bar, and grows back under the connection at some angle, typically about 45 degrees. A specimen shall be considered as failed due to this type of cracking when the crack has grown on any vertical support bar face a length from the point of origin equal to half of the depth of the support bar.
Weld throat cracking originates in the weld throat and typically grows in a plane parallel to the longitudinal axis of the support bar at about mid-depth of the weld throat. A specimen shall be considered as failed due to this type of cracking when a complete fracture of the weld throat has occurred. These cracks have been observed to turn down into the support bar, but only after significant growth. In such instances, the criteria for support bar weld toe cracking shall be applied.
A welded stirrup connection specimen shall be considered as failed when cracks result in the complete fracture of a stirrup leg or when cracks originating at or near a stirrup weld have grown into any face of the centerbeam a length from the stirrup weld toe equal to half of the centerbeam depth.
A bolted centerbeam-to-support bar connection specimen shall be considered as failed when: 1.

Fatigue cracks which have grown out of a bolt hole have resulted in the complete fracture of the tension flange of the centerbeam. 2.
Fatigue cracks which have grown out of a bolt hole have extended into any face of the centerbeam web a distance equivalent to half of the centerbeam depth less the centerbeam flange thickness. 3.
A portion of a stirrup fractures completely. 4.
A single bolt fractures completely. 6-02.3(13)C16 Alternate Criteria for Termination of a Finite Life Regime Fatigue Test
A test may also be terminated when, for a given stress range, the specimen has survived the number of cycles required to plot the data above either a particular fatigue resistance curve or the maximum permitted in Section 6-02.3(13)C20. For example, if the applied stress range is 17 ksi and the desired fatigue resistance curve is Category C, then based upon the equation presented in Section 6-02.3(13)C19, the test may be terminated after application of about 900,000 cycles provided that the specimen has not failed based on the above described criteria. 6-02.3(13)C17 Nominal Stress Range for Welded Centerbeam-to-Support Bar Systems
The nominal stress range for centerbeam weld toe cracking shall be calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the longitudinal bending stress range in the centerbeam and the vertical stress range at the top of the weld.
Page 6-50
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02
The nominal stress range for support bar weld toe cracking shall be calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the longitudinal bending stress range in the support bar and the vertical stress range at the bottom of the weld.
The nominal stress range for weld throat cracking shall be the calculated vertical stress range in the throat of the weld.
The nominal stress range in the centerbeam at a welded stirrup shall be calculated as the summation of the longitudinal bending stress ranges at the critical section resulting from vertical and horizontal loading. The entire load range shall be used in the calculation, even if the loading is partly in compression. The effects of stresses in the load-bearing attachments such as the stirrup or yoke shall not be considered when calculating the nominal stress range in the centerbeam.

The Contractor shall submit all plans for falsework and formwork as Type 2E Working
Drawings. A submittal is not required for footing or retaining wall formwork if the concrete placement is 4 feet or less in height. Formwork plans are required for fixed form barriers regardless of height.
The design of falsework and formwork shall be based on: 1.
Applied loads and conditions which are no less severe than those described in Section 6-02.3(17)A;

2.
Allowable stresses and deflections which are no greater than those described in

Pre-Contract Review of Falsework and Formwork Plans
The Contractor may request pre-contract review of formwork plans for abutments, wingwalls, diaphragms, retaining walls, columns, girders and beams, box Structures, railings, and bulkheads. Plans for falsework supporting the bridge deck for interior spans between precast prestressed concrete girders may also be submitted for pre-contract review.
To obtain pre-contract review, the Contractor shall electronically submit drawings and design calculations in PDF format directly to: BridgeConstructionSupport@wsdot.wa.gov
The Bridge and Structures Office, Construction Support Engineer will return the falsework or formwork plan to the Contractor with review notes, an effective date of review, and revisions needed prior to use.
For each contract on which the pre-reviewed falsework or formwork plans will be used, the Contractor shall submit a copy to the Engineer. Construction shall not begin until the
Engineer has given concurrence.
If the falsework or formwork being constructed has deviations to the preapproved falsework or formwork plan, the Contractor shall submit plan revisions for review and approval in accordance with Section 6-02.3(16). 6-02.3(17)
Falsework and Formwork

Formwork and falsework are both structural systems. Formwork contains the lateral pressure exerted by concrete placed in the forms. Falsework supports the vertical and/ or the horizontal loads of the formwork, reinforcing steel, concrete, and live loads during construction.
The Contractor shall set falsework, to produce in the finished Structure, the lines and grades indicated in the Contract Plans. The setting of falsework shall allow for shrinkage, settlement, falsework girder camber, and all structural camber the Plans or the
Engineer require.
Concrete forms shall be mortar tight, true to the dimensions, lines, and grades of the
Structure. Curved surfaces shown in the Contract Plans shall be constructed as curved surfaces and not chorded, except as allowed in Section 6-02.3(17)J. Concrete formwork shall be of sufficient strength and stiffness to prevent overstress and excess deflection as defined in Section 6-02.3(17)B. The rate of depositing concrete in the forms shall not exceed the placement rate in the formwork plan Working Drawing. The interior form shape and dimensions shall also ensure that the finished concrete will conform with the
Contract Plans.
If the new Structure is near or part of an existing one, the Contractor shall not use the existing Structure to suspend or support falsework unless the Plans or Special
Provisions state otherwise. For prestressed girder and T-beam bridge widenings or stage construction, the bridge deck and the diaphragm forms may be supported from the existing Structure or previous stage, if accepted by the Engineer. For steel plate girder bridge widenings or stage construction, only the bridge deck forms may be supported from the existing Structure or previous stage, if accepted by the Engineer. See Section 6-02.3(17)E for additional conditions.
On bridge decks, forms designed to stay in place made of steel or precast concrete panels shall not be used.
For post-tensioned Structures, both falsework and forms shall be designed to carry the additional loads caused by the post-tensioning operations. The Contractor shall construct supporting falsework in a way that leaves the Superstructure free to contract and lift off the falsework during post-tensioning. Forms that will remain inside box girders to support the placement of the bridge deck concrete shall, by design, resist girder contraction as little as possible. See Section 6-02.3(26) for additional conditions.

Design Loads
The design load for falsework shall consist of the sum of dead and live vertical loads, and a design horizontal load. The minimum total design load for any falsework shall not be less than 100 lbs/sf for combined live and dead load regardless of Structure thickness.
The entire Superstructure cross-section, except traffic barrier, shall be considered to be placed at one time for purposes of determining support requirements and designing falsework girders for their stresses and deflections, except as follows:
For concrete box girder bridges, the girder stem, diaphragms, crossbeam and connected bottom slabs may be considered self-supporting between the falsework bents at the time the top slab is place provided the following conditions are true: 1.
Five or more days have elapsed since the stem walls were placed. 2.
The distance between the falsework bents is less than or equal to four times the depth of the girder that has been placed in the preceding concrete placements.
Falsework bents shall be designed for the entire live load and dead load, including all load transfer that takes place during post-tensioning, and braced for the design horizontal load.
Dead loads shall include the weight of all successive placements of concrete, reinforcing steel, forms and falsework, and all load transfer that takes place during post-tensioning.
The weight of concrete with reinforcing steel shall be assumed to be not less than
160 pounds per cubic foot.
Live loads shall consist of a minimum uniform load of not less than 25 psf, applied over the entire falsework plan area, plus the greater of: 1.

Actual weights of the deck finishing equipment applied at the rails, or; 2.
A minimum load of 75 pounds per linear foot applied at the edge of the bridge deck.
The design horizontal load to be resisted by the falsework bracing system in any direction shall be:
The sum of all identifiable horizontal loads due to equipment, construction sequence, side-sway caused by geometry or eccentric loading conditions, or other causes, and an allowance for wind plus an additional allowance of 1 percent of the total dead load to provide for unexpected forces. In no case shall the design horizontal load be less than 3 percent of the total dead load.
The minimum horizontal load to be allowed for wind on each heavy-duty steel shoring tower having a vertical load carrying capacity exceeding 30 kips per leg shall be the sum of the products of the wind impact area, shape factor, and the applicable wind pressure value for each height zone. The wind impact area is the total projected area of all the elements in the tower face normal to the applied wind. The shape factor for heavy-duty steel shoring towers shall be taken as 2.2. Wind pressure values shall be determined from the following table:

Q = 1 + 0.2W; but Q shall not be more than 10.
Where:
W = is the width of the falsework system, in feet, measured normal to the direction of the wind force being considered.
The falsework system shall also be designed so that it will be sufficiently stable to resist overturning prior to the placement of the concrete. The minimum factor of safety against falsework overturning in all directions from the assumed horizontal load for all stages of construction shall be 1.25. If the required resisting moment is less than 1.25 times the overturning moment, the difference shall be resisted by bracing, cable guys, or other means of external support.
Design of falsework shall include the vertical component (whether positive or negative) of bracing loads imposed by the design horizontal load. Design of falsework shall investigate the effects of any horizontal displacement due to stretch of the bracing. This is particularly important when using cable or rod bracing systems.
If the concrete is to be post-tensioned, the falsework shall be designed to support all increased or redistributed loads caused by the prestressing forces. 6-02.3(17)B

Allowable Design Stresses and Deflections
The maximum allowable stresses listed in this section are based on the use of identifiable, undamaged, high-quality materials. Stresses shall be appropriately reduced if lesser quality materials are to be used.
These maximum allowable stresses include all adjustment factors, such as the short-term load duration factor. The maximum allowable stresses and deflections used in the design of the falsework and formwork shall be as follows: 6-02.3(17)B1 Deflection
Deflection resulting from dead load and concrete pressure for exposed visible surfaces shall not exceed 1/360 of the span.
Deflection resulting from dead load and concrete pressure for unexposed non-visible surfaces, including the bottom of the deck slab between girders shall not exceed 1/270 of the span.
In the foregoing, the span length shall be the center line to center line distance between supports for simple and continuous spans, and from the center line of support to the

end of the member for cantilever spans. For plywood supported on members wider than 1½ inches, the span length shall be taken as the clear span plus 1½ inches. Also, dead load shall include the weight of all successive placements of concrete, reinforcing steel, forms and falsework self weight. Only the self weight of falsework girders may be excluded from the calculation of the above deflections provided that the falsework girder deflection is compensated for by the installation of camber strips.
Where successive placements of concrete are to act compositely in the completed
Structure, deflection control becomes extremely critical. Maximum deflection of supporting members shall not exceed 1/500 of the span for members constructed in several successive placements (such as concrete box girder and concrete T-beam girder
Structures). Falsework components shall be sized, positioned, and/or supported to minimize progressive increases in deflection of the Structure which would preload the concrete or reinforcing steel before it becomes fully composite. 6-02.3(17)B2 Timber
Each species and grade of timber/lumber used in constructing falsework and formwork shall be identified in the drawings. The allowable stresses and loads shall not exceed the lesser of stresses and loads given in the table below or factored stresses for designated species and grade in Table 7.3 of the Timber Construction Manual, latest edition, by the
American Institute of Timber Construction.

The allowable stress for compression perpendicular to the grain, and for horizontal shear shall not be increased by any factors such as short duration loading. Additional requirements are found in other parts of Section 6-02.3(17). Criteria for the design of lumber and timber connections are found in Section 6-02.3(17)I.
Plywood for formwork shall be designed in accordance with the methods and stresses allowed in the APA Design/Construction Guide for Concrete Forming as published by the
American Plywood Association, Tacoma, Washington. As concrete forming is a special application for plywood, wet stresses shall be used and then adjusted for forming conditions such as duration of load, and experience factors. Concrete pour pressures shall be in accordance with Section 6-02.3(17)J.

Copies of catalog data and/or other technical data shall be furnished with the falsework plans to verify the load-carrying capacity, deflection, and manufacturers installation requirements of all manufactured products or devices proposed for use. Upon request by the Engineer, the Contractor shall furnish manufacturer certified test reports and results showing load capacity, deflection, test installation conditions, and identify associated components and hardware for shoring tower systems or other devices. In addition to manufacturer’s requirements, the criteria shown in the following sections for manufactured proprietary shoring tower systems and devices shall be complied with when preparing falsework plans, calculations, and installing these shoring tower systems and devices as falsework.
Alternative criteria and/or systems shall be submitted as a Type 2 Working Drawing consisting of a written statement on the manufacturer’s letterhead, signed by the shoring or device manufacturer (not signed by a material supplier or the Contractor) addressing the following: 1.
Identity of the specific Contract on which the alternative criteria and/or system will apply; 2.
Description of the alternative criteria and/or system; 3.
Technical data and test reports; 4.
The conditions under which the particular alternative criteria may be followed; and 5.
That a design based on the alternative criteria will not overstress or over deflect shoring components or devices nor reduce the required safety factor.
In any case where the falsework drawings detail a manufactured product and the manufacturer’s safe working load, load versus deflection curves, factor of safety, and installation requirements cannot be found in any catalog, the Engineer may require load testing in accordance with Section 6-02.3(17)G to verify the safe working load and deflection characteristics.
Tower leg loads shall not exceed the limiting values under any loading condition or sequence. All frame extensions and reduced capacity shall be shown in the falsework plans. Screw jacks shall fit tight in the leg assemblies without wobble. Screw jacks shall be plumb and straight. Shoring towers shall be installed plumb, and load distribution beams shall be arranged such that vertical loads are distributed to all legs for all successive concrete placements. There shall be no eccentric loads on shoring tower heads unless the heads have been designed for such loading. Shoring towers shall remain square or rectangular in plan view and shall not be skewed. There shall be no interchanging of parts from one manufactured shoring system to another. Bent or faulty components shall not be used.
For manufactured shoring towers that allow ganging of frames, the number of ganged frames shall be limited to one frame per opposing side of a tower, and the total number of legs per ganged tower shall not exceed eight legs.

Stringers, Beams, Joists, Bridge Deck Support, and Deck Overhangs
All stringers, beams, joists, and bridge deck support shall be designed for the design loads, deflections, and allowable stresses described in the preceding Section 6-02.3(17)A, B, and
C and for the following conditions.
At points of support, stringers, beams, joists, and trusses shall be restrained against rotation about their longitudinal axis. The effect of biaxial bending shall be investigated in all cases where falsework beams are not set plumb and the Structure cross-slope exceeds
3 percent.
For box girder and T-beam bridges, the centerline of falsework beams or stringers shall be located within 2 feet of the bridge girder stems and preferably directly under the stems or webs. Stringers supporting formwork for concrete box girder and T-beam slab overhangs shall be stiff enough so that the differential deflection due to the placement of bridge deck concrete is no more than 3/16 inch between the outside edge of the bridge deck and the exterior web even if camber strips can compensate for the deflection.
Friction shall not be relied upon for lateral stability of beams or stringers. If the compression flange of a beam is not laterally restrained, the allowable bending stress shall be reduced to prevent flange buckling. If flange restraint is provided and since it is impossible to predict the direction in which a compression flange will buckle, positive restraint shall be provided in both directions. Flange restraint shall be designed for a minimum load of 2 percent of the calculated compression force in the beam flange at the point under consideration.
Camber strips shall be used to compensate for falsework take-up and deflection, vertical alignment, and the anticipated Structure dead load deflection shown in the camber diagram in the Contract Plans. Camber is the adjustment to the profile of a loadsupporting beam or stringer so that the completed Structure will have the lines and grades shown in the Plans. The dead load camber diagram shown in the Contract Plans is the predicted Structure dead load deflection due to weight of applied concrete loads. This dead load camber shall be increased by: 1.

Amount of anticipated falsework take up, 2.
Anticipated deflection of the falsework beam or stringer under the actual load imposed, and 3.
Vertical curve compensation, if any.
Camber strips shall be fastened by nailing to the top of wood members, or by clamping or banding in the case of steel members. Camber strips shall have sufficient contact bearing area to prevent crushing under total load. Camber strips are required when the total camber adjustment exceeds ¼ inch for exterior falsework stringers and ½ inch for interior stringers.
On concrete box girder Structures, the forms supporting the bridge deck shall rest on ledgers or similar supports and shall not be supported from the bottom slab except as provided below. The form supports shall be fastened within 18 inches of the top of the web walls, producing a clear span between web walls. The bridge deck forms may be supported or posted from the bottom slab if the following conditions are met: 1.
Permanent access, shown in the Contract Plans, is provided to the cells, and the centerline to centerline distance between web walls is greater than 10 feet; 2.
Falsework stringers designed for total load, stresses and deflections in accordance with Section 6-02.3(17)A and B are located directly below each row of posts; 3.
Posts have adequate lateral restraint; and 4.
All forms (including the bridge deck forms), posts, and bracing are completely removed.

The falsework and forms on concrete box girder Structures supporting a sloping web and deck overhang shall consist of a lateral support system which is designed to resist all rotational forces acting on the stem, including those caused by the placement of bridge deck concrete, bridge deck formwork mass, finishing machine, and other live loads.
Stem reinforcing steel shall not be stressed by the construction of the bridge deck slab placement. Overhang brackets shall not be used for the support of bridge deck forms from sloping web concrete box girder bridges.
Deck slab forms between girders or webs shall be constructed such that there is no differential settlement relative to the girders. The support systems for form panels supporting concrete deck slabs and overhangs on girder bridges (such as steel plate girders and prestressed girders) shall be designed as falsework. Falsework supporting deck slabs and overhangs on girder bridges shall be supported directly by the girders so that there will be no differential settlement between the girders and the deck forms during placement of deck concrete. 6-02.3(17)F
Bracing
All falsework bracing systems shall be designed to resist the horizontal design load in all directions with the falsework in either the loaded or unloaded condition. All bracing, connection details, specific locations of connections, and hardware used shall be shown in the falsework plans. Falsework diagonal bracing shall be thoroughly analyzed with particular attention given to the connections. The allowable stresses in the diagonal braces may be controlled by the joint strength or the compression stability of the diagonal.
Timber bracing for timber falsework bents shall have connections designed in accordance with Section 6-02.3(17)I. All damaged cross-bracing, such as split timber members shall be replaced. Steel strapping shall avoid making sharp angles or right-angle bends. A means of preventing accidental loss of tension shall be provided for steel strapping. See Sections 6-02.3(17)A, B, and C for design loads and allowable stresses.
Bracing shall not be attached to concrete traffic barrier, guardrail posts, or guardrail.
To prevent falsework beam or stringer compression flange buckling, cross-bracing members and connections shall be designed to carry tension as well as compression. All components, connection details and specific locations shall be shown in the falsework plans. Bracing, blocking, struts, and ties required for positive lateral restraint of beam flanges shall be installed at right angles to the beam in plan view. If possible, bracing in adjacent bays shall be set in the same transverse plane. However, if because of skew or other considerations, it is necessary to offset the bracing in adjacent bays, the offset distance shall not exceed twice the depth of the beam.
All falsework and bracing shall be inspected by the Contractor for plumbness of vertical support members, secure connections, tight cables, and straight bracing members immediately prior to, during, and immediately after every concrete placement.
Bracing shall be provided to withstand all imposed loads during erection of the falsework and all phases of construction for falsework adjacent to a Roadway, sidewalk, or railroad track which is open to the public. All details of the falsework system which contribute to horizontal stability and resistance to impact, including the bolts in bracing, shall be installed at the time each element of the falsework is erected and shall remain in place until the falsework is removed. The falsework plans shall show provisions for supplemental bracing or methods to be used to conform to this requirement during each phase of erection and removal. Wind loads shall be included in the design of such bracing or methods. Loads, connections, and materials for falsework adjacent to Roadways, shall also be in accordance with Section 6-02.3(17)C.

Concrete Structures 6-02.3(17)F1 Cable or Tension Bracing Systems
When cables, wire rope, steel rod, or other types of tension bracing members are used as external bracing to resist horizontal forces, or as temporary bracing to support bents while falsework is being erected or removed adjacent to traffic, all elements of the bracing system shall be shown in the falsework plans. Bracing shall not be attached to concrete traffic barrier, guardrail posts, or guardrail. All damaged bracing, such as frayed and kinked guying systems shall be replaced. Wire rope shall avoid making sharp angles or rightangle bends and a means of preventing accidental loss of tension shall be provided. The following information shall be submitted as a Type 2 Working Drawing: 1.
Cable diameter, rod, or tension member size, and allowable working load. 2.
Location and method of attaching the cable, rod, or tension member to the falsework.
The connecting device shall be designed to transfer both horizontal and vertical forces to the cable without overstressing the falsework component. 3.
The type of cable connectors or fastening devices (such as wire rope clips, plate clamps, or other attachment devices) to be used and the efficiency factor for each type. If cables are to be spliced, the splicing method shall be shown. 4.
Method of tightening cables, rods, or tension members after installation if tightening is necessary to ensure their effectiveness. Method of preventing accidental loosening.

5.
Anchorage details, including the size and mass of concrete anchor blocks, the assumed coefficient of friction for surface anchorages, and the assumed lateral soil bearing capacity for buried anchorages. 6.
Method of pre-stretching or preloading cable or tension members. 7.
Determination of the potential stretch or elongation of the tension member under the design load and if the resulting lateral deflection will cause excessive secondary stresses in the falsework.
Copies of manufacturer’s catalog or brochure showing technical data pertaining to the type of cable to be used shall be furnished with the falsework plans. Technical data shall include the cable diameter, the number of strands and the number of wires per strand, ultimate breaking strength or recommended safe working strength, and any other information as may be needed to identify the cable.
In the absence of sufficient technical data to identify the cable, or if it is old and obviously worn, the Contractor shall perform cable breaking tests to establish the safe working load for each reel of cable furnished. For static guy cable the minimum factor of safety shall be
3 to 1. The Contractor shall provide the Engineer an opportunity to witness these tests.
When cable bracing is used to prevent the overturning of heavy-duty shoring, attention shall be given to the connections by which forces are transferred from the shoring to the cables. Cable restraint shall be designed to act through the cap system to prevent the inadvertent application of forces which the shoring is not designed to withstand. Cables shall not be attached to tower components.
Cable splices made by lapping and clipping with wire rope clip type clamps shall not be used. Other splicing methods may be used; however, at each location where the cable is spliced, cable strength shall be verified by a load test.
When cables are used as external bracing to resist overturning of a falsework system, the horizontal load to be carried by the cables shall be calculated as follows: 1.

When used with heavy-duty shoring systems, cables shall be designed to resist the difference between 1.25 times the total overturning moment and the resistance to overturning provided by the individual falsework towers.
Page 6-76
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02 2.
When used with pipe-frame shoring systems where supplemental bracing is required, cables shall be designed to resist the difference between 1.25 times the total overturning moment and the resistance to overturning provided by the shoring system as a whole. 3.
When used as external bracing to prevent overturning of all other types of falsework, including temporary support during erection and removal of falsework at traffic openings, cables shall be designed to resist 1.25 times the total overturning moment.
The maximum allowable cable design load shall be determined using the following criteria: 1.
If the cable is new, or is in uniformly good condition, and if it can be identified by reference to a manufacturer’s catalog or other technical publication, the allowable load shall be the ultimate strength of the cable as specified by the manufacturer, multiplied by the efficiency of the cable connector, and divided by a safety factor of 3 (i.e., safe working load = breaking strength × connector efficiency/safety factor). 2.
If the cable is used but still in serviceable condition, or is new or nearly new but cannot be found in a manufacturer’s catalog, the Contractor shall perform load breaking tests. In this case, the cable design load shall not exceed the breaking strength, as determined by the load test, multiplied by the connector efficiency factor, and divided by a safety factor of 3. 3.
If the cable is used and still in serviceable condition, or is a new or nearly new cable which cannot be identified, and if load breaking tests are not performed, the cable design load shall not exceed the safe working load shown in the wire rope capacities table multiplied by the cable connector efficiency.
Cable connectors shall be designed in accordance with criteria shown in the following tables “Efficiency of Wire Rope Connections” and “Applying Wire Rope Clips”. Cable safe working loads are provided in table “Wire Rope Capacities”.

Concrete anchor blocks and connections used to resist forces from external bracing shall be shown in the falsework plans. Concrete anchor blocks shall be proportioned to resist both sliding and overturning. When designing anchor block stability, the weight of the anchor block shall be reduced by the vertical component of the cable or brace tension to obtain the net or effective mass to be used in the anchorage computations. The coefficient of friction assumed in the design shall not exceed the following:

If the bridge is constructed with cast-in-place concrete diaphragms, the bracing may be removed once the concrete in the diaphragms has been placed and cured for a minimum of 24 hours. 6-02.3(17)F5 Temporary Bracing for Bridge Girders During Diaphragm and Bridge Deck
Concrete Placement
Girders shall be braced to resist all temporary and construction loads, including those caused by the placing of precast concrete deck panels and concrete for the bridge deck.
At a minimum, the Contractor shall brace concrete girders to prevent relative lateral movement and rotation at a spacing not to exceed 60 feet. The Contractor may consider the bracing effects of the diaphragms. The Contractor shall account for the added load from concrete finishing machines and other construction loadings in the design of the bracing.

Timber Connections
Timber connections shall be designed in accordance with the methods, stresses, and loads allowed in the Timber Construction Manual, Third Edition by the American Institute of Timber Construction (AITC). Timber falsework and formwork connections shall be designed using wet condition stresses for all installations West of the Cascade Range crest line and by criteria provided in the following sections. Frictional resistance shall not be considered as contributing to the stability of a timber connection. 6-02.3(17)I1
Bolted Connections
Tabulated values in the AITC Timber Construction Manual, Current Edition are based on square posts. For a round post or pile, the main member thickness shall be the side of a square post having the same cross-sectional area as the round post used.
The AITC Table 6.20 for Douglas Fir-Larch bolt Group 3 and for Hem-Fir bolt Group
8 show design values for bolts to be used when the load is applied either parallel or perpendicular to the direction of the wood grain. When the load is applied at an angle to the grain, as is the case with falsework bracing, the design value for the main member shall be obtained from the Hankinson formula shown in the AITC manual.
Design values in the AITC Table 6.20 apply only to three-member joints (bolt in doubleshear) in which the side members are each ½ the thickness of the main member. This joint configuration is not typical of bridge falsework where side members are usually much smaller than main members. For two-member joints (single shear bolt condition), the AITC
Table 6.20 values shall be adjusted by a single shear load factor as follows: 1.

0.75 for installations East of the Cascade Range crest line, except as shown in item 3 below; 2.
0.50 for installations West of the Cascade Range crest line; and 3.
0.50 for load acting at an angle to the bolt axis, as is the case with longitudinal bracing when falsework bents are skewed.
Except for connections in falsework adjacent to or over railroads or Roadways, threaded rods and coil rods may be used in place of bolts of the same diameter with no reduction in the tabulated values. At openings for Roadways and railroads, all connections shall be bolted using ⅝-inch diameter or larger through bolts.
Bolt holes shall be a minimum 1/32 inch to a maximum ⅛ inch larger than the bolt diameter.
A washer not less than a standard cut washer shall be installed between the wood and the bolt head and between the wood and the nut to distribute the bearing stress under the bolt head and nut and to avoid crushing the fibers. In lieu of standard cut washers, metal plates or straps with dimensions at least equal to that of a standard cut washer may be substituted.
When steel bars or shapes are used as diagonal bracing, the tabulated design values shown in AITC Table 6.20 for the main members loaded parallel to grain (P value) are increased 75 percent for joints made with bolts ½ inch or less in diameter, 25 percent for joints made with bolts 1½ inch in diameter, and proportionally for intermediate diameters.
No increase in the tabulated values is allowed for perpendicular-to-grain loading (Q value).

Clearance requirements for end, edge, and bolt spacing distance shall be as shown below.
All distances are measured from the end or side of the wood member to the center of the bolt hole. For members which are subject to load reversals the larger controlling distances shall be used for design. For parallel-to-grain loading, the minimum distances for full design load: 1.
In tension, minimum end distance shall be seven times the bolt diameter; 2.
In compression, minimum end distance shall be four times the bolt diameter; and 3.
In tension or compression, the minimum edge distance shall be one and one-half times the bolt diameter.
For perpendicular-to-grain loading, the minimum distance for full design load: 1.
Minimum end distance shall be four times the bolt diameter; 2.
Edge distance toward which the load is acting shall be at least four times the bolt diameter; and 3.
Distance on the opposite edge shall be at least 1½-bolt diameters.

Minimum clearance (spacing) between adjacent bolts in a row shall be four times the bolt diameter, measured center-to-center of the bolt holes.
When more than two bolts are used in a line parallel to the axis of the side member, additional requirements shall be followed as shown in the AITC manual. 6-02.3(17)I2

The withdrawal values are in pounds per inch of penetration of the threaded part of the lag screw into the side grain of the member holding the point, with the axis of the screw perpendicular to that member. The maximum load on a given screw shall not exceed the allowable tensile strength of the screw at the root section.
AITC recommends against subjecting lag screws to end-grain withdrawal loading.
However, if this condition cannot be avoided, the design value shall be 75 percent of the corresponding value for withdrawal from the side grain.
Values in the Group II wood species column shall be used for Douglas Fir-Larch and the
Group III wood species column shall be used for Hem-Fir. When the load is applied at an angle to the grain, as is the case with falsework bracing, the design value shall be obtained from the Hankinson formula shown in the AITC manual.
When lag screws are subjected to a combined lateral and withdrawal loading, as would be the case with longitudinal bracing when the falsework bents are skewed, the effect of the lateral and withdrawal forces shall be determined separately. The withdrawal component of the applied load shall not exceed the allowable value in withdrawal. The lateral component of the applied load shall not exceed the allowable lateral load value.
Lag screws shall be inserted in lead holes as follows: 1.

The clearance hole for the shank shall have the same diameter as the shank, and the same depth of penetration as the length of unthreaded shank; 2.
The lead hole for the threaded portion shall have a diameter equal to 60 to
75 percent of the shank diameter and a length equal to at least the length of the threaded portion. The larger percentile figure in each range shall apply to screws of the greater diameters used in Group II wood species; 3.
The threaded portion of the screw shall be inserted in its lead hole by turning with a wrench, not by driving with a hammer; and

To facilitate insertion, soap or other lubricant shall be used on the screws or in the lead hole. 6-02.3(17)I3
Drift Pin and Drift Bolt Connections

When drift pins or drift bolts are used, the required length and penetration shall be determined using the following criteria. The lateral load-carrying capacity of drift pins and drift bolts driven into the side grain of a wood member shall be limited to 75 percent of the design values for a common bolt of the same diameter and length in the main member. For drift pin connections, the pin penetration into the connected members shall be increased to compensate for the absence of a bolt head and nut. For drift bolts or pins driven into the end grain of a member, the lateral load-carrying capacity shall be limited to 60 percent of the allowable side grain load (perpendicular to grain value) for an equal diameter bolt with nut. To develop this allowable load the drift bolt or pin shall penetrate at least 12 diameters into the end grain. To fully develop the allowable load of the drift bolts or pins, they shall be driven into predrilled holes, 1/16 inch less in diameter than the drift pin or bolt diameter.
The criteria shown in the AITC Timber Construction Manual, Current Edition shall apply to drift bolt or pin connection allowable loads for the following conditions: 1.
Withdrawal resistance; and 2.
When there are more than two drift bolts or pins in a joint, allowable loads shall be further reduced by applying applicable modification factors shown in the AITC
Table 6.3. 6-02.3(17)I4
Nailed and Spiked Joints
Joints using nails or spikes shall conform to the provisions of AITC. For side grain withdrawal, the values in AITC Table 6.35 for wood having a specific gravity of 0.51 for
Douglas Fir-Larch and a specific gravity of 0.42 for Hem-Fir shall be used. End grain withdrawal shall not be used. For lateral loading, the values in AITC Table 6.36 for wood species Group II for Douglas Fir-Larch and wood species Group III for Hem-Fir shall be used. Diameters listed in the tables apply to fasteners before application of protective coatings.
When more than one nail or spike is used in a joint, the total design value for the joint in withdrawal or lateral resistance shall be the sum of the design values for the individual nails or spikes.
The tabulated design values for lateral loads are valid only when the nail penetrates into the main member at least 11 diameters for Douglas Fir-Larch and 13 diameters for HemFir. Note that the values are maximum values for the type and size of fastener shown. The tabulated values shall not be increased even if the actual penetration is exceeded.
When main member penetration is less than 11 diameters for Douglas Fir-Larch and 13 diameters for Hem-Fir, the design value shall be determined by straight-line interpolation between zero and the tabulated load, except that penetration shall not be less than ⅓ of that specified.
Double-headed or duplex nails used in falsework and formwork construction are shorter than common wire nails or box nails of the same size designation. They have less penetration into the main member and therefore their load-carrying capacity shall be adjusted accordingly.
Nail and spike minimum spacing in timber connections shall be as follows: 1.

The average center-to-center distance between adjacent nails, measured in any direction, shall not be less than the required penetration into the main member for the size of nail being used; and
Page 6-84
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Concrete Structures 2. 6-02
The minimum end distance in the side member, and the minimum edge distance in both the side member and the main member, shall not be less than ½ of the required penetration.
Allowable values for withdrawal and lateral load resistance are reduced when toe nails are used in accordance with the following: 1.
For withdrawal loading, the design load shall not exceed ⅔ of the value shown in the applicable design table; and 2.
For lateral loading, the design load shall not exceed 5⁄6 of the value shown in the applicable design table.
Toe nails are recommended to be driven at an approximate angle of 30 degrees with the piece and started approximately ⅓ of the length of the nail from the end or side of the piece. 6-02.3(17)I5
Timber Connection Adjustment for Duration of Load

Tabulated values for timber fasteners are for normal duration of load and may be increased for short duration loading, except for connections used in falsework and formwork for post tensioned Structures and staged construction sequences. Duration of load adjustment for timber connections shall not be allowed for all post tensioned
Structures and for staged construction sequences where delayed and/or staged loading occurs for any type of concrete Structure. The adjustment for duration of load as described in this section applies only to design values for timber connectors, such as nails, bolts, and lag screws. Allowable stresses for timber and structural steel components used in the connection, as described in Section 6-02.3(17)B, are maximums and thus shall not be increased.
Tabulated values for nails, bolts, and lag screws may be adjusted by the following duration-of-load factors: 1.
1.25 for falsework design governed by the minimum design horizontal load or greater (3 percent or greater of the dead load), 2.
1.33 for falsework design governed by wind load, and 3.
2.00 for falsework design governed by impact loading. 6-02.3(17)J
Face Lumber, Studs, Wales, and Metal Forms
Elements of this section shall be designed for the loads, allowable stresses, deflections, and conditions which pertain from other Subsections of Section 6-02.3(17).
Forms battered or inclined above the concrete will tend to lift up as concrete is placed and shall have positive anchorage or counterweights designed to resist uplift and shall be shown in the formwork plans. Where the concrete pouring sequence causes fresh concrete to be significantly higher along one side of tied forms than the opposite side, a positive form anchorage system shall be designed capable of resisting the imbalance of horizontal thrust, and prevent the dislocation and sliding of the entire form unit.
Wooden forms shall be faced with smooth sanded, exterior plywood. This plywood shall meet the requirements of the National Bureau of Standards, U.S. Product Standard PS 1, and the design specification of the American Plywood Association (APA). Each full sheet shall bear the APA stamp. The Contractor shall list in the form plans the grade and class of plywood. If the Engineer accepts the manufacturer’s certification of structural properties, the Contractor may use plywood that does not carry the APA stamp. Plywood panels stamped “shop” or “shop cutting”, shall not be used.
Plyform is an APA plywood specifically designed and manufactured for concrete forming.
Plyform differs from conventional exterior plywood grades in strength and the exterior face panels are sanded smooth and factory oiled. Likewise, there is a significant difference between grades designated Class 1, Class 2, and Structural I Plyform.

Concrete Structures
The grades of plywood for various form applications shall be as follows: 1.
Traffic and Pedestrian Barriers (except those that will receive an architectural surface treatment) – Plywood used for these surfaces shall be APA grade High-Density
Overlaid (HDO) Plyform Class I. But if the Contractor coats the form to prevent it from leaving joint and grain marks on the surface, plywood that meets or exceeds
APA grades B-B Plyform Class I or B-C (Group I species) may be used. Under this option, the Contractor shall provide for the Engineer’s acceptance a 4-foot-square, test panel of concrete formed with the same plywood and coating as proposed in the form plans. This panel shall include one form joint along its centerline. The Contractor shall apply coating material, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, before applying chemical release agents. 2.
Other Exposed Surfaces (all but those on traffic and pedestrian barriers) – Plywood used to form these surfaces shall meet or exceed the requirements of APA grades
B-B Plyform Class I or B-C (Group I series). If one face is less than B quality, the B (or better) face shall contact the concrete. 3.
Unexposed Surfaces (such as the underside of the bridge deck between girders, the interiors of box girders, or other concrete exposed surfaces not viewable to the public, and traffic and pedestrian barriers where surfaces will receive an architectural treatment) – Plywood used to form these surfaces may be APA grade CDX, provided the Contractor complies with stress and deflection requirements stated elsewhere in these Specifications.

Form joints on an exposed surface shall be in a horizontal or vertical plane. But in wingwalls and box girders, side form joints shall be placed at right angles and parallel to the Roadway grade. Joints parallel to studs or joists shall be backed by a stud or joist.
Joints at right angles to studs and joists shall be backed by a stud or other backing the
Engineer accepts. Perpendicular backing is not required if studs or joists are spaced: 1.
Nine inches or less on center and covered with ½-inch plywood, or 2.
Twelve inches or less on center and covered with ¾-inch plywood.
The face grain of plywood shall run perpendicular to studs or joists unless shown otherwise on the Contractor’s formwork Working Drawings. Proposals to deviate from the perpendicular orientation shall be accompanied by supporting calculations of the stresses and deflections.
Forming for all exposed curved surfaces shall follow the shape of the curve shown in the
Contract Plans and shall not be chorded except as follows. On any retaining wall that follows a horizontal circular curve, the wall stems may be a series of short chords if: 1.
The chords within the panel are the same length, unless otherwise allowed by the
Engineer;

2.
The chords do not vary from a true curve by more than ½ inch at any point; and 3.
All panel points are on the true curve.
Where architectural treatment is required, the angle point for chords in wall stems shall fall at vertical rustication joints.
For exposed surfaces of abutments, wingwalls, piers, retaining walls, and columns, the
Contractor shall build forms of plywood at least ¾ inch thick with studs no more than
12 inches on center. The Engineer may allow exceptions, but deflection of the plywood, studs, or wales shall never exceed 1⁄360 of the span (or 1⁄270 of the span for unexposed surfaces, including the bottom of the deck slab between girders).
All form plywood shall be at least ½ inch thick except on sharply curved surfaces. There, the Contractor may use ¼-inch plywood if it is backed firmly with heavier material.

Round columns or rounded pier shafts shall be formed with a self-supporting metal shell form or form tube that leaves a smooth, nonspiralling surface. Wood forms are not permitted.
Metal forms shall not be used elsewhere unless the Engineer is satisfied with the surface and allows use in writing. The Engineer may withdraw allowing use of metal forms at any time. If permitted to use a combination of wood and metal in forms, the Contractor shall coat the forms so that the texture produced by the wood matches that of the metal.
Aluminum shall not be used for metal forms.
For design purposes, the Contractor shall assume that on vertical surfaces concrete exerts
150 pounds per square foot per foot of depth. However, when the depth is reached where the rate of placement controls the pressure, the following table applies:
Pressure, Pounds per Square Foot for
Temperature of Concrete as Shown 60°F 70°F and Above 470 375 640 565 725 625 815 690 900 750 990 815 1,075 875 1,165 935 1,250 1,000 1,670 1,300

The pressures in the above table have been increased to provide an allowance for the vibration and impact.
All corners shall be beveled ¾ inch. However, footings, footing pedestals, and seals need not be beveled unless required in the Plans.
All forms shall be as mortar-tight as possible with no water standing in them as the concrete is placed.
The Contractor shall apply a parting compound on forms for exposed concrete surfaces.
This compound shall be a chemical release agent that permits the forms to separate cleanly from the concrete. The compound shall not penetrate or stain the surface and shall not attract dirt or other foreign matter. After the forms are removed, the concrete surface shall be dust-free and have a uniform appearance. The Contractor shall apply the compound at the manufacturer’s recommended rate to produce a surface free of dusting action and yet provide easy removal of the forms.
The Engineer may reject forms that will not produce a satisfactory surface. 6-02.3(17)K
Concrete Forms on Steel Spans
Concrete forms on all steel Structures shall be removable and shall not remain in place.
Where needed, the forms shall have openings for truss or girder members. Each opening shall be large enough to leave at least 1½ inches between the concrete and steel on all sides of the steel member after the forms have been removed. Unit Contract prices cover all costs related to these openings.
The Contractor shall not weld any part of the form to steel members.

Restricted Overhead Clearance Sign 6-02.3(17)M1 Vehicular Traffic
The Contractor shall notify the Engineer not less than 15 working days before the anticipated start of each falsework and girder erection operation whenever such falsework or girders will reduce clearances available to the public traffic. Falsework openings shall not be more restrictive to traffic than shown in the Contract Plans.
Where the height of vehicular openings through falsework is less than 15 feet, a W 12-2 “Low Clearance Symbol Sign” shall be erected on the Shoulder in advance of the falsework and two or more W 12-301 and/or W 12-302 signs shall be attached to the falsework to provide accurate usable clearance information over the entire falsework opening. The posted low clearance shall include an allowance for anticipated falsework girder deflection (rounded-up to the next whole inch) due to design dead load, including all successive concrete pours. W 12-302 signs shall be used to designate prominent clearance restrictions and limits of usable clearance. In addition, where the clearance is less than the legal height limit (14 feet), a W 12-2 sign shall be erected in advance of the nearest intersecting road or wide point in the road at which a vehicle can detour or turn around.
A W 13-501 sign indicating the distance to the low clearance shall be installed below the advance sign. The Engineer will furnish the above noted signs and the Contractor shall erect and maintain them, all in accordance with Section 1-10.3(3). 6-02.3(17)M2 Railroad Traffic

Prestressing
Each stressing system shall have a pressure gauge or load cell that will measure jacking force. The gauge shall display pressure accurately and readably with a dial at least 6 inches in diameter or with a digital display. Each jack and its gauge shall be calibrated as a unit and shall be accompanied by a certified calibration chart. The Contractor shall submit a Type 1 Working Drawing consisting of one copy of this chart. The cylinder extension during calibration shall be in approximately the position it will occupy at final jacking force.
Jacks and gauges shall be recalibrated and recertified: 1.
Annually, 2.
After any repair or adjustment, and 3.
Anytime there are indications that the jack calibration is in error.
The Engineer may use load cells to check jacks, gauges, and calibration charts before and during tensioning.
All load cells shall be calibrated and shall have an indicator that shows prestressing force in the strand. The range of this cell shall be broad enough that the lowest 10 percent of the manufacturer’s rated capacity will not be used to measure jacking force.
From manufacture to encasement in concrete, prestressing strand shall be protected against dirt, oil, grease, damage, and all corrosives. Strand shall be stored in a dry, covered area and shall be kept in the manufacturer’s original packaging until placement in the forms. If prestressing strand has been damaged or pitted, it will be rejected. Prestressing strand with rust shall be spot-cleaned with a nonmetallic pad to inspect for any sign of pitting or section loss. Once the prestressing steel has been installed, no welds or grounds for welders shall be made on the forms or the steel in the girder, except as specified.
When the Plans require temporary strands, they may be pretensioned or post-tensioned.

The Contractor shall not tension the post-tensioning reinforcement until the concrete in the cast-in-place closures reaches the minimum compressive strength specified in the Plans. This strength shall be measured with concrete cylinders made of the same concrete and cured under the same conditions as the cast-in-place closures. 3.
All post-tensioning shall be completed before placing the sidewalks and barriers on the Superstructure. 6-02.3(25)C
Casting
Side forms shall be steel except that cast-in-place concrete closure forms for spliced prestressed concrete girders, interior forms of prestressed concrete tub girders, and end bulkhead forms of prestressed concrete girders may be wood. Interior voids for prestressed concrete slab girders with voids shall be formed by either wax soaked cardboard or expanded polystyrene forms. The interior void forms shall be secured in the position as shown in the Working Drawings, and shall remain in place.
All concrete mixes to be used shall be preapproved in the WSDOT plant certification process. The temperature of the concrete when placed shall be between 50°F and 90°F.
Slump shall not exceed 4 inches for normal concrete nor 7 inches with the use of a high range water-reducing admixture, nor 9 inches when both a high range water-reducing admixture is used and the water/cement ratio is less than or equal to 0.35. For selfconsolidating concrete (SCC), the slump requirements specified above do not apply, and are instead replaced by the target slump flow and slump flow range specified as part of the SCC mix design.
Air-entrainment is not required in the concrete placed into prestressed concrete girders, cast-in-place concrete closures for spliced prestressed concrete girders, and prestressed concrete partial-depth stay-in-place panels, provided that the water/cement ratio is less than or equal to 0.45. 6-02.3(25)C1 Acceptance Testing of Concrete for Prestressed Concrete Girders

Curing
During curing, the Contractor shall keep the girder in a saturated curing atmosphere until the girder concrete has reached the required release strength. If the Engineer concurs, the
Contractor may shorten curing time by heating the outside of impervious forms. Heat may be radiant, convection, conducted steam, or hot air. With steam, the arrangement shall envelop the entire surface with saturated steam. Hot air curing will not be allowed, unless the Contractor submits Type 2 Working Drawings consisting of the proposed method to envelop and maintain the girder in a saturated atmosphere. Saturated atmosphere means a relative humidity of at least 90 percent. The Contractor shall never allow dry heat to touch the girder surface at any point.
Under heat curing methods, the Contractor shall: 1.
Keep all unformed girder surfaces in a saturated atmosphere throughout the curing time; 2.
Embed a thermocouple (linked with a thermometer accurate to plus or minus 5°F)
6 to 8 inches from the top or bottom of the girder on its centerline and near its midpoint; 3.
Monitor with a recording sensor (accurate to plus or minus 5°F) arranged and calibrated to continuously record, date, and identify concrete temperature throughout the heating cycle;

4.
Make this temperature record available for the Engineer to inspect; 5.
Heat concrete to no more than 100°F during the first 2 hours after placing the concrete, and then increase no more than 25°F per hour to a maximum of 175°F; 6.
Cool concrete, after curing is complete, no more than 25°F per hour, to 100°F; and 7.
Keep the temperature of the concrete above 60°F until the girder reaches release strength.
The Contractor may strip side forms from prestressed concrete girders once the concrete has reached a minimum compressive strength of 3,000 psi. All damage from stripping is the Contractor’s responsibility.
Curing of cast-in-place concrete closures for spliced prestressed concrete girders shall conform to Section 6-02.3(11). 6-02.3(25)E
Contractors Control Strength
Concrete strength shall be measured on test cylinders cast from the same concrete as that in the girder. These cylinders shall be cured under time-temperature relationships and conditions that simulate those of the girder. If the forms are heated by steam or hot air, test cylinders will remain in the coolest zone throughout curing. If forms are heated another way, the Contractor shall provide a record of the curing time-temperature relationship for the cylinders for each girder to the Engineer. When two or more girders are cast in a continuous line and in a continuous pour, a single set of test cylinders may represent all girders provided the Contractor demonstrates uniformity of casting and curing to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
The Contractor shall mold, cure, and test enough of these cylinders to satisfy Specification requirements for measuring concrete strength. The Contractor may use 4- by 8-inch or 6- by 12-inch cylinders.
Test cylinders may be cured in a moist room or water tank in accordance with FOP for
AASHTO R 100 after the girder concrete has obtained the required release strength. If, however, the Contractor intends to ship the girder prior to the standard 28-day strength test, the design strength for shipping shall be determined from cylinders placed with the girder and cured under the same conditions as the girder. These cylinders may be placed in an unninsulated, moisture-proof envelope.

Concrete Structures
To measure concrete strength in the girder, the Contractor shall randomly select two test cylinders. The average compressive strength of the two cylinders shall be equal or greater than the specified strength and neither cylinder shall have a compressive strength that is more than 5 percent below the specified strength.
If too few cylinders were molded to carry out all required tests on the girder, the
Contractor shall sample and test cores from the girder under the surveillance of the
Engineer. Cores sampled from one girder may not be used to represent any other girder, regardless of whether the girders were cast in a continuous line or pour. Cores shall avoid all prestressing strands, steel reinforcing bars and interior voids.
For prestressed concrete slab girders, a test shall consist of four cores measuring 3 inches in diameter by 6 inches in length (for slabs) or by the thickness of the web (for ribbed and double tee sections). Two cores shall be taken from each side of the girder with one on each side of the girder span midpoint, at locations accepted by the Engineer. The core locations for prestressed concrete ribbed and double tee sections shall be immediately beneath the top flange.
For prestressed concrete tub girders, a test shall consist of four cores measuring 3 inches in diameter by the thickness of the web. Two cores shall be taken from each web approximately 3 feet to the left and to the right of the center of the girder span.
For all other prestressed concrete girders, a test shall consist of three cores measuring
3 inches in diameter by the thickness of the web and shall be removed from just below the top flange; one at the midpoint of the girder’s length and the other two approximately
3 feet to the left and approximately 3 feet to the right.
The cores shall be taken in accordance with AASHTO T 24 and shall be tested in accordance with AASHTO T 22. The Engineer may accept the girder if the average compressive strength of the all test cores from the girder are at least 85 percent of the specified compressive strength with no one core less than 75 percent of specified compressive strength. If there are more than four cored holes in a girder, the prestressing reinforcement shall not be released until the holes are patched and the patch material has attained a minimum compressive strength equal to the required release compressive strength.
All cored holes shall be patched and cured prior to shipment of the girder. The girder shall not be shipped until tests show the patch material has attained a minimum compressive strength of 4,000 psi.
If the annual plant approval includes procedures for patching cored holes, the cored holes shall be patched in accordance with this procedure. Otherwise, the Contractor shall submit a core hole patching procedure as a Type 2 Working Drawing. 6-02.3(25)F

Prestress Release
Side and flange forms that restrain deflection shall be removed before release of the prestressing reinforcement.
All strands shall be released in a way that will minimize eccentricity of the prestressing force about the centerline of the girder. This release shall not occur until tests show each girder has reached the minimum compressive strength required by the Plans.
The Contractor may request permission to release the prestressing reinforcement at a minimum concrete compressive strength less than specified in the Plans. This request shall be submitted as a Type 2E Working Drawing analyzing changes in vertical deflection, girder lateral stability and concrete stresses in accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)L2. 6-02.3(25)G
Protection of Exposed Reinforcement
When a girder is removed from its casting bed, all prestressing reinforcement strands projecting from the girder shall be cleaned and painted with a minimum dry film thickness of 1 mil of paint conforming to Section 9-08.1(2)B, and all steel reinforcing bars, including
Page 6-122
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02 welded wire fabric, projecting from the girder shall be protected in accordance with
Section 6-02.3(24)B. During handling and shipping, projecting reinforcement shall be protected from bending or breaking. Just before placing concrete around the painted projecting bars or strands, the Contractor shall remove from them all spattered concrete remaining from girder casting, dirt, oil, and other foreign matter. 6-02.3(25)H
Finishing

The Contractor shall apply a Class 1 finish, as defined in Section 6-02.3(14), to: 1.
The exterior surfaces of the outside girders; and 2.
The bottoms, sides, and tops of the lower flanges on all girders, including the top of the bottom slab between the tub girder webs.
All other girder surfaces shall receive a Class 2 finish.
The interface on girders that contact a cast-in-place concrete deck shall have a finish of dense, screeded concrete without a smooth sheen or laitance on the surface. After vibrating and screeding, and just before the concrete reaches initial set, the Contractor shall texture the interface. This texture shall be applied with a steel brooming tool that etches the surface transversely leaving grooves ⅛ to ¼ inch wide, between ⅛ and ¼ inch deep, and spaced ¼ to ½ inch apart.
On prestressed concrete wide flange deck girders, deck bulb tee girders, ribbed section girders and double tee girders, the Contractor shall test the top surface for flatness and make corrections in accordance with Section 6-02.3(10)D3 except that the straightedge need not exceed the width of the girder top flange when checking the transverse direction. The top surface shall be finished in accordance with Section 6-02.3(10)D6.
The Contractor may repair defects in prestressed concrete girders in accordance with
Section 6-01.16. 6-02.3(25)I

Page 6-124
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02
Horizontal alignment of the top and bottom flanges shall be checked and recorded.
Alternatively, the Contractor may check and record the horizontal alignment of the web near mid-height of the girder. Each check shall be made by measuring the maximum offset at mid-span relative to a chord that starts and stops at the girder ends. The Contractor shall check and record the alignment at a time when the girder is not influenced by temporary differences in surface temperature. Records for the initial check (item 1 above) shall be included in the Contractor’s prestressed concrete certificate of compliance.

Contractor shall perform and record each check at a time when the alignment of the girder is not influenced by temporary differences in surface temperature. Records for the initial check (Item 1 above) shall be included in the Contractor’s Prestressed
Concrete Certificate of Compliance. Records for all other checks shall be submitted as a
Type 1 Working Drawing.
Girders with vertical deflections not meeting the limit shown in the Plans for the shipment check (item 2 above) shall require an analysis of girder lateral stability and stresses in accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)L2. The Contractor shall perform this analysis and submit it as a Type 2E Working Drawing prior to shipment.
The “D” dimensions shown in the Plans are computed upper and lower bounds of girder vertical deflections at midspan based on a time lapse of 40 and 120 days after release of the prestressing strands. Temporary top strands are assumed to be cut 30 days prior to these elapsed times (10 and 90 days after release of the prestressing strands). Diaphragms are assumed to be placed. The “D” dimensions are intended to advise the Contractor of the expected range of girder vertical deflection at the time of deck placement. A positive (+) “D” dimension indicates upward deflection.

If the girder vertical deflection measured for the erection check (item 3 above) is not between the lower “D” dimension bound shown in the Plans and the upper “D” dimension bound shown in the Plans plus ¾ inches, the Engineer may require corrective action. The
Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working Drawing for all required corrective actions. 6-02.3(25)L
Handling and Storage
The Contractor shall be responsible for safely lifting, shipping, and erecting prestressed concrete girders.
During handling and storage, each prestressed concrete girder shall always be kept plumb and upright. It shall be lifted only by the lifting embedments (strand lift loops or highstrength threaded steel bars) at either end.
The Contract documents may provide shipping and handling details for girders including lifting embedment locations (L), shipping support locations (L1 and L2), minimum shipping support rotational spring constants (Kθ), minimum shipping support center-tocenter wheel spacings (Wcc), vertical deflections and number of temporary top strands.
These shipping and handling details have been determined in accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)L2 and are suggested only.
The Contractor shall submit a Type 2E Working Drawing analyzing girder lateral stability and concrete stresses during lifting, storage, shipping and erection in accordance with
Section 6-02.3(25)L2 in the following cases: 1.

If any of the analysis assumptions listed in Section 6-02.3(25)L2 are invalid.
Determination of validity shall be made by the Contractor, except that analysis assumptions shall be considered invalid if the actual values are outside of the provided tolerances. 2.
If the Contractor intends to use shipping and handling configurations or details different than those in the Contract documents, or if the Contractor intends to handle the girder with temporary works or appurtenances attached to the girder. If the only deviation from the listed assumptions is to the location of the shipping support points such that stability is improved, the concrete stresses shall be analyzed, but the lateral stability may be waived. 3.
If the Contract documents do not provide shipping and handling details. 6-02.3(25)L1
Lifting and Handling Devices
For strand lift loops in girders with a maximum depth of 3 feet, only ½-inch diameter or 0.6-inch diameter strand conforming to Section 9-07.10 shall be used, and a minimum 2-inch diameter straight pin of a shackle shall be used through the loops. Multiple loops shall be held level in the girder during casting in a manner that allows each loop to carry its share of the load during lifting. The minimum distance from the end of the girder to the centroid of the strand lift loops shall be 3 feet. The loops for all prestressed concrete girders shall project a minimum of 1′-6″ from the top of the girder. Loops shall extend to within 3 inches clear of the bottom of the girder, terminating with a 9-inch long 90-degree hook. Loads on individual loops shall be limited to 12 kips, and the angle between a lifting cable and the top of the girder shall not be less than 60 degrees.
For high-strength threaded steel bars, a minimum of two 1⅜-inch diameter bars conforming to Section 9-07.11 shall be used at each end of the girder. The lifting hardware that connects to the bars shall be designed, detailed, and furnished by the
Contractor. The minimum distance from the end of the girder to the centroid of the lifting bars shall be 3 feet. Lifting bars shall extend to within 3 inches of the bottom of the girder and shall be anchored in the bottom flange with steel plates and nuts. The minimum size of embedded plates for lifting bars shall be ½ inch thick by 3 inches square. Lifting forces on the lifting bars shall not exceed 58 kips on an individual bar and shall be within
10 degrees of perpendicular to the top of the girder.

The analysis shall address all effects on girder vertical deflection (camber), “A” dimensions at centerline of bearings and deck screed cambers (C).
Suggested shipping and handling details provided in the Contract documents have been determined using the following analysis assumptions, unless shown otherwise: 1.
Girder dimensions, strand locations and lifting embedment locations are within the tolerances specified in Section 6-02.3(25)I. 2.
Girder horizontal alignment (sweep) is within the tolerance specified in
Section 6-02.3(25)J. 3.
Girder vertical deflection (camber) at midspan is less than or equal to the maximum midspan vertical deflection at shipping shown in the Plans. 4.
Minimum concrete compressive strength at release (f’ci) has been reached before initial lifting from casting bed. Minimum concrete compressive strength at 28 days (f’c) has been reached before shipping.

5.
Lifting lines are plumb. 6.
Height of girder bottom above roadway at shipping supports is less than or equal to
72 inches. 7.
Height of shipping support roll center above roadway is 24 inches, ± 2 inches. 8.
Shipping support longitudinal placement (L1 and L2) tolerance is ± 6 inches. 9.
Shipping support lateral placement tolerance is ±1 inches. 10. Shipping supports provide the minimum shipping support rotational spring constant (Kθ) and minimum shipping support center-to-center wheel spacings (Wcc) shown in the Plans. 11. For shipping at highway speeds a ±20 percent dynamic load allowance (impact) is included with a typical roadway superelevation of 2 percent. 12. For turning at slow speeds, no dynamic load allowance (impact) is included with a maximum roadway superelevation of 6 percent. 13. Wind, centrifugal and seismic forces are not considered. 14. Configurations where a girder is hanging from a lifting line at one end and seated without a lifting line connected at the other end are not considered. 15. Temporary works or appurtenances are not attached to the girder. 6-02.3(25)L3
Girder Storage
If girders are to be stored, the Contractor shall place them on a stable foundation that will keep them in a vertical position. Stored girders shall be supported at the bearing recesses or, if there are no recesses, approximately 2 to 3 feet from the girder ends. After posttensioning, spliced prestressed concrete girders shall be supported at points between
2 and 5 feet from the girder ends, unless otherwise shown in the Plans. For long-term storage of girders with initial horizontal curvature, the Contractor may wedge one side of the bottom flange, tilting the girders to control curvature. If the Contractor elects to set girders out of plumb during storage, the Contractor shall have the proposed method analyzed by the Contractor’s engineer to ensure against damaging the girder. 6-02.3(25)L4

Girder Shipping
After the girder has reached its 28-day design strength, the girder and a completed
Certification of Compliance, signed by a Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute Certified
Technician or a Professional Engineer, shall be submitted to the Engineer for inspection.
If the Engineer finds the certification and the girder to be acceptable, the Engineer will stamp the girder “Approved for Shipment”.
Page 6-128
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02
No prestressed concrete slab girder shall be shipped for at least 3 days after concrete placement. No prestressed concrete wide flange deck, deck bulb tee or tub girder shall be shipped for at least 7 days after concrete placement, except that they may be shipped
3 days after concrete placement when L/(bd) is less than or equal to 5.0, where L equals the shipping length of the girder, b equals the girder top flange width (for prestressed concrete wide flange deck and deck bulb tee girders) or the bottom flange width (for prestressed concrete tub girders), and d equals the girder depth, all in feet. No other girder shall be shipped for at least 10 days after concrete placement.
Girder support locations during shipping shall be no closer than the girder depth to the ends of the girder at the girder centerline.
If the Contractor elects to assemble spliced prestressed concrete girders into shipping configurations not shown in the Contract documents, the Contractor shall submit a Type 2E Working Drawing analyzing girder lateral stability and concrete stresses in accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)L2 before shipping. 6-02.3(25)L5

Girder Erection
Before erecting prestressed concrete girders, the Contractor shall submit an erection plan as a Type 2E Working Drawing. The erection plan shall provide complete details of the erection process including at a minimum: 1.
Temporary falsework support, bracing, guys, gravity anchors, and attachments to other Structure components or objects; 2.
Procedure and sequence of operation; 3.
Girder stresses during progressive stages of erection in accordance with
Section 6-02.3(25)L2; 4.
Girder weights, lift points, lifting embedments and devices, spreaders, and angle of lifting cables in accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)L, etc.; 5.
Crane(s) make and model, mass, geometry, lift capacity, outrigger size, and reactions; 6.
Girder launcher or trolley details and capacity (if intended for use); 7.
Locations of cranes, barges, trucks delivering girders, and the location of cranes and outriggers relative to other Structures, including retaining walls and wing walls; and

8.
Plans and calculations for all temporary support and bracing systems to resist all anticipated construction loads through construction of the bridge deck. 9.
Methods for measuring and adjusting plumbness at girder ends.
The erection plan shall include drawings, notes, catalog cuts, and calculations clearly showing the above listed details, assumptions, and dimensions. Material properties and specifications, structural analysis, and all other data used shall also be included.
The concrete in piers and crossbeams shall reach at least 80 percent of design strength before girders are placed on them.
The Contractor shall hoist girders only by the lifting embedments at the ends, always keeping the girders plumb and upright. When the girders are to receive a cast-in-place concrete deck, lifting embedments shall be removed after erection to provide a minimum 2½-inch clearance to the top of the deck. When the girders are not to receive a cast-inplace concrete deck, lifting embedments shall be removed 1-inch below the girder surface and grouted with an epoxy grout conforming to Section 9-26.3(1)A.
The girders shall be braced in accordance with Sections 6-02.3(17)F4 and 6-02.3(17)F5.
When temporary strands in the top flange are used, they shall be cut after the girders are braced and before the girder deflections are equalized and the intermediate diaphragms are cast.

Assembling and Bolting
To begin bolting any field connection or splice, the Contractor shall install and tighten to snug tight enough bolts to bring all parts into full contact with each other prior to tightening these bolts to the specified minimum tension. “Snug tight” means either the tightness reached by (l) a few blows from an impact wrench or (2) the full effort of a person using a spud wrench.
As erection proceeds, all field connections and splices for each member shall be securely drift pinned and bolted in accordance with 1 or 2 below before the weight of the member can be released or the next member is added. Field erection drawings shall specify pinning and bolting requirements that meet or exceed the following minimums: 1.
Joints in Normal Structures – Fifty percent of the holes in a single field connection and 50 percent of the holes on each side of a single joint in a splice plate shall be filled with drift pins and bolts. Thirty percent of the filled holes shall be pinned.
Seventy percent of the filled holes shall be bolted and tightened to snug tight. Once all these bolts are snug tight, each bolt shall be systematically tightened to the specified minimum tension. “Systematically tightened” means beginning with bolts in the most rigid part, which is usually the center of the joint, and working out to its free edges. The fully tensioned bolts shall be located near the middle of a single field connection or a single splice plate. 2.
Joints in Cantilevered Structures – Seventy-five percent of the holes in a single field connection and 75 percent of the holes on each side of a single joint in a splice plate shall be filled with drift pins and bolts. Fifty percent of the filled holes shall be pinned.
Fifty percent of the filled holes shall be bolted and tightened to snug tight. Once all these bolts are snug tight, each bolt shall be systematically tightened to the specified minimum tension. The fully tensioned bolts shall be located near the middle of a single field connection or a single splice plate.

Cylindrical erection pins (drift pins) shall be placed throughout each field connection and each field joint with the greatest concentration in the outer edges of a splice plate or member being bolted. Drift pins shall be double-tapered barrel pins of hardened steel. The diameter of the drift pins shall be at least 1/32 inch larger than the diameter of the bolts in the connection or the full hole diameter.
To complete a joint following one of the methods listed above, the Contractor shall fill all remaining holes of the field connection or splice plate with bolts and tighten to snug tight. Once all of these bolts are snug tight, each bolt shall be systematically tightened to the specified minimum tension. After these bolts are tightened to the specified minimum tension, the Contractor shall replace the drift pins with bolts tightened to the specified minimum tension.
The Contractor shall complete the joint or connection within ten calendar days of installing the first bolt or within a duration approved by the Engineer. Any bolts inserted in an incomplete connection, either loose or tightened snug-tight, which exceed the specified duration for completing the connection, shall be subject to the following requirements: 1.
Three assemblies for each size and length shall be removed from connection(s) that are to be tensioned. Rotational capacity tests shall be performed on the removed assemblies to demonstrate the assembly has sufficient lubricant to be tensioned satisfactorily. 2.
Five assemblies shall be removed from the connection to establish the inspection torque. 3.
In the case of tension controlled bolts, three assemblies shall be removed and tested in accordance with Section 6-03.3(33)A to verify the minimum specified tension can be achieved prior to shearing of the spline.
Page 6-150
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Steel Structures 6-03
Assemblies removed for the purpose of rotational capacity testing, determination of the inspection torques, or verification of tension controlled bolt performance shall be replaced with new bolts at no additional expense to the Contracting Agency. To minimize the number of removed assemblies, the Contractor may combine rotational capacity testing and inspection torque determination as approved by the Engineer.
The Contractor may complete a field bolted connection or splice in a continuous operation before releasing the mass of the member or adding the next member. The
Contractor shall utilize drift pins to align the connection. The alignment drift pins shall fill between 15 and 30 percent of the holes in a single field connection and between 15 and
30 percent of the holes on each side of a single joint in a splice plate. Once the alignment drift pins are in place, all remaining holes shall be filled with bolts and tightened to snug tight starting from near the middle and proceeding toward the outer gage lines. Once all of these bolts are snug tight, the Contractor shall systematically tighten all these bolts to the specified minimum tension. The Contractor shall then replace the drift pins with bolts.
Each of these bolts shall be tightened to the specified minimum tension.
All bolts shall be placed with heads toward the outside and underside of the bridge. All high-strength bolts shall be installed and tightened before the falsework is removed.
The Contractor may erect metal railings as erection proceeds. But railings shall not be bolted or adjusted permanently until the falsework is released and the deck placed.
The Contractor shall not begin painting until the Engineer has inspected and accepted field bolting. 6-03.3(33)

Bolted Connections

Where the outer face of the bolted parts has a slope greater than 1:20 with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis, a beveled washer shall be used. 3.
Washers shall not be stacked unless otherwise specified by the Engineer. 4.
It is acceptable to place a washer under the unturned element.
All galvanized nuts shall be lubricated by the manufacturer with a lubricant containing a visible dye so a visual check for the lubricant can be made at the time of field installation.
Black bolts shall be lubricated by the manufacturer and shall be “oily” to the touch when installed.
After assembly, bolted parts shall fit solidly together. They shall not be separated by washers, gaskets, or any other material. Assembled joint surfaces, including those next to bolt heads, nuts, and washers, shall be free of loose mill scale, burrs, dirt, and other foreign material that would prevent solid seating.
When all bolts in a joint are tight, each bolt shall carry at least the proof load shown in
Table 1 below:

Prior to final tightening of any bolts in a bolted connection, the connection shall be compacted to a snug tight condition. Snug tight shall include bringing all plies of the connection into firm contact and snug tightening all bolts in accordance with
Section 6-03.3(32).
Final tightening may be done by the Turn-of-Nut Method, the direct-tension indicator method, or the twist off-type tension control structural bolt/nut/washer assembly method. Preferably, the nut shall be turned tight while the bolt is prevented from rotating.
However, if required by either turn-of-nut or direct-tension-indicator methods because of bolt entering and/or wrench operational clearances, tightening may be done by turning the bolt while the nut is prevented from rotating. 1.
Turn-of-Nut Method – After all specified bolting conditions are satisfied, and before final tightening, the Contractor shall match-mark with crayon or paint the outer face of each nut and the protruding part of the bolt. Each bolt shall be final tightened to the specified minimum tension by rotating the amount specified in Table 2. To ensure this tightening method is followed, the Engineer will (1) observe as the Contractor installs, snug tightens, and final tightens all bolts and (2) inspect each match-mark.

D = nominal bolt diameter of bolt being tightened.
When bolt length exceeds 12D, the rotation shall be determined by actual tests in which a suitable tension device simulates actual conditions. 2.

Direct Tension Indicator Method (DTIs). DTIs shall be placed under the bolt head with the protrusions facing the bolt head when the nut is turned. DTIs shall be placed under the nut with the protrusions facing the nut when the bolt is turned. DTIs may be placed under the turned element only if a hardened washer is used to separate the turned element from the DTI.
Gap refusal shall be measured with a 0.005 inch tapered feeler gage. After all specified bolting conditions are satisfied, the snug tightened gaps shall meet Table 3 snug tight limits.
Each bolt shall be final-tightened to meet Table 3 final-tighten limits. If the bolt is tensioned so that no visible gap in any space remains, the bolt and DTI shall be removed and replaced by a new properly tensioned bolt and DTI.
The Contractor shall tension all bolts, inspecting all DTIs with a feeler gage, in the presence of the Engineer. DTIs shall be installed by two-person (or more) crews, with one individual (1) preventing the element at the DTI from turning and (2) measuring the gap of the DTI to determine the proper tension of the bolt.
If a bolt, that has had its DTI brought to full load, loosens during the course of bolting the connection, it shall be rejected. Reuse of the bolt and nut are subject to the provisions of this section. The used DTI shall not be reinstalled.

Twist Off-Type Tension Control Structural Bolt/Nut/Washer Assembly Method (Tension Control Bolt Assembly) – Tension control bolt assemblies shall include the bolt, nut, and washer(s) packaged and shipped as a single assembly. Unless otherwise accepted by the Engineer, tension control bolt assembly components shall not be interchanged for testing or installation and shall comply with all provisions of ASTM
F3125 Grade F1852. If accepted by the Engineer, the tension control bolt assembly components may be interchanged within the same component lot for girder web splices or other locations where access to both sides of the connection is restricted.
The tension control bolts shall incorporate a design feature intended to either indirectly indicate, or to automatically provide, the minimum tension specified in
Table 1.
The Contractor shall submit Type 1 Working Drawings of the tension control bolt assembly, including bolt capacities; type of bolt, nut, and washer lubricant; method of packaging and protection of the lubricated bolt; installation equipment; calibration equipment; and installation procedures.
The tension control bolt manufacturer’s installation procedure shall be followed for installation of bolts in the verification testing device, in all calibration devices, and in all structure connections.
In some cases, proper tensioning of the bolts may require more than one cycle of systematic partial tightening prior to final yield or fracture of the tension control element of each bolt. If yield or fracture of the tension control element of a bolt occurs prior to the final tightening cycle, that bolt shall be replaced with a new one.
Additional field verification testing shall be performed as requested by the Engineer.
All bolts and connecting hardware shall be stored and handled in a manner to prevent corrosion and loss of lubricant. Bolts that are installed without the same lubricant coating as tested under the verification test will be rejected, and they shall be removed from the joint and be replaced with new lubricated bolts at no additional cost to the Contracting Agency.

ASTM F3125 Grade A490 bolts, galvanized ASTM F3125 Grade A325 bolts, and ASTM
F3125 Grade F1852 tension control bolt assemblies shall not be reused. Black ASTM
F3125 Grade A325 bolts may be reused once if accepted by the Engineer. All bolts to be reused shall have their threads inspected for distortion by reinstalling the used nut on the

2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Steel Structures 6-03 bolt and turning the nut for the full length of the bolt threads by hand. Bolts to be reused shall be relubricated in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation. Used bolts shall be subject to a rotational capacity test as specified in Section 6-03.3(33)A PreErection Testing. Touching up or retightening bolts previously tightened by the Turn-ofNut Method, which may have been loosened by the tightening of adjacent bolts shall not be considered as reuse, provided the snugging up continues from the initial position and does not require greater rotation, including the tolerance, than that required by Table 2. 6-03.3(33)A
Pre-Erection Testing
High-strength bolt assemblies (bolt, nut, direct tension indicator, and washer), both black and galvanized, shall be subjected to a field rotational capacity test, as outlined below, prior to any permanent fastener installation. For field installations, the rotational capacity test shall be conducted at the jobsite. Each combination of bolt production lot, nut production lot, washer production lot, and direct tension indicator production lot shall be tested as an assembly, except tension control bolt assemblies, which shall be tested as supplied by the manufacturer. Each rotational capacity test shall include three assemblies. Once an assembly passes the rotational capacity test, it is accepted for use for the remainder of the project unless the Engineer deems further testing is necessary. All tests shall be performed in a bolt tension calibrator by the Contractor in the presence of the Engineer. High-strength bolt assemblies used in this test shall not be reused. The bolt assemblies shall meet the following requirements after being pretensioned to 15 percent of the minimum bolt tension in Table 1. The assembly shall be considered as nonconforming if the assembly fails to pass any one of the following specified requirements: 1.
The measured torque to produce the minimum bolt tension shall not exceed the maximum allowed torque value obtained by the following equation:
Torque = 0.25 PD
Where:
Torque = Calculated Torque (foot-pounds)
P		 =
Measured Bolt Tension (pounds)
D		 =
Normal Bolt Diameter (feet)

The maximum recorded tension after the two turns shall be equal to or greater than 1.15 times the minimum bolt tension listed in Table 1. b.
Each assembly shall be successfully installed to the specified number of turns. c.
The fastener components in the assembly shall not exhibit shear failure or stripping of the threads as determined by visual examination of bolt and nut threads following removal. d.
The bolts in the assembly shall not exhibit torsional or torsional/tension failure.
If any specimen fails, the assembly will be rejected. Elongation of the bolt between the bolt head and the nut is not considered to be a failure.
Bolts that are too short to test in the bolt tension calibrator shall be tested in a steel joint. The Contractor shall (1) install the high-strength bolt assemblies (bolt, nut, direct tension indicator, and washer) in a steel joint of the proper thickness; (2) tighten to the snug tight condition; (3) match-mark the outer face of each nut and the protruding part of the bolt with crayon or paint; (4) rotate to the requirements of Table 2; and (5) record the torque that is required to achieve the required amount of rotation. The assembly shall be considered as nonconforming if the assembly fails to pass any one of the following specified requirements:

Three DTIs, per lot, shall be tested in a bolt tension calibrator. The bolts shall be tensioned to 105 percent of the tension shown in Table 1. If all of the DTI protrusions are completely crushed (all five openings with zero gap), this lot of DTIs is rejected.
Three twist off-type tension controlled bolt assemblies, per assembly lot, shall be tested in a bolt tension calibrator. The bolts shall first be tensioned to a snug tight condition.
Tensioning shall then be completed by tightening the assembly nut in a continuous operation using a spline drive installation tool until the spline shears from the bolt. The bolt assembly tension shall meet the requirements of Table 1. If any specimen fails, the assembly lot is rejected. 6-03.3(33)B
Bolting Inspection
The Contractor, in the presence of the Engineer, shall inspect the tightened bolt using a calibrated inspection torque wrench, regardless of bolting method. The Contractor shall supply the inspection torque wrench. Inspection shall be performed within seven calendar days from the completion of each bolted connection or as specified by the Engineer.
If the bolts to be installed are not long enough to fit in the bolt tension calibrator, five bolts of the same grade, size, and condition as those under inspection shall be tested using Direct-Tension-Indicators (DTIs) to measure bolt tension. This tension measurement test shall be done at least once each inspection day. The Contractor shall supply the necessary DTIs. The DTI shall be placed under the bolt head. A washer shall be placed under the nut, which shall be the element turned during the performance of this tension measurement test. Each bolt shall be tightened by any convenient means to the specified minimum tension as indicated by the DTI. The inspecting wrench shall then be applied to the tightened bolt to determine the torque required to turn the nut 5 degrees (approximately 1 inch at a 12-inch radius) in the tightening direction. The job inspection torque shall be taken as the average of three values thus determined after rejecting the high and low values.
Five representative bolts/nuts/washers and DTIs if used (provided by the Contractor) of the same grade, size, and condition as those under inspection shall be placed individually in a bolt tension calibrator to measure bolt tension. This calibration operation shall be
Page 6-156

2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Steel Structures 6-03 done at least once each inspection day. There shall be a washer under the part turned in tightening each bolt if washers are used on the Structure. In the bolt tension calibrator, each bolt shall be tightened by any convenient means to the specified tension. The inspection torque wrench shall then be applied to the tightened bolt to determine the torque required to turn the nut or head 5 degrees (approximately 1 inch at a 12-inch radius) in the tightening direction. The job-inspection torque shall be taken as the average of three values thus determined after rejecting the high and low values.
Ten percent (at least two), or as specified by the Engineer, of the tightened bolts on the
Structure represented by the test bolts shall be selected at random in each connection.
The job-inspection torque shall then be applied to each with the inspecting wrench turned in the tightening direction, with no restraint applied to the opposite end of the bolt. If this torque turns no bolt head or nut, the Contracting Agency will accept the connection as being properly tightened. If the torque turns one or more bolt heads or nuts, the jobinspection torque shall then be applied to all bolts in the connection. Except for tension control bolt assemblies and DTIs with zero gap at all protrusion spaces, any bolt whose head or nut turns at this stage shall be tightened and reinspected. Any tension control bolt assemblies or DTIs that have zero gap at all protrusion spaces shall be replaced if the head or nut turns at this stage.
The Contractor shall submit Type 1 Working Drawings consisting of the manufacturer’s detailed procedure for routine observation to ensure proper use of the tension control bolt assemblies. 6-03.3(34)
Adjusting Pin Nuts
All pin nuts shall be tightened thoroughly. The pins shall be placed so that members bear fully and evenly on the nuts. The pins shall have enough thread to allow burring after the nuts are tightened. 6-03.3(35)

Anchor bolts shall be set in masonry as required in Section 6-02.3(18). Anchor bolts shall be grouted in after the shoes, masonry plates, and keeper plates have been set and the span or series of continuous spans are completely erected and adjusted to line and camber. 6-03.3(36)
Setting and Grouting Masonry Plates

The following procedure applies to masonry plates for all steel spans, including shoes, keeper plates, and turning racks on movable bridges.
To set masonry plates, the Contractor shall: 1.
Set masonry plates on the anchor bolts; 2.
Place steel shims under the masonry plates to position pin centers or bearings to line and grade and in relationship to each other. Steel shims shall be the size and be placed at the locations shown in the Plans; 3.
Level the bases of all masonry plates; 4.
Draw anchor bolt nuts down tight; 5.
Recheck pin centers or bearings for alignment; and 6.
Leave at least ¾ inch of space under each masonry plate for grout.
After the masonry plates have been set and the span or series of continuous spans are completely erected and swung free, the space between the top of the masonry and the top of the concrete bearing seat shall be filled with grout. Main masonry plates for cantilever spans shall be set and grouted in before any steel Work is erected.
Grout shall conform to Section 9-20.3(2) and placement shall be as required in
Section 6-02.3(20).

Swinging the Span
Forms weighing less than 5 pounds per square foot of bridge deck area and uniformly distributed along the steel spans may be placed before the spans swing free on their supports. Steel reinforcing bars or concrete bridge deck shall not be placed on steel spans until the spans swing free on their supports and elevations are recorded. No simple span or any series of continuous spans will be considered as swinging free until all temporary supports have been released. Reinforcing steel or concrete bridge decks shall not be placed on any simple or continuous span steel girder bridge until all its spans are adjusted and its masonry plates, shoes, and keeper plates grouted. For this specification, the structure shall be considered as continuous across hinged joints.
After the falsework is released (spans swung free), the masonry plates, shoes, and keeper plates are grouted, and before any load is applied, the Contractor (or the Engineer if the
Contracting Agency is responsible for surveying) shall survey elevations at the tenth points along the centerline on top of all girders and floorbeams. The Contractor shall calculate the theoretical top of girder or floorbeam flange elevations and compare the calculated elevations to the surveyed elevations. The theoretical pad or haunch depth shown in the Plans shall be increased or decreased by the difference between the theoretical and surveyed top of girder or floorbeam elevations. The soffit (deck formwork) shall be set based on the Plan bridge deck thickness and the adjusted pad or haunch depth.

Construction Requirements
Piling Terms
Concrete Piles – Concrete piling may be precast or precast-prestressed concrete, or steel casings driven to the ultimate bearing resistance called for in the Contract which are filled with concrete (cast-in-place) after driving.
Steel Piles – Steel piles may be open-ended or closed-ended pipe piles, or H-piles.
Overdriving – Over-driving of piles occurs when the ultimate bearing resistance calculated from the equation in Section 6-05.3(12), or the wave equation driving criteria if applicable, exceeds the ultimate bearing resistance required in the Contract in order to reach the minimum tip elevation specified in the Contract, or as required by the Engineer.
Maximum Driving Resistance – The maximum driving resistance is either the pile ultimate bearing resistance, or ultimate bearing resistance plus overdriving to reach minimum tip elevation as specified in the Contract, whichever is greater.
Wave Equation Analysis – Wave equation analysis is an analysis performed using the wave equation analysis program (WEAP) with a version dated 1987 or later. The wave equation may be used as specified herein to verify the Contractor’s proposed pile driving system. The pile driving system includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the pile, the hammer, the helmet, and cushions. The wave equation may also be used by the Engineer to determine pile driving criteria as may be required in the Contract.
Ultimate Bearing Resistance – Ultimate bearing resistance refers to the vertical load carrying resistance (in units of force) of a pile as determined by the equation in Section 6-05.3(12), the wave equation analysis, pile driving analyzer and CAPWAP, static load test, or any other means as may be required by the Contract, or the Engineer.
Allowable Bearing Resistance – Allowable bearing resistance is the ultimate bearing resistance divided by a factor of safety. The Contract may state the factor of safety to be used in calculating the allowable bearing resistance from the ultimate bearing resistance.
In the absence of a specified factor of safety, a value of three shall be used.

2024 Standard Specifications

Piling
Rated Hammer Energy – The rated energy represents the theoretical maximum amount of gross energy that a pile driving hammer can generate. The rated energy of a pile driving hammer will be stated in the hammer manufacturer’s catalog or Specifications for that pile driving hammer.
Developed Hammer Energy – The developed hammer energy is the actual amount of gross energy produced by the hammer for a given blow. This value will never exceed the rated hammer energy. The developed energy may be calculated as the ram weight times the drop (or stroke) for drop, single acting hydraulic, single acting air/steam, and open-ended diesel hammers. For double acting hydraulic and air/steam hammers, the developed hammer energy shall be calculated from ram impact velocity measurements or other means approved by the Engineer. For closed-ended diesel hammers, the developed energy shall be calculated from the measured bounce chamber pressure for a given blow. Hammer manufacturer calibration data may be used to correlate bounce chamber pressure to developed hammer energy. For a single acting diesel hammer the developed energy is determined using the blows per minute.
Transferred Hammer Energy – The transferred hammer energy is the amount of energy transferred to the pile for a given blow. This value will never exceed the developed hammer energy. Factors that cause transferred hammer energy to be lower than the developed hammer energy include friction during the ram down stroke, energy retained in the ram and helmet during rebound, and other impact losses. The transferred energy can only be measured directly by use of sensors attached to the pile. A pile driving analyzer (PDA) may be used to measure transferred energy.
Pile Driving Analyzer – A pile driving analyzer (PDA) is a device that can measure the transferred energy of a pile driving system, the compressive and tensile stresses induced in the pile due to driving, the bending stresses induced by hammer misalignment with the pile, and estimate the ultimate resistance of a pile at a given blow.
Pile Driving System – The pile driving system includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the hammer, leads, helmet or cap, cushion and pile.
Helmet – The helmet, also termed the cap, drive cap, or driving head, is used to transmit impact forces from the hammer ram to the pile top as uniformly as possible across the pile top such that the impact force of the ram is transmitted axially to the pile. The term helmet can refer to the complete impact force transfer system, which includes the anvil or striker plate, hammer cushion and cushion block, and a pile cushion if used, or just the single piece unit into which these other components fit. The helmet does not include a follower, if one is used. For hydraulic hammers, the helmet is sometimes referred to as the anvil.
Hammer Cushion – The hammer cushion is a disk of material placed on top of the helmet but below the anvil or striker plate to relieve impact shock, thus protecting the hammer and the pile.
Pile Cushion – The pile cushion is a disk of material placed between the helmet and the pile top to relieve impact shock, primarily to protect the pile.
Follower – A follower is a structural member placed between the hammer assembly, which includes the helmet, and the pile top when the pile head is below the reach of the hammer.
Pile Driving Refusal – Pile driving refusal is defined as 15 blows per inch for the last
4 inches of driving. This is the maximum blow count allowed during overdriving.
Minimum Tip Elevation – The minimum tip elevation is the elevation to which the pile tip shall be driven. Driving deeper in order to obtain the required ultimate bearing resistance may be required.

2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Piling 6-05.3(2) 6-05
Ordering Piling
The Contractor shall order all piling (except cast-in-place concrete and steel piles) from an itemized list the Engineer will provide. This list, showing the number and lengths of piles required, will be based on test-pile driving (or other) data. The list will show lengths below the cutoff point. The Contractor shall supply (and bear the cost of supplying) all additional lengths required for handling or driving.
The Contractor shall assume all responsibility for buying more or longer piles than those shown on the list provided by the Engineer. All piles purchased on the basis of the
Engineer’s list but not used in the finished Structure shall become the property of the
Contracting Agency. The Contractor shall deliver these as the Engineer directs. The pile cutoffs that are 8 feet or under and longer ones the Contracting Agency does not require shall become the property of the Contractor.
When ordering steel casings for cast-in-place concrete and steel piling, the Contractor shall base lengths on information derived from driving test piles and from subsurface data.
The Contractor shall also select the wall thickness of steel piles or steel casings for castin-place piles which will be necessary to prevent damage during driving and handling. The selection of wall thickness for steel piles or steel casings shall also consider the effects of lateral pressures from the soil or due to driving of adjacent piles. Steel piles and steel casings must be strong and rigid enough to resist these pressures without deforming or distorting. The Contractor shall select the wall thickness based on information derived from test piles, subsurface data and/or wave equation analysis.
Wave equation analysis is required prior to ordering piling for piles with specified ultimate bearing resistances of 300 tons or greater. If a wave equation analysis is performed, the
Contractor shall base the selection of wall thickness on the maximum driving resistance identified in the Contract to reach the minimum tip elevation, if the maximum driving resistance is greater than the specified ultimate bearing resistance and if a minimum tip elevation is specified. The wave equation analysis shall be submitted by the Contractor as required in Section 6-05.3(9)A. The Engineer will not supply any list for piling of these types. 6-05.3(3)

Manufacture of Precast Concrete Piling
Precast concrete piles shall consist of concrete sections reinforced to withstand handling and driving stresses. These may be reinforced with deformed steel bars or prestressed with steel strands. The Plans show dimensions and details. If the Plans require piles with square cross-sections, the corners shall be chamfered 1 inch.
Precast or prestressed piles shall meet the requirements of the Standard Plans.
Temporary stress in the prestressing reinforcement of prestressed piles (before loss from creep and shrinkage) shall be 75 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength. (For short periods during manufacture, the reinforcement may be overstressed to 80 percent of ultimate tensile strength if stress after transfer to concrete does not exceed 75 percent of that strength.)
Prestressed concrete piles shall have a final (effective) prestress of at least 1,000 psi.
Unless the Engineer approves splices, all piles shall be full length.
The Contracting Agency intends to perform Quality Assurance Inspection. By its inspection, the Contracting Agency intends only to facilitate the Work and verify the quality of that Work. This inspection shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for identifying and replacing defective material and Work.

Pile Tips and Shoes
The Contracting Agency prefers that timber piles be driven with squared ends. But if conditions require, they may be shod with metal shoes. Pile tips and shoes shall be securely attached to the piles in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Where called for in the Contract, conical steel pile tips shall be used when driving steel casings. The tips shall be inside fit, flush-mounted such that the tip and/or weld bead does not protrude more than 1⁄16 inch beyond the nominal outside diameter of the steel casing.
If conical tips are not specified, the lower end of each casing shall have a steel driving plate that is thick enough to keep the casing watertight and free from distortion as it is driven. The diameter of the steel driving plate shall not be greater than the outside diameter of the steel casing.
Where called for in the Contract, inside-fit cutting shoes shall be used when driving openended steel piles. The cutting shoes shall be flush-mounted such that the shoe and/or weld bead does not protrude more than 1⁄16 inch beyond the nominal outside diameter of the steel pile. The cutting shoe shall be of an inside diameter at least ¾ inch less than the nominal inside diameter of the steel pile.
Pile tips or shoes shall be of a type denoted in the Qualified Products List. If pile tips or shoes other than those denoted in the Qualified Products List are proposed, the
Contractor shall submit Type 2 Working Drawings consisting of shop drawings of the proposed pile tip along with design calculations, Specifications, material chemistry and installation requirements, along with evidence of a pile driving test demonstrating suitability of the proposed pile tip.

Pile Driving Equipment 6-05.3(9)A
Pile Driving Equipment Approval
Prior to driving piles, the Contractor shall submit Type 2 Working Drawings consisting of details of each proposed pile driving system. The pile driving system shall meet the minimum requirements for the various combinations of hammer type and pile type specified in this section. These requirements are minimums and may need to be increased in order to ensure that the required ultimate bearing resistance can be achieved, that minimum tip elevations can be reached, and to prevent pile damage.
The Contractor shall submit Type 2E Working Drawings consisting of a wave equation analysis for all pile driving systems used to drive piling with required maximum driving resistances of greater than 300 tons. The wave equation analysis shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of this section and the user’s manual for the program.
The wave equation analysis shall verify that the pile driving system proposed does not produce stresses greater than 50,000 psi or 90 percent of the yield stress whichever is less, for steel piles, or steel casings for cast-in-place concrete piles. For prestressed concrete piles, the allowable driving stress in kips shall be plus prestress in tension, and 0.85f’c minus prestress in compression, where f’c is the concrete compressive strength in kips per square inch. For precast concrete piles that are not prestressed, the allowable driving stress shall be 70 percent of the yield stress of the steel reinforcement in tension, and 0. 85f’c in compression. The wave equation shall also verify that the pile driving system does not exceed the refusal criteria at the depth of penetration anticipated for achieving the required ultimate bearing resistance and minimum tip elevation.
Furthermore, the wave equation analysis shall verify that at the maximum driving resistance specified in the Contract, the driving resistance is 100 blows per foot or less.
Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, or directed by the Engineer, the following default values shall be used as input to the wave equation analysis program:
Output option (IOUT)
Factor of safety applied to (Rult)
Type of damping
Residual stress option

0 1.0
Smith
No
Rult is the resistance of the pile used in the wave equation analyses. If the ultimate bearing resistance equals the maximum driving resistance, a setup factor of 1.3 may be used in the wave equation analysis to account for pile setup. To use a setup factor in the wave equation analysis, Rult in the analysis is the ultimate bearing resistance divided by 1.3. If the maximum driving resistance exceeds the ultimate bearing resistance, no setup factor should be used, and Rult is equal to the maximum driving resistance of the pile.

For each drop hammer used, the Contractor shall weigh it in the Engineer’s presence or submit a Type 1 Working Drawing consisting of a certificate of its weight. The exact weight shall be stamped on the hammer. Drop hammers shall weigh not less than: 1. 3,000 pounds for piles under 50 feet long that have an ultimate bearing resistance of not more than 60 tons, and 2. 4,000 pounds for piles 50 feet and longer or that have an ultimate bearing resistance of 60 to 90 tons.
If a drop hammer is used for timber piles, it is preferable to use a heavy hammer and operate with a short drop.
For each diesel, hydraulic, steam, or air-driven hammer used, the Contractor shall submit a Type 1 Working Drawing consisting of the manufacturer’s Specifications and catalog.
These shall show all data needed to calculate the developed energy of the hammer used.
Underwater hammers may be used only with permission of the Engineer.
Drop hammers on timber piles shall have a maximum drop of 10 feet. Drop hammers shall not be used to drive timber piles that have ultimate bearing resistance of more than

These requirements for minimum hammer size may be waived if a Type 2E Working
Drawing is submitted consisting of a wave equation analysis demonstrating the ability of the hammer to obtain the required bearing resistance and minimum tip elevation without damage to the pile.
Vibratory hammers may be used to drive piles provided the location and plumbness requirements of this section are met. The required bearing resistance for all piles driven with vibratory hammers will be determined according to Section 6-05.3(12) by driving the pile at least an additional 2 feet using an impact hammer. This method of determining bearing resistance will be accepted provided the blows per inch are either constant or increasing. If the pile cannot be driven 2 feet, the pile will be considered acceptable for bearing if the pile is driven to refusal.
If water jets are used, the number of jets and water volume and pressure shall be enough to erode the material next to the pile at the tip. The equipment shall include a minimum of two water-jet pipes and two ¾ inch jet nozzles. The pump shall produce a constant pressure of at least 100 psi at each nozzle. 6-05.3(9)C
Pile Driving Leads
All piles shall be driven with fixed-lead drivers. The leads shall be fixed on the top and bottom during the pile driving operation. Leads shall be long enough to eliminate the need for followers (except for timber piles as specified in Section 6-05.3(11)E). To avoid bruising or breaking the surface of treated timber piles, the Contractor shall use spuds and chocks as little as possible. In building a trestle or foundation with inclined piles, leads shall be adapted for driving batter piles.
A helmet of the right size for the hammer shall distribute the blow and protect the top of steel piling or casings from driving damage. The helmet shall be positioned symmetrically below the hammer’s striking parts, so that the impact forces are applied concentric to the pile top.
Pile driving leads other than those fixed at the top and bottom may be used to complete driving, if permitted by the Engineer, when all of the following criteria are met: 1.
Each plumb and battered pile is located and initially driven at least 20 feet in true alignment using fixed leads or other approved means.

2.
The pile driving system (hammer, cushion and pile) will be analyzed by Pile Driving
Analyzer (PDA) to verify driving stresses in the pile are not increased due to eccentric loading during driving, and transferred hammer energy is not reduced due to eccentric loading during driving, for all test piles and at least one production pile per pier. Unless otherwise specified, the cost of PDA testing shall be incidental to the various unit Contract prices for driving piles. 6-05.3(10)
Test Piles
If the Contract or the Engineer call for it, the Contractor shall drive test piles to determine pile lengths required to reach the required ultimate bearing resistance, penetration, or both. Test piles shall be: 1.
Made of the same material and have the same tip diameter as the permanent piles (although test piles for treated timber piles may be either treated or untreated);
Driven with pile tips if the permanent piles will have tips; 3.
Prebored when preboring is specified for the permanent piles; 4.
Identical in cross-section and other characteristics to the permanent piles when the test piles are steel casings for cast-in-place concrete piles, precast concrete, precast‑prestressed concrete or steel pipe or H-pile; 5.
Long enough to accommodate all soil conditions;

Piling 6.
Driven with equipment and methods identical to those to be used for the permanent piles; 7.
Located as the Engineer directs; and 8.
Driven before permanent piles in a given pier.
Test piles may also be driven by the Contractor (at no cost to the Contracting Agency) as evidence that the pile driving system selected will not damage the pile or result in refusal prior to reaching the specified minimum tip elevation.
Timber test piles shall be driven outside the footing and cut off 1 foot below the finished ground line. Timber test piles shall not be used in place of permanent piles.
Steel and all types of concrete test piles shall become permanent piles. The Contracting
Agency has reduced the number of permanent piles by the number of test piles.
The Contractor shall base test pile length on test-hole data in the Contract. Test piles that prove to be too short shall be replaced (or spliced if the Contract allows splicing) at the
Contractor’s expense.
In foundations and trestles, test piles shall be driven to at least 15 percent more than the ultimate bearing resistance required for the permanent piles, except where pile driving criteria is determined by the wave equation. When pile driving criteria is specified to be determined by the wave equation, the test piles shall be driven to the same ultimate bearing resistance as the production piles. Test piles shall penetrate to a minimum tip elevation specified in the Contract. If no minimum tip elevation is specified, test piles shall extend at least 10 feet below the bottom of the concrete footing or ground line, and 15 feet below the bottom of the concrete seal.
When a test pile to be left as a permanent pile has been so damaged by handling or driving that the Engineer believes it unfit for use, the Contractor shall remove and replace the pile at no additional cost to the Contracting Agency. The Engineer may direct the
Contractor to overdrive the test pile to more than 15 percent above the ultimate bearing resistance for permanent piles, or if the wave equation is used to determine driving criteria, the Engineer may direct the Contractor to overdrive the test pile above the ultimate bearing resistance. In these cases, the overdriving shall be at the Contractor’s expense. But if pile damage results from this overdriving, removal and replacement will be at the Contracting Agency’s expense. 6-05.3(11)

Driving Piles 6-05.3(11)A
Tolerances
For elevated pier caps, the tops of piles at cut-off elevation shall be within 2 inches of the horizontal locations indicated in the Contract. For piles capped below final grade, the tops of piles at cut-off elevation shall be within 6 inches of the horizontal locations indicated in the Contract. No pile edge shall be nearer than 4 inches from the edge of a footing or cap.
Piles shall be installed such that the axial alignment of the top 10 feet of the pile is within
4 percent of the specified alignment. No misaligned steel or concrete piles shall be pulled laterally. A properly aligned section shall not be spliced onto a misaligned section for any type of pile. Unless the Contract shows otherwise, all piles shall be driven vertically. 6-05.3(11)B
Foundation Pit Preparation
The Contractor shall replace (and bear the cost of replacing) piles damaged or destroyed before or during driving.
The Contractor shall completely dig all foundation pits (and build any required cofferdams or cribs) before driving foundation piles. The Contractor shall adjust pit depths to allow for upheaval caused by pile-driving, judging the amount of adjustment by the nature of the soil. Before constructing the footing or pile cap, the Contractor shall restore the pit bottom to correct elevation by removing material or by backfilling with granular material.

Piling 6-05.3(11)C 6-05
Preparation for Driving
Treated and untreated timber piles shall be freshly cut square on the butt ends just before they are driven. If piles will be driven into hard material, caps, collars, or bands shall be placed on the butt ends to prevent crushing or brooming. If the head area of the pile is larger than that of the hammer face, the head shall be snipped or chamfered to fit the hammer. On treated piles, the heads shall be snipped or chamfered to at least the depth of the sapwood to avoid splitting the sapwood from the pile body.
The Contractor shall match timber pile sizes in any single bent to prevent sway braces from undue bending or distorting.
When driven, pile faces shall be turned as shown in the Plans or as the Engineer directs.
No precast-prestressed pile shall be driven until test cylinders poured with it reach at least the specified compressive strength shown in the Contract. On all other precast piles, the cylinders must reach a compressive strength of at least 4,000 psi before the piles are driven.
Helmets of approved design shall protect the heads of all precast concrete piles as they are driven. Each helmet shall have fitted into it a cushion next to the pile head. The bottom side of the helmet shall be recessed sufficiently to accommodate the required pile cushion and hold the pile in place during positioning and driving. The inside helmet diameter shall be determined before casting the pile, and the head of the pile shall be formed to fit loosely inside the helmet.
Steel Casing, steel pipe or H-piles shall have square-cut ends. 6-05.3(11)D
Achieving Minimum Tip Elevation and Bearing
Once pile driving has started, each pile shall be driven continuously until the required ultimate bearing resistance shown in the Contract has been achieved. Pauses during pile driving, except for splicing, mechanical breakdown, or other unforeseen events, shall not be allowed.
If the Contract specifies a minimum tip elevation, the pile shall be driven to at least the minimum tip elevation, even if the ultimate bearing resistance has been achieved, unless the Engineer directs otherwise. If a pile does not develop the required ultimate bearing resistance at the minimum tip elevation, the Contractor shall continue driving the pile until the required bearing resistance is achieved. If no minimum tip elevation is specified, then the piles shall be driven to the ultimate bearing resistance shown in the Contract and the following minimum penetrations:
Pile supporting cross-beams, bents, elevated pile caps elevation

10 feet below final top of ground
Piles supporting foundations
10 feet below bottom of foundation
Piles with a concrete seal
15 feet below bottom of seal
If overdriving is required in order to reach a specified minimum tip elevation, the
Contractor shall provide a pile driving system which will not result in damage to the pile or refusal before the minimum tip elevation is reached. The cost of overdriving shall be incidental to the various unit Contract prices for furnishing and driving piles.
So long as the pile is not damaged and the embankment or foundation material being driven through is not permanently damaged, the Contractor shall use normal means necessary to: 1.
Secure the minimum depth specified, 2.
Penetrate hard material that lies under a soft upper layer,

3.
Penetrate through hard material to obtain the specified minimum tip elevation, or 4.
Penetrate through a previously placed embankment.
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10
Page 6-175 6-05
Piling
Normal means refer to methods such as preboring, spudding, or jetting piles. Blasting or drilling through obstructions are not considered normal means.
Prebored holes and pile spuds shall have a diameter no larger than the least outside dimension of the pile. After the pile is driven, the Contractor shall fill all open spaces between the pile and the soil caused by the preboring or spudding with dry sand, or pea gravel, or controlled density fill as approved by the Engineer.
If water jets are used, the jets shall be withdrawn before the pile reaches its final penetration, and the pile shall then be driven to its final penetration and ultimate bearing resistance. The pile shall be driven a minimum of 2 feet to obtain the ultimate bearing resistance after the jets are withdrawn, or to refusal, whichever occurs first. If the water jets loosen a pile previously driven, it shall be redriven in place or pulled and replaced by a new pile. To check on pile loosening, the Contractor shall attempt to redrive at least one in every five piles, but no less than one pile per bent or pier.
The various unit Contract prices for driving piles shall cover all costs related to the use of water jets, preboring, or spudding. The Contracting Agency will not pay for costs the
Contractor incurs in redriving piles loosened as a result of using water jets, preboring, or spudding.
If the Engineer requires, the Contractor shall overdrive the pile beyond the ultimate bearing resistance and minimum tip elevation shown in the Contract. In this case, the
Contractor will not be required to: 1.

Use other than normal means to achieve the additional penetration, 2.
Bear the expense of removing or replacing piles damaged by overdriving, or 3.
Bear the expense of overdriving the pile more than 3 feet as specified in
Section 6-05.5.
In driving piles for footings with seals, the Contractor shall use no method (such as jetting or preboring) that might reduce friction resistance. 6-05.3(11)E
Use of Followers for Driving
Followers shall not be used to drive concrete or steel piles. On timber piles, the
Contractor may use steel (not wooden) followers if the follower fits snugly over the pile head. If a follower is used, the Contractor shall, in every group of 10 piles, drive one long pile without a follower, but no less than one pile per bent or pier, to the required ultimate bearing resistance and minimum tip elevation. This long pile shall be used to test the bearing resistance of the piles driven with a follower in the group. The tip elevation of the long pile shall be similar to the elevation of the piles driven with the follower. If the tip elevations are significantly different, as determined by the Engineer, the Contractor shall redrive the remaining piles in the group to the tip elevation of the longer pile. 6-05.3(11)F
Pile Damage
The Contractor shall remove and replace (and bear the cost of doing so) piles that are damaged as determined by the Engineer.
After driving a steel casing for a cast-in-place concrete pile, the Contractor shall leave it empty until the Engineer has inspected and accepted it. The Contractor shall make available to the Engineer a light suitable for inspecting the entire length of its interior.
The Engineer will reject casings that are improperly driven, that show partial collapse that would reduce its ultimate bearing resistance, or that has been reduced in diameter, or that will not keep out water. The Contractor shall replace (and bear the cost of replacing) all rejected casings.
Pile heads which have been broomed, rolled, or otherwise significantly damaged as determined by the Engineer shall be cut back to undamaged material before proceeding with driving as well as final acceptance of the pile.
Page 6-176

2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Piling 6-05 6-05.3(11)G
Pile Cutoff
The Contractor shall trim the tops of all piles to the true plane shown in the Contract and to the elevation the Engineer requires. If a pile is driven below cutoff elevation without the Engineer’s permission, the Contractor shall remove and replace it (and bear the costs of doing so), even if this requires a longer pile. Piles that rise as nearby piles are driven, shall be driven down again if the Engineer requires.
Piles under timber caps or grillages shall be sawed to the exact plane of the Structure above them and fit it exactly. No shimming on top of timber piles to adjust for inaccurate pile top elevations will be permitted. If a timber pile is driven out of line, it shall be straightened without damage before it is cut off or braced.
Steel casing shall be cut off at least 6 inches below the finished ground line or at the low water line if the casing will be visible as determined by the Engineer. 6-05.3(11)H
Pile Driving From or Near Adjacent Structures
The Contractor shall not drive piling from an existing Structure unless all of the following conditions are met: 1.
The existing Structure will be demolished within the Contract; 2.
The existing Structure is permanently closed to traffic; and 3.
Type 2E Working Drawings are submitted in accordance with Sections 1-05.3 and 6-02.3(16), showing the structural adequacy of the existing Structure to safely support all of the construction loads.

Freshly placed concrete in the vicinity of the pile driving operation shall be protected against vibration in accordance with Section 6-02.3(6)D. 6-05.3(12)
Determination of Bearing Values
The following formula shall be used to determine ultimate bearing resistances:
P = F × E × Ln(10N)
Where:
P
F
E
W
H
N
Ln

= ultimate bearing resistance, in tons = 1.8 for air/steam hammers = 1.2 for open ended diesel hammers and precast concrete or timber piles = 1.6 for open ended diesel hammers and steel piles = 1.2 for closed ended diesel hammers = 1.9 for hydraulic hammers = 0.9 for drop hammers = developed energy, equal to W times H1, in ft-kips = weight of ram, in kips = vertical drop of hammer or stroke of ram, in feet = average penetration resistance in blows per inch for the last
4 inches of driving = the natural logarithm, in base “e” 1For closed-end diesel hammers (double-acting), the developed hammer energy (E) is to be determined from the bounce chamber reading. Hammer manufacturer calibration data may be used to correlate bounce chamber pressure to developed hammer energy. For double acting hammer hydraulic and air/steam hammers, the developed hammer energy shall be calculated from ram impact velocity measurements or other means acceptable to the Engineer. For open ended diesel hammers (single-acting) use the blows per minute to determine the developed energy (E).
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10
Page 6-177 6-05
Piling
The above formula applies only when: 1.
The hammer is in good condition and operating in a satisfactory manner. 2.
A follower is not used. 3.
The pile top is not damaged.

4.
The pile head is free from broomed or crushed wood fiber. 5.
The penetration occurs at a reasonably quick, uniform rate; and the pile has been driven at least 2 feet after an interruption in driving greater than 1 hour in length. 6.
There is no perceptible bounce after the blow. If a significant bounce cannot be avoided, twice the height of the bounce shall be deducted from “H” to determine its true value in the formula. 7.
For timber piles, bearing resistances calculated by the formula above shall be considered effective only when it is less than the crushing strength of the piles. 8.
If “N” is greater than or equal to 1.0 blow/inch.
If “N” required to achieve the required ultimate bearing resistance using the above formula is less than 1.0 blow/inch, the pile shall be driven until the penetration resistance is a minimum of 1.0 blow/inch for the last 2 feet of driving.
The Engineer may require the Contractor to install a pressure gauge on the inboard end of the hose to check pressure at the hammer.
If water jets are used in driving, bearing resistances shall be determined either: (1) by calculating it with the driving data and the formula above after the jets have been withdrawn and the pile is driven at least 2 feet, or (2) by applying a test load. 6-05.3(13)
Treatment of Timber Pile Heads

After cutting timber piles to correct elevation, the Contractor shall thoroughly coat the heads of all untreated piles with two coats of an approved preservative that meets the requirements of Section 9-09 (except concrete-encased piles).
After cutting treated timber piles to correct elevation, the Contractor shall brush three coats of a preservative that meets the requirements of Section 9-09 on all pile heads (except those to be covered with concrete footings or concrete caps). The pile heads shall then be capped with alternate layers of an approved roofing asphalt and a waterproofing fabric that conforms to Section 9-11.1. The cap shall be made of four layers of an approved roofing asphalt and three layers of fabric. The fabric shall be cut large enough to cover the pile top and fold down at least 6 inches along all sides of the pile. After the fabric cover is bent down over the pile, its edges shall be fastened with large-head galvanized nails or with three turns of galvanized wire. The edges of the cover shall be neatly trimmed.
On a treated timber pile encased in concrete, the cut end shall receive two coats of an approved preservative that meets the requirements of Section 9-09 and then a heavy coat of an approved roofing asphalt. 6-05.3(14)
Extensions and Buildups of Precast Concrete Piles
The Contractor shall add extensions, or buildups (if necessary) on precast concrete piles after they are driven to the required ultimate bearing resistance and minimum tip elevation.
Before adding extensions or buildups to precast-prestressed piles, the Contractor shall remove all spalled concrete, leaving the pile fresh-headed and with a top surface
Page 6-178
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Piling 6-05
Before adding to non-prestressed precast concrete piles, the Contractor shall cut the pile head away to a depth 40 times the diameter of the vertical reinforcing bar. The final cut shall be perpendicular to the axis of the pile. Reinforcement of the same density and configuration as used in the pile shall be used in the buildup and shall be fastened firmly to the projecting steel. Forms shall be placed to prevent concrete from leaking along the
Just before placing the concrete for extensions or buildups to precast or precastprestressed concrete piles, the Contractor shall thoroughly wet the top of the pile. Forms shall remain in place at least 3 days. 6-05.3(15)

Completion of Cast-In-Place Concrete Piles
After acceptance by the Engineer, driven casings shall be cut off horizontally at the required elevation. They shall be clean and free of water when concrete and reinforcing steel are placed.
These piles shall consist of steel casings driven into the ground, reinforced as specified, 6-05.3(15)A
Reinforcement
All bars shall be fastened rigidly into a single unit, then lowered into the casing before the concrete is placed. Loose bars shall not be used.
Spiral hooping reinforcement shall be deformed steel bar, plain steel bar, cold-drawn wire, or deformed wire. 6-05.3(15)B
Placing Concrete
Before placing concrete, the Contractor shall remove all debris and water from the casing.
If the water cannot be removed, the casing shall be removed (or cut off 2 feet below the ground and filled with sand) and a new one driven.
The Contractor shall place concrete continuously through a 5-foot rigid conduit directing the concrete down the center of the pile casing, ensuring that every part of the pile is filled and the concrete is worked around the reinforcement. The top 5 feet of concrete shall be placed with the tip of the conduit below the top of fresh concrete. The Contractor shall vibrate, as a minimum, the top 10 feet of concrete. In all cases, the concrete shall be vibrated to a point at least 5 feet below the original ground line. 6-05.4

Measurement
Measurement for driving (type) pile will be the number of piles driven in place.
In these categories, measurement will be the longer of either the number of linear feet driven below cutoff or as shown in the Engineer’s order list: 1.
Furnishing timber piling (untreated or name of treatment). 2.
Precast concrete and precast-prestressed concrete piling.
In these categories, measurement will be the number of linear feet driven below cutoff, but no Engineer’s order list will be provided: 1.
Cast-in-place concrete piling. 2.

Soil Nail Walls
If caving conditions are encountered, no further drilling will be allowed until the
Contractor selects a method to prevent ground movement. The Contractor may use temporary casing. The Contractor’s method to prevent ground movement shall be approved by the Engineer. The casings for the nail holes, if used, shall be removed as the grout is being placed.
Where necessary for stability of the excavation face, a sealing layer of shotcrete may be placed before drilling is started, or the Contractor shall have the option of drilling and grouting of nails through a stabilizing berm of native soil at the face of the excavation.
The stabilizing berm shall extend horizontally from the soil face and from the face of the shotcrete a minimum distance of 1 foot, and shall be cut down from that point at a safe slope, no steeper than 1H:1V unless approved by the Engineer. The berm shall be excavated to final grade after installation and full length grouting of the nails. Nails damaged during berm excavation shall be repaired or replaced by the Contractor, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, at no added cost to the Contracting Agency.
If sections of the wall are constructed at different times than the adjacent soil nail sections, the Contractor shall use stabilizing berms, temporary slopes, or other measures acceptable to the Engineer, to prevent sloughing or failure of the adjacent soil nail sections.
If cobbles and boulders are encountered at the soil face during excavation, the Contractor shall remove all cobbles and boulders that protrude from the soil face into the design wall section and fill the void with shotcrete. All shotcrete used to fill voids created by removal of cobbles and boulders shall be incidental to shotcrete facing.
The grout equipment shall produce a grout free of lumps and undispersed cement.
A positive displacement grout pump shall be used. The pump shall be equipped with a pressure gauge near the discharge end to monitor grout pressures. The pressure gauge shall be capable of measuring pressures of at least 150 psi or twice the actual grout pressures used by the Contractor, whichever is greater. The grouting equipment shall be sized to enable the grout to be pumped in one continuous operation. The mixer shall be capable of continuously agitating the grout.
The grout shall be injected from the lowest point of the drilled hole. The quantity of the grout and the grout pressures shall be recorded. The grout pressures and grout takes shall be controlled to prevent excessive ground heave.
The Contractor shall make and cure grout cubes once per day in accordance with WSDOT
T 813. These samples shall be retained by the Contractor until all associated verification and proof testing of the soil nails has been successfully completed. If the Contractor elects to test the grout cubes for compressive strength, testing shall be conducted by an independent laboratory and shall be in accordance with the FOP for AASHTO T106. 6-15.3(7)

Shotcrete Facing
Prior to placing shotcrete on an excavated layer, the Contractor shall vertically center prefabricated drainage mat between the columns of nails as shown in the Plans. The prefabricated drainage mat shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. The permeable drain side shall be placed against the exposed soil face. The prefabricated drainage mat shall be installed after each excavation lift and shall be hydraulically connected with the prefabricated drainage mat previously placed, such that the vertical flow of water is not impeded. The Contractor shall tape all joints in the prefabricated drainage mat to prevent shotcrete intrusion during shotcrete application.
The Contractor shall place steel reinforcing bars and welded wire fabric and apply the shotcrete facing in accordance with Section 6-18 and the details shown in the Plans.
The shotcrete shall be constructed to the minimum thickness as shown in the Plans. Costs associated with additional thickness of shotcrete due to over excavation or irregularities in the cut face shall be borne by the Contractor.
Page 6-250
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Soil Nail Walls 6-15
Each soil nail shall be secured at the shotcrete facing with a steel plate as shown in the
Plans. The plate shall be seated on a wet grout pad of a pasty consistency similar to that of mortar for bricklaying. The nut shall then be sufficiently tightened to achieve full bearing surface behind the plate. After the shotcrete and grout have had time to gain the specified strength, the nut shall be tightened with at least 100 foot-pounds of torque. After final tightening of the nut, the threads of the soil nail shall at a minimum be flush with the end of the nut. 6-15.3(8)
Soil Nail Testing and Acceptance
Both verification and proof testing of the nails is required. The Contractor shall supply all materials, equipment, and labor to perform the tests. The Contractor shall submit Type
1 Working Drawings of all test data. Soil nails used for verification tests and proof tests shall not be production soil nails, but instead shall be separate sacrificial soil nails not otherwise incorporated into the Work.
The testing equipment shall include a dial gauge or vernier scale capable of measuring to
0.001 inch of the ground anchor movement. A hydraulic jack and pump shall be used to apply the test load. The movement-measuring device shall have a minimum travel equal to the theoretical elastic elongation of the total nail length plus 1 inch. The dial gauge or vernier scale shall be aligned so that its axis is within 5 degrees from the axis of the nail and shall be monitored with a reference system that is independent of the jacking system and excavation face.
The jack and pressure gauge shall be calibrated by an independent testing Laboratory as a unit. Each load cell, test jack and pressure gauge, grout pump stroke counter, and master gauge, shall be calibrated as specified in Section 6-15.3(3), item 4b. Additionally, the Contractor shall not use load cells, test jacks and pressure gauges, grout pump stroke counters, and master gauges, greater than 60 calendar days past their most recent calibration date, until such items are re-calibrated by an independent testing Laboratory.
The pressure gauge shall be graduated in increments of either 100 psi or 2 percent of the maximum test load, whichever is less. The pressure gauge shall be selected to place the maximum test load within the middle ⅔ of the range of the gauge. The ram travel of the jack shall not be less than the theoretical elastic elongation of the total length at the maximum test load plus 1 inch. The jack shall be independently supported and centered over the nail so that the nail does not carry the weight of the jack. The Contractor shall have a second calibrated jack pressure gauge at the site. Calibration data shall provide a specific reference to the jack and the pressure gauge.
The loads on the nails during the verification and proof tests shall be monitored to verify consistency of load – defined as maintaining the test load within 5 percent of the specified value. Verification and proof test loads less than 20,000 pounds or sustained for
5 minutes or less shall be monitored by the jack pressure gauge alone. Verification and proof test loads equal to or greater than 20,000 pounds and sustained for longer than 5 minutes shall be monitored with the assistance of an electric or hydraulic load cell. The
Contractor shall provide the load cell, the readout device, and a calibration curve from the most recent calibration as specified in Section 6-15.3(3), item 4b. The load cell shall be selected to place the maximum test load within the middle ⅔ of the range of the load cell. The load cell shall be mounted between the jack and the anchor plate. The stressing equipment shall be placed over the nail in such a manner that the jack bearing plates, load cell and stressing anchorage are in alignment.
Nails to be tested shall be initially grouted no closer to the excavation face than the dimension shown in the Plans. After placing the grout, the nail shall remain undisturbed until the grout has reached strength sufficient to provide resistance during testing. Test nails shall be left in the ground after testing, with the exposed portion of the test nail cut and removed to 2 feet behind the excavated face or inside face of shotcrete. The drill holes for test nails shall be completely backfilled with grout or nonstructural filler after testing on those test nails has been completed.

Load testing shall be performed against a temporary reaction frame with bearing pads that bear directly against the existing soil or the shotcrete facing. Bearing pads shall be kept a minimum of 12 inches from the edges of the drilled hole and the load shall be distributed to prevent failure of the soil face or fracture of the shotcrete. The Contractor shall submit
Type 2E Working Drawings of the reaction frame.
The soil nail load monitoring procedure for verification and proof test load greater than 20,000 pounds and sustained for longer than 5 minutes shall be as follows: 1.
For each increment of load, attainment of the load shall be initially established and confirmed by the reading taken from the jack gauge. 2.
Once the soil nail anchor load has been stabilized, based on the jack gauge reading, the load cell readout device shall immediately be read and recorded to establish the load cell reading to be used at this load. The load cell reading is intended only as a confirmation of a stable soil nail load and shall not be taken as the actual load on the soil nail. 3.
During the time period that the load on the soil nail is held at this load increment, the Contractor shall monitor the load cell reading. The Contractor shall adjust the jack pressure as necessary to maintain the initial load cell reading. Jack pressure adjustment for any other reason will not be allowed. 4.
Soil nail elongation measurements shall be taken at each load increment as specified in Sections 6-15.3(8)A and 6-15.3(8)B.

5.
Steps 1 through 4 shall be repeated at each increment of load, in accordance with the load sequence specified in Sections 6-15.3(8)A and 6-15.3(8)B. 6-15.3(8)A
Verification Testing
Verification testing shall be performed on nails installed within the pattern of production nails to verify the Contractor’s procedures, hole diameter, and design assumptions. No drilling or installation of production nails will be permitted in ground/rock unit unless successful verification testing of anchors in that unit has been completed and approved by the Engineer, using the same equipment, methods, nail inclination, nail length, and hole diameter as planned for the production nails. Changes in the drilling or installation method may require additional verification testing as determined by the Engineer and shall be done at no additional expense to the Contracting Agency. Verification tests may be performed prior to excavation for the soil nail wall.
Successful verification tests are required within the limits as specified in the Special
Provisions. Test nail locations within these limits shall be at locations selected by the
Engineer.
The Contractor shall submit Type 2E Working Drawings consisting of design details of the verification testing, including the system for distributing test load pressures to the excavation surface and appropriate nail bar size and reaction plate. The intent is to stress the bond between the grout and the surrounding soil/rock to at least twice the design load transfer. Prior to beginning verification testing, the Contractor shall measure and record the length of the nonbonded zone for each verification test soil nail.
The bar shall be proportioned such that the maximum stress at 200 percent of the test load does not exceed 80 percent of the yield strength of the steel. The jack shall be positioned at the beginning of the test such that unloading and repositioning of the jack during the test will not be required. The verification tests shall be made by incrementally loading the nails in accordance with the following schedule of hold time:

The test load shall be determined by the following equation = Test Load (TL) = Bond
Length (BL) × Design Load Transfer (DLT).
The load shall be applied in increments of 25 percent of the test load. Each load increment shall be held for at least 10 minutes. Measurement of nail movement shall be obtained at each load increment. The load-hold period shall start as soon as the load is applied and the nail movement with respect to a fixed reference shall be measured and recorded at
1 minute, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes.
The Engineer will evaluate the results of each verification test and make a determination of the suitability of the test and of the Contractor’s proposed production nail design and installation system. Tests that fail to meet the design criteria will require additional verification testing or an approved revision to the Contractor’s proposed production nail design and installation system. If a nail fails in creep, retesting will not be allowed.
A verification tested nail with a 60-minute load hold at 1.50TL is acceptable if: 1.
The nail carries the test load with a creep rate that does not exceed 0.08 inch per log cycle of time and is at a linear or decreasing creep rate. 2.
The total movement at the test load exceeds 80 percent of the theoretical elastic elongation of the non-bonded length.
Furthermore, a pullout failure shall not occur for the verification test anchor at the 2.0TL maximum load. Pullout failure load is defined as the load at which attempts to increase the test load result only in continued pullout movement of the test nail without a sustainable increase in the test load. 6-15.3(8)B
Proof Testing

Proof tests shall be performed on proof test soil nails installed within the pattern of the production soil nails at the locations shown in the Plans. Proof test soil nails shall be installed using the same equipment, methods, nail inclination, nail length, and hole diameter as for adjacent production nails. The Contractor shall maintain the side-wall stability of the drill hole for the non-grouted portion during the test. The bond length shall be determined from the Nail Schedule and Test Nail Detail shown in the Plans. Prior to beginning proof testing, the Contractor shall measure and record the length of the nonbonded zone for each proof test soil nail.
Proof tests shall be performed by incrementally loading the nail in accordance with the schedule below. The anchor movement shall be measured and recorded to the nearest
0.001 inch with respect to an independent fixed reference point in the same manner as for the verification tests at the alignment load and at each increment of load. The load shall be monitored in accordance with Section 6-15.3(8). The scheduling of hold times shall be as follows:

The maximum load in a proof test shall be held for 10 minutes. The load hold period shall start as soon as the maximum load is applied and the nail movement with respect to an independent fixed reference shall be measured and recorded at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and
10 minutes. The nail movement between 1 and 10 minutes shall not exceed 0.04 inches.
If the nail movement between 1 and 10 minutes exceeds 0.04 inches, the maximum load shall be held an additional 50 minutes. If the load hold is extended, the nail movement shall be recorded at 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes. If a nail fails in creep, retesting will not be allowed.
A proof tested nail is acceptable if: 1.

The nail carries the maximum load with less than 0.04 inches of movement between
1 and 10 minutes, unless the load hold extended to 60 minutes, in which case the nail would be acceptable if the creep rate does not exceed 0.08 inches per log cycle of time. 2.
The total movement at the maximum load exceeded 80 percent of the theoretical elastic elongation of the non-bonded length. 3
The creep rate is not increasing with time during the load hold period.
If a proof test fails, the Engineer may direct the Contractor to replace some or all of the installed production nails between the failed test and an adjacent proof test nail that has met the test criteria. The Engineer may also require additional proof testing. All additional proof tests, and all installation of additional or modified nails, shall be performed at no additional expense to the Contracting Agency. 6-15.3(9)

Shaft Excavation
Shafts shall be excavated to the required depth as shown in the Plans. The minimum diameter of the shaft shall be as shown in the Plans. The excavation shall be completed in a continuous operation using equipment capable of excavating through the type of material expected to be encountered.
The Contractor may use temporary telescoping casing to construct the shafts.
If the shaft excavation is stopped the shaft shall be secured by installation of a safety cover. It shall be the Contractor’s responsibility to ensure the safety of the shaft and surrounding soil and the stability of the sidewalls. A temporary casing, slurry, or other methods specified in the shaft installation plan shall be used if necessary to ensure such safety and stability.
Where caving in conditions are encountered, no further excavation will be allowed until the Contractor has implemented the method to prevent ground caving as submitted in accordance with item 4 of the Shaft Installation Plan.
No more than 2 inches of loose or disturbed material, for soldier piles with permanent ground anchors, nor more than 12 inches of loose or disturbed material, for soldier piles without permanent ground anchors, shall be present at the bottom of the shaft just prior to beginning concrete placement.
The excavated shaft shall be inspected and receive acceptance by the Engineer prior to proceeding with construction.
When obstructions are encountered, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer promptly.
An obstruction is defined as a specific object (including, but not limited to, boulders, logs, and previously fabricated objects) encountered during the shaft excavation operation that prevents or hinders the advance of the shaft excavation. When efforts to advance past the obstruction to the design shaft tip elevation result in the rate of advance of the shaft drilling equipment being significantly reduced relative to the rate of advance for the rest of the shaft excavation, then the Contractor shall remove the obstruction under the provisions of Section 6-16.5. The method of removal of such obstructions, and the continuation of excavation shall be as proposed by the Contractor and approved by the
Engineer.
Excavation of shafts shall not commence until a minimum of 12 hours after the shaft backfill for the adjacent shafts has been placed.
The temporary casings for the shafts shall be removed. A minimum 5-foot head of concrete shall be maintained to balance the soil and water pressure at the bottom of the casing. The casing shall be smooth. 6-16.3(4)

If the Contractor’s key personnel change, or if the Contractor proposes a significant revision of the approved permanent ground anchor installation plan, an additional conference shall be held before additional permanent ground anchor operations are performed. 6-17.3(5)
Tendon Fabrication
The tendons can be either shop or field fabricated. The tendon shall be fabricated as shown in the shop plans.
The Contractor shall select the type of tendon to be used. The tendon shall be sized so the factored design load does not exceed 80 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the tendon. In addition, the tendon shall be sized so the maximum test load does not exceed 80 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the tendon.
The Contractor shall be responsible for determining the bond length and tendon bond length necessary to develop the factored design load indicated in the Plans in accordance with Sections 6-17.3(8)A, 6-17.3(8)B, and 6-17.3(8)C. The minimum bond length shall be
10 feet in rock and 15 feet in soil.
When the Plans require the tendon bond length to be encapsulated, the tendon bond length portion of the tendon shall be corrosion protected by encapsulating the tendon in a grout-filled PE or PVC tube as specified in Section 6-17.2 as supplemented in the
Special Provisions. The tendons can be grouted inside the encapsulation prior to inserting the tendon in the drill hole or after the tendon has been placed in the drill hole. Expansive admixtures can be mixed with the encapsulation grout if the tendon is grouted inside the encapsulation while outside the drill hole. The tendon shall be centralized within the bond length encapsulation with a minimum of 0.20 inches of grout cover. Spacers shall be used along the tendon bond length of multi-element tendons to separate the elements of the tendon so the prestressing steel will bond to the encapsulation grout.
Centralizers shall be used to provide a minimum of 0.5 inches of grout cover over the tendon bond length encapsulation. Centralizers shall be securely attached to the encapsulation and the center-to-center spacing shall not exceed 10 feet. In addition, the upper centralizer shall be located a maximum of 5 feet from the top of the tendon bond length and the lower centralizer shall be located a maximum of 1 foot from the bottom of the tendon bond length.
The centralizer shall be able to support the tendon in the drill hole and position the tendon so a minimum of 0.5 inches of grout cover is provided and shall permit free flow of grout.
Centralizers are not required on encapsulated, pressure-injected ground anchor tendons if the ground anchor is installed in coarse grained soils (more than 50 percent of the soil larger than the number 200 sieve) using grouting pressures greater than 150 psi.

Permanent Ground Anchors
Centralizers are not required on encapsulated, hollow-stem-augered ground anchor tendons if the ground anchor is grouted through and the hole is maintained full of a stiff grout (8-inch slump or less) during extraction of the auger.
The minimum unbonded length of the tendon shall be the greater of 15 feet or that indicated in the Plans.
Corrosion protection of the unbonded length shall be provided by a sheath completely filled with corrosion inhibiting grease or grout. If grease is used under the sheath, provisions shall be made to prevent the grease from escaping at the ends of the sheath.
The grease shall completely coat the tendon and fill the voids between the tendon and the sheath.
If the sheath is not fabricated from a smooth tube, a separate bond breaker shall be provided. The bond breaker shall prevent the tendon from bonding to the anchor grout surrounding the tendon unbonded length.
The total anchor length shall not be less than that indicated in the Plans or the approved
Working Drawing submittal.
Anchorage devices shall be capable of developing 95 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the prestressing steel tendon. The anchorage devices shall conform to the static strength requirements of Section 3.1 of the Post Tensioning Institute
Specification for Unbonded Single Strand Tendons, First Edition – 1993.
Non-restressable anchorage devices may be used except where indicated in the Plans.
Restressable anchorages shall be provided on those ground anchors that require reloading. The post-tensioning supplier shall provide a restressable anchorage compatible with the post-tensioning system provided.
The bearing plates shall be sized so the bending stresses in the plate do not exceed the yield strength of the steel when a load equal to 95 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the tendon is applied, and the average bearing stress on the concrete does not exceed that recommended in Section 3.1.3 of the Post Tensioning
Institute Specification for Unbonded Single Strand Tendons, First Edition – 1993.
The trumpet shall have an inside diameter equal to or larger than the hole in the bearing plate. The trumpet shall be long enough to accommodate movements of the Structure during testing and stressing. For strand tendons with encapsulation over the unbonded length, the trumpet shall be long enough to enable the tendon to make a transition from the diameter or the tendon in the unbonded length to the diameter of the tendon at the anchor head without damaging the encapsulation. Trumpets filled with corrosioninhibiting grease shall have a permanent rubber seal provided between the trumpet and the tendon unbonded length corrosion protection. Trumpets filled with grout shall have a temporary seal provided between the trumpet and the tendon unbonded length corrosion protection or the trumpet shall overlap the tendon unbonded length corrosion protection. 6-17.3(6)

Tendon Storage and Handling
Tendons shall be handled and stored in such a manner as to avoid damage or corrosion.
Damage to the prestressing steel as a result of abrasions, cut, nicks, welds and weld splatter will be cause for rejection by the Engineer. The prestressing steel shall be protected if welding is to be performed in the vicinity. Grounding of welding leads to the prestressing steel is forbidden. Prestressing steel shall be protected from dirt, rust, and deleterious substances. A light coating of rust on the steel is acceptable. If heavy corrosion or pitting is noted, the Engineer will reject the affected tendons.
Page 6-268
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Permanent Ground Anchors 6-17
The Contractor shall use care in handling and storing the tendons at the site. Prior to inserting a tendon in the drill hole, the Contractor and the Engineer will examine the tendon for damage to the encapsulation and the sheathing. If, in the opinion of the
Engineer, the encapsulation is damaged, the Contractor shall repair the encapsulation in accordance with the tendon supplier’s recommendations and as approved by the Engineer.
If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the smooth sheathing has been damaged, the Contractor shall repair it with ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (PE) tape. The tape shall be spiral wound around the tendon so as to completely seal the damaged area. The pitch of the spiral shall ensure a double thickness at all points. 6-17.3(7)
Installing Permanent Ground Anchors
The Contractor shall select the drilling method, the grouting procedure, and the grouting pressure used for the installation of the ground anchor.
When caving conditions are encountered, no further drilling will be allowed until the
Contractor selects a method to prevent ground movement. The Contractor may use a temporary casing. The Contractor’s method to prevent ground movement shall be submitted as a Type 2 Working Drawing. The casings for the anchor holes, if used, shall be removed. The drill hole shall be located so the longitudinal axis of the drill hole and the longitudinal axis of the tendon are parallel. The ground anchor shall not be drilled in a location that requires the tendon to be bent in order to enable the bearing plate to be connected to the supported Structure. At the point of entry the ground anchor shall be installed within plus or minus 3 degrees of the inclination from horizontal shown in the
Plans or the Working Drawing submittal. The ground anchors shall not extend beyond the
Right of Way limits.
The tendon shall be inserted into the drill hole to the desired depth. When the tendon cannot be completely inserted without difficulty, the Contractor shall remove the tendon from the drill hole and clean or redrill the hole to permit insertion. Partially inserted tendons shall not be driven or forced into the hole.
The Contractor shall use a grout conforming to Section 6-17.2 as supplemented in the
Special Provisions.
The grout equipment shall produce a grout free of lumps and undispersed cement. A positive displacement grout pump shall be used. The pump shall be equipped with a pressure gauge near the discharge end to monitor grout pressures. The pressure gauge shall be capable of measuring pressures of at least 150 psi or twice the actual grout pressures used by the Contractor, whichever is greater. The grouting equipment shall be sized to enable the grout to be pumped in one continuous operation. The mixer shall be capable of continuously agitating the grout.
The grout shall be injected from the lowest point of the drill hole. The grout may be pumped through grout tubes, casing, or drill rods. The grout can be placed before or after insertion of the tendon. The quantity of the grout and the grout pressures shall be recorded. The grout pressures and grout takes shall be controlled to prevent excessive heave in soils or fracturing of rock formations.
The Contractor shall make and cure grout cubes once per day in accordance with WSDOT
T 813. These samples shall be retained by the Contractor until all associated verification, performance and proof testing of the permanent ground anchors has been successfully completed. If the Contractor elects to test the grout cubes for compressive strength, testing shall be conducted by an independent laboratory and shall be in accordance with the FOP for AASHTO T 106.
After grouting, the tendon shall not be loaded for a minimum of 3 days.

Permanent Ground Anchors
No grout shall be placed above the top of the bond length during the time the bond length grout is placed. The grout at the top of the drill hole shall not contact the back of the Structure or the bottom of the trumpet. Except as otherwise noted, only nonstructural filler shall be placed above the bond length grout prior to testing and acceptance of the anchor. The Contractor may place structural grout above the bond length grout prior to testing and acceptance of the anchor subject to the following conditions: 1.
The anchor unbonded length shall be increased by 8 feet minimum. 2.
The grout in the unbonded zone shall not be placed by pressure grouting methods.
The corrosion protection surrounding the unbonded length of the tendon shall extend up beyond the bottom seal of the trumpet or 1 foot into the trumpet if no trumpet seal is provided. If the protection does not extend beyond the seal or sufficiently far enough into the trumpet, the Contractor shall extend the corrosion protection or lengthen the trumpet.
The corrosion protection surrounding the no load zone length of the tendon shown in the Plans shall not contact the bearing plate or the anchor head during testing and stressing. If the protection is too long, the Contractor shall trim the corrosion protection to prevent contact.
The bearing plate and anchor head shall be placed so the axis of the tendon and the drill hole are both perpendicular to the bearing plate within plus or minus 3 degrees and the axis of the tendon passes through the center of the bearing plate at the intersection of the trumpet and the bearing plate when fully seated with the alignment load.
The trumpet shall be completely filled with corrosion inhibiting grease or grout. Trumpet grease can be placed anytime during construction. Trumpet grout shall be placed after the ground anchor has been tested. The Contractor shall demonstrate to the Engineer that the procedure selected by the Contractor for placement of either grease or grout produces a completely filled trumpet.
All anchorages permanently exposed to the atmosphere shall be covered with a corrosion inhibiting grease-filled or grout-filled cover. The Contractor shall demonstrate to the
Engineer that the procedures selected by the Contractor for placement of either grease or grout produces a completely filled cover. If the Plans require restressable anchorages, corrosion inhibiting grease shall be used to fill the anchorage cover and trumpet. 6-17.3(8)

Testing and Stressing
Each ground anchor shall be tested. The test load shall be simultaneously applied to the entire tendon. Stressing of single elements of multi-element tendons will not be permitted. The Engineer will record test data.
The testing equipment shall consist of a dial gauge or vernier scale capable of measuring to 0.001 inch and shall be used to measure the ground anchor movement. The movementmeasuring device shall have a minimum travel equal to the theoretical elastic elongation of the total anchor length plus 1 inch. The dial gauge or vernier scale shall be aligned so that its axis is within 5 degrees from the axis of the tieback. A hydraulic jack and pump shall be used to apply the test load. The jack and pressure gauge shall be calibrated by an independent testing Laboratory as a unit. Each load cell, test jack and pressure gauge, and master pressure gauge, shall be calibrated as specified in Section 6-17.3(3). Additionally, the Contractor shall not use load cells, test jacks and pressure gauges, and master pressure gauges, greater than 60 calendar days past their most recent calibration date, until such items are re-calibrated by an independent testing Laboratory.
Page 6-270
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Permanent Ground Anchors 6-17
The pressure gauge shall be graduated in increments of either 100 psi or 2 percent of the maximum test load, whichever is less. The pressure gauge will be used to measure the applied load. The pressure gauge shall be selected to place the maximum test load within the middle ⅔ of the range of the gauge. The ram travel of the jack shall not be less than the theoretical elastic elongation of the total anchor length at the maximum test load plus 1 inch. The jack shall be independently supported and centered over the tendon so that the tendon does not carry the weight of the jack. The Contractor shall have a second calibrated jack pressure gauge at the site. Calibration data shall provide a specific reference to the jack and the pressure gauge.
The loads on the tiebacks during the performance and verification tests shall be monitored to verify consistency of load as defined in Section 6-17.3(1). Performance test loads, and verification test loads when specified in the Special Provisions, sustained for
5 minutes or less, and all proof test leads, shall be monitored by the jack pressure gauge alone. Performance test loads, and verification test loads when specified in the Special
Provisions, sustained for longer than 5 minutes shall be monitored with the assistance of an electric or hydraulic load cell. The Contractor shall provide the load cell and a readout device. The load cell shall be mounted between the jack and the anchor plate. The load cell shall be selected to place the maximum test load within the middle ⅔ of the range of the load cell. The stressing equipment shall be placed over the ground anchor tendon in such a manner that the jack, bearing plates, load cell and stressing anchorage are in alignment.
The permanent ground anchor load monitoring procedure for performance test loads, and verification test loads when specified in the Special Provisions, sustained for longer than 5 minutes shall be as follows: 1.

For each increment of load, attainment of the load shall be initially established and confirmed by the reading taken from the jack gauge. 2.
Once the permanent ground anchor load has been stabilized, based on the jack gauge reading, the load cell readout device shall immediately be read and recorded to establish the load cell reading to be used at this load. The load cell reading is intended only as a confirmation of a stable permanent ground anchor load, and shall not be taken as the actual load on the permanent ground anchor. 3.
During the time period that the load on the permanent ground anchor is held at this load increment, the Contractor shall monitor the load cell reading. The Contractor shall adjust the jack pressure as necessary to maintain the initial load cell reading. Jack pressure adjustment for all other reasons will not be allowed. 4.
Permanent ground anchor elongation measurements shall be taken at each load increment as specified in Sections 6-17.3(8)A and 6-17.3(8)B. 5.
Steps 1 through 4 shall be repeated at each increment of load, in accordance with the load sequence specified in Sections 6-17.3(8)A and 6-17.3(8)B. 6-17.3(8)A

2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Modified Concrete Overlay - Microsilica or Fly Ash 6-21 (station, offset, elevation) and, from that, the Top of Overlay Model (station, offset, and elevation).
The Engineer will provide the Contractor with primary survey control information consisting of descriptions of two primary control points used for the horizontal and vertical control. Primary control points will be described by reference to the bridge or project-specific stationing and elevation datum. The Engineer will also provide horizontal coordinates for the beginning and ending points and for each Point of Intersection (PI) on each centerline alignment included in the project. The Contractor shall provide the
Engineer 21 calendar days’ notice in advance of the Contractor’s scheduled surveying work to allow the Engineer time to provide the primary survey control information.
The Contractor shall verify the primary survey control information furnished by the
Engineer and shall expand the survey control information to include secondary horizontal and vertical control points as needed for the project. The Contractor’s survey records shall include descriptions of all survey control points, including coordinates and elevations of all secondary control points.
The Contractor shall maintain detailed survey records, including a description of the work performed on each shift, the methods utilized to conduct the survey, and the control points used. The record shall be of sufficient detail to allow the survey to be reproduced.
A Type 1 Working Drawing of each day’s survey record shall be provided to the Engineer within 3 working days after the end of the shift. The Contractor shall compile the survey information in an electronic file format acceptable to the Engineer (Excel spreadsheet format is preferred).
Survey information collected by the Contractor to create the Existing Bridge Deck Surface
Model shall include the station, offset, and elevation of every point of intersection on a grid created as follows: 1.

Longitudinally, for the full length of the bridge and extending 100 feet beyond the bridge back of pavement seat on each end. Data shall be gathered every 20 feet, at even 20-foot station intervals, and also at the centerline of each bridge expansion joint. 2.
Transversely, for the full width of the bridge to be overlaid, from curb line to curb line.
Data shall be gathered at every longitudinal station centerline, offset at each lane, offset at all changes in superelevation such as crowns and broken-backs, and offset at each curb line.
When traffic wear, such as wheel rutting, is not centered on and parallel to existing lane lines (e.g., when the lane striping has been shifted or skewed at some point during the bridge history), the Contractor shall orient its surveying centerlines, or select offsets at the former lane lines, so that the survey data consistently picks up the high spots at the former lane lines, and not any low spots in the wheel ruts.
The Contractor shall ensure a surveying accuracy to within ± 0.01 feet for vertical control and ± 0.2 feet for longitudinal and transverse control.
The Engineer will establish the Idealized Existing Bridge Deck Surface Model and the Top of Overlay Model based on the Contractor’s Existing Bridge Deck Surface Model, and will provide both to the Contractor within five Working Days after receiving the Contractor’s survey information.
Except for (1) the primary survey control information, (2) the Idealized Existing Bridge
Deck Surface Model, and (3) the Top of Overlay Model furnished by the Engineer, the
Contractor shall be responsible for all calculations, surveying, and measuring required for setting, maintaining, and resetting equipment and materials necessary for the construction of the overlay to the final grade profile. The Engineer may post-check the Contractor’s surveying, but these post-checks shall not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for internal survey quality control.

Excavation and Preparation of Trench 7-08.3(1)A
Trenches
The length of trench excavation in advance of pipe laying shall be kept to a minimum.
Excavations shall either be closed up at the end of the day or protected per
Section 1-07.23(1).
The trench width shall be as specified in Section 2-09.4 and shall be excavated to the depth and grade as staked by the Engineer.
Trenches must be of sufficient width in the pipe zone to permit proper installation and bedding of the pipe and to provide the required compaction of backfill. Above the top of the pipe zone, the Contractor may excavate to any width.
All ledgerock, boulders, and stones shall be removed to provide a minimum of 6 inches clearance under all portions of the pipe.
Placement of bedding material shall precede the installation of all pipe. This shall include necessary leveling of the native trench bottom or the top of the foundation material as well as placement and compaction of required bedding material to a uniform grade so that the entire length of pipe will be supported on a uniformly dense unyielding foundation.
When, after excavating to the foundation level, the material remaining in the trench bottom is determined to be unsuitable by the Engineer, excavation shall be continued to such additional depth and width as required by the Engineer. Unsuitable foundation materials shall be disposed of at an approved site. The trench foundation shall be backfilled to the bottom of the pipe zone with gravel backfill for foundations, gravel backfill for pipe zone bedding, or other suitable material, and compacted to form a uniformly dense, unyielding foundation.
All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench shall be maintained so that the toe of the slope is at least 2 feet from the edge of the trench. It shall be piled to cause a minimum of inconvenience to public travel, and provision shall be made for merging traffic where necessary. Free access shall be provided to all fire hydrants, water valves, and meters; and clearance shall be left to enable free flow of storm water in gutters, conduits, or natural watercourses.
If any part of the excavated material meets the Specifications of Section 9-03.12(3), the
Engineer may require that such material, in the quantity required, be selectively removed, stockpiled separately, and used as pipe bedding instead of quantities of gravel backfill for pipe zone bedding. If material so stockpiled becomes contaminated, the Contractor shall furnish suitable material in an amount equal to that lost by contamination at no expense to the Contracting Agency. All costs involved in storing, protecting, re-handling, and placing the material shall be included in other items of Work on the project.
Excavation for manholes and other Structures connected to the pipelines shall be sufficient to provide a minimum of 12 inches between their surfaces and the sides of the excavation.
Page 7-18

2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 General Pipe Installation Requirements 7-08
The Contractor shall furnish, install, and operate all necessary equipment to keep excavations above the foundation level free from water during construction, and shall dewater and dispose of the water so as not to cause injury to public or private property or nuisance to the public. Sufficient pumping equipment in good working condition shall be available at all times for all emergencies, including power outage, and shall have available at all times competent workers for the operation of the pumping equipment.
Where pipe is to be placed in a new embankment, the embankment shall be constructed as shown in the Plans or as designated by the Engineer for a distance each side of the pipe location of not less than five times the diameter and to a minimum height equal to ½ of the outside diameter of the pipe. The embankment material shall be compacted to 95 percent of maximum density and the moisture content at the time of compaction shall be between optimum and 3 percentage points below optimum as determined by the Compaction Control Tests specified in Section 2-03.3(14)D. The trench shall then be excavated to a width as specified in Section 2-09.4, and the pipe installed in accordance with the Standard Plans. 7-08.3(1)B
Shoring
The Contractor shall provide all materials, labor, and equipment necessary to shore trenches to protect the Work, existing property, utilities, pavement, etc., and to provide safe working conditions in the trench. The Contractor may elect to use any combination of shoring and overbreak, tunneling, boring, sliding trench shield, or other method of accomplishing the Work consistent with applicable local, State, or Federal safety codes.
If workers enter any trench or other excavation 4 feet or more in depth that does not meet the open pit requirements of Section 2-09.3(3)B, it shall be shored. The Contractor alone shall be responsible for worker safety, and the Contracting Agency assumes no responsibility.
Upon completing the Work, the Contractor shall remove all shoring unless the Plans or the Engineer direct otherwise.
Shoring to be removed, or moveable trench shields or boxes, shall be located at least 2½ pipe diameters away from metal or thermoplastic pipe if the bottom of the shoring, shield, or box extends below the top of the pipe, unless a satisfactory means of reconsolidating the bedding or side support material disturbed by shoring removal can be demonstrated.
Damages resulting from improper shoring or failure to shore shall be the sole responsibility of the Contractor. 7-08.3(1)C

Bedding the Pipe
Pipe zone bedding material shall provide uniform support along the entire pipe barrel, without load concentration at joint collars or bells. All adjustment to line and grade shall be made by scraping away or filling in with bedding material under the body of the pipe and not by blocking or wedging. Bedding disturbed by pipe movement, or by removal of shoring movement of a trench shield or box, shall be reconsolidated prior to backfill.
Pipe zone bedding shall be as specified in the Standard Plans and shall be compacted to
90 percent maximum density. Bedding shall be placed, spread, and compacted before the pipe is installed so that the pipe is uniformly supported along the barrel. Lifts of not more than 6 inches in thickness shall be placed and compacted along the sides of the pipe to the height shown in the Standard Plans. Material shall be worked carefully under the pipe haunches and then compacted.
If the Engineer determines that the material existing in the bottom of the trench is satisfactory for bedding the pipe, the bedding material specified in the Standard Plans is not required, provided the existing material is loosened, regraded, and compacted to form a dense, unyielding base.

Survey Line and Grade
Survey line and grade control hubs will be placed in a manner consistent with accepted practices.
The Contractor shall transfer line and grade into the trench where they shall be carried by means of a laser beam or taut grade line supported on firmly set batter boards at intervals of not more than 30 feet. Not less than three batter boards shall be in use at one time.
Grades shall be constantly checked and in the event the batter boards do not line up, the Work shall be immediately stopped, the Engineer notified, and the cause remedied before proceeding with the Work. Any other procedure shall have the written approval of the Engineer. 7-08.3(2)B
Pipe Laying – General
After an accurate grade line has been established, the pipe shall be laid in conformity with the established line and grade in the properly dewatered trench. Mud, silt, gravel, and other foreign material shall be kept out of the pipe and off the jointing surfaces.
All pipe laid in the trench to the specified line and grade shall be kept in longitudinal compression until the backfill has been compacted to the crown of the pipe. All pipe shall be laid to conform to the prescribed line and grade shown in the Plans, within the limits that follow.
Pipe shall be laid to a true line and grade at the invert of the pipe and the Contractor shall exercise care in matching pipe joints for concentricity and compatibility. In no case shall two pipes be joined together with ends having the maximum manufacturer’s tolerance.
The invert line may vary from the true line and grade within the limits stated to develop uniformity, concentricity, and uniform compression of jointing material provided such variance does not result in a reverse sloping invert. The limit of the variance at the invert shall not exceed plus or minus 0.03 feet at the time of backfill. Checking of the invert elevation of the pipe may be made by calculations from measurements on the top of the pipe.
The pipe, unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, shall be laid up grade from point of connection on the existing pipe or from a designated starting point. The pipe shall be installed with the bell end forward or upgrade. When pipe laying is not in progress, the forward end of the pipe shall be kept tightly closed with an approved temporary plug.
Where pipe joints must be deflected within the manufacturer’s recommended limits to accommodate required horizontal or vertical curvature, it shall first be joined in straight alignment and then deflected as required.
Where pipe joints must be deflected to an amount greater than the manufacturer’s recommended limits to accommodate required horizontal or vertical curvature, the curves shall be achieved with a series of tangents and shop fabricated bends, subject to the approval of the Engineer.
Upon final acceptance of the Work, all pipe and appurtenances shall be open, clean, and free draining. 7-08.3(2)C

Pipe Laying – Concrete
For concrete pipe with elliptical reinforcement, the markings indicating the minor axis of the reinforcement shall be placed in a vertical plane (top or bottom) when the pipe is laid.

Pipe Laying – Steel or Aluminum
Pipe with riveted or resistance spot welded seams shall be laid in the trench with the outside laps of circumferential joints upgrade and with longitudinal laps positioned other than in the invert, and firmly joined together with approved bands.
Aluminum pipe or pipe arch used in cement concrete shall be painted with two coats of paint. The paint shall cover all the surfaces in contact with the cement concrete and extend one inch beyond the point of contact. The aluminum pipe to be painted shall be cleaned with solvent to remove contaminants. After cleaning, the pipe shall be painted with two coats of paint conforming to Federal Specification TT-P-645 (primer, paint, zinc chromate, alkyd vehicle). Aluminized steel pipe will not require painting when placed in
Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or when in contact concrete head walls.
All costs of cleaning and painting the aluminum surfaces as specified shall be included in the unit Contract price per linear foot for the aluminum pipe or pipe arch. 7-08.3(2)E

Rubber Gasketed Joints
In laying pipe with rubber gaskets, the pipe shall be handled carefully to avoid knocking the gasket out of position or contaminating it with foreign material. Any gasket so disturbed shall be removed, cleaned, relubricated if required, and replaced before joining the sections.
The pipe shall be properly aligned before joints are forced home. Sufficient pressure shall be applied in making the joint to ensure that the joint is home, as defined in the standard installation instructions provided by the pipe manufacturer. The Contractor may use any method acceptable to the Engineer for pulling the pipe together, except that driving or ramming by hand or machinery will not be permitted. Any pipe damaged during joining and joint tightening shall be removed and replaced at no expense to the Contracting
Agency.
Care shall be taken to properly align the pipe before joints are entirely forced home.
During insertion of the tongue or spigot, the pipe shall be partially supported by hand, sling or crane to minimize unequal lateral pressure on the gasket and to maintain concentricity until the gasket is properly positioned. Since most gasketed joints tend to creep apart when the end of the pipe is deflected and straightened, such movement shall be held to a minimum once the joint is home.
Sufficient restraint shall be applied to the line to ensure that joints once home are held so by compacting backfill material under and alongside the pipe or by other acceptable means. At the end of the work day, the last pipe shall be blocked in such a manner as may be required to prevent creep. 7-08.3(2)F
Plugs and Connections
Plugs for pipe branches, stubs, or other open ends which are not to be immediately connected shall be made of an approved material and shall be secured in a place with a joint comparable to the main line joint, or stoppers may be of an integrally cast breakout design. 7-08.3(2)G
Jointing of Dissimilar Pipe

Dissimilar pipe shall be jointed by use of a factory-fabricated adapter coupling or a pipe collar as detailed in the Standard Plans.

Storm and sanitary sewer line connections to trunks, mains, laterals, or side sewers shall be left uncovered until after the Engineer has inspected and approved the Work. After approval of the connection, the trench shall be backfilled as specified. 7-08.3(2)I
Side Sewer Connections
Where a storm or sanitary side sewer is larger than the trunk, main, or lateral to which it is to be connected, the connection shall be made only at a standard manhole unless otherwise provided in the Plans or in the Special Provisions, or unless otherwise authorized by the Engineer. 7-08.3(3)
Backfilling

Placement of pipe zone backfill shall be performed in accordance with these requirements and the Standard Plans. Trenches shall be backfilled as soon after the pipe laying as possible.
Pipe zone backfill material shall be clean earth or sand, free from clay, frozen lumps, roots, or moisture in excess of that permitting required compaction. Rocks or lumps larger than
3 inches maximum shall not be used for pipe zone backfill.
Pipe zone backfill shall be placed in loose layers and compacted to 90 percent maximum density. Backfill shall be brought up simultaneously on each side of the pipe to the top of the pipe zone. The pipe shall then be covered to the top of the pipe zone and the materials compacted in a manner to avoid damaging or disturbing the completed pipe.
Backfill above the pipe zone shall be accomplished in such a manner that the pipe will not be shifted out of position nor damaged by impact or overloading. If pipe is being placed in a new embankment, backfill above the pipe zone shall be placed in accordance with
Section 2-03.3(14)C. If pipe is being placed under existing paved areas, or Roadways, backfill above the pipe zone shall be placed in horizontal layers no more than 6 inches thick and compacted to 95 percent maximum density. If pipe is being placed in non-traffic areas, backfill above the pipe zone shall be placed in horizontal layers no more than
6 inches thick and shall be compacted to 85 percent maximum density. All compaction shall be in accordance with the Compaction Control Test of Section 2-03.3(14)D, except in the case that 100% Recycled Concrete Aggregate is used. When 100% Recycled
Concrete Aggregate is used, the Contractor may submit a written request to use a test point evaluation for compaction acceptance. Test Point evaluation shall be performed in accordance with SOP 738. Material excavated from the trench shall be used for backfill above the pipe zone, except that organic material, frozen lumps, wood, rocks, or pavement chunks larger than 6 inches in maximum dimension shall not be used. Materials determined by the Engineer to be unsuitable for backfill at the time of excavation shall be removed and replaced with imported backfill material.
Backfilling of trenches in the vicinity of catch basins, manholes, or other appurtenances will not be permitted until the cement in the masonry has become thoroughly hardened.
When it is required that a blanket of select material or bank run gravel is to be placed on top of the native backfill, the backfill shall be placed to the elevations shown in the Plans, or to the elevations specified by the Engineer. Compaction of the native material shall be as required by the Contracting Agency and shall be performed prior to placing the select material. Surface material shall be loosened to whatever depth is required to prevent bridging of the top layer, but shall in no case be less than 18 inches.
The Contractor shall not operate tractors or other heavy equipment over the top of the pipe until the backfill has reached a height of 3 feet above the top of the pipe.

Hydrostatic Pressure Test
Water main appurtenances and service connections to the meter setter shall be tested in sections of convenient length under a hydrostatic pressure equal to 150 psi in excess of that under which they will operate or in no case shall the test pressure be less than 225 psi. Pumps, gauges, plugs, saddles, corporation stops, miscellaneous hose and piping, and measuring equipment necessary for performing the test shall be furnished and operated by the Contractor.
Sections to be tested shall normally be limited to 1,500 feet. The Engineer may require that the first section of pipe, not less than 1,000 feet in length, installed by each of the
Contractor’s crews, be tested in order to qualify the crew and the materials. Pipe laying shall not be continued more than an additional 1,000 feet until the first section has been tested successfully.
The pipeline shall be backfilled sufficiently to prevent movement of the pipe under pressure. Thrust blocks shall be in place and time allowed for the concrete to cure before testing. Where permanent blocking is not required, the Contractor shall furnish and install temporary blocking and remove it after testing.
The mains shall be filled with water and allowed to stand under pressure a sufficient length of time to allow the escape of air and allow the lining of the pipe to absorb water.
The Contracting Agency will furnish the water necessary to fill the pipelines for testing purposes at a time of day when sufficient quantities of water are available for normal system operation.
The test shall be accomplished by pumping the main up to the required pressure, stopping the pump for 15 minutes, and then pumping the main up to the test pressure again.
During the test, the section being tested shall be observed to detect any visible leakage.
A clean container shall be used for holding water for pumping up pressure on the main being tested. This makeup water shall be sterilized by the addition of chlorine to a concentration of 50 mg/l.
The quantity of water required to restore the pressure shall be accurately determined by pumping through a positive displacement water meter. The meter shall be approved by the Engineer. Acceptability of the test will be determined as follows:

Pressure gauges used in the test shall be accompanied with certifications of accuracy from a testing Laboratory approved by the Engineer.
Any visible leakage detected shall be corrected by the Contractor regardless of the allowable leakage specified above. Should the tested section fail to meet the pressure test successfully as specified, the Contractor shall, at no additional expense to the Contracting
Agency, locate and repair the defects and then retest the pipeline.
Tests shall be made with the hydrant auxiliary gate valves open and pressure against the hydrant valve. Each valve shall be tested by closing each in turn and relieving the pressure beyond. This test of the valve will be acceptable if there is no immediate loss of pressure on the gauge when the pressure comes against the valve being checked. The Contractor shall verify that the pressure differential across the valve does not exceed the rated working pressure of the valve.
Prior to calling out the Engineer to witness the pressure test, the Contractor shall have all equipment set up completely ready for operation and shall have successfully performed the test to ensure that the pipe is in satisfactory condition.
Defective materials or Work, discovered as a result of hydrostatic field test, shall be replaced by the Contractor at no additional expense to the Contracting Agency. Whenever it is necessary to replace defective material or correct the Work, the hydrostatic test shall be re-run at the Contractor’s expense until a satisfactory test is obtained. 7-09.3(23)A
Testing Extensions From Existing Mains
When an existing water main is extended with new pipe to a new valve and the distance from the existing pipe to the new valve is 18 feet or less, the section of new pipe installed between the new valve and the end of the existing main shall be made with pretested, prechlorinated pipe, and no hydrostatic test will be required. When the required hydrostatic tests are conducted in the new main section beyond the installed new valve in the closed position, the normal pressure of the existing main may be present against the other side of the new valve.
Where the distance between the end of an existing water main pipe extension to the new valve is more than 18 feet, the connection of the new pipe to existing pipe shall not be made until after hydrostatic tests have been made to the required pressure in both directions against the new valve. This shall be accomplished by a temporary cap or plug installed on the end of the new pipe, beyond the new valve, as close as possible to the existing pipe for testing purposes.
The short length of pipe between the temporary cap or plug end with the new valve in the closed position, with no hydrostatic pressure active on the opposite side of the valve, shall be subjected to the required test pressure. The same test shall be made against the other side of the new valve when that section of pipe is tested with no hydrostatic pressure active in the short section of pipe toward the existing main. The final connection to the existing main shall be made with pretested prechlorinated pipe. 7-09.3(23)B

Testing Section With Hydrants Installed
When hydrants are included with the section of main pipe to be tested, the testing shall be conducted in three separate tests as follows:
Test No. 1 – Water main gate valves and hydrant auxiliary gate valves closed, with the hydrant operating stem valves and hose ports wide open.
Test No. 2 – Water main gate valves and the hydrant operating the stem valves tightly closed but the hydrant auxiliary gate valves and hose ports wide open.

Dry Calcium Hypochlorite
As each length of pipe is laid, sufficient high-test calcium hypochlorite (65 to 70 percent chlorine) shall be placed inside the pipe to yield a dosage of not less than 50 mg/l available chlorine, calculated on the volume of the water that the pipe and appurtenances will contain.
The number of grams of 70 percent test calcium hypochlorite required for a 20-foot length of pipe equals 0.238 × d2, in which “d” is the diameter in inches. 7-09.3(24)E

Liquid Chlorine
A chlorine gas-water mixture shall be applied by means of a solution-feed chlorinating device, or the dry gas may be fed directly through proper devices for regulating the rate of flow and providing effective diffusion of the gas into the water within the pipe being treated. Chlorinating devices for feeding solutions of the chlorine gas, or the gas itself, must provide means for preventing the backflow of water into the chlorine. 7-09.3(24)F
Chlorine-Bearing Compounds in Water
A mixture of water and high-test calcium hypochlorite (65 to 70 percent Cl) may be substituted for the chlorine gas-water mixture. The dry powder shall first be mixed as a paste and then thinned to a 1 percent chlorine solution by adding water to give a total quantity of 7.5 gallons of water per pound of dry powder. This solution shall be injected in one end of the section of main to be disinfected while filling the main with water. 7-09.3(24)G
Sodium Hypochlorite
Sodium hypochlorite, commercial grade (12.5 percent Cl) or in the form of liquid household bleach (5 to 6 percent Cl), may be substituted for the chlorine gas-water mixture. This liquid chlorine compound may be used full strength or diluted with water and injected into the main in correct proportion to the fill water so that dosage applied to the water will be at least 50 mg/l. 7-09.3(24)H
Point of Application
The point of application of the chlorinating agent shall be at the beginning of the pipeline extension or any valved section of it, and through a corporation stop inserted in the horizontal axis of the pipe. The water injector for delivering the chlorine-bearing water into the pipe should be supplied from a tap on the pressure side of the gate valve controlling the flow into the pipeline extension. Alternate points of applications may be used when approved by the Engineer. 7-09.3(24)I
Rate of Application
Water from the existing distribution system, or other source of supply, shall be controlled to flow very slowly into the newly-laid pipeline during application of the chlorine. The rate of chlorine gas-water mixture or dry gas feed shall be in such proportion to the rate of water entering the newly-laid pipe that the dosage applied to the water will be at least

The chlorinating procedure to be followed shall be as specified in AWWA Standard C651.
All closure fittings shall be swabbed with a very strong chlorine solution at least as strong as liquid household bleach (5 to 6 percent Cl). 7-09.3(24)N
Final Flushing and Testing
Following chlorination, treated water shall be flushed from the newly-laid pipe until the replacement water throughout its length shows, upon test, the absence of chlorine. In the event chlorine is normally used in the source of supply, then the tests shall show a residual not in excess of that carried in the water supply system.
A sample tap shall be located ahead of the flushing hose for convenience and for sanitary sampling.
Before placing the lines into service, a satisfactory report shall be received from the local or State Health Department on samples collected from representative points in the new system. Samples will be collected and bacteriological tests obtained by the Engineer.
At a minimum, chlorinated water shall be dechlorinated to a concentration of 0.1 parts per million (ppm) or less, and pH adjustment to within 6.5 to 8.5 standard units, if necessary, before discharging to surface waters of the State or to a storm sewer system that drains to surface waters of the State. 7-09.3(24)O

Repetition of Flushing and Testing
Should the initial treatment result in an unsatisfactory bacteriological test, the original chlorination procedure shall be repeated by the Contractor until satisfactory results are obtained. Failure to get a satisfactory test shall be considered as failure of the Contractor to keep the pipe clean during construction, or to properly chlorinate the main. 7-09.4
Measurement
Measurement for payment of pipe for water mains will be by the linear foot of pipe laid and tested and shall be measured along the pipe through fittings, valves, and couplings.
Measurement for payment of blowoff assembly will be per each.
When listed as a pay item, rock excavation will be measured in its original position by volume in cubic yards.

Cleaning and Testing 7-17.3(2)A
General
Sewers and appurtenances, where required in the Plans, shall be cleaned and tested after backfilling by either the exfiltration or low pressure air method at the option of the
Contractor, except where the ground water table is such that the Engineer may require the infiltration test.
All Work involved in cleaning and testing sewer lines between manholes or rodding inlets as required shall be completed within 15 working days after backfilling of sewer lines and Structures. Any further delay will require the written consent of the Engineer. The
Contractor shall furnish all labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to make the test, clean the lines, and perform all incidental Work. The Contractor shall perform the tests under the direction and in the presence of the Engineer. Precautions shall be taken to prevent joints from drawing during tests, and any damage resulting from these tests shall be repaired by the Contractor at no expense to the Contracting Agency. The manner and time of testing shall be subject to approval by the Engineer.
All yes, tees, and stubs shall be plugged with flexible jointed caps, or acceptable alternate, securely fastened to withstand the internal test pressure. Such plugs or caps shall be readily removable, and their removal shall provide a socket suitable for making a flexible jointed lateral connection or extension.
Testing side sanitary sewers shall be for their entire length from the public sewer in the street to the connection with the building’s plumbing. Their testing shall be as required by the local sanitary agency but in no case shall it be less thorough than that of filling the pipe with water before backfilling and visually inspecting the exterior for leakage. The decision of the Engineer as to acceptance of the side sanitary sewer shall be final.
If any sewer installation fails to meet the requirements of the test method used, the
Contractor shall determine, at no expense to the Contracting Agency, the source or sources of leakage and shall repair or replace all defective materials or Work at no expense to the Contracting Agency. The complete pipe installation shall meet the requirements of the test method used before being considered acceptable. 7-17.3(2)B

Exfiltration Test
Prior to making exfiltration leakage tests, the Contractor may fill the pipe with clear water to permit normal absorption into the pipe walls provided, however, that after so filling the pipe, the Contractor shall complete the leakage test within 24 hours after filling. When under test, the allowable leakage shall be limited according to the provisions that follow.
Specified allowances assume pre-wetted pipe.
Leakage shall be no more than 0.28 gph per inch diameter per 100 feet of sewer, with a hydrostatic head of 6 feet above the crown at the upper end of the test section, or above the natural ground water table at the time of test, whichever is higher. The length of pipe tested shall be limited so that the pressure at the lower end of the Section tested does not exceed 16 feet of head above the invert, and in no case shall be greater than 700 feet or the distance between manholes when greater than 700 feet.
Where the test head is other than 6 feet, the maximum leakage shall not exceed the amount determined from the following equation:
Maximum leakage (in gallons per hour) = 0.28 × (√H/√6) × D × (L/100)
Where:
D = diameter (in.)
L = length of pipe (ft.)
H = test head (ft.)
When the test is to be made one joint at a time, the leakage per joint shall not exceed the computed allowable leakage per length of pipe.
Page 7-50

2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Sanitary Sewers 7-17.3(2)C 7-17
Infiltration Test
Where the natural ground water head over the pipe is 2 feet or less above the crown of pipe at the upper end of the test section, the infiltration test leakage shall not exceed
0.16 gallons per hour per inch of diameter per 100 feet of pipe length. The length of pipe tested shall not exceed 700 feet or the distance between manholes when greater than
700 feet.
Where the natural ground water head is greater than 2 feet, the maximum leakage shall not exceed the amount determined from the following equation:
Maximum leakage (in` gallons per hour) = 0.16 × (√H/√2) × D × (L/100)
Where:
D = diameter (in.)
L = length of pipe (ft.)
H = natural ground water head (ft.)
When a suitable head of ground water exists above the crown of the pipe and when the pipe is large enough to work inside, acceptance may be based on the repair of visible leakage by means satisfactory to the Engineer. 7-17.3(2)D

Other Test Allowances
For either the infiltration or exfiltration test, all lateral or side sewer branches included in the test section shall be taken into account in computing allowable leakage. An allowance of 0.2 gallons per hour per foot of head above invert shall be made for each manhole included in a test section.
Upon final acceptance of the Work all sewers, side sewers and fittings shall be open, clean, and free draining. 7-17.3(2)E
Low Pressure Air Test for Sanitary Sewers Constructed of Air Permeable
Materials
Air permeable materials include concrete and vitrified clay. Low pressure air testing may be used for air permeable pipes 30 inches in diameter and smaller.
The test equipment to be used shall be furnished by the Contractor and shall be inspected and approved by the Engineer prior to use. The Engineer may at any time require a calibration test of gauges or other instrumentation that is incorporated into the test equipment. Calibration tests shall be certified by an independent testing Laboratory.
Plugs used to close the pipe for the air test must be securely braced to prevent the unintentional release of a plug, which can become a high velocity projectile. Gauges, air piping manifold, and valves shall be located at the top of the ground. No one shall be permitted to enter a manhole or catch basin where a plugged pipe is under pressure. Air testing apparatus shall be equipped with a pressure release device, such as a rupture disk or a pressure relief valve, designed to activate when the pressure in the pipe exceeds
2 psig above the required test pressure.
If the pipe to be tested is submerged by groundwater, the backpressure on the pipe created by the groundwater submergence must be determined. All gauge pressures described in the test shall be increased by that amount.
The first section of pipe installed by each crew shall be tested in order to qualify the crew and material. A successful test for the section shall be a prerequisite to further installation by that crew. Following the initial test, pipes shall be tested from manhole to manhole, catch basin to catch basin, or such shorter lengths as determined by the Contractor.

Air shall be slowly supplied to the plugged pipe section until the internal air pressure reaches 4 psig. Wait at least 2 minutes to allow for pressure and temperature stabilization to occur within the pipe.
When the pressure decreases to 3.5 psig, the air pressure test shall begin. The test shall consist of measuring the time in seconds for the pressure in the pipe to drop from 3.5 psig to 2.5 psig. The pipe shall be considered acceptable if the time in seconds for the pressure drop is equal to or greater than the required time as calculated below:
K = 0.0111d2L
C = 0.0003918dL

Low Pressure Air Test for Sanitary Sewers Constructed of Non Air
Permeable Materials
Non air permeable materials include ductile iron, ABS composite, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polyethylene (PE). When non air permeable pipe is subjected to a low-pressure air test, all of the provisions of Section 7-17.3(2)E shall apply, except that the time in seconds for the pressure drop shall be equal to or greater than four times the required time calculated in Section 7-17.3(2)E.
ASTM C1103.
Reaches of thermoplastic pipe containing no joints shall be exempt from testing requirements. 7-17.3(2)G

Deflection Test for Thermoplastic Pipe
Sanitary sewers constructed of thermoplastic pipe shall be tested for deflection not less than 30 days after the trench backfill and compaction has been completed. The test shall be conducted by pulling a properly sized “go-nogo” mandrel through the completed pipeline. Testing shall be conducted on a manhole-to-manhole basis and shall be done after the line has been completely flushed out with water.
The mandrel shall be a rigid, nonadjustable mandrel having an effective length of not less than its normal diameter and an odd-number of legs (9 legs minimum). Minimum diameter at any point along the full length of the mandrel shall be 95 percent of the base inside diameter of the pipe being tested.

Pavement Marking
Description
This Work consists of furnishing, installing, and removing pavement markings upon the
Roadway surface in accordance with the Plans, Standard Plans, the FHWA publication
Standard Alphabet for Highway Signs and Pavement Markings and these Specifications, at locations shown in the Contract or as ordered by the Engineer in accordance with
Section 1-04.4.
Pavement Markings may be either Longitudinal (long) Line Markings or Transverse
Markings. Longitudinal line markings are generally placed parallel and adjacent to the flow of traffic. Transverse markings are generally placed perpendicular and across the flow of traffic. Word and symbol markings are classified as transverse markings. Traffic letters used in word messages shall be sized as shown in the Plans. 8-22.2

Materials
Material for pavement marking shall be paint or plastic as noted in the Bid item meeting the requirements of Section 9-34. Glass beads for paint shall meet the requirements of Section 9-34.4. Glass beads for plastic shall be as recommended by the material manufacturer. 8-22.3
Construction Requirements 8-22.3(1)
Preliminary Spotting
The Engineer will provide necessary control points at intervals agreed upon with the
Contractor to assist in preliminary spotting of the lines before marking begins. The
Contractor shall be responsible for preliminary spotting of the lines to be marked.
Approval by the Engineer is required before marking begins. Preliminary spotting to guide the striping machine is required for all longitudinal lines except where a clearly visible separation is present. Preliminary spotting shall be provided at a spacing of 100 feet maximum on tangents and 25‑feet maximum on curves. The color of the material used for spotting shall match the color of the permanent marking. 8-22.3(2)
Preparation of Roadway Surfaces
All surfaces shall be dry, free of loose debris, and within the proper temperature range prior to striping. When required by the pavement marking manufacturer’s installation instructions, pavement markings that will adversely affect the bond of new pavement marking material to the roadway surface shall be removed from pavement surfaces in accordance with Section 8-22.3(6).
Remove all other contaminants from pavement surfaces that may adversely affect the installation of new pavement marking.
Apply pavement marking materials to new HMA that is sufficiently cured according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Typically, Type D material applied to new HMA pavement requires a pavement cure period of 21 days. This cure period may be reduced if the manufacturer performs a successful adhesion test and approves the reduction of the pavement cure period.
For new Portland cement concrete surfaces, remove curing compounds and laitance by an approved mechanical means. Air blast the pavement with a high-pressure system to remove extraneous or loose material. Apply pavement marking materials to concrete that has reached a minimum compressive strength of 2,500 psi and that is sufficiently cured according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Typically, Type D material applied to
Portland cement concrete pavement requires a pavement cure period of 28 days. This cure period may be reduced if the manufacturer performs a successful adhesion test and approves the reduction of the pavement cure period.

Geosynthetic Material Requirements
The term geosynthetic shall be considered to be inclusive of geotextiles, geogrids, and prefabricated drainage mats.
Geotextiles, including geotextiles attached to prefabricated drainage core to form a prefabricated drainage mat, shall consist only of long chain polymeric fibers or yarns formed into a stable network such that the fibers or yarns retain their position relative to each other during handling, placement, and design service life. At least 95 percent by weight of the material shall be polyolefins or polyesters. The material shall be free from defects or tears. The geotextile shall also be free of any treatment or coating which might adversely alter its hydraulic or physical properties after installation.
Geogrids shall consist of a regular network of integrally connected polymer tensile elements with an aperture geometry sufficient to permit mechanical interlock with the surrounding backfill. The long chain polymers in the geogrid tensile elements, not including coatings, shall consist of at least 95 percent by mass of the material of polyolefins or polyesters. The material shall be free of defects, cuts, and tears.
Prefabricated drainage core shall consist of a three dimensional polymeric material with a structure that permits flow along the core laterally, and which provides support to the geotextiles attached to it.
The geosynthetic shall conform to the properties as indicated in Tables 1 through 8 in Section 9-33.2, and additional tables as required in the Standard Plans and Special
