field. PGSuper calculates estimated cambers at 40 days (D40) and 120 days (D120). Due to variations in observed camber, these estimated cambers are generally considered to be upper bounds at their respective times. This is based on measured girder cambers of prestressed concrete girders compared with the estimated cambers from PGSuper. D @ 120 Days is the upper bound of expected camber range at a girder age of 120 days after the release of prestress and is primarily intended to mitigate interference between the top of the cambered girder and the placement of concrete deck reinforcement. It is also used to calculate the “A” dimension at the girder ends. The age of 120 days was chosen because data has shown that additional camber growth after this age is negligible. D @ 120 Days may be taken as D120, the estimated camber at 120 days reported by PGSuper. D @ 40 Days is the lower bound of expected camber range at a girder age of 40 days (30 days after the earliest allowable girder shipping age of 10 days). To match the profile grade, girders with too little camber require an increased volume of haunch concrete along the girder length. For girders with large flange widths, such as the WF series, this can add up to significant quantities of additional concrete for a large deck placement. Thus, the lower bound of camber allows the contractor to assess the risk of increased concrete quantities and mitigates claims for additional material. D @ 40 Days shall be taken as 50 percent of D40, the estimated camber at 40 days reported by PGSuper. Figure 5.2.4-1 shows a typical pattern of girder deflection with time at centerline span. Portions of this characteristic curve are described below. The subparagraph numbers correspond to circled numbers on the curve.

5.2.4.B.1
Elastic Deflection Due to Release of Prestress
The prestress force produces moments in the girder tending to bow the girder upward. Resisting these moments are girder section dead load moments. The result is a net upward deflection. 5.2.4.B.2
Creep Deflection Before Cutting Temporary Strands
The girder continues to deflect upward due to the effect of creep. This effect is computed using the equation stated in Section 5.1.1E. 5.2.4.B.3
Deflection Due to Cutting of Temporary Strands
Cutting of temporary strands results in an elastic upward deflection. The default time interval for creep calculations for release of top temporary strands is 90 days after the release of prestress during girder fabrication for D120 (10 days for D40). 5.2.4.B.4
Diaphragm Load Deflection
The load of diaphragm is applied to the girder section resulting in an elastic downward deflection. The default time interval for creep calculations for placing diaphragms is 90 days after the release of prestress during girder fabrication for D120 (10 days for D40). 5.2.4.B.5
Creep Deflection After Casting Diaphragms
The girder continues to deflect upward for any time delay between diaphragms and deck slab casting. 5.2.4.B.6
Deck Slab Load Deflection
The load of the deck slab is applied to the girder section resulting in an elastic downward deflection. The default time interval for creep calculations for placing the deck slab is 120 days after the release of prestress during girder fabrication for D120 (40 days for D40). 5.2.4.B.7
Superimposed Dead Load Deflection
The load of the traffic barriers, sidewalk, overlay, etc. is applied to the composite girder section resulting in an elastic downward deflection. 5.2.4.B.8
Final Camber
It might be expected that the above deck slab dead load deflection would be accompanied by a continuing downward deflection due to creep. However, many measurements of actual structure deflections have shown that once the deck slab is poured, the girder tends to act as though it is locked in position. To obtain a smooth riding surface on the deck, the deflection indicated on Figure 5.2.4-1 as “Screed Camber” (known as “C”) is added to the profile grade elevation of the deck screeds. The “C” dimension and the “Screed Setting Dimensions” detail shall be given in the plans. 5.2.4.C
Pre-camber
Prestressed concrete girders may be precambered to compensate for the natural camber and for the effect of the roadway geometry.

Reinforced Concrete Box Girder Bridges Post-tensioning shall be required for all new CIP reinforced concrete single-span or multispan box girder bridges. The use of CIP reinforced concrete (RC) box girder bridges without post-tensioning shall be restricted to widening existing RC box girder bridges. RC box girder bridges may also be used for bridges with tight curvatures or irregular geometry upon the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer’s approval. Partial prestressing shall not be considered for design of RC box girders. The performance and longevity of RC box girder bridges have been a major concern. Cracking in RC box girders are flexural in nature and are an inherent part of reinforced concrete design. RC box girders are designed for ultimate strength and checked for distribution of reinforcement for service conditions and control of cracking. This means that the concrete cracks under applied loads but the cracks are under control. Open cracks in RC box girders result in rebar corrosion and concrete deterioration, affecting the bridge longevity. Post-tensioning RC box girders eliminates cracks, limits corrosion, and improves structural performance. The above requirements apply equally to RC T-beam and slab bridges. However, these types of superstructures are not encouraged. See also Sections 2.4.1.C and 2.4.1.D.
5.3.1
Box Girder Basic Geometries 5.3.1.A
Web Spacing
The most economical web spacing for ordinary box girder bridges varies from about 8 to 12 feet. Greater girder spacing requires some increase in both top and bottom slab thickness, but the cost of the additional concrete can be offset by decreasing the total number of girder stems. Fewer girder stems reduces the amount of form work required and can lower costs. The number of girder stems can be reduced by cantilevering the top slab beyond the exterior girders. A deck overhang of approximately one-half the girder spacing generally gives satisfactory results. This procedure usually results in a more aesthetic as well as a more economical bridge. For girder stem spacing in excess of 12 feet or cantilever overhang in excess of 6 feet, transverse post-tensioning shall be used. 5.3.1.B
Basic Dimensions
The basic dimensions for concrete box girders with vertical and sloped exterior webs are shown in Figures 5.3.1-1 and 5.3.1-2, respectively. 5.3.1.B.1

Construction Considerations
Review the following construction considerations to minimize constructability problems: 1.
Construction joints at slab/stem interface or fillet/stem interface at top slab are appropriate.
2.
All construction joints to have roughened surfaces.
3.
Bottom slab is parallel to top slab (constant depth).
4.
Girder stems are vertical.
5.
Dead load deflection and camber to nearest ⅛″.
6.
Skew and curvature effects have been considered.
7.
Thermal effects have been considered.
8.
The potential for falsework settlement is acceptable. This always requires added stirrup reinforcement in sloped outer webs.
5.3.1.D
Load Distribution
5.3.1.D.1
Unit Design
According to the AASHTO LRFD, the entire slab width shall be assumed effective for compression. It is both economical and desirable to design the entire superstructure as a unit rather than as individual girders. When a reinforced box girder bridge is designed as an individual girder with a deck overhang, the positive reinforcement is congested in the exterior cells. The unit design method permits distributing all girder reinforcement uniformly throughout the width of the structure. 5.3.1.D.2
Dead Loads
Include additional D.L. for top deck forms: 5 pounds per square foot of the area. 10 pounds per square foot if web spacing > 10′-0″. 5.3.1.D.3
Live Load
See Section 3.9.4 for live load distribution to superstructure and substructure.

For CIP sloped outer webs, increase inside stirrup reinforcement and bottom slab top transverse reinforcement as required for the web moment locked-in during construction of the top slab. This moment about the bottom corner of the web is due to tributary load from the top slab concrete placement plus 10 psf form dead load. See Figure 5.3.2-10 for typical top slab forming. 5.3.2.D

Notes: 1. The diagonal brace supports web forms during web pour. After cure, the web is stiffer than the brace, and the web attracts load from subsequent concrete placements. 2. The tributary load includes half the overhang because the outer web form remains tied to and transfers load to the web which is considerably stiffer than the formwork. 3. Increase web reinforcement for locked-in construction load due to top slab forming for sloped web box girders. Page 5-50

Crossbeam 5.3.3.A
General
Crossbeam shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of strength limit state design of AASHTO LRFD and shall satisfy the serviceability requirements for crack control. 5.3.3.B
Basic Geometry
For aesthetic purposes, it is preferable to keep the crossbeam within the superstructure so that the bottom slab of the entire bridge is a continuous plane surface interrupted only by the columns. Although the depth of the crossbeam may be limited, the width can be made as wide as necessary to satisfy design requirements. Normally, it varies from 3 feet to the depth of box but is not less than the column size plus 1′-0″ to allow placement of the column reinforcement as shown in see Figures 5.3.3-1 and 5.3.3-2. Crossbeams on box girder type of construction shall be designed as a T beam utilizing the flange in compression, assuming the deck slab acts as a flange for positive moment and bottom slab a flange for negative moment. The effective overhang of the flange on a cantilever beam shall be limited to six times the flange thickness. The bottom slab thickness is frequently increased near the crossbeam in order to keep the main box girder compressive stresses to a desirable level for negative girder moments as shown in Figures 5.3.3-1 and 5.3.3-2. This bottom slab flare also helps resist negative crossbeam moments. Consideration should be given to flaring the bottom slab at the crossbeam for designing the cap even if it is not required for resisting main girder moments. 5.3.3.C
Loads
For concrete box girders the superstructure dead load shall be considered as uniformly distributed over the crossbeam. For concrete box girders the live load shall be considered as the truck load directly to the crossbeam from the wheel axles. Truck axles shall be moved transversely over the crossbeam to obtain the maximum design forces for the crossbeam and supporting columns. 5.3.3.D
Reinforcement Design and Details
The crossbeam section consists of rectangular section with overhanging deck and bottom slab if applicable. The effective width of the crossbeam flange overhang shall be taken as the lesser of:
• 6 times slab thickness,
• 1/10 of column spacing, or
• 1/20 of crossbeam cantilever as shown in Figure 5.3.3-3. The crossbeam shall have a minimum width of column dimension plus 6″. Crossbeam is usually cast to the fillet below the top slab. To avoid cracking of concrete on top of the crossbeam, construction reinforcement shall be provided at approximately 3″ below the construction joint. The design moment for construction reinforcement shall be the factored negative dead load moment due to the weight of crossbeam and adjacent 10′ of superstructure each side. The total amount of construction reinforcement shall be adequate to develop an ultimate moment at the critical section at least 1.2 times the cracking moment Mcr.

Top Reinforcement
The negative moment critical section shall be at the ¼ point of the square or equivalent square columns. 1.
When Skew Angle ≤ 25° If the bridge is tangent or slightly skewed deck transverse reinforcement is normal or radial to centerline bridge, the negative cap reinforcement can be placed either in contact with top deck negative reinforcement (see Figure 5.3.3-1) or directly under the main deck reinforcement.
2.
When Skew Angle > 25° When the structure is on a greater skew and the deck steel is normal or radial to the longitudinal centerline of the bridge, the negative cap reinforcement should be lowered to below the main deck reinforcement (see Figure 5.3.3-2).
3.
To avoid cracking of concrete Interim reinforcement is required below the construction joint in crossbeams.

Skin Reinforcement
Longitudinal skin reinforcement shall be provided in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.6.7.

End Diaphragm 5.3.4.A
Basic Geometry
Bearings at the end diaphragms are usually located under the girder stems to transfer loads directly to the pier as shown in Figure 5.3.4-1. In this case, the diaphragm width shall be equal to or greater than bearing grout pads as shown Figure 5.3.4-2. Designer shall provide access space for maintenance and inspection of bearings. Allowance shall be provided to remove and replace the bearings. Lift point locations, jack capacity, number of jacks, and maximum permitted lift shall be shown in the plan details. Figure 5.3.4-1

Dead Load Deflection and Camber Camber is the adjustment made to the vertical alignment to compensate for the anticipated dead load deflection and the long-term deflection caused by shrinkage and creep. Estimating long-term deflection and camber for reinforced concrete flexural members shall be based on the creep coefficient given in Section 5.1.1E. Alternatively, Table 5.3.5-1 may be used for long-term camber multipliers. Table 5.3.5-1
Long-term Camber Multipliers Multiplier Coefficient
Girder Adjacent to Existing/Stage Construction Deflection (downward) — apply to the elastic deflection due to the weight of member Deflection (downward) — apply to the elastic deflection due to superimposed dead load only Girder Away From Existing/Stage Construction Deflection (downward) — apply to the elastic deflection due to the weight of member Deflection (downward) — apply to the elastic deflection due to superimposed dead load only
1.90 2.20
2.70 3.00
In addition to dead load deflection, forms and falsework tend to settle and compress under the weight of freshly placed concrete. The amount of this take-up is dependent upon the type and design of the falsework, workmanship, type and quality of materials and support conditions. The camber shall be modified to account for anticipated take-up in the falsework.

Chapter 5
Thermal Effects Concrete box girder bridges are subjected to stresses and/or movements resulting from temperature variation. Temperature effects result from time-dependent variations in the effective bridge temperature and from temperature differentials within the bridge superstructure. 5.3.6.A
Effective Bridge Temperature and Movement
Proper temperature expansion provisions are essential in order to ensure that the structure will not be damaged by thermal movements. These movements, in turn, induce stresses in supporting elements such as columns or piers, and result in horizontal movement of the expansion joints and bearings. For more details see Chapter 8. 5.3.6.B
Differential Temperature
Although time-dependent variations in the effective temperature have caused problems in both reinforced and prestressed concrete bridges, detrimental effects caused by temperature differential within the superstructure have occurred only in prestressed bridges. Therefore, computation of stresses and movements resulting from the vertical temperature gradients is not included in this chapter. For more details, see AASHTO Guide Specifications, Thermal Effects on Concrete Bridge Superstructures dated 1989.
5.3.7
Hinges Hinges are one of the weakest links of box girder bridges subject to earthquake forces and it is desirable to eliminate hinges or reduce the number of hinges. For more details on the design of hinges, see Section 5.4. Designer shall provide access space or pockets for maintenance and inspection of bearings. Allowance shall be provided to remove and replace the bearings. Lift point locations, maximum lift permitted, jack capacity, and number of jacks shall be shown in the hinge plan details.
5.3.8
Drain Holes Drain holes shall be placed in the bottom slab at the low point of each cell to drain curing water during construction and any rain water that leaks through the deck slab. Additional drains shall be provided as a safeguard against water accumulation in the cell (especially when waterlines are carried by the bridge). In some instances, drainage through the bottom slab is difficult and other means shall be provided (i.e., cells over large piers and where a sloping exterior web intersects a vertical web). In this case, a horizontal drain shall be provided through the vertical web. Figure 5.3.8-1 shows drainage details for the bottom slab of concrete box girder bridges with steel wire screen.

Hinges and Inverted T-Beam Pier Caps Hinges and inverted T-beam pier caps require special design and detailing considerations. Continuous hinge shelves (both top and bottom projecting shelves) and continuous ledges of inverted T-beam pier caps, which support girders, are shown in Figure 5.4-1. In each case, vertical tensile forces (hanger tension) act at the intersection of the web and the horizontal hinge shelf or ledge. In the ledges of inverted T-beam pier caps, passage of live loads may also cause reversing torsional stresses which together with conventional longitudinal shear and bending produce complex stress distributions in the ledges7, 8. Figure 5.4-2 provides minimum shelf or ledge support lengths (N) and provides positive longitudinal linkage (e.g., earthquake restrainers) in accordance with the current AASHTO LRFD Guide Specifications for Seismic Design requirements. Design considerations for beam ledges, inverted T-beam and hinges are given in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.8.4.3. Inverted T-beam pier caps shall not be used for prestressed concrete girder bridges unless approved by the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer. Figure 5.4-1

Bridge Widenings This section provides general guidance for the design of bridge widenings. Included are additions to the substructure and the superstructure of reinforced concrete box girder, flat slab, T-beam, and prestressed concrete girder bridges. For additional information, see ACI Committee Report, Guide for Widening Highway Bridges9.
5.5.1
Review of Existing Structures 5.5.1.A
General
Obtain the following documents from existing records for preliminary review, design, and plan preparation: 1.
The “As-Built” contract plans, usually available from the ”Bridge Engineering Information System” on the Bridge and Structures Office website.
2.
The original contract plans and special provisions, which can be obtained from Engineering Records (Plans Vault), Records Control or the ”Bridge Engineering Information System” on the Bridge and Structures Office website.
3.
Check with the WSDOT Bridge Preservation Office for records of any unusual movements/rotations and other structural information.
4.
Original design calculations, which are stored in State Archives.
5.
Current field measurements. Current field measurements of existing pier crossbeam locations are recommended so that new prestressed concrete girders are not fabricated too short or too long. This is particularly important if piers have been constructed with different skews.
6.
Original and current Foundation Reports from the Materials Lab or from the Plans Vault.
7.
Change Order files to the original bridge contract Bridge Archive Engineer.
5.5.1.B
Original Contract Plans and Special Provisions
Location and size of reinforcement, member sizes and geometry, location of construction joints, details, allowable design soil pressure, and test hole data are given on the plans. Original contract plans can be more legible than the microfilm copies. The special provisions may include pertinent information that is not covered on the plans or in the AASHTO LRFD Specifications. 5.5.1.C
Original Calculations
The original calculations should be reviewed for any “special assumptions” or office criteria used in the original design. The actual stresses in the structural members, which will be affected by the widening, should be reviewed. This may affect the structure type selected for the widening. 5.5.1.D
Final Records
For major widening/renovation projects, the Final Records should be reviewed particularly for information about the existing foundations and piles. Sometimes the piles indicated on the original plans were omitted, revised, or required preboring. Final Records are available from Records Control or Bridge Records (Final Records on some older bridges may be in storage at the Materials Lab). WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

5.5.2
Concrete Structures
Analysis and Design Criteria 5.5.2.A
General
Each widening represents a unique situation and construction operations may vary between widening projects. The guidelines in this section are based on years of WSDOT design experience with bridge widenings. 5.5.2.A.1
Appearance
The widening of a structure should be accomplished in such a manner that the existing structure does not look “added on to.” When this is not possible, consideration should be given to enclosure walls, cover panels, paint, or other aesthetic treatments. Where possible and appropriate, the structure’s appearance should be improved by the widening. 5.5.2.A.2
Materials
Preferably, materials used in the construction of the widening shall have the same thermal and elastic properties as the materials in the original structure. 5.5.2.A.3
Load Distribution and Construction Sequence
The members of the widening should be proportioned to provide similar longitudinal and transverse load distribution characteristics as the existing structure. Normally this can be achieved by using the same cross sections and member lengths that were used in the existing structure. The construction sequence and degree of interaction between the widening and the existing structure, after completion, shall be fully considered in determining the distribution of the dead load for design of the widening and stress checks for the existing structure. A suggested construction sequence or stage construction shall be clearly shown in the plans to avoid confusion and misinterpretation during construction. A typical construction sequence may involve placing the deck concrete, removing the falsework, placing the concrete for the closure strip, and placing the concrete for the traffic barrier. 5.5.2.A.4
Specifications
The design of the widening shall conform to the current AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications and the Standard Specifications. 5.5.2.A.5
Geometrical Constraints
The overall appearance and geometrical dimensions of the superstructure and columns of the widening should be the same or as close as possible to those of the existing structure. This is to ensure that the widening will have the same appearance and similar structural stiffness as the original structure. 5.5.2.A.6
Overlay
It should be established at the preliminary plan stage if an overlay is required as part of the widening.
Page 5-62
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
5.5.2.A.7
Strength of the Existing Structure
A review of the strength of the main members of the existing structure shall be made for construction conditions utilizing AASHTO LRFD Specifications. A check of the existing main members after attachment of the widening shall be made for the final design loading condition. If the existing structural elements do not have adequate strength, consult your Design Unit Manager or in the case of consultants, contact the Consultant Liaison Engineer for appropriate guidance. If significant demolition is required on the existing bridge, consideration should be given to requesting concrete strength testing for the existing bridge and including this information in the contract documents. 5.5.2.A.8
Special Considerations
1.
For structures that were originally designed for HS-20 loading, HL-93 shall be used to design the widening. For structures that were originally designed for less than HS-20, consideration should be given to replacing the structure instead of widening it.
2.
Longitudinal joints are not permitted in order to eliminate potentially hazardous vehicle control problems.
3.
The Standard Specifications do not permit falsework to be supported from the existing structure unless the Plans and Specifications state otherwise. This requirement eliminates the transmission of vibration from the existing structure to the widening during construction. The existing structure may still be in service.
4.
For narrow widenings where the Plans and Specifications require that the falsework be supported from the original structure (e.g., there are no additional girders, columns, crossbeams, or closure strips), there shall be no external rigid supports such as posts or falsework from the ground. Supports from the ground do not permit the widening to deflect with the existing structure when traffic is on the existing structure. This causes the uncured concrete of the widening to crack where it joins the existing structure. Differential dead load deflection during construction shall be given consideration.
5.
Precast members may be used to widen existing CIP structures. This method is useful when the horizontal or vertical clearances during construction are insufficient to build CIP members.
6.
The alignment for diaphragms for the widening shall generally coincide with the existing diaphragms.
7.
When using battered piles, estimate the pile tip elevations and ensure that they will have ample clearance from all existing piles, utilities, or other obstructions. Also check that there is sufficient clearance between the existing structure and the pile driving equipment.

Seismic Design Criteria for Bridge Widenings
Seismic design of bridge widenings shall be in accordance with Section 4.3.

5.5.2.C.1
Selection of Foundation
1.
The type of foundation to be used to support the widening shall generally be the same as that of the existing structure unless otherwise recommended by the Geotechnical Engineer. The effects of possible differential settlement between the new and the existing foundations shall be considered.
2.
Consider present bridge site conditions when determining new foundation locations. The conditions include: overhead clearance for pile driving equipment, horizontal clearance requirements, working room, pile batters, channel changes, utility locations, existing embankments, and other similar conditions.
5.5.2.C.2
Scour and Drift
Added piles and columns for widenings at water crossings may alter stream flow characteristics at the bridge site. This may result in pier scouring to a greater depth than experienced with the existing configuration. Added substructure elements may also increase the possibility of trapping drift. The Hydraulics Engineer shall be consulted concerning potential problems related to scour and drift on all widenings at water crossings. 5.5.2.D
Superstructure
5.5.2.D.1
Camber
Accurate prediction of dead load deflection is more important for widenings than for new bridges, since it is essential that the deck grades match. To obtain a smooth transition in transverse direction of the bridge deck, the camber of the girder adjacent to the existing structure shall be adjusted for the difference in camber between new and existing structure. A linear interpolation may be used to adjust the camber of the girders located away from the existing structure. The multipliers for estimating camber of new structure may be taken as shown in Table 5.3.5-1. 5.5.2.D.2
Closure Strip
Except for narrow deck slab widenings a closure strip is required for all widenings. The width shall be the minimum required to accommodate the necessary reinforcement and for form removal. Reinforcement which extends through the closure strip shall be investigated. Shear shall be transferred across the closure strip by shear friction and/or shear keys. All falsework supporting the widening shall be released and formwork supporting the closure strip shall be supported from the existing and newly widened structures prior to placing concrete in the closure strip. Because of deck slab cracking experienced in widened concrete decks, closure strips are required unless the mid-span dead load camber is ½″ or less. In prestressed concrete girder bridge widenings, the closure shall extend through the intermediate and end diaphragms. The diaphragms shall be made continuous with existing diaphragms.

5.5.2.D.3
Stress Levels and Deflections in Existing Structures
Caution is necessary in determining the cumulative stress levels, deflections, and the need for shoring in existing structural members during rehabilitation projects. The designer shall investigate the adequacy of the existing structure adjacent to the widening for any additional loads, taking into account the loss of removed components. For example, a T-beam bridge was originally constructed on falsework and the falsework was released after the deck slab concrete gained strength. As part of a major rehabilitation project, the bridge was closed to traffic and the entire deck slab was removed and replaced without shoring. Without the deck slab, the stems behave as rectangular sections with a reduced depth and width. The existing stem reinforcement was not originally designed to support the weight of the deck slab without shoring. After the new deck slab was placed, wide cracks from the bottom of the stem opened, indicating that the reinforcement was overstressed. This overstress resulted in a lower load rating for the newly rehabilitated bridge. This example shows the need to shore up the remaining T-beam stems prior to placing the new deck slab so that excessive deflections do not occur and overstress in the existing reinforcing steel is prevented. It is necessary to understand how the original structure was constructed, how the rehabilitated structure is to be constructed, and the cumulative stress levels and deflections in the structure from the time of original construction through rehabilitation. 5.5.2.E
Stability of Widening
For relatively narrow box girder and T-beam widenings, symmetry about the vertical axis should be maintained because lateral loads are critical during construction. When symmetry is not possible, use pile cap connections, lateral connections, or special falsework. A minimum of two webs is generally recommended for box girder widenings. For T-beam widenings that require only one additional web, the web should be centered at the axis of symmetry of the deck slab. Often the width of the closure strip can be adjusted to accomplish this.
5.5.3
Removing Portions of the Existing Structure Portions of the existing structure to be removed shall be clearly indicated on the plans. Where a clean break line is required, a ¾″ deep saw cut shall be specified for a deck slab with normal wear and a ½″ deep saw cut for worn deck slabs. In no case, however, shall the saw blade cut or nick the main transverse top slab reinforcement. The special provisions shall state that care will be taken not to damage any reinforcement which is to be saved. Hydromilling is preferred where reinforcing bar cover is shallow and can effectively remove delaminated decks because of the good depth control it offers. When greater depths of slab are to be removed, special consideration should be given to securing exposed reinforcing bars to prevent undue vibration and subsequent fatigue cracks from occurring in the reinforcing bars. The current General Special Provisions should be reviewed for other specific requirements on deck slab removal. Removal of any portion of the main structural members should be held to a minimum. Careful consideration shall be given to the construction conditions, particularly when the removal affects the existing frame system. In extreme situations, preloading by jacking is acceptable to control stresses and deflections during the various stages of removal and construction. Removal of the main longitudinal deck slab reinforcement should be
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-65
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
kept to a minimum. See “Slab Removal Detail” Figure 5.5.4-1 for the limiting case for the maximum allowable removal. The plans shall include a note that critical dimensions and elevations are to be verified in the field prior to the fabrication of precast units or expansion joint assemblies. In cases where an existing sidewalk is to be removed but the supporting slab under the sidewalk is to be retained, Region personnel should check the feasibility of removing the sidewalk. Prior to design, Region personnel should make recommendations on acceptable removal methods and required construction equipment. The plans and specifications shall then be prepared to accommodate these recommendations. This will ensure the constructibility of plan details and the adequacy of the specifications.
5.5.4
Attachment of Widening to Existing Structure 5.5.4.A
General
5.5.4.A.1
Lap and Mechanical Splices
To attach a widening to an existing structure, the first choice is to utilize existing reinforcing bars by splicing new bars to existing. Lap splices or mechanical splices should be used. However, it may not always be possible to splice to existing reinforcing bars and spacing limitations may make it difficult to use mechanical splices. 5.5.4.A.2
Welding Reinforcement
Existing reinforcing steel may not be readily weldable. Mechanical splices should be used wherever possible. If welding is the only feasible means, the chemistry of the reinforcing steel must be analyzed and acceptable welding procedures developed. 5.5.4.A.3
Drilling Into Existing Structure
It may be necessary to drill holes and set dowels in epoxy resin in order to attach the widening to the existing structure. When drilling into heavily reinforced areas, chipping should be specified to expose the main reinforcing bars. If it is necessary to drill through reinforcing bars or if the holes are within 4 inches of an existing concrete edge, core drilling shall be specified. Core drilled holes shall be roughened before resin is applied. If this is not done, a dried residue, which acts as a bond breaker and reduces the load capacity of the dowel, will remain. Generally, the drilled holes are ⅛″ in diameter larger than the dowel diameter for #5 and smaller dowels and ¼″ in diameter larger than the dowel diameter for #6 and larger dowels. In special applications requiring drilled holes greater than 1½″ diameter or deeper than 2′, core drilling shall be specified. These holes shall also be intentionally roughened prior to applying epoxy resin. Core drilled holes shall have a minimum clearance of 3″ from the edge of the concrete and 1″ clearance from existing reinforcing bars in the existing structure. These clearances shall be noted in the plans. 5.5.4.A.4 1.
Page 5-66
Dowelling Reinforcing Bars Into the Existing Structure
Dowel bars shall be set with an approved epoxy resin. The existing structural element shall be checked for its adequacy to transmit the load transferred to it from the dowel bars. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
2.
Dowel spacing and edge distance affect the allowable tensile dowel loads. Allowable tensile loads, dowel bar embedment, and drilled hole sizes for reinforcing bars (Grade 60) used as dowels and set with an approved epoxy resin are shown in Table 5.5.4-1. These values are based on an edge clearance greater than 3″, a dowel spacing greater than 6″, and are shown for both uncoated and epoxy coated dowels. Table 5.5.4-2 lists dowel embedment lengths when the dowel spacing is less than 6″. Note that in Table 5.5.4-2 the edge clearance is equal to or greater than 3″, because this is the minimum edge clearance for a drilled hole from a concrete edge. If it is not possible to obtain these embedments, such as for traffic railing dowels into existing deck slabs, the allowable load on the dowel shall be reduced by the ratio of the actual embedment divided by the required embedment.
3.
The embedments shown in Table 5.5.4-1 and Table 5.5.4-2 are based on dowels embedded in concrete with ƒ′c=4,000 psi. Table 5.5.4-1

5.5.4.A.5
Shear Transfer Across a Dowelled Joint
Shear shall be carried across the joint by shear friction. The existing concrete surface shall be intentionally roughened. Both the concrete and dowels shall be considered effective in transmitting the shear force. Chipping shear keys in the existing concrete can also be used to transfer shear across a dowelled joint, but is expensive. 5.5.4.A.6
Preparation of Existing Surfaces for Concreting
See “Removing Portions of Existing Concrete” in the General Special Provisions and Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(12) for requirements. Unsound, damaged, dirty, porous, or otherwise undesirable old concrete shall be removed, and the remaining concrete surface shall be clean, free of laitance, and intentionally roughened to ensure proper bond between the old and new concrete surfaces. 5.5.4.A.7
Control of Shrinkage and Deflection on Connecting Reinforcement
Dowels that are fixed in the existing structure may be subject to shear as a result of longitudinal shrinkage and vertical deflection when the falsework is removed. These shear forces may result in a reduced tensile capacity of the connection. When connecting the transverse reinforcing bars across the closure strip is unavoidable, the interaction between shear and tension in the dowel or reinforcing bar shall be checked. The use of wire rope or sleeved reinforcement may be acceptable, subject to approval by your Bridge Design Unit Manager. Where possible, transverse reinforcing bars shall be spliced to the existing reinforcing bars in a blocked-out area which can be included in the closure strip. Nominal, shear friction, temperature and shrinkage, and distribution reinforcing bars shall be bent into the closure strip. Rock bolts may be used to transfer connection loads deep into the existing structure, subject to the approval of your Bridge Design Unit Manager. 5.5.4.A.8
Post-tensioning
Post-tensioning of existing crossbeams may be utilized to increase the moment capacity and to eliminate the need for additional substructure. Generally, an existing crossbeam can be core drilled for post-tensioning if it is less than 30′ long. The amount of drift in the holes alignment may be approximately 1″ in 20′. For crossbeams longer than 30′, external post‑tensioning should be considered. For an example of this application, refer to Contract 3846, Bellevue Transit Access – Stage 1.

Figures 5.5.4-1 through 5.5.4-6 show typical details for widening box girder bridges. Welding or mechanical butt splice are preferred over dowelling for the main reinforcement in crossbeams and columns when it can be done in the horizontal or flat position. It shall be allowed only when the bars to be welded are free from restraint at one end during the welding process. Figure 5.5.4-1

Flat Slab Bridges
It is not necessary to remove any portion of the existing slab to expose the existing transverse reinforcing bars for splicing purposes, because the transverse slab reinforcement is only distribution reinforcement. The transverse slab reinforcement for the widening may be dowelled directly into the existing structure without meeting the normal splice requirements. For the moment connection details, see Figure 5.5.4-7. Note: Falsework shall be maintained under pier crossbeams until closure pour is made and cured for 10 days. Figure 5.5.4-7

Expansion Joints The designer should determine if existing expansion joints can be eliminated. It will be necessary to determine what modifications to the structure are required to provide an adequate functional system when existing joints are eliminated. For expansion joint design, see Section 9.1 Expansion Joints. Very often on widening projects it is necessary to chip out the existing concrete deck and rebuild the joint. Figures 5.5.5-1 and 5.5.5-2 show details for rebuilding joint openings for compression seal expansion joints.

5.5.7
Bridge Widening Falsework For widenings which do not have additional girders, columns, crossbeams, or closure pours, falsework should be supported by the existing bridge. There should be no external support from the ground. The reason is that the ground support will not allow the widening to deflect the existing bridge when traffic is on the bridge. This will cause the Expansion Joint Detail Shown for Compression “green” concrete to crack where it joins the existing bridge. The designer should contact Seal with New Reinforcing Steel Added the Bridge Construction Support Unit regarding Figurefalsework 5.5.5-2 associated with widenings.

Existing Bridge Widenings Appendix 5-B3 lists bridge widenings projects that may be used as design aids for the designers.

Prestressed Concrete Girder Superstructures The prestressed concrete girder bridge is an economical and rapid type of bridge construction and often preferred for WSDOT bridges. Precast sections are generally fabricated in plant or somewhere near the construction site and then erected. Precasting permits better material quality control and is often more economical than CIP concrete.
5.6.1
WSDOT Standard Prestressed Concrete Girder Types A girder type consists of a series of girder cross sections sharing a common shape. The numbers within girder series generally refer to the depth of the section in inches. Refer to Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25) for a comprehensive list of Standard WSDOT girder types. Standard WSDOT girder types include: Prestressed Concrete I Girders – Washington State Standard I Girders were adopted in the mid-1950s. The original series was graduated in 10 foot increments from 30 feet to 100 feet. In 1990, revisions were made incorporating the results of the research done at Washington State University on girders without end blocks. The revisions included three major changes: a thicker web; end blocks were eliminated; and strand spacing was increased. The current Series of this type include W42G, W50G, W58G, and W74G. Prestressed Concrete Wide Flange (WF) I Girders and Spliced Prestressed Concrete Girders – In 1999, deeper girders, commonly called “Supergirders” were added to the WSDOT standard concrete girders. These new supergirders may be pre-tensioned or post-tensioned. The pre-tensioned Series are designated as WF74G, WF83G and WF95G and the post-tensioned (spliced) Series are designated as WF74PTG, WF83PTG and WF95PTG. In 2004 Series WF42G, WF50G, and WF58G were added to the prestressed concrete girder standards. In 2008, Series WF66G, WF100G, and WF100PTG were added to the prestressed concrete girder standards. In 2009, Series WF36G was added to the prestressed concrete girder standards. Prestressed Concrete Wide Flange Deck Girders – In 2015, the top flanges of Wide Flange I Girders were widened and thickened to support traffic loads without a CIP concrete deck. The top flanges are either spliced using ultra high performance concrete or mechanically connected at the flange edges to adjacent girders. This Series includes the WF39DG through the WF103DG. Prestressed Concrete Wide Flange Thin Deck Girders – In 2015, the top flanges of wide flange I girders were widened to create a girder which would support a CIP concrete deck placement without formwork. This Series includes the WF36TDG through the WF100TDG. Deck Bulb Tee Girders – This type of girder has a top flange designed to support traffic loads and are mechanically connected at the flange edges to adjacent girders. They include Series W35DG, W41DG, W53DG and W65DG. Prestressed Concrete Slab Girders – Prestressed concrete slab girders are available in heights ranging from 12 inches to 30 inches.

Prestressed Concrete Tub Girders – In 2004 prestressed concrete tub girders were added as standard girders. All WSDOT prestressed concrete girders are high performance high strength concrete girders. They generally rely on high strength concrete to be effective for the spans expected as a single piece. The approximate ranges of maximum span lengths are as shown in Table 5.6.1-1 and Appendices 5.6-A1-1 to 5.6-A1-9. Standard drawings for WSDOT prestressed concrete girders are shown in the Bridge Standard Drawings website (www.wsdot.wa.gov/Bridge/Structures/ StandardDrawings.htm).

Design Criteria WSDOT design criteria for prestressed concrete girder superstructures are given in Table 5.6.2-1. AASHTO LRFD Section 5.12.3.3 “Bridges Composed of Simple Span Precast Girders Made Continuous” allows for some degree of continuity for loads applied on the bridge after the continuity diaphragms have been cast and cured. This assumption is based on the age of the girder when continuity is established, and degree of continuity at various limit states. Both degree of continuity and time of continuity diaphragm casting may result in contractual and design issues. Designing these types of bridges for the envelope of simple span and continuous spans for applicable permanent and transient loads is the approach used by WSDOT as it has yielded good results.
Table 5.6.2-1 Design Specifications
Design Criteria for Prestressed Concrete Girders AASHTO LRFD Specifications and WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50
Design Method Prestressed concrete members shall be designed for service limit state for stress limits and checked for strength limit state for ultimate capacity. Superstructure Continuity
Prestressed concrete girder superstructures shall be designed for the envelope of simple span and continuous span loadings for all permanent and transient loads. Loads applied before establishing continuity (typically before placement of continuity diaphragms) need only be applied as a simple span loading. Continuity reinforcement shall be provided at supports for loads applied after establishing continuity.
Loads and Load Service, Strength, Fatigue, and Extreme Event Limit State loads and load combinations shall be Factors in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Specifications Stress Limits

Continuous Structure Configuration
Girder type, depth and number of lines shall be identical in adjacent spans. Girder type, depth and number of lines may be changed at expansion piers.
Girder End Skew Angle
Girder end skew angles for prestressed concrete slabs, deck bulb-tees, WFDG girders, WFTDG girders and tubs shall be limited to 30°. Girder end skew angles for all other prestressed concrete girders shall be limited to 45°.
Intermediate Diaphragms
Except for Prestressed Concrete Wide Flange Deck Girder and Prestressed Concrete Slab Girder bridges, CIP concrete intermediate diaphragms shall be provided for prestressed concrete girder bridge spans in the following situations:
• Spans crossing a roadway with a minimum vertical clearance of 20'-0" or less.
• Spans crossing a railway with a minimum vertical clearance of 23'-4" or less from the top of rail.
• Spans crossing a water body or waterway with a minimum vertical clearance of 6'-0" of less from the 100-year MRI water surface level.
• Spans that will possibly or likely have vehicular traffic under the span in the future with a minimum vertical clearance of 20'-0" or less. Intermediate diaphragms shall be equally spaced between bearing centerlines at a spacing not to exceed 50'. Intermediate diaphragms shall be either partial or full depth as described in Section 5.6.4.C.4.

5.6.2.A
Support Conditions
The prestressed concrete girders are assumed to be supported on rigid permanent simple supports. These supports can be either bearing seats or elastomeric pads. The design span length is the distance center to center of bearings for simple spans. For continuous spans erected on falsework (raised crossbeam), the effective point of support for girder design is assumed to be the face of the crossbeam. For continuous spans on crossbeams (dropped or semi-dropped crossbeam), the design span length is usually the distance center to center of temporary bearings. 5.6.2.B
Composite Action
5.6.2.B.1
General
The sequence of construction and loading is extremely important in the design of prestressed concrete girders. The composite section has a much larger capacity than the basic girder section but it cannot take loads until the deck slab has obtained adequate strength. Assumptions used in computing composite section properties are shown in Figure 5.6.2-1. 5.6.2.B.2
Load Application
The following sequence and method of applying loads is typically used in girder analysis: 1.
Girder dead load is applied to the girder section.
2.
Diaphragm dead load is applied to the girder section.
3.
Deck slab dead load is applied to the girder section.
4.
Superimposed dead loads (such as barriers, sidewalks and overlays) and live loads are applied to the composite section.
5.6.2.B.3
Composite Section Properties
A CIP concrete bridge deck forms the top flange of the composite girder in prestressed concrete girder bridge construction. 1.
Effective and Transformed Flange Width The effective flange width of a concrete bridge deck for computing composite section properties shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 4.6.2.6. The effective flange width shall be reduced by the ratio Eslab/Egirder to obtain the transformed flange width. The effective modulus of the composite section with the transformed flange width is then Egirder.
2.
Effective Flange Thickness The effective flange thickness of a concrete bridge deck for computing composite section properties shall be the deck thickness reduced by ½″ to account for wearing. Where a bridge will have an overlay applied prior to traffic being allowed on the bridge, the full deck thickness may be used as effective flange thickness.

5.6.2.B.4
Slenderness Ratio
The lateral slenderness ratio of WF girders l/r, where l is the girder length and r is the radius of gyration about the weak axis, shall not exceed 310. WF100G girders reach this limit at a length of 210 ft. The top flange width of WF100G girders can be increased to 5’-1” for spans greater than 210 ft. Figure 5.6.2-1

Concrete Structures
1.
Flange Position An increased dimension from top of girder to top of bridge deck at centerline of bearing at centerline of girder shall be shown in the Plans. This is called the “A” dimension. It accounts for the effects of girder camber, vertical curve, deck cross slope, etc. See Appendix 5-B1 for method of computing. For purposes of calculating composite section properties for negative moments, the pad/haunch height between bottom of deck and top of girder shall be taken as the “A” dimension minus the flange thickness “T” at intermediate pier supports and shall be reduced by girder camber as appropriate at other locations. For purposes of calculating composite section properties for positive moments, the bottom of the bridge deck shall be assumed to be directly on the top of the girder. This assumption may prove to be true at center of span where excess girder camber occurs.
2.
Section Dead Load The bridge deck dead load to be applied to the girder shall be based on the full bridge deck thickness. The full effective pad/haunch weight shall be added to that load over the full length of the girder. The full effective pad or haunch height is typically the “A” dimension minus the flange thickness “T”, but may be higher at midspan for a crest vertical curve.

Girder End Types
There are four typical end types for prestressed concrete girders. Due to the extreme depth of the WF83G, WF95G, and WF100G girders, and possible end of girder tilt at the piers for profile grades, the designer will need to pay particular attention to details to assure the girders will fit and perform as intended. The end types designs may require modification for bridge security. The space between girders at the abutment may require omission by extending the diaphragm to the face of the abutment stem. Coordinate with the WSDOT State Bridge and Structures Architect during final design where required. The four end types are shown as follows: 5.6.2.E.1
End Type A
End Type A as shown in Figure 5.6.2-3 is for cantilever end piers with an end diaphragm cast on the end of the girders. End Type A has a recess at the bottom of the girder near the end for an elastomeric bearing pad. See Bridge Standard Drawings 5.6-A4-12 and 5.6-A9-9 for bearing pad details. The recess at the centerline of bearing is 0.5″ deep. This recess is to be used for profile grades up to and including 4 percent. The recess is to be replaced by an embedded steel plate flush with the bottom of the girder for grades over 4 percent. A tapered bearing plate, with stops at the edges to contain the elastomeric pad, can be welded or bolted to the embedded plate to provide a level bearing surface. Reinforcing bars and pre-tensioned strands project from the end of the girder. The designer shall assure that these bars and strands fit into the end diaphragm. Extended prestressing strands should be capable of developing seismic connection forces, but at least 4 strands should be extended. Embedment of the girder end into the end diaphragm shall be a minimum of 3″ and a maximum of 6″. For girder ends where the tilt would exceed 6″ of embedment, the girder ends shall be tilted to attain a plumb surface when the girder is erected to the profile grade. The gap between the end diaphragm and the stem wall shall be a minimum of 1½″ or ½″ greater than required for longitudinal bridge movement.

Notes regarding the bearing recess on End Type A also apply to End Type B. End Type B typically does not have reinforcing or strand projecting from the girder end. The centerline of the diaphragm is normal to the roadway surface. The centerline of the bearing is coincident with the centerline of the diaphragm at the top of the elastomeric pad.

5.6.2.E.3
End Type C
End Type C as shown in Figure 5.6.2-5 is for continuous spans and an intermediate hinge diaphragm at an intermediate pier. There is no bearing recess and the girder is temporarily supported on oak blocks. This detail may be used to reduce the seismic demand at an intermediate pier by allowing rotation about the axis parallel to the crossbeam. The reduced pier stiffness will lower the plastic overstrength shear demand (Vpo), allow for shorter columns and eliminate the plastic hinge at the top of each column. While the diaphragm hinge is intended to act as a pin, there may be some residual stiffness at the connection that shall be determined by the designer. This stiffness will move the point of inflection down the pier, inducing some plastic overstrength shear demand. The hinge connection should be assumed pinned to determine the pier displacement and ductility demand for seismic analysis. The designer shall check the edge distance and provide a dimension that prevents edge failure, or spalling, at the top corner of the supporting cross beam for load from the oak block including dead loads from girder, deck slab, and construction loads. For prestressed concrete girders with intermediate hinge diaphragms, designers shall: 1.
Check size and minimum embedment in crossbeam and diaphragm for hinge bars. Bars shall be sized based on interface shear due to calculated plastic overstrength shear force (Vpo) from the column while ignoring the concrete cohesion and axial load contributions.
2.
Design the width of the shear key to take the factored vertical bearing force per AASHTO LRFD Section 5.6.5 at the Strength limit state. The maximum shear key width shall be limited to 0.3d, where d is the width of the diaphragm.
3.

Stirrups for slab and wide flange thin deck girders which shall be bent at the heigh shown in the standard girder plans. I-girder stirrups may be prebent, but the extended hook shall be within the core of the slab (the inside edge of the hook shall terminate above the bottom mat deck slab bars). For I-girders with a 7½” minimum thickness cast-in-place bridge deck, girder stirrups no larger than #5 bars, and with or without permanent precast prestressed concrete stay-inplace deck panels, prebent stirrups may be used with “hat bar” stirrup extensions. Details shall conform to Figure 5.6.2-7 and the following requirements (see reference 27):

Fabrication and Handling 5.6.3.A
Shop Plans
Fabricators of prestressed concrete girders are required to submit shop plans which show specific details for each girder. These shop plans are reviewed for conformance with the Contract Plans and specifications. 5.6.3.B
Special Problems for Fabricators
5.6.3.B.1
Strand Tensioning
The method selected for strand tensioning may affect the design of the girders. The strand arrangements shown in the office standard plans and included in the PGSuper computer program are satisfactory for tensioning methods used by fabricators in this state. Harped strands are normally tensioned by pulling them as straight strands to a partial tension. The strands are then deflected vertically as necessary to give the required harping angle and strand stress. In order to avoid overtensioning the harped strands by this procedure, the slope of the strands is limited to a maximum of 6:1 for 0.5″ φ strands and 8:1 for 0.6″φ strands. The straight strands are tensioned by straight jacking. 5.6.3.B.2
Hold Down Forces
Forces on the hold-down units are developed as the harped strands are raised. The holddown device provided by the fabricator must be able to hold the vertical component of the harping forces. Normally a two or more hold-down unit is required. Standard commercial hold-down units have been preapproved for use with particular strand groups. 5.6.3.B.3
Numbers of Strands
Since the prestressing beds used by the girder fabricators can carry several girders in a line, it is desirable that girders have the same number of strands where practical. This allows several girders to be set up and cast at one time. For pre-tensioned concrete girders, the number of permanent prestressing strands (straight and harped) shall be limited to 100 total 0.6″f strands. 5.6.3.C
Handling of Prestressed Concrete Girders
5.6.3.C.1
In-Plant Handling
The maximum weight that can be handled by precasting plants in the Pacific Northwest is 262 kips. It is possible that products heavier than 262 kips can be manufactured if they will be shipped directly to the jobsite by barge, but special plant lifting arrangements must be investigated. Headroom is also not generally a concern for the deeper sections. 5.6.3.C.2
Lateral Stability During Handling
In order to ensure constructability, the designer shall specify the lifting embedment locations (centroid 3′ minimum from ends - see Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25) L), maximum midspan vertical deflection and the corresponding concrete strength at release that satisfies the stress limits from Section 5.2.1.C and provides an adequate factor of safety for lateral stability. The calculations shall conform to methods as described in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25) and reference 26. Factors of safety of 1.0 against cracking and 1.5 against failure shall be used. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-97
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
Biaxial stresses due to lateral bending at the girder tilt equilibrium condition shall consider the assumed lifting embedment transverse placement tolerance and the girder sweep tolerance. Stresses shall be evaluated for the girder tilt equilibrium condition for a hanging girder as described in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25) and reference 26. Lateral stability can be a concern when handling long, slender girders. Lateral bending failures are sudden, catastrophic, costly, pose a serious threat to workers and surroundings, and therefore shall be considered by designers. When the girder forms are stripped from the girder, the prestressing level is higher and the concrete strength is lower than at any other point in the life of the member. Lifting embedment/support misalignment, horizontal girder sweep and other girder imperfections can cause the girder to roll when handling, causing a component of the girder weight to be resisted by the weak axis. Lateral stability may be improved using the following methods: 1.
Move the lifting embedments away from the ends. This may increase the required concrete release strength, because decreasing the distance between lifting devices increases the concrete stresses at the harp point. Stresses at the support may also govern, depending on the exit location of the harped strands.
2.
Select a girder section that is relatively wide and stiff about its vertical (weak) axis.
3.
Add temporary prestressing in the top flange.
4.
Brace the girder.
5.
Raise the roll axis of the girder with a rigid yoke.
5.6.3.D
Shipping Prestressed Concrete Girders
5.6.3.D.1
General
The ability to ship girders can be influenced by a large number of variables, including mode of transportation, weight, length, height, and lateral stability. The ability to ship girders is also strongly site-dependent. For large or heavy girders, routes to the site shall be investigated during the preliminary design phase. To this end, on projects using large or heavy girders, WSDOT can place an advisory in their special provisions including shipping routes, estimated permit fees, escort vehicle requirements, Washington State Patrol requirements, and permit approval time. 5.6.3.D.2
Mode of Transportation
Three modes of transportation are commonly used in the industry: truck, rail, and barge. In Washington State, an overwhelming percentage of girders are transported by truck, so discussion in subsequent sections will be confined to this mode. However, on specific projects, it may be appropriate to consider rail or barge transportation. Standard rail cars can usually accommodate larger loads than a standard truck. Rail cars range in capacity from approximately 120 to 200 kips. However, unless the rail system runs directly from the precasting plant to the jobsite, members must be trucked for at least some of the route, and weight may be restricted by the trucking limitations. For a project where a large number of girders are required, barge transportation may be the most economical. Product weights and dimensions are generally not limited by barge delivery, but by the handling equipment on either end. In most cases, if a product can be made and handled in the plant, it can be shipped by barge. Page 5-98
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
5.6.3.D.3
Chapter 5
Weight Limitations
The net weight limitation with trucking equipment currently available in Washington State is approximately 180 kips, if a reasonable delivery rate (number of pieces per day) is to be maintained. Product weights of up to 262 kips can be hauled with currently available equipment at a limited rate. The hauling of heavier girders may be possible with coordination with hauling subcontractors. Hauling subcontractors should be consulted on the feasibility of shipping large or heavy girders on specific projects. 5.6.3.D.4
Support Locations
The designer shall provide shipping support locations in the plans to ensure adequate girder stability. Shipping support locations shall be no closer than the girder depth to the ends of the girder at the girder centerline. The overhangs at the leading and trailing ends of the girders should be minimized and equal if possible. Generally, the leading end overhang should not exceed 15′ to avoid interference with trucking equipment. Local carriers should be consulted if a larger leading end overhang is required. Shipping support locations shall maintain the concrete stresses within allowable limits. Length between shipping support locations may be governed by turning radii on the route to the jobsite. Potential problems can be circumvented by moving the support points closer together (away from the ends of the girder), or by selecting alternate routes. Up to 130′ between supports is typically acceptable for most projects. 5.6.3.D.5
Height Limitations
The height of a deep girder section sitting on a jeep and steerable trailer is of concern when considering overhead obstructions on the route to the jobsite. The height of the support is approximately 6′ above the roadway surface. When adding the depth of the girder, including camber, the overall height from the roadway surface to the top of concrete can rapidly approach 14′. Overhead obstructions along the route should be investigated for adequate clearance in the preliminary design phase. Obstructions without adequate clearance must be bypassed by selecting alternate routes. Expectations are that, in some cases, overhead clearance will not accommodate the vertical stirrup projection on deeper WSDOT standard girder sections. Alternate stirrup configurations can be used to attain adequate clearance, depending on the route from the plant to the jobsite. 5.6.3.D.6
Lateral Stability During Shipping
In order to ensure constructability, the designer shall specify concrete strengths, shipping support locations, minimum shipping support rotational spring constants, shipping support center-to-center wheel spacing, maximum midspan vertical deflection at shipping and temporary top strand configurations in the Plans that satisfy the stress limits from Section 5.2.1.C and provide adequate factors of safety for lateral stability during shipping. The calculations shall conform to methods described in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25) and reference 26. Factors of safety of 1.0 against cracking and 1.5 against failure and rollover shall be used. The maximum midspan vertical deflection at shipping used to evaluate stability shall be shown in the plans. In order to minimize the need for re-analysis under contract, this value may be conservatively determined using losses at 10 days, camber at 90 days, and a span length equal to the girder length.

The rotational stiffness and center-to-center wheel spacing used in design shall be taken from Table 5.6.3-1. Design the girder for transportation with the least stiff support system as possible while achieving recommended factors of safety. Table 5.6.3-1

Design for shipping should not preclude the contractor from making modifications under contract that consider actual conditions, such as fabrication tolerances and the haul route, but the Engineer should confirm that any proposed changes are structurally acceptable in the final in-service structure. 5.6.3.E
Erection and Bridge Deck Construction
A variety of methods are used to erect prestressed concrete girders, depending on the weight, length, available crane capacity, and site access. Generally, lifting girders during erection is not as critical as when they are stripped from the forms, particularly when the same lifting devices are used for both. However, if appurtenances such as deck overhang formwork brackets are attached to the girder, the lifting slings are at an angle other than 90° ± 10° from the top surface of the girder, wind loads are present, the girder is erected in such a manner that one end is supported at the top by a lifting device while the other end is seated on a girder transport vehicle or bearing, or a separate set of erection devices are used, the girder shall be checked for stresses and lateral stability as part of the contractor’s erection plan. In addition, once the girder is set in place, the free span between supports is usually increased. Wind can also pose a problem. Consequently, when girders are erected, they shall immediately be braced. The temporary bracing of the girders is the contractor’s responsibility. For tub girders, designers should consider web out-of-plane bending forces that will develop during construction. Examples of these loads include forces developed by lift rigging and loading due to the deck finishing machine. These cases may require temporary struts and govern the design of web stirrups. 5.6.3.F
Construction Sequence for Multi-Span Prestressed Concrete Girder Bridges
For multi-span prestressed concrete girder bridges, the sequence and timing of the superstructure construction has a significant impact on the performance and durability of the bridge. In order to maximize the performance and durability, the “construction sequence” details shown on the Bridge Standard Drawings website (www.wsdot.wa.gov/ Bridge/Structures/StandardDrawings.htm) shall be followed for all new WSDOT multispan prestressed concrete girder bridges. Particular attention shall be paid to the timing of casting the lower portion of the pier diaphragms/crossbeams (30 days minimum after girder fabrication) and the upper portion of the diaphragms/crossbeams (10 days minimum after placement of the deck slab). The requirements apply to multi-span prestressed concrete girder bridges with monolithic and hinge diaphragms/crossbeams.

Chapter 5
Superstructure Optimization 5.6.4.A
Girder Selection
Cost of the girders is a major portion of the cost of prestressed concrete girder bridges. Much care is therefore warranted in the selection of girders and in optimizing their position within the structure. The following general guidelines should be considered. 5.6.4.A.1
Girder Series Selection
All girders in a bridge shall be of the same series unless approved otherwise by the Bridge and Structures Engineer. If vertical clearance is no problem, a larger girder series, utilizing fewer girder lines, may be a desirable solution. Fewer girder lines may result in extra reinforcement and concrete but less forming cost. These items must also be considered. 5.6.4.A.2
Girder Concrete Strength
Higher girder concrete strengths should be specified where that strength can be effectively used to reduce the number of girder lines, see Section 5.1.1.A.2. When the bridge consists of a large number of spans, consideration should be given to using a more exact analysis than the usual design program in an attempt to reduce the number of girder lines. This analysis shall take into account actual live load, creep, and shrinkage stresses in the girders. 5.6.4.A.3
Girder Spacing
Consideration must be given to the deck slab cantilever length to determine the most economical girder spacing. This matter is discussed in Section 5.6.4.B. The deck slab cantilever length should be made a maximum if a line of girders can be saved. It is recommended that the overhang length, from edge of slab to center line of exterior girder, be less than 40 percent of girder spacing; then the exterior girder can use the same design as that of the interior girder. The following guidance is suggested. 1.
Tapered Spans On tapered roadways, the minimum number of girder lines should be determined as if all girder spaces were to be equally flared. As many girders as possible, within the limitations of girder capacity should be placed. Deck slab thickness may have to be increased in some locations in order to accomplish this.
2.
Curved Spans On curved roadways, normally all girders will be parallel to each other. It is critical that the exterior girders are positioned properly in this case, as described in Section 5.6.4.B.
3.
Geometrically Complex Spans Spans which are combinations of taper and curves will require especially careful consideration in order to develop the most effective and economical girder arrangement. Where possible, girder lengths and numbers of straight and harped strands should be made the same for as many girders as possible in each span.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-101
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
4.
Number of Girders in a Span Usually all spans will have the same number of girders. Where aesthetics of the underside of the bridge is not a factor and where a girder can be saved in a short side span, consideration should be given to using unequal numbers of girders. It should be noted that this will complicate crossbeam design by introducing torsion effects and that additional reinforcement will be required in the crossbeam.
5.6.4.B
Bridge Deck Cantilevers
The exterior girder location is established by setting the dimension from centerline of the exterior girder to the adjacent curb line. For straight bridges this dimension will normally be no less than 2′-6″ for W42G, W50G, and W58G; 3′-0″ for W74G; and 3′-6″ for WF74G, WF83G, WF95G and WF100G. Some considerations which affect this are noted below. 5.6.4.B.1
Appearance
Normally, for best appearance, the largest bridge deck overhang which is practical should be used. 5.6.4.B.2
Economy
Fortunately, the condition tending toward best appearance is also that which will normally give maximum economy. Larger curb distances may mean that a line of girders can be eliminated, especially when combined with higher girder concrete strengths. 5.6.4.B.3
Bridge Deck Strength
It must be noted that for larger overhangs, the bridge deck section between the exterior and the first interior girder may be critical and may require thickening. 5.6.4.B.4
Drainage
Where drainage for the bridge is required, water from bridge drains is normally piped across the top of the girder and dropped inside of the exterior girder line. A large bridge deck cantilever length may severely affect this arrangement and it must be considered when determining exterior girder location. 5.6.4.B.5
Bridge Curvature
When straight prestressed concrete girders are used to support curved roadways, the curb distance must vary. Normally, the maximum bridge deck overhang at the centerline of the long span will be made approximately equal to the overhang at the piers on the inside of the curve. At the point of minimum curb distance, however, the edge of the girder top flange should be no closer than 1′-0″ from the bridge deck edge. Where curvature is extreme, other types of bridges should be considered. Straight girder bridges on highly curved alignments have a poor appearance and also tend to become structurally less efficient.

Diaphragm Requirements
5.6.4.C.1
General
Intermediate diaphragms provide girder stability for the bridge deck placement and improve the bridge resistance to over-height impact loads. Diaphragms for prestressed concrete girder bridges shall be cast-in-place concrete. For large girder spacings or other unusual conditions, special diaphragm designs shall be performed. Inserts may be used to accommodate the construction of intermediate diaphragms for connections between the diaphragm and the web of prestressed concrete girders. The designer shall investigate the adequacy of the insert and the connection to develop the tensile capacity of diaphragm reinforcement. The designer shall also investigate the interface shear capacity of the diaphragm-to-web connections for construction and deck placement loads. Vertical reinforcement for intermediate diaphragms may be terminated at the top of top flange if SIP deck panels are used for the bridge deck. 5.6.4.C.2
Design
Diaphragms shall be designed as transverse beam elements carrying both dead load and live load. 5.6.4.C.3
Geometry
Diaphragms shall normally be oriented parallel to skew (as opposed to normal to girder centerlines). This procedure has the following advantages: 1.
The build-up of higher stresses at the obtuse corners of a skewed span is minimized. This build-up has often been ignored in design.
2.
Skewed diaphragms are connected at points of approximately equal girder deflections and thus tend to distribute load to the girders in a manner that more closely meets design assumptions.
3.
The diaphragms have more capacity as tension ties and compression struts are continuous. Relatively weak inserts are only required at the exterior girder.
On curved bridges, diaphragms shall normally be placed on radial lines. 5.6.4.C.4
Full or Partial Depth Intermediate Diaphragms
Based on research done by Washington State University (WSU) on damage by over-height loads24, the type of intermediate diaphragms for prestressed concrete girder bridges (including widenings) shall be as follows: 1.
Full depth intermediate diaphragms as shown in the office standard plans shall be used for bridges crossing over roads of ADT > 50,000.
2.
Either full depth or partial depth intermediate diaphragms as shown in the office standard plans may be used for all bridges not included in item a.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-103
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
5.6.4.C.5
Tub Girder Intermediate Diaphragms
Where required, intermediate diaphragms shall be provided both inside and between prestressed concrete tub girders. The diaphragms inside the tub may be cast in the field or at the fabrication plant. The bottom of the diaphragm inside the tub shall be at least 3 inches above the top of the bottom flange. The diaphragms between the tubs shall be cast in the field. For diaphragms between the tubs, the roughened surface or shear keys on the sloped web faces may not be effective in resisting interface shear. All diaphragm and construction loads on the diaphragm before the deck cures and gains strength will then be resisted by the reinforcement or inserts alone. 5.6.4.D
Skew Effects
Skew in prestressed concrete girder bridges affects structural behavior and member analysis and complicates construction. 5.6.4.D.1
Analysis
Normally, the effect of skew on girder analysis is ignored. It is assumed that skew has little structural effect on normal spans and normal skews. For short, wide spans and for extreme skews (values over 30°), the effect of the skew on structural action shall be investigated. All trapezoidal tub, slab, wide flange deck, wide flange thin deck and deck bulb-tee girders have a skew restriction of 30°. Skews at ends of prestressed concrete girders cause prestressing strand force transfer to be unbalanced about the girder centerline at girder ends. In some cases, this has caused bottom flange cracking. Recent projects where this cracking occurred are Contract 8128 (Bridge Number 522/142N has W74G girders with 55 degree skew and 8 bottom flange straight strands) and Contract 8670 (Bridge Number 5/456E has WF100G girders with 56 degree skew and 40 bottom flange straight strands). Details shown in Figure 5.6.4-1 could be used to minimize bottom flange cracking for girders with large skews.

Grade and Cross Slope Effects
Large cross slopes require an increased amount of the girder pad dimension (‘A’ Skewed Girder End Details dimension) necessary to ensure that the structure can be built. This effect is especially To Prevent Cracking pronounced if the bridge is on a horizontal or vertical curve. Care must be taken that deck Figure 5.6.4-1 drainage details reflect the cross slope effect. Girder lengths shall be modified for added length along grade slope.

Curve Effect and Flare Effect
Curves and tapered roadways each tend to complicate the design of straight girders. The designer must determine what girder spacing to use for dead load and live load design and whether or not a refined analysis, that considers actual load application, is warranted. Normally, the girder spacing at centerline of span can be used for girder design, especially in view of the conservative assumptions made for the design of continuous girders. B

Repair of Damaged Prestressed Concrete Girders at Fabrication When girders suffer defects during fabrication or damage before becoming part of a final structure, the girder repairs shall be addressed with pre-approved repair procedures from the current Annual Plant Approval document for the fabricator (see Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25)A). If the repairs cannot be addressed by this document, the fabricator shall initiate the Fax Resolution process from the current Annual Plant Approval document to address contract specific repairs with the Project Office and HQ Bridge Construction. Normally, no designer action is required. When evaluating repairs for unusual situations not covered, the designer must ensure that the required strength and appearance of the girder can be maintained. If stressing will occur after the repair is made, normally no test loading is required; however, such a test should be considered. See reference 14 for guidance.

Repair of Damaged Prestressed Concrete Girders in Existing Bridges 5.6.6.A
General
This section is intended to cover repair of damaged girders on existing bridges. For repair of newly constructed girders, see Section 5.6.5. Over-height loads are a fairly common source of damage to prestressed concrete girder bridges. The damage may range from spalling and minor cracking of the lower flange of the girder to loss of a major portion of a girder section. Occasionally, one or more strands may be broken. The damage is most often inflicted on the exterior or first interior girder. 5.6.6.B
Repair Procedure
The determination of the degree of damage to a prestressed concrete girder is largely a matter of judgment. Where the flange area has been reduced or strands lost, calculations can aid in making this judgment decision. The following are general categories of damage and suggested repair procedures (see references 15, 16). 5.6.6.B.1
Minor Damage
If the damage is slight and concerns only spalling of small areas of the outside surface of the concrete, repair may be accomplished by replacing damaged concrete areas with concrete grout. The area where new concrete is to be applied shall first be thoroughly cleaned of loose material, dried, and then coated with epoxy. 5.6.6.B.2
Moderate Damage
If damage is moderate, (damage does not exceed replacement criteria in Item 4 below), a repair procedure shall be developed using the following guidelines. It is probable that some prestress will have been lost in the damaged area due to reduction in section and consequent strand shortening or through loss of strands. The following steps shall be part of any proposed repair procedure: 1.
Determine Condition Sketch the remaining cross section of the girder and compute its reduced section properties. Determine the stress in the damaged girder due to the remaining prestress and loads in the damaged state. If severe overstresses are found, action must be taken to restrict loads on the structure until the repair has been completed. If the strand loss is so great that AASHTO prestress requirements cannot be met with the remaining strands, consideration should be given to replacing the girder.
2.
Restore Prestress If Needed Prestress in damaged/severed strands can sometimes be restored with mechanical strand couplers. Damaged girders with broken 0.6” diameter strands may need to be repaired with 0.5” diameter strands and additional post-tensioning as needed. Current commercially-available couplers are capable of restoring full prestressing force in strands of up to ½” diameter. Verify that the restoration of full prestress force will not cause overstress in the damaged girder section.
3.
Prepare a Repair Plan Draw a sketch to show the area of concrete removal required for replacement of damaged concrete, and for installation of any mechanical strand couplers required. The damaged area is to be thoroughly prepared, coated with epoxy, and repaired with grout equal in strength to the original concrete.

5.6.6.B.3
Severe Damage
Where the damage to the girder is considered to be irreparable due to loss of many strands, extreme cracking, etc., the girder shall be replaced. This has been done several times, but involves some care in determining a proper replacement sequence. In general, the procedure consists of cutting through the existing deck slab and diaphragms and removing the damaged girder. Adequate exposed reinforcement steel must remain to allow splicing of the new bars. The new girder and new reinforcement is placed and previously cut concrete surfaces are cleaned and coated with epoxy. New deck slab and diaphragm portions are then poured. It is important that the camber of the new girder be matched with that in the old girders. Excessive camber in the new girder can result in inadequate deck slab thickness. Girder camber can be controlled by prestress, curing time, or dimensional changes. Casting the new bridge deck and diaphragms simultaneously in order to avoid overloading the existing girders in the structure should be considered. Extra bracing of the girder at the time of casting the bridge deck will be required. Methods of construction shall be specified in the plans that will minimize inconvenience and dangers to the public while achieving a satisfactory structural result. High early strength grouts and concretes should be considered. In case of replacement of a damaged girder, the intermediate diaphragms adjacent to the damaged girder shall be replaced with full depth diaphragms as shown in Figure 5.6.6-1. In case of replacement of a damaged girder, the replacement girder should be of the same type or the same depth as the original damaged girder. In case of repair of a damaged girder with broken or damaged prestressing strands, the original damaged strands shall be replaced with similar diameter strands. Restoration of the prestress force as outlined in Section 5.6.6 B-2b shall be considered. Existing bridges with pigmented sealer shall have replacement girders sealed. Those existing bridges without pigmented sealer need not be sealed.

Repair vs. Replacement of Damaged Girder
Several factors need to be considered when evaluating whether to repair or to replace a damaged girder. Among them are the level of concrete damage, number of broken strands, location and magnitude of web damage, permanent offset of the original girder alignment, and overall structural integrity. Other considerations include fresh damage to previously damaged girders, damage to adjacent girders, and cost of repair versus replacement. Ultimately, the evaluation hinges on whether the girder can be restored to its original capacity and whether the girder can be repaired sufficiently to carry its share of the original load. The following guidelines describe damaged girder conditions which require replacement:
• Strand Damage – More than 25 percent of prestressing strands are damaged/severed. If over 25 percent of the strands have been severed, replacement is required. Splicing is routinely done to repair severed strands. However, there are practical limits as to the number of couplers that can be installed in the damaged area.
• Girder Displacements – The bottom flange is displaced from the horizontal position more than ½″ per 10′ of girder length. If the alignment of the girder has been permanently altered by the impact, replacement is required. Examples of nonrepairable girder displacement include cracks at the web/flange interface that remain open. Abrupt lateral offsets may indicate that stirrups have yielded. A girder that is permanently offset may not be restorable to its original geometric tolerance by practical and cost-effective means.
• Concrete Damage at Harping Point – Concrete damage at harping point resulting in permanent loss of prestress. Extreme cracking or major loss of concrete near the harping point may indicate a change in strand geometry and loss in prestress force. Such loss of prestress force in the existing damaged girder cannot be restored by practical and cost effective means, and requires girder replacement.
• Concrete Damage at Girder Ends – Severe concrete damage at girder ends resulting in permanent loss of prestress or loss of shear capacity. Extreme cracking or major loss of concrete near the end of a girder may indicate unbonding of strands and loss in prestress force or a loss of shear capacity. Such loss of prestress force or shear capacity in the existing damaged girder cannot be restored by practical and costeffective means, and requires girder replacement.
• Significant Concrete Loss from the Web – Significant damage of concrete in the web that results in loss of shear capacity shall require girder replacement. The web damage shall be considered significant when more than 25 percent of web section is damaged or when shear reinforcement has yielded. Damaged girders shall be replaced in accordance with current WSDOT design criteria and with current girder series. There are other situations as listed below which do not automatically trigger replacement, but require further consideration and analysis.
• Significant Concrete Loss from the Bottom Flange – For girder damage involving significant loss of concrete from the bottom flange, consideration should be given to verifying the level of stress remaining in the exposed prestressing strands. Residual strand stress values will be required for any subsequent repair procedures.
• Adjacent Girders – Capacity of adjacent undamaged girders. Consideration must be given as to whether dead load from the damaged girder has been shed to the adjacent girders and whether the adjacent girders can accommodate the additional load. Page 5-110
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
• Previously Damaged Girders – Damage to a previously damaged girder. An impact to a girder that has been previously repaired may not be able to be restored to sufficient capacity.
• Cost – Cost of repair versus replacement. Replacement may be warranted if the cost of repair reaches 70 percent of the replacement project cost.
• Continuous Girders – Continuous girders with or without raised crossbeam that requires supporting falsework in the adjacent spans.
• Superstructure Replacement – Superstructure replacement shall be considered if more that 50 percent of all girders in the span are damaged or if there is a high risk of future impacts from over-height loads. 5.6.6.C

Deck Girders 5.6.7.A
General
The term “deck girder” refers to a girder whose top flange or surface is the driving surface, with or without an overlay or CIP topping. They include slab, double-tee, ribbed, deck bulb-tee, wide flange deck and wide flange thin deck girders. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-111
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
Unless noted otherwise deck girders that are not connected to adjacent girders shall use a Type 1 deck protection system; girders that only have shear connections with adjacent girders shall use a Type 3 or Type 4 deck protection system; and girders that have moment connections with adjacent girders shall use Type 2 or Type 3 deck protection systems. The requirements for bridge deck protection systems are covered in Section 5.7.4. Deck girders without a composite CIP concrete deck or topping shall have a minimum concrete cover of 2″ over the top mat. The top mat of reinforcement in the deck girder (top flange) shall be epoxy-coated. 5.6.7.B
Slab Girders
Slab girder spans between centerlines of bearing shall be limited to the prestressed concrete girder height multiplied by 30 due to unexpected variations from traditional beam camber calculations. Standard configurations of slab girders are shown in the girder standard plans. The width of slab girders should not exceed 8′-0″. Designers should minimize the number of different widths of slabs on projects in order simplify fabrication. For slab girders bearing on reinforced soil, standard details shall be modified per Section 7.5.2.A. Slab girder spans shall use a Type 4 deck protection system. The longitudinal reinforcement shall #5 bars be spaced at 12 inches maximum and the transverse reinforcement shall be #5 bars spaced at 6 inches maximum. The AASHTO LRFD criteria for deflection shall be satisfied for slab girders. A minimum of two permanent top strands shall be provided for slab girders, one adjacent to each edge. Additional permanent top strands can be used if required to control girder end tensile stresses as well as concrete stresses due to plant handling, shipping and erection. In some cases it may be necessary to use temporary top strands to control girder end tensile stresses as well as concrete stresses due to plant handling, shipping and erection. These strands shall be bonded for 10′ at both ends of the girder, and unbonded for the remainder of the girder length. Temporary strands shall be cut prior to equalizing girders and placing the CIP bridge deck. Designers may also consider other methods to control girder stresses including debonding permanent strands at girder ends and adding mild steel reinforcement. Girder equalization, shear keys and weld ties are not required when a minimum 5″ composite CIP bridge deck is placed over slab girders. Differential camber is expected to be small but the designer should ensure it can be accommodated by the CIP deck. Designers should ensure that the cross slope of girder supports are the same at both ends of each girder in order to prevent girder torsion, point loads, and gaps between the girder and the bearings. Lateral restraint of slab girder superstructures with end type A at abutments shall be provided by external girder stops, one on each side of the bridge. 5.6.7.C
Double-Tee and Ribbed Deck Girders
Double-tee and ribbed deck girders shall be limited to widening existing similar structures. A hot mix asphalt (HMA) overlay with membrane shall be specified. These sections are capable of spanning up to 60′. Page 5-112

Deck Bulb-Tee Girders
Deck bulb-tee girders have standard girder depths of 35, 41, 53, and 65 inches. The top flange/deck may vary from 4-feet 1-inch to 6-feet wide. They are capable of spanning up to 155 feet. Deck bulb-tee girders shall be limited to pedestrian bridges, temporary bridges and to widening existing similar structures. Deck bulb-tee girders shall be installed with girder webs plumb. Bridge deck superelevation shall be accommodated by varying the top flange thickness. Superelevation should be limited so that lifting embedments can be located at the center of gravity of the girder to prevent complications with lifting, hauling and erection. Use of deck bulb-tee girders should be avoided when superelevation transitions occur within the span. Girder size and weight shall be evaluated for shipping and hauling to the project site. 5.6.7.E
Wide Flange Deck Girders
Wide flange deck girders have standard girder depths ranging from 39 inches to 103 inches. The top flange/deck may vary from 5-feet to 8-feet wide. Bridge deck superelevation shall be accommodated by varying the top flange thickness. Superelevation should be limited so that lifting embedments can be located at the center of gravity of the girder to prevent complications with lifting, hauling and erection. Use of wide flange deck girders should be avoided on roadways with superelevation transitions or sharp horizontal curvature. They shall be limited to spans where the pier skew angles are within 10° of each other. Designers should balance weight, prestress and camber between adjacent girders to improve fit-up. Biaxial bending stress and the effect of an eccentric shear center shall be considered when roadway cross-slopes exceed 0.04 ft/ft. Girder size and weight shall be evaluated for shipping and hauling to the project site. 1.
Wide Flange Deck Girders with Mechanical Connections These girders rely on weld ties and a grouted keyway to connect adjacent girders. These girders shall be limited to pedestrian bridges, temporary bridges and to widening existing similar structures.
2.
Wide Flange Deck Girders with UHPC Connections These girders rely on a short non-contact lap splice between extended transverse reinforcement in cast-in-place closures of ultra high performance concrete. A nonstructural overlay shall be used on these bridges to protect the deck girders as well as accommodate differential girder camber. A polyester concrete overlay can be used. An HMA overlay can be used where the approach roadways are HMA. Modified concrete overlays may be considered, but special consideration is required to prevent debonding of the overlay from UHPC. These girders shall be limited to simple span bridges with roadway with cross- slopes of 0.04 ft/ft or less. WF39DG, WF45DG, and WF53DG girders may be erected with the web plumb or perpendicular to the roadway surface. Erect all other girders with the web plumb.

Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
Due to the risk of over height impacts and the difficulty of repairing UHPC connections, these bridges shall be limited to spans with at least 16’-6” of vertical clearance above roadways below. Precise fit-up between the top flanges of adjacent girders is necessary for a quality UHPC connection joint. When the ends of girders are skewed, top flange edges are vertically offset relative to one another due to camber. This is commonly known as the “saw tooth” effect. The “saw tooth” effect can be accommodated by negating the effects of camber with longitudinal top flange thickening or precamber or adjusting the bearing elevations so that adjacent top flanges align. Adjustments typically consist of raising one end of the girder and lowering the other to match the profile of the adjacent girder. This approach is only viable if the roadway profile is made to match the camber. 5.6.7.F
Wide Flange Thin Deck Girders Wide flange thin deck girders have standard girder depths ranging from 36 inches to 100 inches. The top flange may vary from 5-feet to 8-feet wide. Welded ties and grouted keys at flange edges are not required. The CIP bridge deck thickness shall be capable of accommodating expected girder camber variations and tolerances using a Type 1 Deck Protection System. The deck shall be assumed to be 7” minimum in preliminary design, but may be reduced to as thin as 6” in final design. Two mats of transverse reinforcement in the CIP bridge deck shall be designed to resist live loads and superimposed dead loads. The cover to the bottom of the bottom mat shall be 1” minimum. Bottom mat longitudinal bars are not required. Wide flange thin deck girders shall be installed with girder webs plumb. Bridge deck superelevation shall be accommodated by varying the CIP bridge deck thickness. Use of wide flange thin deck girders should be avoided with large superelevations in order to limit CIP bridge deck thickness.

Prestressed Concrete Tub Girders 5.6.8.A
General
Prestressed concrete tub girders (U and UF sections) are an option for moderate bridge spans. The standard tub girders (U sections) have 4′-0″ or 5′-0″ bottom flange widths and are 4′-6″, 5′-6″ or 6′-6″ deep. A 6″ deep top flange can be added to tub girders (UF sections) to improve structural efficiency and to accommodate placement of formwork and stay-inplace precast deck panels. Drain holes shall be provided at the low point of the tub girders at the centerline of the bottom flange.

Curved Tub Girders
Curved tub girders may be considered for bridges with moderate horizontal radiuses. Curved tub girders can either be designed in one piece or in segments depending on span configurations and shipping limitations. Curved tub girders are post-tensioned at the fabrication plant and shipped to the jobsite. Additional jobsite post-tensioning may be required if segment assembly is necessary, or if continuity over intermediate piers is desired. Closure joints at segment splices shall meet the requirements of Section 5.9.4.C. The following limitations shall be considered for curved tub girders:
5.6.9
1.
The overall width of curved segments for shipment shall not exceed 16 feet.
2.
The location of the shipping supports shall be carefully studied so that the segment is stable during shipping. The difference in dead load reactions of the shipping supports within the same axle shall not exceed 5 percent.
3.
The maximum shipping weight of segments may be different depending on the size of the segments. The shipping weight shall meet the legal axle load limits set by the RCW, but in no case shall the maximum shipping weight exceed 275 kips.
4.
The minimum web thickness shall be 10″. Other cross-sectional dimensions of WSDOT standard tub girders are applicable to curved tub girders.
5.
Effects of curved tendons shall be considered in accordance with Section 5.8.1.F.
6.
The clear spacing between the outside diameter of ducts shall be 2″ min. The duct diameter shall not exceed 4½″.
Prestressed Concrete Girder Checking Requirement 1.
Shear reinforcing size and spacing shall be determined by the designer.
2.
Determine lifting location and required concrete strength at release to provide adequate stability during handling. Generally temporary strands provide additional stability for lifting and transportation, and reduce the camber. Less camber allows for less “A” dimension and concrete pad dead weight on the structure. Temporary strands are cut after the girders are erected and braced and before the intermediate diaphragms are cast.
3.
Due to the extreme depth of the WF83G, WF95G, and WF100G girders, and possible tilt at the piers for profile grades, the designer will need to pay particular attention to details to assure the girders will fit and perform as intended.
4.
Check edge distance of supporting cross beam.

Bridge Decks Concrete bridge decks shall be designed using the Traditional Design of AASHTO LRFD Section 9.7.3 as modified by this section. The following information is intended to provide guidance for bridge deck thickness and transverse and longitudinal reinforcement of bridge decks. Information on deck protection systems is given in Section 5.7.4.
5.7.1
Bridge Deck Requirements 5.7.1.A
Minimum Bridge Deck Thickness
The minimum bridge deck thickness (including 0.5″ wearing surface) shall be 7.5″ for concrete girder bridges, 8.0″ for steel girder bridges, and 8.5″ for concrete girder bridges with SIP deck panels. This minimum bridge deck thickness may be reduced by 0.5″ for bridges with Deck Protection Systems 2, 3 and 5. The minimum CIP bridge deck thickness for prestressed concrete slab girders is 5″. For bridge deck overhangs that support traffic barriers, the minimum thickness shall be 8”. This minimum is intended to satisfy crashworthiness requirements as well as provide clearance for hooked transverse bars in the deck. Minimum bridge deck thicknesses are established in order to ensure that overloads will not result in premature bridge deck cracking. The minimum clearance between top and bottom reinforcing mats shall be 1″. 5.7.1.B
Computation of Bridge Deck Strength
The design thickness for usual bridge decks are shown in Figures 5.7.1-1 and 2. The thickness of the bridge deck and reinforcement in the area of the cantilever may be governed by traffic barrier loading. Wheel loads plus dead load shall be resisted by the sections shown in Figure 5.7.1-2. Design of the cantilever is normally based on the expected depth of the bridge deck at centerline of girder span. This is usually less than the dimensions at the girder ends. Figure 5.7.1-1

Computation of “A” Dimension
The distance from the top of the bridge deck to the top of the girder at centerline bearing at centerline of girder is represented by the “A” Dimension. It is calculated in accordance with the guidance of Appendix 5-B1. This ensures that adequate allowance will be made for excess camber, transverse deck slopes, vertical and horizontal curvatures. Where temporary prestress strands at top of girder are used to control the girder stresses due to shipping and handling, the “A” dimension must be adjusted accordingly. The note in the left margin of the layout sheet shall read: “A” Dimension = X” (not for design).
5.7.2
Bridge Deck Reinforcement 5.7.2.A
Transverse Reinforcement
The size and spacing of transverse reinforcement may be governed by interior bridge deck span design and cantilever design. Where cantilever design governs, short hooked bars may be added at the bridge deck edge to increase the reinforcement available in that area. Top transverse reinforcement is always hooked at the bridge deck edge unless a traffic barrier is not used. Top transverse reinforcement is preferably spliced at some point between girders in order to allow the clearance of the hooks to the bridge deck edge forms to be properly adjusted in the field. Usually, the bridge deck edge hooks will need to be tilted in order to place them. On larger bars, the clearance for the longitudinal bar through the hooks shall be checked. Appendices 5.3‑A5 through 5.3-A8 can be used to aid in selection of bar size and spacing. For skewed spans, the transverse bars are placed normal to bridge centerline and the areas near the expansion joints and bridge ends are reinforced by partial length bars. For raised crossbeam bridges, the bottom transverse bridge deck reinforcement is discontinued at the crossbeam. The spacing of bars over the crossbeam must be detailed to be large enough to allow concrete to be poured into the crossbeam. For typical requirements, see Section 5.3.3.D. For bridge decks with a crowned roadway, the bottom surface and rebar shall be flat, as shown in Figure 5.7.2-1. Page 5-118

Longitudinal Reinforcement
This section discusses reinforcement requirements for resistance of longitudinal moments in continuous multi-span prestressed concrete girder bridges and is limited to reinforcement in the bridge deck since capacity for resisting positive moment is provided by the girder reinforcement. For longitudinal reinforcement requirements for decks on steel girder bridges, see Chapter 6. 5.7.2.B.1
Simple Spans
For simple span bridges, longitudinal bridge deck reinforcement is not required to resist negative moments and therefore the reinforcement requirements are nominal. Figure 5.7.2-2 defines longitudinal reinforcement requirements for these decks. The bottom longitudinal reinforcement is defined by AASHTO LRFD Section 9.7.3.2 requirements for distribution reinforcement. The top longitudinal reinforcement is based on current office practice.

Normally, no more than 33 percent of the total area of main reinforcing bars at a support (negative moment) or at midspan (positive moment) shall be cut off at one point. Where limiting this value to 33 percent leads to severe restrictions on the reinforcement pattern, an increase in figure may be considered. Two reinforcement bars shall be used as stirrup hangers.

Concrete Bridge Deck Design and Detailing
These requirements are primarily for beam-slab bridges with main reinforcement perpendicular to traffic:
• Minimum cover over the top layer of reinforcement shall be 2.5″ including 0.5″ wearing surface (Deck Protection Systems 1 and 4). The minimum cover over the bottom layer reinforcement shall be 1.0″.
• The minimum clearance between top and bottom reinforcing mats shall be 1″.
• A maximum bar size of #5 is preferred for longitudinal and transverse reinforcement in the bridge deck except that a maximum bar size of #7 is preferred for longitudinal reinforcement at intermediate piers. #6 bars may be used for transverse reinforcement, but designers should be aware that they may not be fully developed at overhang curblines for all traffic barriers.
• The minimum amount of reinforcement in each direction shall be 0.18 in2/ft for the top layer and 0.27 in2/ft for the bottom layer. The amount of longitudinal reinforcement reinforcementin inthe thebottom bottomof ofbridge bridgedecks decksshall shallnot notbe beless lessthan than 220 ≤67 percent of √S the positive moment as specified in AASHTO LRFD Section 9.7.3.2.
• Top and bottom reinforcement in longitudinal direction of bridge deck shall be staggered to allow better flow of concrete between the reinforcing bars.

• The maximum bar spacing in transverse and longitudinal directions for the top mat, and transverse direction of the bottom mat shall not exceed 12″. The maximum bar spacing for bottom longitudinal within the effective length, as specified in AASHTO LRFD Section 9.7.2.3, shall not exceed the deck thickness.
• Allow the Contractor the option of either a roughened surface or a shear key at the intermediate pier diaphragm construction joint.
• Both top and bottom layer reinforcement shall be considered when designing for negative moment at the intermediate piers.
• Reduce lap splices if possible. Use staggered lap splices for both top and bottom in longitudinal and transverse directions.
5.7.3
Stay-In-Place Deck Panels 5.7.3.A
General
The use of precast, prestressed stay-in-place (SIP) deck panels for bridge decks may be investigated at the preliminary design stage. The acceptance evaluation will consider such items as extra weight for seismic design and the resulting substructure impacts. The composite deck system consisting of precast prestressed concrete deck panels with a CIP topping has advantages in minimizing traffic disruption, speeding up construction and solving constructability issues on certain projects. Contractors, in most cases, prefer this composite deck panel system for bridge decks in traffic congested areas and other specific cases. Precast prestressed stay-in-place deck panels typically do not require air-entrained concrete because they are protected from saturation under service. SIP deck panels may be used on WSDOT bridges with WSDOT State Bridge and Structures Engineer approval. Details for SIP deck panels are shown on the Bridge Standard Drawings website (www.wsdot.wa.gov/Bridge/Structures/ StandardDrawings.htm). Steel deck forms are not permitted in order to allow inspection of deck soffits and to avoid maintenance of a corrosion protection system. 5.7.3.B
Design Criteria
The design of SIP deck panels follows the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications and the PCI Bridge Design Manual. The design philosophy of SIP deck panels is identical to simple span prestressed concrete girders. They are designed for Service Limit State and checked for Strength Limit State. The precast panels support the dead load of deck panels and CIP topping, and the composite SIP deck panel and CIP cross-section resists the live load and superimposed dead loads. The tensile stress at the bottom of the panel is limited to zero per WSDOT design practice. 5.7.3.C
Limitations on SIP Deck Panels
The conventional full-depth CIP bridge deck shall be used for most applications. However, the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office may allow the use of SIP deck panels with the following limitations: 1.
Page 5-122
SIP deck panels shall not be used in negative moment regions of continuous conventionally reinforced bridges. SIP deck panels may be used in post-tensioned continuous bridges. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
5.7.4
Chapter 5
2.
Bridge widening. SIP deck panels are not allowed in the bay adjacent to the existing structure because it is difficult to set the panels properly on the existing structure, and the requirement for a CIP closure. SIP deck panels can be used on the other girders when the widening involves multiple girders.
3.
Phased construction. SIP deck panels are not allowed in the bay adjacent to the previously placed deck because of the requirement for a CIP closure.
4.
Prestressed concrete girders with narrow flanges. Placement of SIP deck panels on girders with flanges less than 12″ wide is difficult.
5.
A minimum bridge deck thickness of 8.5″, including 3.5″ precast deck panel and 5″ CIP concrete topping shall be specified.
6.
SIP deck panels are not allowed for steel girder bridges.
Bridge Deck Protection Systems The roadway surface for all bridge structures shall conform to one of the listed deck protection systems. Special conditions (i.e. a widening) where it may be desirable to deviate from the standard deck protection systems require approval of the WSDOT Bridge Asset Management Unit. Preliminary plans shall indicate the protection system in the left margin in accordance with Section 2.3.8. Saw cutting or grinding pavement items are not allowed on the bridge decks. Rumble strips and recessed pavement markers shall not be placed on bridge decks, or approach slab surfaces whether they are concrete or asphalted as stated in Standard Specifications Section 8-08 and 8-09, respectively. Traffic detection loops shall not be located in an existing bridge surface. They may be installed during the construction of bridge decks prior to placing the deck concrete in accordance with Standard Plan J-50.16. 5.7.4.A
Deck Protection Systems
The following paragraphs describe five WSDOT protective systems used to protect a concrete bridge deck design. 5.7.4.A.1
Type 1 Protection System
This is the default deck protection system for cases where a deck protection system has not been specified. Type 1 protection system shall be used for cast-in-place bridge decks with two layers of reinforcement, see Figure 5.7.4-1. This also applies to CIP slab bridges, deck replacements and the widening of existing decks. System 1 consists of the following: 1.
A minimum 2½″ of concrete cover over top bars of deck reinforcing for cast-in-place decks. The cover includes a ½″ wearing surface and ¼″ tolerance for the placement of the reinforcing steel. Bottom cover shall be 1” minimum.
2.
Both the top and bottom mat of deck reinforcing shall be epoxy-coated or equivalent corrosion protection system as specified in BDM 5.1.2.
3.
Girder stirrups and horizontal shear reinforcement do not require epoxy-coating or equivalent corrosion protection system as specified in BDM 5.1.2..

5.7.4.A.2
Type 2 Protection System
This protection system consists of cementitious and polymer-based overlays on new and existing bridge decks, see Figure 5.7.4-2 for an example of a modified concrete overlay on a deck rehabilitation project. For new bridges, a 1½″ modified concrete overlay shall be used. For rehabilitation projects, the WSDOT Bridge Asset Management Unit will recommend the type of overlay. The common overlays are as follows. 1.
1½″ Modified Concrete Overlay Concrete overlays are generally described as a 1.5″ minimum unreinforced layer of modified concrete. Overlay concrete is modified to provide a low permeability that slows or prevents the penetration of chlorides into the bridge deck, but also has a high resistance to rutting. Ideally, the concrete cover to the top layer of reinforcement should be 2.5″. For new structures, the deck reinforcement shall be epoxy coated or equivalent corrosion protection system as specified in BDM 5.1.2. These overlays were first used by WSDOT in 1979 and have an expected life between 20-40 years. There are more than 600 bridges with concrete overlays as of 2010. This is the preferred overlay system for deck rehabilitation that provides longterm deck protection and a durable wearing surface. In construction, the existing bridge deck is hydromilled ½″ prior to placing the 1.5″ overlay. This requires the grade to be raised 1″.
Page 5-124
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
The modified concrete overlay specifications allow a contractor to choose between a latex, microsilica or fly ash modified mix design. Construction requires a deck temperature between 45°F–75°F with a wind speed less than 10 mph. Traffic control can be significant since the time to cure the concrete overlay alone is 42 hours. 2.
¾″ Polyester Modified Concrete Overlay These overlays were first used by WSDOT in 1989 and have an expected life between 20-40 years with more than 20 overlay as of 2010. This type of overlay uses specialized polyester equipment and materials. Construction requires dry weather with temperatures above 50°F and normally cures in 4 hours. A polyester concrete overlay may be specified in special cases when rapid construction is needed.
3.
3″ Concrete Class 4000D Overlay These are nominally 3” thick concrete overlays placed after the existing bridge deck is scarified down to the top mat of bridge deck reinforcement. The minimum thickness shall be 2” to accommodate the larger aggregate in Concrete Class 4000D. These overlays were first used in the mid 2010’s on bridges that had previously received a modified concrete overlay. Second generation modified concrete overlays were seen to suffer from debonding, which may have been caused by microcracks in the substrate concrete caused by rotary milling machines and other percussive equipment used to scarify bridge decks in the past. The increased depth of removal using hydromilling equipment ensures the removal of bruised/microcracked concrete in the existing bridge deck.
4.
Historical Overlay Systems A rapid set latex modified concrete (RSLMC) overlay uses special cement manufactured by the CTS Company based in California. RSLMC is mixed in a mobile mixing truck and applied like a regular concrete overlay. The first RSLMC overlay was applied to bridge 162/20 South Prairie Creek in 2002 under Contract No. 016395. Like polyester, this overlay cures in 4 hours and may be specified in special cases when rapid construction is needed. Thin polymer overlays are built up layers of a polymer material with aggregate broad cast by hand. The first thin overlay was placed in 1986 and after placing 25 overlays, they were discontinued in the late 1998 due to poor performance. Figure 5.7.4-2

Concrete Structures
5.7.4.A.3
Type 3 Protection System
This protection system consists of a Hot Mixed Asphalt (HMA) overlay wearing surface and requires the use of a waterproofing membrane, see Figure 5.7.4-3. HMA overlays should be applied over decks with 2” of concrete cover and epoxy-coated or other corrosion resistant reinforcing. HMA overlays provide a lower level of deck protection and introduce the risk of damage by planing equipment during resurfacing. Asphalt overlays with a membrane were first used on a WSDOT bridges in 1971 and about ⅓ of WSDOT structures have HMA. The bridge HMA has an expected life equal to the roadway HMA when properly constructed. Waterproof membranes are required with the HMA overlay. Unlike roadway surfaces, the HMA material collects and traps water carrying salts and oxygen at the concrete surface deck. This is additional stress to an epoxy protection system or a bare deck and requires a membrane to mitigate the penetration of salts and oxygen to the structural reinforcement and cement paste. See Standard Specifications for more information on waterproof membranes. HMA overlays may be used in addition to the Type 1 Protection System for new bridges where it is desired to match roadway pavement materials or for simple span WFDG girder bridges connected with UHPC. New bridge designs using HMA shall have a minimum depth of overlay of 0.25' (3″) to allow future resurfacing contracts to remove and replace 0.15′ HMA without damaging the concrete cover or the waterproof membrane. Plan sheet references to the depth of HMA shall be in feet, since this is customary for the paving industry. Existing structures may apply an HMA overlay in accordance with the Bridge Paving Policies, Section 5.7.5. Standard Plan A-40.20.00, Bridge Transverse Joints Seals for HMA provides some standard details for saw cutting small relief joints in HMA paving. Saw cut joints can have a longer life, better ride, and help seal the joint at a location known to crack and may be used for small bridge expansion joints less than 1 inch. Figure 5.7.4-3

Type 4 Protection System
This system is a minimum 5″ cast-in-place (CIP) topping with at least one mat of epoxy coated reinforcement, see Figure 5.7.4-4. This system eliminates girder wheel distribution problems, provides a quality protection system and provides a durable wearing surface. It is commonly used on slab girder bridges that transfer shear forces between girders with minimal flexure. 1.
A minimum concrete cover of 1″ applies to the top mat of the top of the prestressed member.
2.
Epoxy coating the prestressed member top mat reinforcement is not required. Figure 5.7.4-4
5.7.4.A.5
Deck Protection System 4
Type 5 Protection System
This system requires a layered, 3″ concrete cover for double protection, see Figure 5.7.4-5. All segmentally constructed bridges shall use this system to protect construction joints and provide minor grade adjustments during construction. Segmental bridges and bridge decks with transverse post-tensioning in the deck shall use this system since deck rehabilitation due to premature deterioration is very costly. The 3″ cover consists of the following: 1.
Both the top and bottom mat of deck reinforcing are epoxy-coated or equivalent corrosion protection system as specified in BDM Section 5.1.2. Girder/web stirrups and horizontal shear reinforcement does not require epoxy-coating.
2.
The deck is constructed with a 1¾″ concrete cover.
3.
The deck is then scarified ¼″ prior to the placement of a modified concrete overlay. Scarification shall be diamond grinding to preserve the integrity of the segmental deck and joints.
4.
A 1½″ modified concrete overlay is placed as a wearing surface.

Existing Bridge Deck Widening
New deck rebar shall match the existing top layer. This provides steel at a uniform depth which is important when removing concrete during future rehab work. Bridges prior to the mid 1980’s used 1½″ concrete cover. New and widened decks using a Type 1 Protection System shall have 2½″ cover. When an existing bridge is widened, the existing concrete or asphalt deck may require resurfacing. WSDOT is forced to rehab concrete decks based on the condition of the existing deck or concrete overlay. If a deck or overlay warrants rehabilitation, then the existing structure shall be resurfaced and included in the widening project. By applying the stated design criteria, the following policies shall apply to bridge widening projects which may require special traffic closures for the bridge work. 5.7.4.B.1
Rebar
The deck or cast-in-place slab of the new widened portion shall use the Type 1 Protection System, even though the existing structure has bare rebar. The top mat of new rebar shall match the height of existing rebar. Variations in deck thickness are to be obtained by lowering the bottom of the deck or slab. 5.7.4.B.2
Concrete Decks
If the existing deck is original concrete without a concrete overlay, the new deck shall have a Type 1 Protection System and the existing deck shall have a 1½″ concrete overlay or Type 2 Protection System. This matches the rebar height and provides a concrete cover of 2.5″ on both the new and old structure. If the existing deck has a concrete overlay, the new deck shall have a Type 1 Protection System and the existing overlay shall be replaced if the deck deterioration is greater than 1 percent of the deck area. 5.7.4.B.3
Concrete Overlays
It is preferred to place a concrete overlay from curb to curb. If this is problematic for traffic control, then Plans shall provide at least a 6″ offset lap where the overlay construction joint will not match the deck construction joint.
Page 5-128
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
5.7.4.B.4
HMA Overlays
The depth of existing asphalt must be field measured and shown on the bridge plans. This mitigates damage of the existing structure due to removal operations and reveals other design problems such as: improper joint height, buried construction problems, excessive weight, or roadway grade transitions adjustments due to drainage. The new deck must meet the rebar and cover criteria stated above for Concrete Decks and deck tinning is not required. Type 3 Protection system shall be used and HMA shall be placed to provide a minimum 0.15′ or the optimum 0.25′. 5.7.4.B.5
Small Width Widening
With approval of the WSDOT Bridge Management Unit, smaller width widening design that has traffic on the new construction can match existing 1½″ concrete cover for the widened portion, if the existing deck deterioration is less than 1 percent of the deck area. 5.7.4.B.6
Expansion Joints
All joints shall be in good condition and water tight for the existing bridge and the newly constructed widened portion. The following joint criteria applies: 1.
The existing expansion joint shall be replaced if:
• More than 10 percent of the length of a joint has repairs within 1′-0″ of the joint.
• Part of a joint is missing.
• The joint is a non-standard joint system placed by maintenance.
5.7.5
2.
All existing joint seals shall be replaced.
3.
When existing steel joints are not replaced in the project, the new joint shall be the same type and manufacturer as the existing steel joint.
4.
Steel joints shall have no more than one splice and the splice shall be at a lane line. Modular joints shall not have any splices.
HMA Paving on Bridge Decks 5.7.5.A
Design Responsibilities
Bridge paving design options are bridge specific based on the existing conditions and previous paving. All designers, whether WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office, Region PEO, or outside consultants, shall have the following documents in-hand before beginning any bridge deck paving design: 1.
Bridge Condition Report (BCR) as developed by the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office for each bridge within the project limits. The BCR specifies the known bridge deck paving conditions present at the bridge, and specifies the paving depths and bridge deck repair requirements as determined by the WSDOT State Bridge Asset Management unit.
2.
Project Resurfacing Report as developed by the Region Materials Laboratory. The Region PEO is responsible for field evaluation of the current surfacing condition and the current depth of surfacing as confirmed by cores taken by the Region Materials Laboratory. Surfacing depths vary from bridge to bridge and vary within the same bridge deck, so multiple cores at a bridge are necessary to establish a valid current baseline.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-129
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
Discrepancies in paving depths specified at each bridge between the Project Resurfacing Report and the BCR shall be discussed by the Region PEO and the Bridge Asset Management unit to reach a consensus prior to continuing with bridge deck paving design. Bridge deck paving PS&E for bridges in HMA paving projects may be prepared in the Region by the Design PEO provided all of the following conditions are satisfied: 1.
A minimum of 0.25 feet of competent HMA is present on the bridge deck. Milling operations will leave a minimum of 0.10 feet of HMA on the bridge deck. Filling operations will not add more than 0.15 feet of HMA. Bridge deck repair and a waterproof membrane are not planned.
2.
No bridge expansion joint or header repair or replacement work is required.
3.
The bridges have an operating load rating equal or greater than 45 tons. Operating ratings are shown on the Bridge Engineering Information System (BEIST) summary sheet: http://beist/InventoryAndRepair/Inventory/BRIDGE
4.
The BCR indicates paving weight restrictions are not required for the structure.
Bridge deck paving PS&E for bridges not conforming to all of the criteria above will be prepared by the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office. Region is responsible for field evaluation of paving condition and the depth of asphalt provided by the last paving contract. Asphalt depths can vary on the concrete deck and from bridge to bridge. In most cases, asphalt depth measurements at the fog line on the four corners of the deck are sufficient to establish a design depth for contracts. The Bridge Asset Manager shall be informed of the measurements. Paving shown in the Plans would use an approximate or averaged value of the measurements. Some situations may require a Plan Detail showing how the depth varies to assist the planing operations. 5.7.5.B
Design Considerations
An HMA wearing surface is a recognized method to manage concrete rutting, improve the ride on HMA roadways, and is a form of deck protection. Bridges may or may not have the capacity to carry the additional dead load of an asphalt wearing surface. The following bridge paving policies have been developed with the concurrence of WSDOT Pavement Managers to establish bridge HMA Design options available for state managed structures. 5.7.5.B.1
HMA Depth
HMA thickness shall be 0.25′ or 3″. A greater depth may be allowed if structurally acceptable, such as structures with ballast or as approved by the WSDOT Load Rating Engineer. The thickness of HMA shall not reduce the exposed barrier height below minimum requirements. Paving designs that increase the HMA more than 3″ require a new Load Rating analysis and shall be submitted to the WSDOT Bridge Preservation office Load Rating Engineer.
Page 5-130
1.
Concrete bridge decks with more than 0.21′ HMA may be exempted from paving restrictions for mill/fill HMA design.
2.
Prestressed concrete deck girders and slabs with less than 0.25′ HMA require paving restrictions to avoid planing the supporting structure.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
3.
Chapter 5
A paving grade change will be required when more than 0.25′ of asphalt exists on a structure in order to reduce the weight on the structure and meet acceptable rail height standards.
5.7.5.B.2
Grade Controlled Structures
For bridge decks with an HMA thickness less than 0.25′ and the grade is limited by bridge joint height or other considerations, resurfacing must provide full depth removal of HMA or mill/fill the minimum 0.12′. 5.7.5.B.3
Grade Transitions
When raising or lowering the HMA grade profile on/off or under the bridge, the maximum rate of change or slope shall be 1″/40′ (1′/500′) as shown in Standard Plan A-60.30-00, even if this means extending the project limits. Incorrect transitions are the cause of many “bumps at the bridge” and create an undesired increase in truck loading. The following items should be considered when transitioning a roadway grade: 1.
Previous HMA overlays that raised the grade can significantly increase the minimum transition length.
2.
Drainage considerations may require longer transitions or should plane to existing catch basins.
3.
Mainline paving that raises the grade under a bridge must verify Vertical Clearance remains in conformance to current Vertical Clearance requirements. Mill/Fill of the roadway at the bridge is generally desired unless lowering the grade is required. See Design Manual Section 720.04 Bridge Site Design Elements, (5) Vertical Clearances, (c) Minimum Clearance for Existing Structures, 1. Bridge Over a Roadway.
5.7.5.B.4
Full Removal
Full depth removal and replacement of the HMA is always an alternate resurfacing design option. Full depth removal may be required by the Region Pavement Manager or the Bridge Office due to poor condition of the HMA or bridge deck. Bridge Deck Repair and Membrane Waterproofing (Deck Seal) standard pay items are required for this option and the Bridge Office will provide engineering estimates of the quantity (SF) and cost for both. 1.
Bridge deck repair will be required when the HMA is removed and the concrete is exposed for deck inspection. Chain drag testing is completed and based on the results, the contractor is directed to fix the quantity of deck repairs. The chain drag results are sent to the WSDOT State Bridge Asset Manager and used by the WSDOT Bridge Office to monitor the condition of the concrete deck and determine when the deck needs rehabilitation or replacement.
2.
Membrane Waterproofing (Deck Seal) is Standard Item 4455 and will be required for all HMA bridge decks, except when the following conditions are met. A. HMA placed on a deck that has a Modified Concrete Overlay which acts like a membrane. B.
The bridge is on the P2 replacement list or deck rehabilitation scheduled within the next 4 years or two bienniums.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
5.7.5.B.5
Bare Deck HMA
Paving projects may place HMA on a bare concrete deck, with concurrence of the WSDOT Bridge Asset Manager, if the bridge is on an HMA route and one of the following conditions apply. 1.
Rutting on the concrete deck is ½″ or more.
2.
The Region prefers to simplify paving construction or improve the smoothness at the bridge.
When the concrete bridge deck does not have asphalt on the surface, Region Design should contact the Region Materials lab and have a Chain Drag Report completed and forwarded to the Bridge Asset Manager during design to establish the Bridge Deck Repair quantities for the project. Pavement Design should then contact Region Bridge Maintenance to request the repairs be completed prior to contract; or the repairs may be included in the paving contract. Small amounts of Bridge Deck Repair have an expensive unit cost by contract during paving operations. 5.7.5.B.6
Bridge Transverse Joint Seals
Saw cut pavement joints shown in Standard Plan A-40.20-04 perform better and help prevent water problems at the abutment or in the roadway. Typical cracking locations where pavement joint seals are required: End of the bridge; End of the approach slab; or joints on the deck. However, if Pavement Designers do not see cracking at the ends of the bridge, then sawcut joints may be omitted for these locations. HQ Program Management has determined this work is “incidental” to P1 by definition and should be included in a P1 paving project and use Standard Item 6517. The following summarizes the intended application of the Details in Standard Plan A-40.20-04. 1.
Detail 1 & 2 Applies where HMA on the bridge surface abuts an HMA roadway.
2.
Detail 3 & 4 Applies where concrete bridge surface abuts an HMA roadway.
3.
Detail 5, 6 & 7 Applies at open concrete joints.
4.
Detail 11 Applies to longitudinal staging joints.
5.
Detail 12 Applies to pavement repair at pavement seats.
5.7.5.B.7
Bituminous Surface Treatments (BST)
Bituminous Surface Treatments (or chip seals) ½″ thick may be applied to bridge decks with HMA under the following conditions.
Page 5-132
1.
Plans must identify or list all structures bridges included or expected within project limits and identify bridge expansion joint systems to be protected.
2.
BST is not allowed on weight restricted or posted bridges.
3.
Planing will be required for structures at the maximum asphalt design depth or the grade is limited.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
BSTs are generally not a problem if the structure is not grade limited for structural reasons. BCRs will specify a ½″ chip seal paving depth of 0.03′ for BST Design to be consistent with Washington State Pavement Management System. Plans should indicate ½″ chip seal to be consistent with Standard Specifications and standard pay items. 5.7.5.B.8
Culverts and Other Structures
Culverts or structures with significant fill and do not have rail posts attached to the structure generally will not have paving limitations. Culverts and structures with HMA pavement applied directly to the structure have bridge paving design limits. 5.7.5.B.9
Paving Equipment Load Restrictions
All structures shall be evaluated for their ability to carry the weight of HMA removal and HMA paving equipment. Modern HMA roadway paving equipment can be quite heavy, and typically does not conform to legal vehicle axle patterns. This is particularly true for material transfer vehicles (MTV’s). Each plan set shall include one plan sheet for HMA removal equipment load restrictions and one plan sheet for HMA paving equipment load restrictions. These limits should be selected to give the paving contractor the most flexibility to select equipment and achieve HMA compaction. In special cases for short span bridges where only one piece of equipment can occupy a span, piece weight limits may be specified by plan note. Specified paving loads and configurations shall have an operating load rating factor greater than 1.0. An impact factor of 0.1 or greater shall be used. Vibratory methods of compaction shall not be allowed on bridges or other structures. 5.7.5.B.10
Plans Preparation
All WSDOT structures within the defined project limits must be evaluated for paving or Bituminous Surface Treatment (BST or chip seal). All bridges shall be identified in the Plans as “INCLUDED IN PROJECT” or “NOT INCLUDED” in accordance with Plan Preparation Manual Section 4 “Vicinity Map”, paragraph (n). This applies to all state bridges including but not limited to: 1.
Off the main line. Typical locations include bridges on ramps, frontage roads, or bridges out of right-of-way.
2.
Bridges where the main line route crosses under the structure.
3.
Bridges at the beginning and ending stations of the project. It is not necessary to include the bridge when it was recently resurfaced, but it should be included if incidental joint maintenance repairs are necessary.
A standard Microstation detail is available to simplify detailing of bridge paving in the Plans, see “SH_DT_RDSECBridgeDeckOverlay_Detail”. The table format is copied from the BCR and allows the bridge paving design requirements to be listed in the table. All bridges within the limits of the project must be listed in the table to clarify which structures do not have paving and facilitate data logging for the Washington State Pavement Management System and the Bridge Office.

Design Parameters 5.8.1.A
General
Post-tensioning is generally used for CIP construction and spliced prestressed concrete girders since pretensioning is generally practical only for fabricator-produced structural members. The FHWA Post-tensioned Box Girder Bridge Manual17 is recommended as the guide for design. This manual discusses longitudinal post-tensioning of box girder webs and transverse post-tensioning of box girder slabs, but the methods apply equally well to other types of bridges. The following recommendations are intended to augment the FHWA Manual and the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications and point out where current WSDOT practice departs from practices followed elsewhere. Post-tensioning consists of installing steel tendons into a hollow duct in a structure after the concrete sections are cast. These tendons are usually anchored at each end of the structure and stressed to a design strength using a hydraulic jacking system. After the tendon has been stressed, the duct is typically filled with grout which bonds the tendon to the concrete section and prevents corrosion of the strand. The anchor heads are then encased in concrete to provide corrosion protection. 5.8.1.B
Bridge Types
Post-tensioning has been used in various types of CIP bridges in Washington State with box girders predominating. See Appendix 5-B4 for a comprehensive list of box girder designs. The following are some examples of other bridge types: Kitsap County, Contract 9788, Multi-Span Slab Peninsula Drive, Contract 5898, Two- Span Box Girder Covington Way to 180th Avenue SE, Contract 4919, Two-Span Box Girder Longitudinal Post‑tensioning Snohomish River Bridge, Contract 4444, Multi-Span Box Girder Longitudinal Post-tensioning See Section 2.4.1 for structure type comparison of post-tensioned concrete box girder bridges to other structures. In general, a post-tensioned CIP bridge can have a smaller depth-to-span ratio than the same bridge with conventional reinforcement. This is an important advantage where minimum structure depth is desirable. However, structure depth must be deep enough to accommodate anchorages. 5.8.1.B.1
Slab Bridge
Structure depth can be quite shallow in the positive moment region when post-tensioning is combined with haunching in the negative moment region. However, post-tensioned CIP slabs are usually more expensive than when reinforced conventionally. Designers should proceed with caution when considering post-tensioned slab bridges because severe cracking in the decks of bridges of this type has occurred 21, 22, 23. The Olalla Bridge (Contract 9202) could be reviewed as an example. This bridge has spans of 41.5′–50′–41.5′, a midspan structure depth of 15 inches, and some haunching at the piers.

Chapter 5
T-Beam Bridge
This type of bridge, combined with tapered columns, can be structurally efficient and aesthetically pleasing, particularly when the spacing of the beams and the columns are the same. A T-Beam bridge can also be a good choice for a single-span simply-supported structure. When equally spaced beams and columns are used in the design, the width of beam webs should generally be equal to the width of the supporting columns. See SR 16, Union Avenue O’Xings, for an example. Since longitudinal structural frame action predominates in this type of design, crossbeams at intermediate piers can be relatively small and the post-tensioning tendons can be placed side-by-side in the webs, resulting in an efficient center of gravity of steel line throughout. For other types of T-Beam bridges, the preferred solution may be smaller, more closely spaced beams and fewer, but larger pier elements. If this type of construction is used in a multispan, continuous bridge, the beam crosssection properties in the negative moment regions need to be considerably larger than the properties in the positive moment regions to resist compression. Larger section properties can be obtained by gradually increasing the web thickness in the vicinity of intermediate piers or, if possible, by adding a fillet or haunch. The deck slab overhang over exterior webs should be roughly half the web spacing. 5.8.1.B.3
Box Girder Bridge
This type of bridge has been a popular choice in this state. The cost of a prestressed box girder bridge is practically the same as a conventionally-reinforced box girder bridge, however, longer spans and shallower depths are possible with prestressing. The superstructure of multi-cell box girders shall be designed as a unit. The entire superstructure section (traffic barrier excluded) shall be considered when computing the section properties. For criteria on distribution of live loads, see Section 3.9.4. All slender members subjected to compression must satisfy buckling criteria. Web spacing should normally be 8 to 11 feet and the top slab overhang over exterior girders should be approximately half the girder spacing unless transverse post-tensioning is used. The apparent visual depth of box girder bridges can be reduced by sloping all or the lower portion of the exterior web. If the latter is done, the overall structure depth may have to be increased. Web thickness should be 12 inches minimum, but not less than required for shear, horizontal and vertical reinforcing, duct placement, and for concrete placing clearance. Providing 2½″ of clear cover expedites concrete placement and consolidation in the heavily congested regions adjacent to the post-tensioning ducts. Webs should be flared at anchorages. Top and bottom slab thickness should normally meet the requirements of Section 5.3.1.B, but not less than required by stress and specifications. Generally, the bottom slab would require thickening at the interior piers of continuous spans. This thickening should be accomplished by raising the top surface of the bottom slab at the maximum rate of ½″ per foot.

5.8.1.C
Strand and Tendon Arrangements
The total number of strands selected should be at least the minimum required to meet the strength and service limit state requirements at all points. Check PT supplier literature for duct sizes and strand capacity. The most economical tendon selection will generally be the maximum duct size within the range than can be fit within the web. Commonlystocked anchorages for ½″ diameter strands include 9, 12, 19, 27, 31, and 37 strands. Commonly-stocked anchorages for 0.6″ diameter strands include 4, 7, 12, 19, 22, and 27 strands. The design should utilize commonly-stocked items. For example, a design requiring 66 strands per web would be most economically satisfied by three 22-strand tendons. A less economical choice would be four 17-strand tendons with 19-strand anchorages. The interior cross-sectional area of duct area shall be at least 2.5 times the net cross-sectional area of the prestressing steel. In the regions away from the end anchorages, the duct placement patterns indicated in Figures 5.8.1-1 through 5.8.1-3 shall be used. Although post-tensioning steel normally takes precedence in a member, sufficient room must be provided for other essential mild steel and placement of concrete, in particular near diaphragms and cross-beams. More prestress may be needed in certain portions of a continuous superstructure than elsewhere, and the designer may consider using separate short tendons in those portions of the spans only. However, the savings on prestressing steel possible with such an arrangement should be balanced against the difficulty involved in providing suitable anchoring points and sufficient room for jacking equipment at intermediate locations in the structure. For example, torsion in continuous, multigirder bridges on a curve can be counter-balanced by applying more prestress in the girders on the outside of the curve than in those on the inside of the curve. Some systems offer couplers which make possible stage construction of long bridges. With such systems, forms can be constructed and concrete cast and stressed in a number of spans during stage 1, as determined by the designer. After stage 1 stressing, couplers can be added, steel installed, concrete cast and stressed in additional spans. To avoid local crushing of concrete and/or grout, the stress existing in the steel at the coupled end after stage 1 stressing shall not be exceeded during stage 2 stressing.

Layout of Anchorages and End Blocks
Consult industry brochures and shop plans for recent bridges before laying out end blocks. To encourage bids from a wider range of suppliers, try to accommodate the large square bearing plate sizes common to several systems. Sufficient room must be allowed inside the member for mild steel and concrete placement and outside the member for jacking equipment. The size of the anchorage block in the plane of the anchor plates shall be large enough to provide a minimum of 1″ clearance from the plates to any free edge. The end block dimensions shall meet the requirements of the AASHTO LRFD Specifications. Note that in long-span box girder superstructures requiring large bearing pads, the end block should be somewhat wider than the bearing pad beneath to avoid subjecting the relatively thin bottom slab to high bearing stresses. When the piers of box girder or T-beam bridges are severely skewed, the layout of end blocks, bearing pads, and curtain walls at exterior girders become extremely difficult as shown in Figure 5.8.1-4. Note that if the exterior face of the exterior girder is in the same plane throughout its entire length, all the end block widening must be on the inside. To lessen the risk of tendon break-out through the side of a thin web, the end block shall be long enough to accommodate a horizontal tendon curve of 200 feet minimum radius. The radial component of force in a curved tendon is discussed in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.9.5.4.3.

To prevent excessive friction loss and damage to the prestressing sheathings, adherence to the minimum tendon radii is required.

Whenever members such as columns, crossbeams, and diaphragms are appreciably affected by post-tensioning of the main girders, those effects shall be included in the design. This will generally be true in structures containing rigid frame elements. For further discussion, see Section 2.6 of reference 17. Past practice in the state of Washington regarding control of superstructure shortening in post-tensioned bridges with rigid piers can be illustrated by a few examples. Single-span bridges have been provided with a hinge at one pier and longitudinal slide bearings at the other pier. Two-span bridges have been detailed with longitudinal slide bearings at the end piers and a monolithic middle pier. On the six-span Evergreen Parkway Undercrossing (Bridge Number 101/510), the center pier (pier 4) was built monolithic with the superstructure, and all the other piers were constructed with slide bearings. After posttensioning, the bearings at piers 3 and 5 were converted into fixed bearings to help resist large horizontal loads such as earthquakes. Superstructures which are allowed to move longitudinally at certain piers are typically restrained against motion in the transverse direction at those piers. This can be accomplished with suitable transverse shear corbels or bearings allowing motion parallel to the bridge only. The casting length for box girder bridges shall be slightly longer than the actual bridge layout length to account for the elastic shortening of the concrete due to prestress.

Analysis 5.8.2.A
General
The procedures outlined in Section 2.1 through 2.5 of reference 17 for computation of stress in single and multispan box girders can be followed for the analysis of T-beams and slab bridges as well. STRUDL or CSIBridge is recommended for complex structures which are more accurately idealized as space frames. Examples are bridges with sharp curvature, varying superstructure width, severe skew, or slope-leg intermediate piers. An analysis method in Chapter 10 of reference18 for continuous prestressed beams is particularly well adapted to the loading input format in STRUDL. In the method, the forces exerted by cables of parabolic or other configurations are converted into equivalent vertical linear or concentrated loads applied to members and joints of the superstructure. The vertical loads are considered positive when acting up toward the center of tendon curvature and negative when acting down toward the center of tendon curvature. Forces exerted by anchor plates at the cable ends are coded in as axial and vertical concentrated forces combined with a concentrated moment if the anchor plate group is eccentric. Since the prestress force varies along the spans due to the effects of friction, the difference between the external forces applied at the end anchors at opposite ends of the bridge must be coded in at various points along the spans in order for the summation of horizontal forces to equal zero. With correct input, the effects of elastic shortening and secondary moments are properly reflected in all output, and the prestress moments printed out are the actual resultant (total) moments acting on the structure. For examples of the application of STRUDL to post-tensioning design, see the calculations for I-90 West Sunset Way Ramp and the STRUDL/CSI Bridge manuals. 5.8.2.B
Section Properties
As in other types of bridges, the design normally begins with a preliminary estimate of the superstructure cross-section and the amount of prestress needed at points of maximum stress and at points of cross-section change. For box girders, see Figures 2-0 through 2-5 of Reference17. For T-beam and slab bridges, previous designs are a useful guide in making a good first choice. For frame analysis, use the properties of the entire superstructure regardless of the type of bridge being designed. For stress analysis of slab bridges, calculate loads and steel requirements for a 1′ wide strip. For stress analysis of T-beam bridges, use the procedures outlined in the AASHTO LRFD Specifications. Note that when different concrete strengths are used in different portions of the same member, the equivalent section properties shall be calculated in terms of either the stronger or weaker material. In general, the concrete strength shall be limited to the values indicated in Section 5.1.1.

Chapter 5
Preliminary Stress Check
In accordance with AASHTO, flexural stresses in prestressed members are calculated at service load levels. Shear stresses, stirrups, moment capacities vs. applied moments are calculated at ultimate load levels. During preliminary design, the first objective should be to satisfy the stress limits in the concrete at the critical points in the structure with the chosen cross-section and amount of prestressing steel, then the requirements for shear stress, stirrups, and ultimate moment capacity can be readily met with minor or no modifications in the cross-section. For example, girder webs can be thickened locally near piers to reduce excessive shear stress. In the AASHTO formulas for tensile stress limits in concrete, bonded reinforcement should be interpreted to mean bonded auxiliary (nonprestressed) reinforcement in conformity with Article 8.6 of the 2002 ACI Code for Analysis and Design of Reinforced Concrete Bridge Structures. The refined estimate for computing time-dependent losses in steel stress given in the code shall be used. To minimize concrete cracking and protect reinforcing steel against corrosion for bridges, the concrete stress limits under final conditions in the precompressed tensile zone shall be limited to zero in the top and bottom fibers as shown in Figure 5.8.2-1. In all cases where tension is allowed in the concrete under initial or final conditions, extra mild steel (auxiliary reinforcement) shall be added to carry the total tension present. This steel can be computed as described in Section 9-5 of Reference18. Figure 5.8.2-1
Box Girder Stresses
In case of overstress, try one or more of the following remedies: adjust tendon profiles, add or subtract prestress steel, thicken slabs, revise strength of concrete of top slab, add more short tendons locally, etc.

The initial offset shown is intended to result in minimal bearing eccentricity for the majority of the life of the structure. The bearing shall be designed for the full range of anticipated movements: ES+CR+SH+TEMP including load factors specified in AASHTO for deflections.
5.8.3
Post-tensioning 5.8.3.A
Tendon Layout
After a preliminary estimate has been made of the concrete section and the amount of prestressing needed at points of maximum applied load, it may be advantageous in multispan bridges to draw a tendon profile to a convenient scale superimposed on a plot of the center of gravity of concrete (c.g.c.) line. The most efficient tendon profile from the standpoint of steel stress loss will normally be a series of rather long interconnected parabolas, but other configurations are possible. For continuous bridges with unequal span lengths, the tendon profile (eccentricity) shall be based on the span requirement. This results in an efficient post-tensioning design. The tendon profile and c.g.c. line plot is strongly recommended for superstructures of variable cross-section and/or multiple unsymmetrical span arrangements, but is not necessary for superstructures having constant cross- section and symmetrical spans. The main advantages of the tendon profile and c.g.c. plot are: 1.
The primary prestress moment curves (prestress force times distance from c.g.c. line to center of gravity of steel (c.g.s.) lines) at all points throughout all spans are quickly obtained from this plot and will be used to develop the secondary moment curves (if present) and, ultimately, to develop the resultant total prestress moment curve.
2.
Possible conflicts between prestressing steel and mild steel near end regions, crossbeams, and diaphragms may become apparent.
3.
Possible design revisions may be indicated. For example, camber in bridges with unequal spans can be balanced by adjusting tendon profiles. The tendon profile and c.g.c. line diagram shall also contain a sketch of how the end bearing plates or anchors are to be arranged at the ends of the bridge. Such a sketch can be useful in determining how large the end block in a girder bridge will have to be and how much space will be required for mild steel in the end region. In general, the arrangement of anchor plates should be the same as the arrangement of the ducts to which they belong to avoid problems with duct cross-overs and to keep end blocks of reasonable width.

Prestress Losses
Prestress losses shall be as indicated in Section 5.1.4. 5.8.3.C
Jacking End
Effective prestressing force in design of post-tensioned bridges depends on the accumulation of friction losses due to the horizontal and vertical curvature of the tendons as well as the curvature of the bridge. Although jacking ends of post-tensioned bridges is important to achieve more effective design, consideration shall be given to the practicality of jacking during construction. The following general stressing guidelines shall be considered in specifying jacking end of post-tensioned bridges.
• All simple or multiple span CIP or precast concrete bridges with total length of less than 350′ shall be stressed from one end only.
• All CIP or precast concrete post tensioned bridges with total length between 350′ to 600′. may be stressed from one end or both ends if greater friction losses due to vertical or horizontal curvature are justified by the designer.
• All CIP or precast concrete bridges with total length of greater than 600′ shall be stressed from both ends. When stressing tendons from both ends or when alternating a single pull from both ends (half tendons pulled from one end with the other half pulled from the other end), all tendons shall be stressed on one end before all tendons are stressed on the opposite end. Stressing at both ends shall preferably be done on alternate tendons, and need not be done simultaneously on the same tendon. In rare cases, tendons can be stressed from both ends to reduce large tendon losses but is undesirable due to worker safety issues and a reduction in stressing redundancy.

Accurate plotting of steel stress variation due to local curvature is normally not necessary, and straight lines between intersection points on the diagram as shown in Figure 5.8.3-1 are usually sufficient. When tendons are continuous through the length of the bridge, the stress for design purposes at the jacked end should be limited to 0.79ƒpu or 213 ksi for 270 ksi low relaxation strands. This would permit the post-tensioning contractor to jack to the slightly higher value of 0.81ƒpu for low relaxation strands as allowed by the AASHTO LRFD Specifications in case friction values encountered in the field turn out somewhat greater than the standard values used in design. Stress loss at jacked end shall be calculated from the assumed anchor set of ⅜″, the normal slippage during anchoring Stress Diagram for a 2-span PT Bridge in most systems. At the high points on the initial stress curve, the stress shall not exceed Figure 5.8.3-1 0.74ƒpu for low relaxation strands after seating of the anchorage. If these values are exceeded, the jacking stress can be lowered or alternately the specified amount of anchor set can be increased. When the total tendon length (L) is less than the length of cable influenced by anchor set (x) and the friction loss is small, as in short straight tendons, the 0.70ƒpu value at the anchorage immediately after anchor set governs. In these cases, the allowable jacking stress value at the anchorage cannot be used and a slightly lower value shall be specified. In single-span, simply supported superstructures friction losses are so small that jacking from both ends is normally not warranted. In the longer multispan bridges where the Page 5-146
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
tendons experience greater friction losses, jacking from both ends will usually be necessary. Jacking at both ends need not be done simultaneously, since final results are virtually the same whether or not the jacking is simultaneous. If unsymmetrical two-span structures are to be jacked from one end only, the jacking must be done from the end of the longest span. In the absence of experimental data, the friction coefficient for post-tensioning tendons in rigid and semi-rigid galvanized metal sheathing shall be taken as shown in Table 5.8.3-1. For tendon lengths greater than 1,000 feet, investigation is warranted on current field data of similar length bridges for appropriate values of µ. In the absence of experimental data, the friction coefficient for post-tensioning tendons in polyethylene ducts shall be taken as shown in the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. Table 5.8.3-1

Flexural Stress in Concrete
Stress at service load levels in the top and bottom fibers of prestressed members shall be checked for at least two conditions that will occur in the lifetime of the members. The initial condition occurs just after the transfer of prestress when the concrete is relatively fresh and the member is carrying its own dead load. The final condition occurs after all the prestress losses when the concrete has gained its full ultimate strength and the member is carrying dead load and live load. For certain bridges, other intermediate loading conditions may have to be checked, such as when prestressing and false­work release are done in stages and when special construction loads have to be carried, etc. The concrete stresses shall be within the AASHTO LRFD Specification allowable except as amended in Section 5.2.1. In single-span simply supported superstructures with parabolic tendon paths, flexural stresses at service load levels need to be investigated at the span midpoint where moments are maximum, at points where the cross-section changes, and near the span ends where shear stress is likely to be maximum (see Section 5.8.4 Shear). For tendon paths other than parabolic, flexural stress shall be investigated at other points in the span as well. In multispan continuous superstructures, investigate flexural stress at points of maximum moment (in the negative moment region of box girders, check at the quarter point of the crossbeam), at points where the cross section changes, and at points where shear is likely to be maximum. Normally, mild steel should not be used to supplement the ultimate moment capacity. It may be necessary, however, to determine the partial temperature and shrinkage stresses that occur prior to post-tensioning and supply mild steel reinforcing for this condition. In addition, maximum and minimum steel percentages and cracking moment shall be checked. See Section 2.3.8 of Reference 17. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Prestress Moment Curves
5.8.3.F.1
Single-Span Bridges, Simply Supported
The primary prestress moment curve is developed by multiplying the initial steel stress curve ordinates by the area of prestressing steel times the eccentricity of steel from the center of gravity of the concrete section at every tenth point in the span. The primary prestress moment curve is not necessary for calculating concrete stresses in single-span simply supported bridges. Since there is no secondary prestress moment developed in the span of a single span, simply supported bridge which is free to shorten, the primary prestress moment curve is equal to the total prestress moment curve in the span. However, if the single span is rigidly framed to supporting piers, the effect of elastic shortening shall be calculated. The same would be true when unexpected high friction is developed in bearings during or after construction. 5.8.3.F.2
Multispan Continuous Bridges
Designers shall take into account the elastic shortening of the superstructure due to prestressing. To obtain the total prestress moment curve used to check concrete stresses, the primary and secondary prestress moment curves must be added algebraically at all points in the spans. As the secondary moment can have a large absolute value in some structures, it is very important to obtain the proper sign for this moment, or a serious error could result. 5.8.3.G
Partial prestressing
Partial prestressing is not allowed in WSDOT bridge designs. However, mild reinforcement could be added to satisfy the ultimate flexural capacity under factored loads if the following requirements are satisfied:
5.8.4
1.
Stress limits, as specified in this manual for Service-I and Service-III limit states, shall be satisfied with post-tensioning only. The zero-tension policy remains unchanged.
2.
Additional mild reinforcement could be used if the ultimate flexural capacity cannot be met with the prestressing provided for service load combinations. The mild reinforcement is filling the gap between the service load and ultimate load requirements. This should be a very small amount of mild reinforcement since adequate post-tensioning is already provided to satisfy the service load requirement for dead load and live loads.
3.
If mild reinforcement is added, the resistance factor for flexural design shall be adjusted in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.5.4.2 to account for the effect of partial prestressing. The section will still be considered uncracked and requirements for crack control, and side skin reinforcement do not apply.
Shear and Anchorages 5.8.4.A
Shear Capacity
Concrete box girder and T-beam bridges with horizontal construction joints (which result from webs and slabs being cast at different times) shall be checked for both vertical and horizontal shear capacity. Generally, horizontal shear requirements will control the stirrup design.
Page 5-148
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
Vertical concrete shear capacity for prestressed or post-tensioned structural members is calculated in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.7.3. Minimum stirrup area and maximum stirrup spacing are subject to the limitations presented in AASHTO LRFD Sections 5.7.2.5 and 5.7.2.6. For further explanation, refer to Section 11.4 of the ACI 318-02 Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete and Commentary. Chapter 27 of Notes on ACI 318-02 Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete with Design Applications presents two excellent example problems for vertical shear design. 5.8.4.B
Horizontal Shear
Horizontal shear stress acts over the contact area between two interconnected surfaces of a composite structural member. AASHTO LRFD Section 5.7.4 shall be used for shearfriction design. 5.8.4.C
End Block Stresses
The highly concentrated forces at the end anchorages cause bursting and spalling stresses in the concrete which must be resisted by reinforcement. For a better understanding of this subject, see Chapter 7 of Reference18 and 19, and Section 2.82 of Reference17. Note that the procedures for computing horizontal bursting and spalling steel in the slabs of box girders and T-beams are similar to those required for computing vertical steel in girder webs, except that the slab steel is figured in a horizontal instead of a vertical plane. In box girders, this slab steel should be placed half in the top slab and half in the bottom slab. The anchorage zones of slab bridges will require vertical stirrups as well as additional horizontal transverse bars extending across the width of the bridge. The horizontal spalling and bursting steel in slab bridges shall be placed half in a top layer and half in a bottom layer.
5.8.5
Temperature Effects Most specifications for massive bridges call for a verification of stresses under uniform temperature changes of the total bridge superstructure. Stresses due to temperature unevenly distributed within the cross-section are not generally verified. In reality, however, considerable temperature gradients are set up within the cross-section of superstructures. Such temperature differences are mostly of a very complex nature, depending on the type of cross-section and direction of solar radiation 20. Solar radiation produces uniform heating of the upper surface of a bridge superstructure which is greater than that of the lower surface. An inverse temperature gradient with higher temperatures at the lower surface occurs rarely and involves much smaller temperature differences. In statically indeterminate continuous bridge beams, a temperature rise at the upper surface produces positive flexural moments which cause tensile stresses in the bottom fibers. When the temperature gradient is constant over the entire length of a continuous beam superstructure, positive flexural moments are induced in all spans. These moments are of equal constant magnitude in the interior spans and decrease linearly to zero in the end spans. The most critical zones are those which have the lowest compressive stress reserve in the bottom fibers under prestress plus dead load. Normally, these are the zones near the interior supports where additional tensile stresses develop in the bottom fibers due to
• A concentrated support reaction, and
• Insufficient curvature of prestressed reinforcement.

Concrete Structures
Studies have shown that temperature is the most important tension-producing factor, especially in two-span continuous beams in the vicinity of intermediate supports, even when the temperature difference is only 10°C between the deck and bottom of the beam. In practice, a box girder can exhibit a ΔT=30°C. The zone at a distance of about 0.3 to 2.0d on either side of the intermediate support proved to be particularly crack-prone. Uniform temperature loads (TU) as well thermal gradients loads (TG) shall be considered in design.
5.8.6
Construction 5.8.6.A
General
Construction plans for conventional post-tensioned box girder bridges include two different sets of drawings. The first set (contract plans) is prepared by the design engineer and the second set (shop plans) is prepared by the post-tensioning materials supplier (contractor). 5.8.6.B
Contract Plans
The contract plans shall be prepared to accommodate several post-tensioning systems, so only prestressing forces and eccentricity should be detailed. The concrete sections shall be detailed so that available systems can be installed. Design the thickness of webs and flanges to facilitate concrete placement. Generally, web thickness for post-tensioned bridges shall be as described in Section 5.8.1.B. See Section 5.8.7 for design information to be included in the contract plan post-tensioning notes. 5.8.6.C
Shop Plans
The shop plans are used to detail, install, and stress the post-tensioning system selected by the Contractor. These plans must contain sufficient information to allow the engineer to check their compliance with the contract plans. These plans must also contain the location of anchorages, stressing data, and arrangement of tendons. 5.8.6.D
Review of Post-tensioning Installation Drawings
Post-tensioning installation drawings shall be reviewed by the designer (or Bridge Technical Advisor) and consulted with the Concrete Specialist if needed. Review of the drawings shall verify that the plans, specifications, applicable PTI requirements, and design assumptions are satisfied. The PTI requirements include a detailed list of most of the required items. Reviewers should pay special attention to the following:
Page 5-150
1.
Ensure that the special anchorage device test reports for post-tensioning anchorages are included, and that the tendon drawing details for post-tensioning anchorage local zones are validated by the tested anchorage configuration (i.e. minimum spacing, edge distance, and concrete strength) shown in the test reports.
2.
Ensure that the layout of the post-tensioning anchorages is consistent with the design of the general zone reinforcing. If not, either the anchorage layout or general zone may need to be revised.
3.
Ensure than tendon vents and drains are properly located and oriented.

During Construction
1.
In case of low concrete strength, the design engineer should investigate the adequacy of the design with lower strength if they suspect repairs may be avoidable.
2.
If the measured elongation of a strand tendon is within ± 7 percent of the approved calculated elongation, the stressed tendon is acceptable. For tendons shorter than 40 ft, if the measured elongation is within ± 7 percent + ¼ inch, the stressed tendon is acceptable.
3.
If the measured elongation is greater than the allowable range, anchorage force verification after seating (lift-off force) should be performed. The lift-off force should not be less than 99 percent of the approved calculated force nor more than 70% ƒpu As.
4.
If the measured elongation is less than the allowable range, anchorage force verification of the fixed-end anchorage should be performed. The designer could consider acceptance where the total prestressing force in a web, girder, or even bridge cross-section is greater than 98% of the design prestressing force.
5.
One broken strand per tendon may be structurally acceptable. (Post-tensioning design shall preferably allow one broken strand). If more than one strand per tendon is broken, the designed should consider the ability of the other tendons in the structure to provide prestressing and strength.
6.
Other problems such as unbalanced and out of sequence post-tensioning, strand surface condition, strand subjected to corrosion and exposure, delayed posttensioning, jack calibration, etc. should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in coordination with the contractor, post-tensioning system supplier, HQ Bridge Construction Office, and the Engineer of Record.
Post-tensioning Notes Contract Plans 5.8.7.A
Plan Details
The Plans for post-tensioned concrete shall include a longitudinal section showing the vertical profile of the center-of-gravity of the prestressing force, camber diagram for dead load plus prestress force, and the post-tensioning notes as suggested in Section 5.8.7.B. The following information shall typically be included in a post-tensioning table on a per-web basis: minimum required concrete strengths at the time of stressing, minimum number of strands required, jacking load, anchorage load after seating, and long term prestress losses.

Spliced Prestressed Concrete Girders
5.9.1
Definitions
Chapter 5
The provisions herein apply to precast girders fabricated in segments that are spliced longitudinally to form the girders in the final structure. The cross-section for this type of bridge is typically composed of wide flange I girders or trapezoidal tub girders with a composite CIP deck. WSDOT Bridge and Structure office’s standard drawings for spliced I-girders are as shown on the Bridge Standard Drawings website (www.wsdot.wa.gov/ Bridge/Structures/StandardDrawings.htm). Span capabilities of spliced prestressed concrete girders are shown in Appendices 5.6-A1-8 for I girders and 5.6-A1-9 for trapezoidal tub girders. Prestressed concrete wide flange deck girder or deck bulb tee girder bridges may also be fabricated in segments and spliced longitudinally. Splicing in this type of girder may be beneficial because the significant weight of the cross-section may exceed usual limits for handling and transportation. Spliced structures of this type, which have longitudinal joints in the deck between each deck girder, shall comply with the additional requirements of AASHTO LRFD Section 5.12.2.3. Spliced prestressed concrete girder bridges may be distinguished from what is referred to as “segmental construction” in bridge specifications by several features which typically include:
• The lengths of some or all segments in a bridge are a significant fraction of the span length rather than having a large number of segments in each span.
• Design of joints between girder segments at the service limit state does not typically govern the design for the entire length of the bridge for either construction or for the completed structure.
• 2’-0” minimum CIP concrete closures are required for connecting spliced girder segments, where segmental bridge segments are often joined with epoxy in matchcast joints.
• The bridge cross-section is composed of girders with a CIP concrete composite deck rather than precasting the full width and depth of the superstructure as one piece. In some cases, the deck may be integrally cast with each girder. Connecting the girders across the longitudinal joints completes a bridge of this type.
• Girder sections are used, such as bulb tee, deck bulb tee or tub girders, rather than closed cell boxes with wide monolithic flanges.
• Provisional ducts are required for segmental construction to provide for possible adjustment of prestress force during construction. Similar requirements are not given for spliced prestressed concrete girder bridges because of the redundancy provided by a greater number of webs and tendons, and typically lower friction losses because of fewer joint locations.
5.9.2
WSDOT Criteria for Use of Spliced Girders See Section 5.6.3.D.3 for criteria on providing an alternate spliced-girder design for long span one-piece pre-tensioned girders.

Girder Segment Design 5.9.3.A
Design Considerations
Stress limits for temporary concrete stresses in girder segments specified in Section 5.2.1C shall apply at each stage of pretensioning or posttensioning. The concrete strength at release and initial lifting shall be f’ci and at the time the post-tensioning is applied shall be f’c in the stress limits. Stress limits for final concrete stresses at the service load in girder segments as specified in Section 5.2.1C shall apply for intermediate load stages with the concrete strength at the time of loading shall be f’c in the stress limits. All supports required prior to the splicing of the girder shall be shown on the contract documents, including elevations and reactions. The stage of construction during which the temporary supports are removed shall also be shown on the contract documents. Stresses computations shall account for changes in the structural system, in particular the effects of the application of load to one structural system and its removal from a different structural system. Redistribution of such stresses by creep shall be taken into account and allowance shall be made for possible variations in the creep rate and magnitude. Prestress losses in spliced prestressed concrete girder bridges shall be estimated using the provisions of Section 5.1.4. The effects of combined pretensioning and post-tensioning and staged post-tensioning shall be considered. When required, the effects of creep and shrinkage in spliced prestressed concrete girder bridges shall be estimated using the provisions of Section 5.1.1. The designer shall consider requirements for bracing of the girder segments once they have been erected. Any requirements for bracing during subsequent stages of construction that the contractor needs to design shall be specified in the contract documents. 5.9.3.B
Post-tensioning
Longitudinal post-tensioning may be applied with the following considerations:
Page 5-154
1.
Post-tensioning precast segments in their final position before deck casting. This option is recommended by WSDOT for all spliced girder bridges. This option may require higher concrete compressive stress at CIP closures. But this option is more suitable for future deck repairs and deck replacement since the deck is not prestressed.
2.
Post-tensioning girder line segments before erecting girders. Handling and shipping of spliced girders with segments post-tensioned prior to erection requires larger cranes and more staging area. This option may be used in some cases where the use of temporary support at the bridge site is not feasible.
3.
Post-tensioning after deck casting. This option require lower concrete compressive stress at CIP closure. This option complicates future deck repairs and deck replacements since the deck is prestressed.
4.
Two stage post-tensioning where girders are post-tensioned separately for dead load in the first stage, followed by post-tensioning the entire superstructure in a second stage after deck placement.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
Designers shall investigate the required concrete compressive strength at the CIP closures. Achieving high strength concrete for CIP closures may be challenging in some locations. Ducts for longitudinal post-tensioning shall be kept below the bridge deck, and ideally below the top of web when they could be exposed to damage during construction. Effects of curved tendons shall be considered in accordance with Section 5.8.1.F. All post-tensioning tendons shall be fully grouted after stressing. For construction cases prior to grouting posttensioning ducts, cross-section properties shall be reduced by deducting the area of ducts and void areas around tendon couplers. Where some or all post-tensioning is applied after the bridge deck concrete is placed, fewer posttensioning tendons and a lower concrete strength in the closure joint may be required. However, deck replacement, if necessary, is difficult to accommodate with this construction sequence. Where all of the post-tensioning is applied before the deck concrete is placed, a greater number of post tensioning tendons and a higher concrete strength in the closure joint may be required. However, in this case, the deck can be replaced if necessary.
5.9.4
Joints Between Segments 5.9.4.A
General
Cast-in-place closure joints are typically used in spliced girder construction. The sequence of placing concrete for the closure joints and bridge deck shall be specified in the contract documents. Match-cast joints shall not be specified for spliced girder bridges unless approved by the Bridge Design Engineer. Prestress, dead load, and creep effects may cause rotation of the faces of the match-cast joints prior to splicing. If match cast joint is specified, the procedures for splicing the girder segments that overcome this rotation to close the match-cast joint shall be shown on the contract plans. 5.9.4.B
Location of Closure Joints
The location of intermediate diaphragms shall be offset by at least 2′-0″ from the edge of cast‑in‑place closure joints. In horizontally curved spliced girder bridges, intermediate diaphragms could be located at the CIP closure joints if straight segments are spliced with deflection points at closures. In this case, the diaphragm should be extended beyond the face of the exterior girder for improved development of diaphragm reinforcement. The final configuration of the closures shall be coordinated with the State Bridge and Structures Architect on all highly visible bridges, such as bridges over vehicular or pedestrian traffic.

Concrete Structures
5.9.4.C
Details of Closure Joints
The length of a closure joint between concrete segments shall allow for the splicing of steel whose continuity is required by design considerations and the accommodation of the splicing of post‑tensioning ducts. The length of a closure joint shall not be less than 2′-0″. A longer closure joint may be used to provide more room to accommodate tolerances for potential misalignment of ducts within girder segments and misalignment of girder segments at erection. Web reinforcement within the joint shall be the larger of that in the adjacent girders. The face of the segments at closure joints shall be specified as intentionally roughened surface or use a sawtooth pattern. Concrete cover to web stirrups at the CIP closures of pier diaphragms shall not be less than 2½″. If intermediate diaphragm locations coincide with CIP closures between segments, then the concrete cover at the CIP closures shall not be less than 2½″. This increase in concrete cover is not necessary if intermediate diaphragm locations are away from the CIP closures. See Figures 5.9.4-1 to 5.9.4-3 for details of closure joints. Adequate reinforcement shall be provided to confine tendons at CIP closures and at intermediate pier diaphragms. The reinforcement shall be proportioned to ensure that the steel stress during the jacking operation does not exceed 0.6fy. The clear spacing between the outside diameter of ducts at CIP closures of pier diaphragms shall be 2.0″ minimum. On the construction sequence sheet indicate that the side forms at the CIP closures and intermediate pier diaphragms shall be removed to inspect for concrete consolidation prior to post-tensioning and grouting. Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) may be used for CIP closures. 5.9.4.D
Joint Design
Stress limits for temporary concrete stresses in joints before losses specified in Section 5.2.1.C shall apply at each stage of post-tensioning. The concrete strength at the time the stage of post-tensioning is applied shall be substituted for ƒ′ci in the stress limits. Stress limits for concrete stresses in joints at the service limit state after losses specified in Section 5.2.1.C shall apply. These stress limits shall also apply for intermediate load stages, with the concrete strength at the time of loading substituted for ƒ′c in the stress limits. The compressive strength of the closure joint concrete at a specified age shall be compatible with design stress limitations.

6.0.1
Introduction This chapter primarily covers design and construction of steel plate and box girder bridge superstructures. Because of their limited application, other types of steel superstructures (truss, arch, cable stayed, suspension, etc.) are not addressed except as it relates to retrofit of truss sway and portal frames and for painting of existing steel trusses. Plate girder bridges are commonly used for river crossings and curved interchange ramps. Typical span lengths range from 150 to 300 feet. Steel girders are also being used where limited vertical clearance requires shallow superstructure depth. They may be set over busy highway lanes with a minimum of disruption and falsework, similar to precast concrete elements. Longitudinal launching of steel framing and transverse rolling of completed steel structures has been done successfully. English units are the current standard for detailing. Widening or rehabilitation plan units should be consistent with the original.
6.0.2
Special Requirements for Steel Bridge Rehabilitation or Modification As part of steel bridge rehabilitation or modification, calculations shall be made to demonstrate the adequacy of existing members and connections, with special attention given to fracture critical components such as truss gusset plates. When structural modifications or other alterations result in significant changes in stress level, deficiencies shall also be corrected. A thorough survey of impacted components shall be made to determine section loss due to corrosion or prior modification.
6.0.3
Retrofit of Low Vertical Clearance Truss Portal and Sway Members A WSDOT internal study and subsequent report titled “Low Vertical Clearance Truss Bridges: Risk Assessment and Retrofit Mitigation Study” completed in November, 2017 identifies all the trusses on the WSDOT inventory with vertical clearances less than the current minimum of 16’-6”. The report prioritizes the over 60 trusses with substandard vertical clearance for potential retrofit and provides scoping level project cost estimates. The goal is to eventually procure a funding source to gradually begin to retrofit the most vulnerable structures that have the highest risk of being struck with an over-height vehicle causing damage to the structure. Previous over-height vehicle impacts have caused damage ranging from minor distortion of members to as severe as a total collapse similar to the SR 5/712 Skagit River Bridge in 2013. When through-truss type structures are programed for maintenance, painting, structural retrofit, or barrier/railing rehabilitation projects, the designer should reference the previously mentioned report to determine if the structure is a high priority for consideration of a portal and/or sway raising retrofit. If the structure is in the Priority Group 1 or 2 categories, inquiries should be made with the Region Project Office, the Bridge Asset Management Engineer, and the Steel Specialist to determine if a portal and/ or sway retrofit should be added to the project.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 6-1
Chapter 6
Structural Steel
Most existing through-truss structures have portal and sway members that form a parabolic shape, where the vertical clearance at the centerline of the bridge is higher than at the left and right truss lines where the portals and sways connect to the main truss members. When a portal and/or sway retrofit is to be performed, a typical retrofit is to remove the entire parabolic portal or sway member, modify the secondary members attached to the portal or sway, and install a new beam with a straight horizontal profile. Alternatively, and because the portal or sway members often have sufficient clearance for a portion of the length, the members can be cut at the 16’-6” height and a short member added to each side in a straight horizontal profile. Examples of each one of these retrofit schemes is shown in Figures 6.0.3-1 and 6.0.3-2, respectively.

When a portal raising retrofit is being performed, the designer will need to check the end posts on the truss to determine if strengthening of these highly loaded compression members is required. The horizontal portal member acts as a brace point for the end post. The capacity of the member is reduced due to an increase in the unbraced length. When the portal is raised, the distance from the bottom chord connection point to the portal horizontal connection to the end post is increased, thus increasing the unbraced length. In most instances, the end posts are strengthened by adding side plates to the member. These are typically bolted on, but have also been field welded in the past. A relatively straight forward analysis method for determining the end post retrofit needs is to analyze the existing portal frame with a 2-D model in its existing condition. A unit load can be applied to the upper panel point of the portal frame and a displacement determined. The same analysis is then performed with the portal horizontal member in its raised condition. The section of the end post can be increased by adding steel plate until the deflections for the applied load are the same. The applied load can be the actual calculated lateral wind or seismic load or just a nominal load. This is a relative stiffness comparison analysis so the exact load is not critical. In most cases the boundary conditions for the bottom of the end post can be considered pinned. A more rigorous 3-D analysis with actual wind and seismic loads can always be performed, especially if 3-D models are available due to other retrofit needs. In addition to the lateral analysis of the end posts, the compressive capacity shall also be analyzed and verified to be sufficient in the final condition and during any construction conditions. The construction condition is particularly important if live load will remain on the structure while the existing portal is removed. In this case the unbraced length will be at its longest length (panel point to panel point) and needs to be analyzed to be structurally sufficient during the interim construction conditions. Temporary horizontal bracing has been utilized in the past to provide a temporary brace point on the end post after the existing portal is removed and prior to installation of the new. The designer should also consider how many portal and/or sway members can be worked on at the same time during construction. In most cases, traffic will still be on the structure during the retrofit project. The stability of the truss must be maintained at all times. Previous retrofit projects determined that requiring every other sway member to remain in place during a retrofit project was sufficient. A 3-D model will likely be required to determine the number of portal and sway members that can be removed at one time. The Bridge Architect and the Region Project Office shall also be consulted during any portal and sway raising projects. Many of the existing trusses are old enough to be on the historic register and changing any visual appearance of the structure may require additional permits or approvals.

WSDOT Steel Bridge Practice Unshored, composite construction is used for most plate girder and box girder bridges. Shear connectors are placed throughout positive and negative moment regions, for full composite behavior. A minimum of one percent longitudinal deck steel, in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Article 6.10.1.7, shall be placed in negative moment regions to ensure adequate deck performance. Additionally, due to cracking observed in some positive moment regions on some recent steel girder structures, the one percent longitudinal deck steel is required to be placed the full length of the bridge. For service level stiffness analysis, such as calculating live load moment envelopes, the bridge deck shall be considered composite and uncracked for the entire bridge length, provided the above methods are used. For negative moment at strength limit states, the bridge deck shall be ignored while reinforcing steel is included for stress and section property calculations. Where span arrangement is not well balanced, these assumptions may not apply. Plastic design may be utilized as permitted in the AASTHO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications.

Currently, economical design requires simplified fabrication with less emphasis on weight reduction. The number of plate thicknesses and splices should be minimized. Also, the use of fewer girder lines, spaced at a maximum of about 14 to 16 feet, saves on fabrication, shipping, painting, and future inspection. Widely spaced girders will have heavier flanges, hence, greater stability during construction. Normally, eliminating a girder line will not require thickening remaining webs or increasing girder depth. The increased shear requirement can be met with a modest addition of web stiffeners or slightly thicker webs at interior piers. For moderate to long spans, partially stiffened web design is the most economical. This method is a compromise between slender webs requiring transverse stiffening throughout and thicker, unstiffened webs. Stiffeners used to connect cross frames shall be welded to top and bottom flanges. Jacking stiffeners shall be used adjacent to bearing stiffeners, on girder or diaphragm webs, in order to accommodate future bearing replacement. If solid diaphragms (I-sections) are used at piers and designed for jacking, sufficient access shall be provided for form removal behind the diaphragm. For plate girders, the diaphragm shall be at least 0.75 of the girder depth. Coordinate jack placement in substructure and girder details. Verify bearing stiffener locations are placed such that jacks can be installed, girders raised, and bearings removed. Proper access should be provided to permit the bearings to be removed and replaced in the future. Steel framing shall consist of main girders and cross frames. Bottom lateral systems shall only be used when temporary bracing is not practical. Where lateral systems are needed, they shall be detailed carefully for adequate fatigue life. Standard corrosion protection for steel bridges is the Standard Specifications four-coat paint system west of the Cascades and where paint is required for appearance. Unpainted weathering steel shall only be used east of the Cascades. WSDOT does not allow the use of steel stay-in-place deck forms.
6.1.3
Preliminary Girder Proportioning The superstructure depth is initially determined during preliminary plan development and is based upon the span/depth ratios provided in Chapter 2. The depth may be reduced to gain vertical clearance, but the designer should verify live load deflection requirements are met. See AASHTO LRFD Table 2.5.2.6.3-1. Live load deflections shall be limited in accordance with the optional criteria of AASHTO LRFD Articles 2.5.2.6.2 and 3.6.1.3.2. The superstructure depth is typically shown as the distance from the top of the bridge deck to the bottom of the web. Web depths are generally detailed in multiples of 6 inches. On straight bridges, interior and exterior girders shall be detailed as identical. Spacing should be such that the distribution of wheel loads on the exterior girder is close to that of the interior girder. The number of girder lines should be minimized, with a maximum spacing of 14–16 feet. Steel bridges shall be redundant, with three or more girders lines for I-girders and two or more boxes for box girders, except as otherwise approved by the Steel Specialist and Bridge Design Engineer.

Estimating Structural Steel Weights For the preliminary quantities or preliminary girder design, an estimate of steel weights for built-up plate composite I-girders can be obtained from Figure 6.1.4-1. This figure is based upon previous designs with AASHTO HS-20 live loads with no distinction between service load designs and load factor designs. This chart also provides a good double check on final quantities. The weights shown include webs, flanges, and all secondary members (web stiffeners, diaphragms, cross frame, lateral systems, and gusset plates) plus a small allowance for weld metal, bolts, and shear connectors. Both straight and curved box girder quantities may be estimated with the chart, using a 10 to 20 percent increase. The chart should only be used for a lower bound estimate of curved I-girder weight. Roadway width and curvature greatly influence girder weight, including cross frames. An additional resource for estimating structural steel weights is the NSBA Steel Span Weight Curves published in 2016, which can be obtained off of their website. Figure 6.1.4-1

Bridge Steels Use AASHTO M 270/ASTM A 709 grades 50 or 50W for plate girders and box girders. AASHTO M 270 grades HPS70W and HPS100W may only be used if allowed by the Bridge Design Engineer. HPS70W can be economical if used selectively in a hybrid design. For moderate spans HPS70W could be considered for the bottom flanges throughout and top flanges near interior piers. HPS 50W is no longer readily available and should be avoided. For wide flange beams, use AASHTO M 270/ASTM A 709 Grade 50S or ASTM A 992. For ancillary members such as expansion joint headers, utility brackets, bearing components or small quantities of tees, channels, and angles, ASTM M 270/ASTM A 709 bridge steels are acceptable but are not required. In these cases, equivalent ASTM designated steels may be used.

*Minimum yield strength is 90 ksi for plate thickness greater than 2½″.
A 992 or 50S steel is most commonly available in W shapes but is also available in other rolled sections including beams (S and M shapes), H-piles, and tees cut from W-shapes. Channels and angles are not readily available in ASTM A992. Angles are often more available in thicknesses that are not an increment of 1/16”. For example, if a 5/16” thickness is required for design, it would be appropriate to increase to 3/8” for availability considerations. All the materials in the table are prequalified under the Bridge Welding Code. All main load-carrying members or components subject to tensile stress shall be identified in the plans and shall meet the minimum Charpy V-notch (CVN) fracture toughness values as specified in AASHTO LRFD Table 6.6.2.1-2, temperature zone 2. Fracture critical members or components shall also be designated in the plans. Availability of weathering steel can be a problem for some sections. For example, steel suppliers do not stock angles or channels in weathering steel. Weathering steel wide flange and tee sections are difficult to locate or require a mill order. A mill order is roughly 10,000 pounds. ASTM A 709 and AASHTO M 270 bridge steels are not typically stocked by local service centers. The use of bridge steel should be restricted to large quantities such as found in typical plate or box girder projects. The older ASTM specification steels, such as A 36 or A 572, should be specified when a fabricator would be expected to purchase from local service centers. Structural tubes and pipes are covered by other specifications. See the latest edition of the AISC Manual of Steel Construction for selection and availability. These materials are not considered prequalified under the Bridge Welding Code. They are covered under the Structural Welding Code AWS D1.1. Structural tubing ASTM A 500 shall not be used for dynamic loading applications. ASTM A 1085 is a newer cold formed and welded HSS section specification that is a Gr 50 steel. Supplements for heat treating and CVNs are included and may also be specified. CVN tests are typically performed in the flats of the HSS square or rectangular tube sections. CVN values in the bend radius of the tubes may be lower than values obtained in the flats, however recent informational testing has shown the CVN values in the corners meet or exceeds the requirements for FCM steels in temperature zone 2. Heat treating of the sections can improve the values, but no data is currently available. ASTM A 1085 should not be specified for dynamic loading applications until further data is available. The designer should check with suppliers to ensure the size and quantities are readily available. In some cases minimum tonnage or bundle quantities is required in order to obtain HSS sections in ASTM A 1085. Consult with the Steel Specialist for more information.

Plate Sizes Readily available lengths and thicknesses of steel plates should be used to minimize costs. Tables of standard plate sizes have been published by various steel mills and should be used for guidance. These tables are available through the Steel Specialist or online. In general, an individual plate should not exceed 12′-6″ feet in width, including camber requirements, or a length of about 60 feet. If either or both of these dimensions are exceeded, a butt splice is required and should be shown or specified on the plans. Some plates may be available in lengths over 90 feet, so web splice locations should be considered optional. Quenched and tempered plates are limited to 50 feet, based on oven size. Plate thicknesses of less than 5/16 inches shall not be used for bridge applications. Preferred plate thicknesses, English units, are as follows:
• 5/16″ to ⅞″ in 1/16″ increments
• ⅞″ to 1¼″ in ⅛″ increments
• 1¼″ to 4″ in ¼″ increments
6.1.7
Girder Segment Sizes Locate bolted field splices so that individual girder segments can be handled, shipped, and erected without imposing unreasonable requirements on the contractor. Crane limitations need to be considered in congested areas near traffic or buildings. Transportation route options between the girder fabricator and the bridge site can affect the size and weight of girder sections allowed. Underpasses with restricted vertical clearance in sag vertical curves can be obstructions to long, tall segments shipped upright. The Region Project Office should help determine the possible routes, and the restrictions they impose, during preliminary planning or early in the design phase. Local heavy haul trucking companies can also be consulted to help determine girder shipping segment lengths and depths. Contact the Steel Specialist for more information. Segment lengths should be limited to 150 feet, depending upon cross section. Long, slender segments can be difficult to handle and ship due to their flexibility. Horizontal curvature of girder segments may increase handling and shipping concerns. Out-to-out width of curved segments, especially box girders, should not exceed 14 feet without additional travel permits and requirements. Weight is seldom a controlling factor for I-girders. However, 40 tons is a practical limit for some fabricators. Limit weight to a maximum of 100 tons if delivery by truck is anticipated. Consider the structure’s span length and the above factors when determining girder segment lengths. In general, field splices should be located at dead load inflection points. When spans are short enough, some field splices can be designated optional if resulting segment lengths and weights meet the shipping criteria.

Computer Programs The designer should consult the Steel Specialist to determine the computer program best suited for a particular bridge type. Office practice and good engineering principles require that the results of any computer program or analysis be independently verified for accuracy. Also, programs with built-in code checks must be checked for default settings. Default settings may reflect old code or office practice may supersede the code that the program was written for.

ASTM F 3125 GR A325 & GR F1852
High strength steel, headed bolts for use in structural joints. These bolts may be hot-dip galvanized in accordance with ASTM F2329 or mechanically galvanized in accordance with ASTM B695 – Class 55. For painted structures, WSDOT’s current policy is to require galvanized bolts for structures that are painted to avoid the need for blasting and priming of black bolts after erection of the steel in the field. The Standard Specifications provides requirements for surface preparation and painting of galvanized bolts. Do not specify for anchor bolts. Galvanized GR F1852 “Twist-Off” style bolts are not permitted on WSDOT structures. A recent change to the ASTM F3125 specification allows for alternate dimensions such as modified head geometry or special thread lengths. The modified head geometry would include countersunk heads, which previously needed to be specified as ASTM A449. The engineer shall specify Supplement S2 when requiring alternate dimensions.

ASTM A449
High strength steel bolts and studs for general applications including anchor bolts. Recommended for use where strengths equivalent to ASTM F 3125 GR A325 bolts are desired but custom geometry or lengths are required. Strengths for ASTM A 449 bolts are equivalent to GR A325 up to 1” diameter. If using bolts of larger diameter, a reduction in strength as indicated in the previous table shall be accounted for. These bolts may be hotdip galvanized. Do not use these as anchor bolts for seismic applications due to low CVN impact toughness. 6.1.9.C
F1554 – Grade 105
Higher strength anchor bolts to be used for larger sizes (1½″ to 4″). When used in seismic applications, such as bridge bearings that resist lateral loads, specify supplemental CVN requirement S4 with a test temperature of -20°F. Lower grades may also be suitable for sign structure foundations. This specification should also be considered for seismic restrainer rods, and may be galvanized. The equivalent AASHTO M 314 shall not be specified as it doesn’t include the CVN supplemental requirements. 6.1.9.D
ASTM F 3125 GR A490 & GR F2280
High strength alloy steel, headed bolts for use in structural joints. These bolts should not be hot dip galvanized, because of the high susceptibility to hydrogen embrittlement. In lieu of galvanizing, the application of an approved zinc rich paint may be specified. Other coating applications are available and are specified in ASTM F3125. The Steel Specialist shall be consulted prior to specifying one of the alternative coatings. Do not specify for anchor bolts. Only uncoated GR F2280 “Twist-Off” bolts are permitted on WSDOT structures. 6.1.9.E
A354–Grade BD
High strength alloy steel bolts and studs. These are suitable for anchor bolts where strengths equal to ASTM F 3125 GR A490 bolts are desired. These bolts should not be hot dip galvanized. If used in seismic applications, specify minimum CVN toughness of 25 ft-lb at 40°F.
6.1.10
Bending Steel It is often necessary to bend steel plate or members for use in the final configuration. This is common for sign brackets or bridge and architectural railings. In researching bending and rolling facilities, the minimum size bending radius for 2-inch to 6-inch diameter, schedule 40 or 80 pipe is 3 times the diameter, 3D. The measurement is taken to the centerline of the pipe. Some facilities may not be able to bend to this tight of a radius so specifying 4D or 5D is preferable. When bending square tubes in the 2 to 4-inch range, a 12-inch inside radius should be used as a minimum, with larger radius being preferred. When bends to larger diameter members, square or rectangular tubes, or rolled shapes (I-beams, angles and channels) is required, the designer should contact bend and roll facilities to verify capabilities. Consult with the Steel Specialist for additional information.

Chapter 6
Structural Steel
Bending of AASTHO M270 (ASTM A709) bridge steel may be necessary for haunched girders or the dapped ends of girders. Typically these plates can be cold bent (room temperature) provided a minimum radius of 5 times the thickness of the plate is specified, 5t. This requirement is for bending plate perpendicular to direction of final rolling. If it is necessary to bend parallel to the rolling direction, the minimum radius shall be increased to 7.5t. When bending other grades of steel and for ancillary components (connection plates etc.) up to 3/4" thick the minimum bend radius may be taken as 1.5t, or as recommended by the plate producer. Again, the larger the bend radius the finished part will permit the better. Cracking can originate from the outside edges of bent plate, therefore it is recommended to require the edges of bent plates to be ground to a chamfer or radius prior to bending. Require the grinding to occur one-foot beyond the end of the bend. Hot bending of bridge steels may be used with the approval of the WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer and Steel Specialist. The Contractor shall submit a heating and bending plan for review. The plates shall be bent at a temperature above the "blue brittle" temperature of 700F but not greater than 1200F, except for HPS 70W and HPS 100W shall be limited to 1100F. Minimum radii shall be as previously specified.

6.2
Girder Bridges
6.2.1
General Once the material of choice, structural steel has been eclipsed by prestressed concrete. Fabrication, material and life cycle costs have contributed to steel’s relative cost disadvantage. Costs may be minimized by simplifying fabrication details, optimizing the number of girder lines, allowing for repetitive fabrication of components such as cross frames and stiffeners, and ensuring ease of shipping and erecting. The specifications allow a combination of plastic design in positive moment regions and elastic design in negative moment regions. Plate girders, of the depths typically built in this state, have traditionally been designed to elastic limits or lower. High performance and weathering steel can be used to save weight and life cycle painting costs, thereby minimizing the cost gap between steel and concrete bridges. I-girders may require accommodation for bridge security. Security fences may be installed within the confines of the superstructure to deter inappropriate access. Coordinate with the State Bridge and Structures Architect during final design where required.
6.2.2
I-Girders Welded plate I-girders constitute the majority of steel girders designed by WSDOT. The I-girder represents an efficient use of material for maximizing stiffness. Its shortcoming is inefficiency in resisting shear. Office practice is to maintain constant web thickness and depth for short to medium span girders. Weight savings is achieved by minimizing the number of webs used for a given bridge. This also helps minimize fabrication, handling, and painting costs. Current office practice is to use a minimum of three girders to provide redundant load path structures. Two girder superstructures are considered non-redundant and hence, fracture critical. Buckling behavior of relatively slender elements complicates steel plate girder design. Most strength calculations involve checks on buckling in some form. Local buckling can be a problem in flanges, webs, and stiffeners if compression is present. Also, overall stability shall be ensured throughout all stages of construction, with or without a bridge deck. The art of designing steel girders is to minimize material and fabrication expense while ensuring adequate strength, stiffness, and stability. I-girders are an excellent shape for welding. All welds for the main components are easily accessible and visible for welding and inspection. The plates are oriented in the rolling direction to make good use of strength, ductility, and toughness of the structural steel. The web is attached to the top and bottom flanges with continuous fillet welds. Usually, they are made with automatic submerged arc welders (SAW). These welds are loaded parallel to the longitudinal axis and resist horizontal shear between the flanges and web. Minimum size welds based on plate thickness will satisfy strength and fatigue requirements in most cases. The flanges and webs are fabricated to full segment length with full penetration groove welds. These welds are inspected by ultrasound (UT) 100 percent. Tension welds, as designated in the plans, are also radiographed (RT) 100 percent. Office practice is to have flanges and webs fabricated full length before they are welded into the “I” shape. Weld splicing built-up sections results in poor fatigue strength and zones that are difficult to inspect. Quality welding and inspection requires good access for both.

Structural Steel
Tub or Box Girders Typical steel box girders for WSDOT are trapezoidal tub sections. Using single top flange plates to create true box sections is very uncommon when reinforced concrete decks are used. Tub girders will be referred to herein as box girders, as in AASHTO LRFD Article 6.11. The top lateral system placed inside the girder is treated as an equivalent plate, closing the open section, to increase torsional stiffness before bridge deck curing. Although not required by the code, it helps ensure stability that may be overlooked during construction. Partial or temporary bracing may be used provided it is properly designed and installed. Dramatic construction failures have occurred due to insufficient bracing of box girders. Stability of the shape shall be ensured for all stages of construction in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Article 6.11.3. The cured bridge deck serves to close the section for torsional stiffness. Internal cross frames or diaphragms are used to maintain the shape and minimize distortion loading on individual plates and welds making up the box. Box segments will have considerable torsional stiffness when top lateral bracing is provided. This may make fit-up in the field difficult. The ability to make box girders with high torsional stiffness makes them a popular choice for short radius curved structures. Curved box girders, because of inherent torsional stiffness, behave differently than curved I-girders. Curved box girder behavior can be easily modeled with modern finite element software. See curved girder references listed at the end of this chapter for complete description. Straight box girders, when proportioned in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Article 6.11.2 may be designed without consideration of distortional stresses. The range of applicability for live load distribution is based on: ͲǤͷ൑ܰ௅ ോ ܰ௕ ൑ ͳǤͷ
(6.2.3-1)
which limits the number of lanes loading each box. Wide box girder spacing, outside this range, will require additional live load analysis. Consideration must be given to differential deflection between boxes when designing the bridge deck. Generally, use of cross frames between boxes is limited to long spans with curvature. Box girders shall have a single bearing per box for bridges with multiple box girders, not bearings under each web. If bearings are located under each web, distribution of loads is uncertain. For single box girder bridges, two bearings per box shall be used. Generally, plate diaphragms with access holes are used in place of pier cross frames. With the exception of effects from inclined webs, top flanges and webs are designed as if they were part of individual I-girders. The combined bottom flange is unique to box girders. In order to maximize web spacing while minimizing bottom flange width, place webs out of plumb on a slope of 1 in 4. Wide plates present two difficulties: excessive material between shop splices and buckling behavior in compression zones (interior piers). To keep weight and plate thickness within reason, it is often necessary to stiffen the bottom flange in compression with longitudinal stiffeners. Office practice is to use tee sections for longitudinal stiffeners and channel bracing at cross frame locations (transverse stiffeners). If possible, bottom flange stiffeners are terminated at field splices. Otherwise, carefully ground weld terminations are needed in tension regions with high stress range. Due to the transverse flexibility

of thin wide plates, stiffener plates are welded across the bottom flange at cross frame locations, combined with web vertical stiffeners. For the design of the bottom flange in compression, see AASHTO LRFD Articles 6.11.8.2 and 6.11.11.2.
6.2.4
Fracture Critical Superstructures Non-redundant, fracture critical single tub superstructures, and twin I-girder systems, may sometimes be justified. In which case, approval for this bridge type must be obtained from the WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer. Conditions that favor this option are narrow one lane ramps, especially with tightly curved alignments, at locations within existing mainline interchanges. Flyover ramps often fall into these constraints. The box section allows in-depth inspection access without significant disruption to mainline traffic. UBIT access over urban interstate lanes is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. Where curvature is significant, the box section is a stiffer, more efficient load carrying system than a twin I-girder system. If a twin I-girder system is to be used, approval must also be secured. Some form of permanent false decking or other inspection access needs to be included over mainline lanes that will be difficult to close for UBIT access. This access needs to be appropriate for fracture critical inspections. If curvature is not severe, the twin I-girder system may prove to be more economical than a single box. The maximum roadway width for either a single box or twin I-girder superstructure is about 27 feet. Where roadway width exceeds this, additional girders shall be used. Mainline structures, usually exceeding 38 feet in width, will require a minimum of three webs, with four webs being the preferred minimum. Increased vertical clearance from mainline traffic should be obtained for either of these bridge types. The desired minimum is 20 feet. Box sections tend to offer greater stiffness than equal depth I-girders, especially on curved alignment. The web depth may be reduced below AASHTO LRFD Table 2.5.2.6.3-1 minimums provided live load deflection criteria are met. However, avoid web depth less than 5′-0″ so that inspection access is within reason. The desirable minimum web depth for boxes is 6′-6″. Box sections with web depth of 6′-6″ should be capable of interior spans up to 250 feet. Main spans of 150 feet should be considered the low end of this girder type’s economical range. Because of the proximity of flyover ramps to high numbers of observers, attempt to streamline their superstructure depths where economical and deflection criteria can be achieved. Consider use of high performance steels, AASHTO M270 grade HPS70W for these girder types. Grades of steel with equal CVN toughness may be considered, however the improved through-thickness properties of the HPS grades should also be considered. If practical, maintain a maximum flange thickness of 2″ when using HPS for better properties and plate availability. The improved toughness of HPS will lower the chance of sudden crack propagation if a crack does become visible to casual observation. The limit state load modifier relating to redundancy, ηr = 1.05, as specified in AASHTO LRFD Article 1.3.4 shall be used in the design of non-redundant steel structures. However, for load rating non-redundant structures, a system factor of 0.85 is currently required in the AASHTO Manual for Bridge Evaluation (MBE) on the capacity of the girders, which is not consistent with the redundancy load modifier used in design. The designer shall design some reserve capacity in the girders so the load rating value for HL93 Inventory is greater than or equal to 1.0.

The AASHTO LRFD approximate live load distribution factors are not applicable to these girder types. The level rule or the preferred refined analysis shall be used. Where highly curved, only a refined analysis shall be used. Fracture-critical members and system redundant members shall be designed for infinite fatigue life, which requires design using the Fatigue I load combination specified In Table 3.4.1-1 and the nominal fatigue resistance specified In Article 6.6.1.2.5.

6.3.1
Limit States for AASHTO LRFD Structural components shall be proportioned to satisfy the requirements of strength, extreme event, service, and fatigue limit states as outlined in AASHTO LRFD Articles1.3.2 and 6.5. Service limit states are included in Service I and Service II load combinations. Service I load combination is used to check the live load deflection limitations of AASHTO LRFD Article 2.5.2.6. Service II places limits on permanent deflection, no yielding, slenderness of the web in compression, and slip of bolted connections. The fatigue live load specified in AASHTO LRFD Article 3.6.1.4 shall be used for checking girder details in accordance with Article 6.6. A single fatigue truck, without lane loading or variable axle spacing, is placed for maximum and minimum effect to a detail under investigation. The impact is 15 percent, regardless of span length. The load factor is 1.75. It is generally possible to meet the constant amplitude fatigue limit (CAFL) requirement for details with good fatigue performance. Limiting the calculated fatigue range to the CAFL ensures infinite fatigue life. Webs shall be checked for fatigue loading in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Article 6.10.5.3, using the calculated fatigue stress range for flexure or shear. Shear connector spacing shall be according to AASHTO LRFD Article 6.10.10. Generally, the fatigue resistance (Zr) for ⅞″ diameter shear connectors can be taken as 4.2 kips for an infinite number of cycles (CAFL = 4.2 kips). Flanges and webs shall meet strength limit state requirements for both construction and final phases. Constructability requirements for flanges and webs are covered in AASHTO LRFD Article 6.10.3. Flexure resistance is specified in AASHTO LRFD Articles 6.10.7 and 6.10.8; shear resistance is specified in AASHTO LRFD Article 6.10.9 Pier cross frames shall be designed for seismic loading, extreme event load combination. Bolts are treated as bearing type connections with AASHTO LRFD Article 6.5.4.2 resistance factors. The resistance factor for all other members is 1.0 at extreme limit state.
6.3.2
Composite Section Live load plus impact shall be applied to the transformed composite section using Es/Ec, commonly denoted n. Long-term loading (dead load of barriers, signs, luminaries, overlays, etc.) is applied to the transformed composite section using 3n. Positive moments are applied to these composite sections accordingly; both for service and strength limit states. The bridge deck may be considered effective in negative moment regions provided tensile stresses in the deck are below the modulus of rupture. This is generally possible for Service I load combination and fatigue analysis. For strength limit state loadings, the composite section includes longitudinal reinforcing while the bridge deck is ignored.

Flanges Flange thickness is limited to 4″ maximum in typical bridge plate, but the desirable maximum is 3″. Structural Steel Notes on contract plans shall require all plates for flange material 2” or less to be purchased such that the ratio of reduction of thickness from a slab to plate shall be at least 3.0:1. This requirement helps ensure the plate material has limited inclusions and micro-porosity that can create problems during cutting and welding. Plates for flange material greater than 2” thick shall be supplied based on acceptable ultrasonic testing (UT) inspection in accordance with ASTM A 578. UT scanning and acceptance shall be as follows:
• The entire plate shall be scanned in accordance with ASTM A 578 and shall meet Acceptance Standard C, and
• Plate material within 12-inches of flange complete joint penetration splice welds shall be scanned in accordance with ASTM A 578 Supplementary S1 and shall meet Acceptance Standard C The number of plate thicknesses used for a given project should be kept to a minimum. Generally, the bottom flange should be wider than the top flange. Flange width changes should be made at bolted field splices. Thickness transitions are best done at welded splices. AASHTO LRFD Article 6.13.6.1.4 requires fill plates at bolted splices to be developed, if thicker than ¼″. Since this requires a significant increase in the number of bolts for thick fill plates, keeping the thickness transition ¼″ or less by widening pier segment flanges can be a better solution. Between field splices, flange width should be kept constant.
6.3.4
Webs Maintain constant web thickness throughout the structure. If different web thickness is needed, the transition shall be at a welded splice. Horizontal web splices are not needed unless web height exceeds 12′-6″. Vertical web splices for girders should be shown on the plans in an elevation view with additional splices made optional to the fabricator. All welded web splices on exterior faces of exterior girders and in tension zones elsewhere shall be ground smooth. Web splices of interior girders need not be ground in compression zones.
6.3.5
Transverse Stiffeners Transverse stiffeners shall be used in pairs at cross frame locations on interior girders and on the inside of webs of exterior girders. They shall be welded to the top flange, bottom flange and web at these locations. This detail is considered fatigue category C’ for longitudinal flange stress. Stiffeners used between cross frames shall be located on one side of the web, welded to the compression flange, and cut short of the tension flange. Stiffeners located between cross frames in regions of stress reversal shall be welded to one side of the web and cut short of both flanges. Alternatively, they may be welded to both flanges if fatigue Category C’ is checked. Transverse stiffeners may be dropped when not needed for strength. If cross frame spacing is less than 3 times the web depth, additional stiffeners may only be necessary near piers. Stiffened webs require end panels to anchor the first tension field. The jacking stiffener to bearing stiffeners space shall not be used as the anchor panel. The first transverse stiffener is to be placed at no greater spacing than 1.5 times the web depth from the bearing or jacking stiffener.

Chapter 6
Transverse stiffeners shall be designed and detailed to meet AASHTO LRFD Article 6.10.11.1. Where they are used to connect cross frames, they should be a minimum width of 8″ to accommodate two bolt rows.
6.3.6
Longitudinal Stiffeners On long spans where web depths exceed 10 feet, comparative cost evaluations shall be made to determine whether the use of longitudinal stiffeners will be economical. The use of longitudinal stiffeners may be economical on webs 10 feet deep or greater. Weld terminations for longitudinal stiffeners are fatigue prone details. Longitudinal stiffener plates shall be continuous, splices being made with full penetration welds before being attached to webs. Transverse stiffeners should be pieced to allow passage of longitudinal stiffeners. Design of longitudinal stiffeners is covered by AASHTO LRFD Article 6.10.11.3.
6.3.7
Bearing Stiffeners Stiffeners are required at all bearings to enable the reaction to be transmitted from the web to the bearing. These stiffeners are designated as columns, therefore, must be vertical under total dead load. The connection of the bearing stiffener to flanges consists of partial penetration groove welds reinforced with fillet welds, of sufficient size to transmit design loads. Pier cross frames may transfer large seismic lateral loads through top and bottom connections. Weld size must be designed to ensure adequate load path from deck and cross frames into bearings. Design of bearing stiffeners is covered by AASHTO LRFD Article 6.10.11.2.
6.3.8
Cross Frames The primary function of intermediate cross frames is to provide stability to individual girders or flanges. Cross frames or diaphragms are required at each support to brace girders; they should be as near to full-depth as practical and are required to be a minimum of 0.75 of the web depth for plate girders and 0.5 of the web depth for rolled sections. On curved bridges, the cross frames also resist torsional twisting of the superstructure and are considered primary members. Pier cross frames are subjected to lateral loads from wind, earthquake, and curvature. These forces are transmitted from the roadway slab to the bearings by way of the pier cross frames. Intermediate cross frames also resist wind load to the lower half of the girders. The primary load path for wind is the concrete deck and pier diaphragms. Wind load on the bottom flange is shed incrementally to the deck through intermediate cross frames. The essential function, however, is to brace the compression flanges for all stages of construction and service life. As such, continuous span girders require bottom flange bracing near interior supports. Office practice requires intermediate cross frames at spacing consistent with design assumptions. The 25 foot maximum spacing of older specifications is not maintained in the AASHTO LRFD code. A rectangular grid of girders and cross frames with 3 or less girders may not be sufficiently stiff laterally before the deck is cured. Both wind and deck placement can cause noticeable deflections. In the case of deck placement, permanent sideway and rotation of the steel framing may result in a system buckling mode and should be checked per AASHTO section 6.10.3.4.2. Some form of temporary or permanent lateral bracing to an adjacent structure is recommended when possible. For example, when widening a steel girder bridge, the top and bottom struts of the cross frames should be installed and
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Chapter 6
Structural Steel
connected to the existing bridge with one bolt at each connection. This provides lateral stability but allows vertical deflections. The remaining connection bolts can be installed after the deck is cast. Cross frames and connections should be detailed for repetitive fabrication and openness for inspection and painting. Cross frames consisting of back-to-back angles separated by gusset plates are not permitted. These are difficult to repaint. Cross frames are generally patterned as K-frames or as X-frames. Typically the configuration selected is based on the most efficient geometry. The diagonals should closely approach a slope of 1:1 or 45°. Some rules of thumb for selecting either X or K-frames are as follows:
• If S/D is less than or equal to 1.0, use X-frames
• If S/D is greater than or equal to 1.5, use K-frames
• If 1 < S/D < 1.5, OK to use either Where, S = girder spacing D = total depth of web WSDOT standard practice when using K-frame configured cross frames is to orient the frame where the diagonals meet at the center of the bottom horizontal strut. For pier cross frames, it may be advantageous to flip the K-frame so the diagonals help to transfer lateral loads from the deck directly into the girder bearings. Avoid conflicts with utilities passing between the girders. Detailing of cross frames should follow guidelines of economical steel bridge details promoted by the National Steel Bridge Alliance. Office practice is to bolt rather than weld individual cross frames units to girder stiffeners. Welding of individual pieces to make up a cross frame unit is acceptable. Oversize holes are not allowed in cross frame connections if girders are curved and should be avoided for straight and skewed bridges unless approved by the Steel Specialist. Intermediate cross frames for straight girders with little or no skew should be designed as secondary members. Choose members that meet minimum slenderness requirements and design connections only for anticipated loads, not for 75 percent strength of member. Cross frames should also be sized to meet the stability bracing requirements discussed in Chapter 13 of the recently updated (Feb. 2022) Steel Bridge Design Handbook. The stability bracing forces should be added to the loads obtained from the first-order analysis loads such as dead load, wind etc. In general, cross frames should be installed parallel to piers for skew angles of 0° to 20°. For greater skew angles, other arrangements may be used. Recent research has provided guidance, much of which is included in AASTHO, for cross frame arrangements for skews greater than 20°, especially near intermediate piers and abutments. The key is to avoid a cross frame spanning from one girder that is supported by a pier or abutment to an adjacent girder point away from the support. This creates large cross frame forces due to differential deflections of the girders. Consult with the Steel Specialist for recommendations on cross frame arrangements. Intermediate cross frames for curved I-girders require special consideration. Cross frames for curved girder bridges are main load carrying members and tension components should be so designated in the plans. For highly curved systems, it is more efficient to keep members and connections concentric, as live loads can be significant. Welded connections should be carefully evaluated for fatigue.

the 10th Edition of AASHTO provides reductions in the fatigue demands in cross frames. Currently the load factors for Fatigue I (infinite) and Fatigue II (finite) are 1.75 and 0.80, respectively. These have been found to be overly conservative for cross frame design. The approved ballot item allows the current Fatigue I and II load factors to be multiplied by a cross frame design factor of 0.65. For design and detailing of cross frames, the following are additional items to consider: 1.
When using a refined analysis, such as a 3D model, member stiffness for equal leg single angles, unequal leg single angles connected by the long leg, and flange connected WT members may use an effective member stiffness equal to 0.65AE. This approach will reduce the force demands by accounting for connection stiffness and second-order stiffness softening. It is recommended to create a new steel material property within the analysis model with a reduced modulus, E, versus reducing the area, A, of the section.
2.
When modeling cross frames in 3D models, the ends of the members should be considered pinned and the point of the connection to the girder web modeled as close to the true location as possible. Connecting the cross frame member directly into the intersection of the web and flanges can often produce higher demands than the members will actually experience.
3.
When obtaining fatigue demands on cross frames, the maximum and minimum forces shall be obtained with the fatigue truck confined to one critical transverse position per each longitudinal position throughout the length of the bridge. In other words, the max/min forces on a cross frame shall be obtained from the truck loading from one lane. For a specific cross frame, it is too conservative to use the max force from a truck positioned in lane 1 while taking the minimum force obtained from and adjacent lane. For typical FEA model software, such as CSI Bridge, consisting of a model with multiple lanes, the normal output is to provide an envelope of max and min forces considering all the lanes. Fatigue truck loading will need to be carefully obtained from FEA models and should be limited to demands produced from one lane of loading at a time.
4.
Cross frames can be one of the most expensive items to fabricate for a steel bridge. Economy of repetition should be considered in the design and detailing. If the loads on the cross frames vary along the length of the bridge, the cross frame designs can be grouped into 2-3 types based on demands. For example, one design for highly loaded frames, one for intermediate, and one for lightly loaded. It can be expensive to design one cross frame for the maximum demands and use them at all locations.
5.
Detailing of cross frames have historically identified work points (WP) on the plans at the intersections of cross frame centerlines and the centerline of the girder web. Consider using the center of a bolt hole at cross frame gusset connections as a defined WP. This enables the fabricators in the shop to physically layout the WP in their fabrication jigs versus having it be “off in space” beyond the limits of the actual cross frame. Additionally, distances or clearances from girder flanges to bottom of cross frame gussets or WP can be called out with +/- tolerances, especially when there are variations in girder framing geometry. If there are tolerances allowed in the actual location of the cross frame, it provides opportunity for the fabricator to detail and fabricate cross frames that are exactly the same.

Structural Steel
6.
When obtaining cross frame loads, consider the actual stiffness of the supports and allowable movements in the bearings. A true pin or fixed bearing in a model can produce high demands on the pier cross frames. Including flexibility of the support or slight movements in bearings, say 1/8” to ¼”, can greatly reduce demands. This will depend on the bearing type.
7.
For straight or slightly skewed I-girder bridges, consider lean on bracing for the cross frames. Lean on bracing has not been codified in AASHTO but several states have used them successfully in steel bridges. The general concept is to minimize the number of complete cross frames between girder lines. For example, in a 4-girder system labeled A through D, a complete K or X cross frame would be used between girders A and B while only top and bottom struts are installed between girders B-C and between C-D. The positions of the complete cross frame would vary along the length of the bridge and in some bays, complete cross frames would be used between all girders. See Figure 6.3.8-1 for a general illustration. The construction sequence will need to be carefully considered so stability is provided during girder erection. See the Steel Specialist for more guidance on design and detailing of lean on bracing.
8.
Single angles members for cross frames are generally preferred by fabricators. These are the easiest to fabricate. WT sections require a W-beam to be cut in half, adding an additional step to fabrication. The AASHTO code provides equations for design of single angles that account for the eccentricity of the angle and the connection point, allowing the angle to be designed for just axial demands. When checking slenderness minimum requirements L/r or KL/r, use the radius of gyration, r, from the Z-Z axis.
Web stiffeners at cross frames shall be welded to top and bottom flanges. This practice minimizes out-of-plane bending of the girder web. Figure 6.3.8-1

Bottom Laterals Bottom lateral systems are expensive to install permanently. If possible, they should be avoided in favor of alternative bracing methods. They are seldom required in the completed structure, but may contribute to nuisance fatigue cracking or fracture in the main girders. The primary function of a bottom lateral system is to stabilize the girders against lateral loads and translation before the bridge deck hardens. The layout pattern is based on number of girder lines, girder spacing, and cross frame spacing. Cost considerations should include geometry, repetition, number, and size of connections. If used, limit bottom laterals to one or two bays. For both straight and curved structures, bottom laterals carry dead and live loads, in proportion to distance from the neutral axis. They should be modeled in the structure to determine the actual forces the member's experience. Since they carry slab dead load, they should be accounted for when calculating camber. Where lateral gusset plates are fillet welded to girder webs, the fatigue stress range in the girder is limited to Category E without transition radius, or Category D with carefully made transition radius. The gusset plates should be bolted to the girder web in regions of high tension stress range. For widening projects, bottom laterals are not needed since the new structure can be braced against the existing structure during construction. Framing which is adequately braced should not require bottom laterals.
6.3.10
Bolted Field Splice for Girders Field splices shall be bolted. Splices are usually located at the dead load inflection point to minimize the design bending moment. See AASHTO LRFD Articles 6.13.2 and 6.13.6.1 for bolted splice design requirements. A major revision to the design of bolted splices was implemented in the 8th Edition of the AASHTO LRFD. The design methodology is simplified and requires top and bottom flange splice plates and bolts to be sized to develop the capacity of the smaller flange. Designing web splices is outlined in AASHTO LRFD Article 6.13.6.1.3c. Web splices are sized to develop the shear capacity of the web, with a check on moments. Only 2 rows of web bolts will typically be required on each side of the splice plate. Bolted web splices should not involve thin fill material. Thickness transitions for webs, if needed, should be done with welded shop splices. The NSBA has developd a bolted splice EXCEL spreadsheet, which can be downloaded from their website to assist in splice design. Flange splice design is outlined in AASHTO LRFD Article 6.13.6.1.3b. For splice plates at least ⅜″ thick and ⅞″ diameter bolts, threads may be excluded from all shear planes for a 25 percent increase in strength, per AASHTO LRFD Article 6.13.2.7. Bolts designed with threads excluded from shear planes shall be designated as such in the plans. Generally, bolts in girder field splices may be designed for double shear. A requirement has been added for developing fillers used in bolted splices, AASHTO LRFD Article 6.13.6.1.4. When fill plates are greater than ¼″, the splice or filler needs to be extended for additional bolts. As filler thickness increases, the shear resistance of bolts decreases. A way of minimizing filler thickness is to transition flange width for pier segments. Using equal plate thickness by this method has the added benefit of reducing the number of plate sizes in a project.

Splice bolts shall be checked for Strength load combinations and slip at Service II load combination. When faying surfaces are blasted and primed with inorganic zinc paint, a Class B surface condition is assumed. Fabrication of girder splices is covered by Standard Specifications Sections 6-03.3(27) and 6-03.3(28). Method of field assembly is covered by Section 6-03.3(32) and bolting inspection and installation by Section 6-03.3(33). Since bolted joints have some play due to differences in bolt diameter and hole size, field splices are drilled while segments are set in proper alignment in the shop. The joint is pinned (pin diameter equals hole size to prohibit movement) for shop assembly and also during initial field fit-up. Normally, this ensures repeatability of joint alignment from shop to field.
6.3.11
Camber Camber shall include effects of profile grade, superelevation, anticipated dead load deflections, and bridge deck shrinkage (if measurable). Permanent girder deflections shall be shown in the plans in the form of camber diagrams and tables. Dead load deflections are due to steel self-weight, bridge deck dead load, and superimposed dead loads such as overlay, sidewalks, and barriers. Since fabricated camber and girder erection have inherent variability, bridge deck form height is adjusted after steel has been set. Although a constant distance from top of web to top of deck is assumed, this will vary along the girders. Bridge deck forms without adjustment for height are not allowed. Girders shall be profiled once fully erected, and before bridge deck forms are installed. See Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(39). Girder camber is established at three stages of construction. First, girder webs are cut from plates so that the completed girder segment will assume the shape of reverse dead load deflections superimposed on profile grade. Only minor heat corrections may be made in the shop to meet the camber tolerance of the Bridge Welding Code AWS D1.5 Chapter 3.5. Camber for plate girders is not induced by mechanical force. The fabricated girder segment will incorporate the as-cut web shape and minor amounts of welding distortion. Next, the girder segments are brought together for shop assembly. Field splices are drilled as the segments are placed in position to fit profile grade plus total dead load deflection (no load condition). Finally, the segments are erected, sometimes with supports at field splices. There may be slight angle changes at field splices, resulting in altered girder profiles. Errors at mid-span can be between one to two inches at this stage. The following is a general outline for calculating camber and is based on girders having shear studs the full length of the bridge. Two camber curves are required, one for total dead load plus bridge deck formwork and one for steel framing self-weight. The difference between these curves is used to set bridge deck forms. Girder dead load deflection is determined by using various computer programs. Many steel girder design programs incorporate camber calculation. Girder self-weight shall include the basic section plus stiffeners, cross frames, welds, shear studs, etc. These items may be accounted for by adding an appropriate percentage of basic section weight (15 percent is a good rule of thumb). Total dead load camber shall consist of deflection due to:
Page 6-26

Structural Steel
Chapter 6
1.
Steel weight, applied to steel section. Include 5 psf bridge deck formwork allowance in the total dead load camber, but not in the steel weight camber. The effect of removing formwork is small in relation to first placement, due to composite action between girders and bridge deck. It isn’t necessary to account for the removal.
2.
Bridge deck weight, applied to steel section. This should be the majority of dead load deflection.
3.
Traffic barriers, sidewalks, and overlays, applied to long-term composite section using 3n. Do not include weight of future overlays in the camber calculations.
4.
Bridge deck shrinkage (if ≥ ¾″).
Bridge deck dead load deflection will require the designer to exercise some judgment concerning degree of analysis. A two or three span bridge of regular proportions, for example, may not require a rigorous analysis. The bridge deck could be assumed to be placed instantaneously on the steel section only. Generally, due to creep, deflections and stresses slowly assume a state consistent with instantaneous bridge deck placement. However, with the modern analysis tools available, it is recommended a rigorous analysis be performed for all steel bridge designs. An analysis coupled with a bridge deck placement sequence should be used. This requires an incremental analysis where previous bridge deck placement are treated as composite sections (using a modulus of elasticity for concrete based on age at time of second pour) and successive bridge deck placements are added on non-composite sections. Each bridge deck placement requires a separate deflection analysis. The total effect of bridge deck construction is the superposition of each bridge deck placement. This analysis can also be accomplished using staged construction features in most finite element analysis software. Traffic barriers, sidewalks, overlays, and other items constructed after the bridge deck placement should be analyzed as if applied to the long-term composite section full length of the bridge. The modulus of elasticity of the slab concrete shall be reduced to one third of its short term value. For example, if f′c = 4000 psi, then use a value of n = 24. Bridge deck shrinkage has a varying degree of effect on superstructure deflections. The designer shall use some judgment in evaluating this effect on camber. Bridge deck shrinkage should be the smallest portion of the total camber. It has greater influence on shallower girder sections, say rolled beams. Simple spans will see more effect than continuous spans. For medium to long span continuous girders (spans over 200 feet without any in-span hinges), bridge deck shrinkage deflection can be ignored. For simple span girders between 150 and 250 feet, the deflection should not exceed 1″. For calculation, apply a shrinkage strain of 0.0002 to the long-term composite section using 3n. In addition to girder deflections, show girder rotations at bearing stiffeners. This will allow shop plan detailers to compensate for rotations so that bearing stiffeners will be vertical in their final position. Camber tolerance is governed by the Bridge Welding Code AWS D1.5, chapter 5.5. A note of clarification is added to the plan camber diagram: “For the purpose of measuring camber tolerance during shop assembly, assume top flanges are embedded in concrete without a designed haunch.” This allows a high or low deviation from the theoretical curve, otherwise no negative camber tolerance is allowed.

A screed adjustment diagram shall be included with the camber diagram. This diagram, with dimension table, shall be the remaining calculated deflection just prior to bridge deck placement, taking into account the estimated weight of deck formwork and deck reinforcing. The weight of bridge deck formwork may be taken equal to 5 psf, or the assumed formwork weight used to calculate total camber. The weight of reinforcing may be taken as the span average distributed uniformly. The screed adjustment should equal: (Total Camber – Steel Camber)–(deflection due to forms + rebar). The screed adjustment shall be shown at each girder line. This will indicate how much twisting is anticipated during bridge deck placement, primarily due to span curvature and/or skew. These adjustments shall be applied to theoretical profile grades, regardless of actual steel framing elevations. The adjustments shall be designated “C”. The diagram shall be designated as “Screed Setting Adjustment Diagram.” The table of dimensions shall be kept separate from the girder camber, but at consistent locations along girders. That is, at 1/10th points or panel points. A cross section view shall be included with curved span bridges, showing effects of twisting. See Appendix 6.4-A6. For the purpose of setting bridge deck soffit elevations, a correction shall be made to the plan haunch dimension based on the difference between theoretical flange locations and actual profiled elevations. The presence of bridge deck formwork shall be noted at the time of the survey. The presence of false decking need not be accounted for in design or the survey.
6.3.12
Bridge Deck Placement Sequence The bridge deck shall be placed in a prescribed sequence allowing the concrete in each segment to shrink with minor influence on other segments. Negative moment regions (segments over interior piers) must be placed after positive moment regions have had time to cure. This helps minimize shrinkage cracking and provides manageable volumes of concrete for a work shift. Positive moment regions should be placed first, while negative moment regions are placed last. Successive segments should not be placed until previous segments attain sufficient strength, typically about 2000 psi or cure of 3 to 7 days. This general guideline is sufficient for typical, well balanced span, however the designer should check slab tensile stresses imposed on adjoining span segments. Required concrete strength can be increased, but needless delays waiting for higher strengths should be avoided. Also, the contractor should be given the option of placing positive moment segments with little influence on each other at a convenient rate, regardless of curing time. That is, segments separated by a span could be placed the same or next day without any harm. These can be lumped in the same pour sequence.
6.3.13
Bridge Bearings for Steel Girders Make bearing selection consistent with required motions and capacities. The following order is the general preference, high to low, however the designer should consider economics and constructability when selecting bearings. In some cases where an elastomeric bearing could handle vertical loads and rotations, additional girder stops and/or hold downs may be needed, which could make a disc bearing a smarter and more economical choice.

Surface Roughness and Hardness The standard measure of surface roughness is the microinch value. This can be measured in a number of scales but typically in the USA, the Ra scale is assumed. Surface roughness shall be shown on the plans for all surfaces for which machining is required unless covered by the Standard Specifications or Special Provisions. Consult the Machinery’s Handbook for common machining practice. Edge finishing for steel girders is covered in Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(14). Surface hardness of thermal cut girder flanges is also controlled. Following is a brief description of some finishes: 1000A surface produced by thermal cutting 500A rough surface finish typical of “as rolled” sections. Suitable for surfaces that do not contact other parts and for bearing plates on grout. 250A fairly smooth surface. Suitable for connections and surfaces not in moving contact with other surfaces. This finish is typical of ground edges in tension zones of flanges. 125A fine machine finish resulting from careful machine work using high speeds and taking light cuts. It may be produced by all methods of direct machining under proper conditions. Suitable for steel to steel bearing or rotational surfaces including rockers and pins. 63A smooth machine finish suitable for high stress steel to steel bearing surfaces including roller bearings on bed plates. 32An extremely fine machine finish suitable for steel sliding parts. This surface is generally produced by grinding. 16A very smooth, very fine surface only used on high stress sliding bearings. This surface is generally produced by polishing. For examples, see Figure 6.3.14-1. For stainless steel sliding surfaces, specify a #8 mirror finish. This is a different method of measurement and reflects USA industry standards for finish on stainless steel sheet, strip, and plate. A #1 finish is basically "as rolled" and the scale goes up to a #8 finish, which is the mirror finish. No units are implied. See the Steel Specialist for examples of these finishes.

Welding All structural steel and rebar welding shall be in accordance with the Standard Specifications, amendments thereto and the special provisions. The Standard Specifications currently calls for welding structural steel according to the AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code (BWC), latest edition and the latest edition of the AWS D1.1 Structural Weld Code. Exceptions to both codes and additional requirements are shown in the Standard Specifications and the special provisions. Standard symbols for welding, brazing, and nondestructive examination can be found in the ANSI/AWS A 2.4 by that name. This publication is a very good reference for definitions of abbreviations and acronyms related to welding. The designer shall consider the limits of allowable fatigue stress, specified for the various welds used to connect the main load carrying members of a steel structure. See AASHTO LRFD Article 6.6. Most plate girder framing can be detailed in a way that provides fatigue category C or better.

The minimum fillet weld size shall be as shown in the following table. Weld size is determined by the thicker of the two parts joined unless a larger size is required by calculated stress. The weld size need not exceed the thickness of the thinner part joined. Base Metal Thickness of Thicker Part Joined To ¾″ inclusive Over ¾″
Minimum Size of Fillet Weld ¼″ 5/16″
In general, the maximum size fillet weld which may be made with a single pass is 5/16 inch for submerged arc (SAW), gas metal arc (GMAW), and flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) processes. The maximum size fillet weld made in a single pass is ¼ inch for the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) process. The major difference between AWS D1.1 and D1.5 is the welding process qualification. The only process deemed prequalified in D1.5 is shielded metal arc (SMAW). All others must be qualified by test. All bridge welding procedure specifications (WPS) submitted for approval shall be accompanied by a procedure qualification record (PQR), a record of test specimens examination and approval except for SMAW is prequalified. Notes: Electrogas and electroslag welding processes are not allowed in WSDOT work. Narrow gap improved electroslag welding is allowed on a case-by-case basis. Often in the rehabilitation of existing steel structures, it is desirable to weld, in some form, to the in-place structural steel. Often it is not possible to determine from the original contract documents whether or not the existing steel contains high or low carbon content and carbon equivalence. Small coupons from the steel can be taken for a chemical analysis. Labs are available in the Seattle and Portland areas that will do this service quickly. Suitable weld procedures can be prepared once the chemical content is measured.
6.3.16
Shop Assembly In most cases, a simple progressive longitudinal shop assembly is sufficient to ensure proper fit of subsections, field splices, and cross frame connections, etc., in the field. Due to geometric complexity of some structures, progressive transverse assembly, in combination with progressive longitudinal assembly may be desirable. The designer shall consult with the Design Unit Manager and the Steel Specialist to determine the extent of shop assembly and clarification of Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(28)A. If other than line girder progressive assembly is required, the method must be included by special provision. High skews or curved girders should be done with some form of transverse and longitudinal assembly. Complex curved and skewed box girder framing should be done with full transverse progressive assembly. For transverse assembly, specify cross frame and pier diaphragm connections to be completed while assembled. During shop assembly, girder segments are blocked or supported in the no-load condition (no gravity effects). Simple line girder assembly is often done in the horizontal position. The primary reason for shop assembly is to ensure correct alignment for girder field splices. For straight bridges, cross frame connections are normally done by numerically controlled (NC) drilling (no trial shop assembly). This is generally of sufficient accuracy to allow cross frame installation in the field without corrective action such as reaming.

For curved I-girders, cross frames are to be fabricated to fit the no-load or steel dead load only condition. During field erection, girder segments will need to be adjusted or supported to make fit-up possible. This is not unreasonable since curved girders are not self-supporting before cross frames are in place. However, the method results in out-ofplumb girders. For most cases, making theoretical compensation to arrive at plumb in final condition is not justified. Highly skewed girders present difficult fit-up conditions. Setting screeds is also complicated because of differential deflections between neighboring girders. Design of cross frames and pier diaphragms must take into account twist and rotations of webs during construction. This situation should be carefully studied by finite element analysis to determine amount and type of movement anticipated during construction. Details should be consistent. Unlike curved girders rotating away from plumb at midspan, girder webs for skewed construction should be kept plumb at piers. The National Steel Bridge Association (NSBA) has published Skewed and Curved Steel I-girder Bridge Fit, which is a good reference on how to deal with fit-up of skewed and curved girders. Consult with the Steel Specialist on what fit-up to specify in the plans for curved and skewed bridges. Straight bridges, fit of girders is not an issue because the webs will remain vertical in all conditions, no-load, steel dead load only, and total dead load.

Plan Details
6.4.1
General Detailing practice shall follow industry standards. Previous plans are a good reference for detailing practices. Detailing should also conform to national unified guidelines published by AASHTO/NSBA Steel Bridge Collaboration listed in Section 6.1.1. Details for plate girders are continually being revised or improved to keep up with changing fabrication practice, labor and material costs, and understanding of fatigue behavior. Uses and demands for steel girder bridges are also changing. Cost benefits for individual details vary from shop to shop and even from time to time. For these reasons, previous plan details can be guides but should not be considered standards. Options should be made available to accommodate all prospective fabricators. For example, small shops prefer shorter, lighter girder segments. Some shops are able to purchase and handle plates over 90 feet long. Large shop assembly may be prohibitive for fabricators without adequate space. WSDOT practice shall be to use field bolted connections. Cross frame members may be shop bolted or welded assemblies and shall be shipped to the field in one unit. Connections of bolted cross frame assemblies shall be fully tensioned prior to shipping. Cross frame assemblies shall be field bolted to girders during erection.
6.4.2
Structural Steel Notes Structural steel notes are dynamic in nature and often change due to changes in design, materials and industry practice. A starting point for Structural Steel Notes can be found in the Standard Design Drawings on the WSDOT Bridge and Structures website and as standards in the drafting system. Since each project has unique requirements, these notes should be edited accordingly. Material specifications are constantly changing. Separate sets of notes are available for bridges to be painted and for weathering steel bridges. Amendments to each are available for box girders. Contact the Steel Specialist for specific questions related to steel notes.
6.4.3
Framing Plan The Framing Plan shall show plan locations of girders, cross frames, and attachments and show ties between the survey line, girder lines, backs of pavement seats, and centerlines of piers. Locate panel points (cross frame locations). Show general arrangement of bottom laterals. Provide geometry, bearing lines, and transverse intermediate stiffener locations. Show field splice locations. Map out different lateral connection details. See Bridge Standard Drawing 6.4-A1.
6.4.4
Girder Elevation The Girder Elevation is used to define flanges, webs, and their splice locations. Show shear connector spacing, location, and number across the flange. Show shear connector locations on flange splice plates or specifically call out when no connectors are required on splice plates. Locate transverse stiffeners and show where they are cut short of tension flanges. Show the tension regions of the girders for the purpose of ordering plate material, inspection methods (NDE), and Bridge Welding Code acceptance criteria. See Charpy V-notch testing requirements of the Standard Specifications. Identify tension welded butt splices for which radiographic examination (RT) is required. See Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(25)A. V and X are also defined in the Structural Steel Notes.

Permissible welded web splices should be shown, however, the optional welded web splice shown on the Girder Details sheet permits the fabricator to add splices subject to approval by the engineer. If there are fracture critical components, they must be clearly identified as FCM. If a member is identified as fracture critical with an “FCM” symbol, it is not necessary to also call the plate or member with a “V” for Charpy-V-Notch as this is covered with the “FCM” designation. See Bridge Standard Drawing 6.4-A2.
6.4.5
Typical Girder Details One or two plan sheets should be devoted to showing typical details to be used throughout the girders. Such details include the weld details, various stiffener plates and weld connections, locations of optional web splices, and drip plate details. Include field splice details here if only one type of splice will suffice for the plans. An entire sheet may be required for bridges with multiple field splice designs. See Bridge Standard Drawings 6.4-A3 and 6.4-A4. Note: Do not distinguish between field bolts and shop bolts. A solid bolt symbol will suffice. Field splices for flanges should accommodate web location tolerance of ± ¼″ per Bridge Welding Code Section 5.5. Allow a minimum of ¼″ for out of position web plus ⅜″ for fillet weld, or a total of ⅝″ minimum clear between theoretical face of web and edge of splice plate. The bottom flange splice plate should be split to allow moisture to drain (use 4 equal bottom flange splice plates). The fill plate does not need to be split. Vertical stiffeners used to connect cross frames are generally 8″ wide to accommodate two bolt rows. They shall be welded to top and bottom flanges to reduce out-of-plane bending of the web. All stiffeners shall be coped, clipped (or cut short in the case of transverse stiffeners without cross frames) a distance between 4tw and 6tw to provide web flexibility, per AASHTO LRFD Article 6.10.11.1.1.
6.4.6
Cross Frame Details Show member sizes, geometrics (work lines and work points), and connection details. Actual lengths of members and dimensions of connections will be determined by the shop plan detailer. Details shall incorporate actual conditions such as skew and neighboring members so that geometric conflicts can be avoided. Double angles shall not be used for cross frames. Cross frames shall be complete subassemblies for field installation. For highly loaded cross frames, such as at piers or between curved girders where single angles or WT sections will not suffice, consider symmetric sections (HSS tubes) with little or no eccentricity in the connections. Where possible, allow for repetitive use of cross frame geometrics, especially hole patterns in stiffener connections, regardless of superelevation transitions. See Bridge Standard Drawing 6.4-A5. Internal cross frames and top lateral systems for box girders are shop welded, primarily. All connection types should be closely examined for detail conflict and weld access. Clearance between bridge deck forming and top lateral members must be considered.
6.4.7
Camber Diagram and Bearing Stiffener Rotation Camber curves shall be detailed using conventional practices. Dimensions shall be given at tenth points. Dimensions may also be given at cross frame locations, which may be more useful in the field. In order to place bearing stiffeners in the vertical position after bridge deck placement, it is necessary to show expected girder rotations at piers. See Bridge Standard Drawing 6.4-A6.

Office practice is to show deflection camber only. Geometric camber for profile grade and superelevation will be calculated by the shop detailer from highway alignment shown on the Layout sheets. A separate diagram and table, with bridge cross section, should be included to show how elevations at edges of deck can be determined just before concrete placement. This will give adjustments to add to profile grades, based on remaining dead load deflections, with deck formwork and reinforcing being present. The camber diagram is intended to be used by the bridge fabricator. The screed setting adjustment diagram is intended to be used by the contractor and inspectors.
6.4.8
Bridge Deck New bridge decks for steel I-girders or box girders shall use Deck Protection System 1. The bridge deck slab is detailed in section and plan views. The current WSDOT policy requires one percent minimum steel be provided for the entire length of the bridge so typically only one section view is required for single or continuous spans. The “pad” dimension for steel girders is treated somewhat differently than for prestressed girders. The pad dimension is assumed to be constant throughout the span length. Ideally, the girder is cambered to compensate for dead loads and vertical curves. However, fabrication and erection tolerances result in considerable deviation from theoretical elevations. The pad dimension is therefore considered only a nominal value and is adjusted as needed along the span once the steel has been erected and profiled. The screed for the slab is to be set to produce correct roadway profile. The plans should reference this procedure contained in Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(39). The pad dimension is to be noted as nominal. As a general rule of thumb, use 11″ for short span bridges (spans less than 150′), 12″ for short to medium span bridges (150′ to 180′), 13″ for medium spans (180′ to 220′) and 14″ to 15″ for long spans (over 220′). These figures are only approximate. Use good engineering judgment when detailing this dimension.
6.4.9
Handrail Details, Inspection Lighting, and Access If required, include handrails with typical girder details. Locations may be adjusted to avoid conflicts with other details such as large gusset plates. Handrail use shall be coordinated with the Bridge Preservation Office (BPO). Often, handrails are not needed if access to all details is possible from under bridge inspection trucks (UBIT’s) although recently the BPO inspection staff has requested handrails on both sides of interior girders and the inside of exterior girders. Easy public access to girder ends and handrails may represent a nuisance. Examine the bridge and site to determine the need for handrails. Fences may be required to deny public access. Box girders require special consideration for inspection access. Access holes or hatches shall be detailed to exclude birds and the public. They shall be positioned where ladders, as a minimum, are required to gain access. If possible locate hatches in girder webs at abutments. Hatches through webs may reduce shear capacity but are easier to use. Webs can be thickened to compensate for section loss. Provide for round trip access and penetrations at all intermediate diaphragms. Openings through girder ends are preferred if space behind end walls permits. Bottom flange hatches are difficult to operate. Pier diaphragms will require openings for easy passage. Access for removing bridge deck formwork shall be planned for. Typically, block-outs in the deck large enough to remove full size plywood are detailed. Block-outs require careful rebar splicing or coupling for

good long term performance. Box girders shall have electrical, inspection lighting, and ventilation details for the aid of inspection and maintenance. Refer to the Design Manual Chapter 1040 for bridge inspection lighting requirements. Coordinate with the Region Design Office to include lighting with the electrical plans. To facilitate inspection, interior paint shall be SAE AMS Standard 595 color number 17925 (white). One-way inspection of all interior spaces should be made possible by round trip in adjoining girders. This requires some form of walkway between boxes and hatch operation from both sides. If locks are needed, they must be keyed to one master. Air vents shall be placed along girder webs to allow fresh air to circulate. Refer to previous projects for details.
6.4.10
Box Girder Details A few details unique to box girders will be presented here. Office practice has been to include a top lateral system in each box, full length of a girder. There is a possibility of reducing some bays of the top laterals in straight girders without sacrificing safety during construction. However, most WSDOT box girders are built to some level of curvature, and the practice of using a full length top lateral system should be adhered to unless a careful stability analysis is undertaken. In the past, the top lateral system was detailed with 6″ to 8″ clearance between lateral work line and bottom of top flange. The intent was to provide adequate clearance for removable deck forming. This requires the introduction of gusset connecting plates with potentially poor fatigue behavior if welded to the web. A cleaner method of attaching the top laterals is by bolting directly to the top flange or intermediate bolted gusset plate (in which case, the lateral members may be welded to the gusset plate). The flange bolting pattern shall be detailed to minimize loss of critical material, especially at interior supports. In order to maximize the clearance for bridge deck forms, all lateral connections should progress down from the bottom surface of the top flange. The haunch distance between top of web and deck soffit shall be 6″ or greater to allow deck forming to clear top lateral members. Supplemental blocking will be required to support deck forms on the typical waler system. See example top lateral details Bridge Standard Drawings 6.4-A11. Ideal girder construction allows full length web and flange plates to be continuously welded without interruption of the welder. This process is routinely accomplished with I-girder shapes, where web stiffeners are attached after top and bottom flanges are welded to the web. With box girders, however, due to handling constraints, most fabrication shops need to progress from top flange-to-web welding, welding stiffeners to webs, and then welding the top flange plus web assemblies to the bottom flange. This introduces a start and stop position at each web stiffener, unless enough clearance is provided for the welder. To achieve this, the stiffener should be held back and attached to the bottom flange by a member brought in after the bottom longitudinal welds are complete. See detail Bridge Standard Drawings 6.4-A11. Small tractor mounted welders are able to run a continuous pass on the bottom external weld, provided there is adequate shelf width. The standard offset between center of web and edge of bottom flange is now 2″. In the past, this weld was primarily performed by hand.

The most significant design difference between I-girders and box girders occur in bottom flange compression regions. Using thicker material to provide stability is not usually economical, given the typically wide unsupported flange widths. The standard practice has been to stiffen relatively thin compression plates with a system of longitudinal and transverse stiffeners. WSDOT practice is to use tee shapes, either singly or in pairs for the wider plates. Ideally, the stiffeners are terminated at bolted field splices. If the stiffener is terminated in a region of live load tension cycles, careful attention needs to be paid to design fatigue stresses and the termination detail. See details Bridge Standard Drawings 6.4-A13. Box girder inside clear height shall be 5 feet or more to provide reasonable inspection access. Less than 5 feet inside clear height is not be permitted. Other girder types and materials shall be investigated. Drain holes shall be installed at all low points. Geometrics for boxes are referenced to a single workline, unless box width tapers. The box cross section remains tied to a centerline intersecting this workline and normal to the bridge deck. The section rotates with superelevation transition rather than warping. See box girder geometrics and proportions Bridge Standard Drawings 6.4-A10. Box girders shall be supported by single centralized bearings when two or more boxes make up the bridge section. This requires diaphragms between boxes for bracing. See pier diaphragm details Bridge Standard Drawings 6.4-A12.

Shop Plan Review Shop plans shall be checked for agreement with the Contract Plans, Standard Specifications, and the Special Provisions. The review procedure is described in Section 1.3.5. Material specifications shall be checked along with plate sizes. Welding procedure specifications (WPS) and procedure qualification records (PQR), when applicable, should be submitted with shop plans. If not, they should be requested so they can be reviewed during the shop plan review process. All the geometry in most shop plans is typically not reviewed in its entirety, however the reviewer should verify that lengths, radii, material types, and sizes shown on shop plans are in general agreement with the contract. The effects of profile grade and camber would make exact verification difficult. Some differences in lengths, between top and bottom flange plates for example, are to be expected. Typically shop plans are submitted as Type 2 Working Drawings. See Standard Specifications Section 1-05.3 for definitions of Working Drawings. Upon completion of the review, the submittal shall be stamped in accordance with the WSDOT Construction Manual Section SS 1-05.3 guidance. The status of the submittal is typically stamped as: 1.
No exceptions taken
2.
Make corrections noted
3.
Revise and resubmit.
When stamping as “Make corrections noted” it is often worthwhile to note whether the shop plan needs to be resubmitted or not.

Painting of Existing Steel Bridges
6.6.1
General With the aging of our existing steel bridge inventory, painting of these existing steel bridges has become a common preservation project requiring PS&E development. The majority of the painting projects are existing steel truss bridges and this section will focus mainly on trusses, however most aspects of this section are also applicable to plate girder and box girder type structures. The existing truss bridges range in complexity from simple span through-truss bridges to complex multi-span, arched deck trusses. As part of the PS&E development, the structures need to be analyzed to ensure the bridge can support the construction loads that will be imposed on the structure. In many instances, the structures will need to remain open to all or partial live load traffic lanes. The existing trusses may require both a vertical and horizontal analysis. The vertical analysis is necessary to ensure the structure can withstand the additional dead and live load from painting construction activities. The horizontal analysis is necessary to ensure the structure can withstand the lateral wind loading imposed on the structure during painting operations. Containment is required to collect all debris and creates a large “sail” area with respect to the truss condition without containment. Wind load limitations must be imposed as part of the Contract documents to ensure the structure is not overloaded while the containment is in place. This will be covered in more detail in Section 6.6.3. In most cases when painting a plate or box girder structure, only a vertical analysis will be required. The containment necessary for plate or box girders will not be substantially larger than the normal exposed wind area of the bridge without containment. Most existing steel structures were originally constructed when lead paint was used as a primer coat for protection of the steel elements. It began to phase out in the 1960’s and was formally banned by the Federal government in 1978. However, lead paint was not removed from WSDOT Standard Specifications until the early 1990s. Structures constructed prior to these dates should be assumed to contain lead based paint. For many years, WSDOT’s practice was to overcoat existing steel structures, including trusses. This involved removal of loose paint and debris, spot sandblasting and priming of areas with visible rust, and then over coating with an intermediate and top coat of paint. WSDOT’s current policy is to require full paint removal on our existing steel structures that have only received overcoat paint applications in the past. This entails full removal of all existing paint, rust, mill scale etc. down to bare metal. Refer to Section 6-07 of the Standard Specifications for more details on full paint removal procedures. Contract Special Provisions should indicate the general paint history of a structure and note that blasting to bare metal has not occurred in the past, several layers of paint may exist on the structure, and no guarantee of total paint thickness can be made. Paint history forms can be obtained from the Bridge Asset Engineer and can be include as “For Information Only” documents. WSDOT’s current policy requires full containment of all blasting and paint debris and shall be in accordance with SSPC Technology Guide No. 6, Guide for Containing Surface Preparation Debris Generated During Paint Removal Operations Class 1. Emissions from the containment are limited to the Level A Acceptance Criteria – Option Level 0 Emissions standard per SSPC Technology Update No. 7. This means no emissions (debris, old paint, sand blast media, etc.) are permitted to escape the containment.

Structural Steel
Vertical Analysis A vertical analysis is typically required when developing plans and specifications for a steel bridge painting project. Cases where a vertical analysis may not be required are when the structure will be closed to live load during construction or when enough lanes will be closed to easily ensure the extra construction load will be less than the live load from the closed lanes. The vertical analysis consists of a load rating of the bridge with added loads for construction dead and live load. The additional dead load is primarily due to containment, access platforms, and equipment. The additional live load is for workers, and debris from abrasive blasting. These are considered live loads because they vary and are not constant. For the vertical analysis, a 25 psf load is typically assumed to account for both dead and live loads. The width of the applied construction load is typically assumed to be the bridge width plus 5 feet on each side. This is only a rule of thumb and can be adjusted, but the assumptions used for the area of construction load must be clearly stated in the plans. If the Contractor chooses to use a wider or narrower width of platform, then they can adjust the allowable construction load proportionally. Construction load can also be increased if the structure allows or decreased if 25 psf creates rating concerns. The minimum reasonable construction load should be at least 20 psf. The load rating analysis is only performed for legal vehicles, which include the AASHTO 1, 2 and 3 vehicles and the NRL. In some cases, additional vehicles may need to be included in the rating on a case-by-case basis including emergency vehicles. The construction load is subtracted from the member capacity in the numerator of the typical load rating equation. In most cases the LRFR rating method should be used. The designer should assume the construction load is applied to the entire length of the structure. This allows the contractor the most flexibility in constructing the work access and containment. In some cases, this may not be possible due to load rating limitations and only specific zones will be permitted to be loaded with the additional construction load. Again, these limitations need to be clearly stated on the contract plans. As with a typical load rating, the rating should include the primary truss members, the floor system and the primary member gusset plates. The designer should check with the WSDOT Bridge Preservation office’s Load Rating Engineer to obtain the latest load rating information. Often, an existing rating can be easily modified to add in construction loads or existing structural models can be utilized as part of the analysis. In addition to the global analysis of the structure for the added construction load, analysis of localized loads on individual members may be required. The number of support points and maximum applied loads for individual stringers, floor beams or truss elements will need to be outlined in the Contract plans. The most common approach is to provide maximum loads and spacing of support points. The Contractor will need to analyze the local attachment to the member based on his construction methods and particular attachment detail. Alternatively, maximum additional shear or moment demands on specific members can be provided, however maximum loads and support point spacing is typically preferred by the Contractor.

Chapter 6
Horizontal Analysis As discussed previously, and primarily with truss type structures, a horizontal wind analysis will need to be performed to ensure the structure can resist wind loads while the containment is in place, which creates a large wind or “sail” area on the bridge. As part of the analysis, the amount of bridge to be contained needs to be determined and at what maximum wind speed the containment side walls need to be removed to provide an acceptable level of safety. This is particularly important with long span trusses and trusses with varying depths such as arch deck trusses or camel back trusses. Currently the Standard Specifications limit the amount of containment to one span unless otherwise specified. In some cases more or less than one span can be contained. It is possible that a Contractor may want to contain portions of multiple spans or they may want to maintain a constant containment length, but progressively move the containment down the length of the bridge. This can create many different loading conditions on the structure. A full rigorous analysis can always be performed for the horizontal analysis taking into account member capacities and demands; however a simplified method has been successfully employed in the past and will be described herein. The following is a basic outline of the process followed by a more detailed description for each step. Basic Outline: 1. Compute the AASHTO LRFD design wind pressure for the bridge elements based on the existing site conditions. 2. Apply the wind pressure to the bridge elements and calculate total horizontal wind shear at each support location. 3. Utilize the total design wind shear at each support as the allowable upper bound horizontal wind loading. Assume locations for containment. Back calculate a reduced wind speed that results in the same or lower horizontal wind shear at each pier. Compute for the various containment conditions. Determine allowable containment areas and associated maximum wind speeds during construction. These maximum wind speeds will be the forecast wind speed value that triggers the Contractor to remove or lower the containment side walls. Detailed Discussion: The following discussion provides more detail to the outlined steps above. In the past Excel spreadsheets have been used for the analysis and have proven to be an efficient tool for this simplified analysis. Steps 1, 2 & 3: Determining the design horizontal wind shear at each pier or support location requires computing the exposed surface area of the existing truss members, floor system and any barrier or rail. The design wind pressure, Pz, to apply to the surface area should be computed based on the latest AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications for the Strength III Limit State. The wind speed to use in the calculation of wind pressure should be obtained from AASHTO LRFD Figure 3.8.1.1.2-1. The Wind Exposure Category and Ground Surface Roughness Category will need to be selected based on judgment of the existing site. The Drag Coefficients will vary depending on the member and can be found in AASHTO LRFD Table 3.8.1.2.1-2. Typically for truss members the sharp-edged member coefficient is used, whereas the I-girder Superstructure coefficient is used for the floor system and barrier.

The computed design wind pressure is applied to each member or bridge element to compute a horizontal shear per member. For simplicity, the individual member horizontal shear can be distributed to each pier or support by assuming simple span boundary conditions for each span, regardless if the truss is continuous over the pier(s). The load is assumed to be applied at the mid-length of the member when computing horizontal distances to the pier. The summation of all member shear forces is calculated for each pier and can be considered the maximum allowable shear force per pier or support. The calculated maximum shears will be based on the latest AASHTO wind speeds and could be higher than the original design. As a good check, the designer should review the existing stress sheets as they often will have design wind shear for the bearings. These forces will be Service level demands and should be compared with unfactored calculated demands. If no data is available, old versions of the AASHTO code in the WSDOT Bridge Office archives can be reviewed to determine design wind speeds and or pressures used when the structure was originally constructed. Historically a wind pressure of 50psf was used on trusses. The designer can then make a judgment as to what maximum shear value should be used for comparison in the next steps. Regardless of which maximum wind shear is to be used, a safety (or resistance) factor of 0.80 should be applied to the maximum permissible shear forces. Overturning stability of a bridge should be calculated at each pier, especially when the truss has significant depth, has a variable depth, or the ratio of truss line horizontal spacing to truss vertical depth is less than 1/5. Overturning forces have been computed on previous projects and have been found to not be of concern and no uplift conditions on the bearings were encountered. Step 4: Once the upper bound horizontal shear force per pier has been determined, analysis of the containment areas can be computed. Simple Spans Structures: For a simple span truss, it is recommended the designer start by assuming the entire span is covered with containment. For the total containment height, assume a vertical distance from 5 feet below the truss bottom chords to 5 feet above the top of bridge superstructure. Using the total containment area, calculate the associated wind pressure that results in the previously determined maximum shear at the pier or support. From this wind pressure, back calculate the corresponding wind speed. For containment areas use a drag coefficient for I-Girder Superstructures when back calculating wind speed. This drag coefficient most closely represents a flat surface created by the containment. This value is the maximum wind speed that can be allowed on the structure before the Contractor will be required to remove or lower the containment side walls. The Contract Specifications and Special Provisions require the Contractor to monitor forecasted wind speeds and gusts and are required to act accordingly if speeds over the maximum are expected. As a rule of thumb, 30 to 35 mph has been successfully used as maximum wind speeds on several projects. However, removal of containment can be time consuming and expensive for the Contractor. A more desirable maximum wind speed is in the range of 45 to 50 mph. The Contractor may not necessarily be working in these conditions, but will allow them to safely leave the containment in place. Multi-span, Long-span, Variable Depth or Complex Geometry Structures: These types of truss structures typically require more analysis due to the many containment scenarios that could be employed on the structure. In many cases only portions of the span will or can be contained. When computing shear forces at the piers or supports, the portion Page 6-42

Chapter 6
contained and the members not contained will need to be included in the analysis. This is where an Excel spreadsheet can be a handy tool. In past analyses, each bay of the truss has been set up with essentially an “on or off” switch. If on, the total area of the truss bay or panel is assumed contained and the associated area and distances from the center of the bay are used to calculate horizontal wind shear at the piers. If off, only the truss members within the bay are assumed to be loaded with wind pressure. Shear forces are combined and total shear at the pier is computed. This tool allows many containment scenarios to be investigated at various wind pressures and speeds. As discussed earlier, the Contractor will often want to contain a constant length of the bridge, but will move the containment progressively along the length. As discussed with the simple spans, a wind pressure and corresponding wind speed can be back-calculated and used as the maximum allowable construction wind speed. For further questions on the analysis methods, and what method may be appropriate for a given structure, discuss with the Steel Specialist.
6.6.4
Special Considerations 6.6.4.A
Coast Guard
Coast Guard permits will be required for any painting project over a navigable waterway. The containment will typically extend below the structure thereby reducing the vertical and/or horizontal clearance of the navigation channel. Temporary navigation lights may also be required as part of the project as existing lights may be covered by containment. The WSDOT Coast Guard Liaison should be contacted early in the design process so there is sufficient time to procure the necessary permits. When a moveable span is included in the project, such as a bascule, lift, or swing bridge, the operation of the moveable span may need to be modified during the contract. This will require either a deviation or rule change to the operation of the bridge. The deviation can be handled at the local level and allows for changes up to 6 months. If changes to the operation of the bridge are required for longer than 6 months, a temporary rule change will be required and will need approval at the national level. 6.6.4.B
Moveable Spans
When working with moveable spans, consideration for machinery and span balancing must be considered. For most moveable bridges, counterweights are necessary to balance the span while it is being lifted or swung open. This is to keep the span operating smoothly and to reduce demand on the machinery and associated components. The Bridge Preservation Office should be contacted to discuss the specifics of the project. In some cases measurements of the bridge machinery must be taken prior to any work starting and then again after painting is complete and prior to operating. Removing all the existing paint can change the weight and balance of the span and adjustments to the counterweights may be required. The machinery will also need to be protected during painting operations, particularly sandblasting. Sandblasting can severely damage bearings, gears, motors etc. if not protected. These elements are typically excluded from the project painting limits. Operation of the moveable spans with containment in place is typically not permitted. This will need to be coordinated with the Coast Guard and durations where the span is inoperable should be minimized to avoid impacts to the marine traffic. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 6-43

Structural Steel
6.6.4.C
Traffic Control
Traffic Control options will need to be discussed with the Region early in the project, particularly with through-truss type bridges. Ideally the bridge can be closed during the painting operation; however that is not the norm. In most cases all or partial lanes will need to remain open during the painting project. This will control the amount and location of containment the Contractor will be permitted to install. The trade-off is the overall duration of the project. If several containment set-ups are required, the longer the project duration and number of working days required. 6.6.4.D
Review of Construction Submittals
The Standard Specifications requires a comprehensive painting plan be submitted by the Contractor for all painting projects. Included in the submittal will be the engineered containment plans. These will need to be reviewed carefully to ensure the limitations outlined in the Contract have been followed. In many cases, attachments to existing piers, bearings or walls are required as part of the containment support system to resist horizontal forces. These attachment locations and associated calculations also need careful review to ensure no damage will occur to existing elements. 6.6.4.E
Structural Steel Repairs
The designer should review the existing inspection reports for the bridge(s) included in the painting project to determine if structural repairs are required and would be appropriate to add to the scope of work. In addition, the design engineer should consider a site visit to review and inspect the existing structure during the design effort. The designer should consult with the Bridge Preservation Office to coordinate the site visit (traffic control, UBIT or other equipment needs). During the site visit the designer should verify any repair areas identified in the inspection reports and look for additional areas that may need repairs. An assessment of the condition of the existing rivets and amount of existing pack rust should be made to help in estimating quantities for the project. In most cases it will be difficult to inspect the entire bridge, but representative areas can be inspected and evaluated and then extrapolated to the entire structure. The Bridge Asset Management Engineer should be consulted as to available funding for structural repairs. If known structural repairs are not required, all paint projects should include a bid item for Misc. Steel Repairs to account for items that are discovered during the painting operations. Typically this bid item is included as a Force Account item so that WSDOT can direct the work when needed repairs are identified. In addition, existing rivets that are corroded or loose should be replaced during the contract. A detail is provided in the plans that outlines in what condition a rivet should be removed and replaced with a high strength bolt. All rivets being replaced with high strength bolts should be replaced with galvanized bolts. Tension control “twist–off” bolts shall not be permitted. Use of galvanized bolts avoids having to go back and sandblast the black bolts in preparation for prime paint in areas that have already been blasted and primed. Refer to Standard Drawing 6.4-A16 for details on evaluation and replacement of existing rivets. Rivets shall be evaluated after blasting and priming operations. In many cases rivet deterioration can't be evaluated until after blasting operations are completed. However, to avoid flash rust on the newly blasted steel, the Contractor will need to prime the existing surfaces prior to any evaluation inspection can occur. The rivet evaluation and repair work shall be included in a separate per each bid item.

Chapter 6
The engineer should review the inspection reports to determine a reasonable estimate for number of rivets in addition to any assessments made during a site visit. Consult with the Steel Specialist if the inspection reports do not have an estimated quantity of deteriorated rivets. The Misc. Steel Repair Force Account bid item should be included to cover any unforeseen structural repairs. Known structural repairs are typically included as a Lump Sum bid item based on estimated steel weight.
6.6.5
Quantities and Estimates As part of the PS&E development, quantities of surface area will need to be calculated for the entire bridge. This can be a time consuming effort but is necessary to estimate project costs and durations. On truss bridges, it is typically sufficient to compute the surface areas of the members from panel point to panel point and ignore the gusset plates. Detailed comparisons have been performed and when a member length between panel points is used, the area of the gusset plates is typically accounted for. A factor for miscellaneous area in the range of 5% to 15% can be added depending on the complexity of the bridge to cover connections, bolt or rivet surfaces, and any miscellaneous items not accounted for in the surface quantity take-off. Once the quantity of surface area is computed, the Specification and Estimate Engineers should be consulted and can provide estimates on cost. When estimating schedules, experience from previous painting projects can be used as a guide. A good rule of thumb is to assume one painting crew consisting of 6-8 people can complete 250SF of surface area per 8 hour shift. This would include set-up and takedown of containment, blasting and painting. From these initial estimates, durations can be estimated for the entire project by adjusting number of crews on the project and number of shifts worked per day. The engineer/estimator must take into account the practical limitations of a given project. For example, a simple span truss will have limited amount of access and/or crews that can be working at one time. Alternatively a large multi-span truss may have several crews working or several shifts per day. Constraints at a particular site will also need to be considered in the working day estimate. Limitations on night work may be required due to noise concerns. The sandblasting operation is loud and often exceeds the noise limits, particularly in populated areas.

Corrosion of Steel Foundations and Buried Structures
6.7.1
Corrosion of Steel Foundations The following section provides corrosion rates for the design of steel H-piling, pipe piling, concrete filled steel tubes (CFSTs), and sheet piling. The design wall, flange, and web thickness, as applicable, for structural steel sections shall be reduced for corrosion over a 75-year minimum design life. The remaining steel thickness at 75 years shall be sufficient to resist the anticipated design loads. Minimum corrosion rates for section loss are specified in Table 6.7-1 below. Table 6.7-1
Section Loss (inch per year)
Location Soil embedded zone (undisturbed soil) Soil embedded zone (fill or disturbed soils) Immersed zone Tidal zone Splash zone Atmospheric
Marine or NonMarine: Corrosive 0.001 0.0015 0.003 0.004 0.006 0.002
Non-Marine: Non-Corrosive 0.0005 0.00075 0.0015
----0.001
Definitions of the terms used in Table 6.7-1 are as follows:
• Marine – a site is considered a marine environment if the structure is less than 1000 feet measured from the surface or edge of salt or brackish water. Water shall be considered brackish if the chloride concentration is measured at 500 ppm or greater measured at mean tide level or higher.
• Non-Marine: Corrosive – a non-marine site is greater than 1000 feet from salt or brackish water and is considered corrosive if one or more of the following conditions exist based on representative soil and/or water samples: 1.
The chloride concentration is 500 ppm or greater,
2.
The sulfate concentration is 1500 ppm or greater,
3.
The pH is 5.5 or less.
If none of the following conditions exist, the site is considered non-marine: noncorrosive. Refer to Section 6.7.2.1 for information on appropriate testing procedures.
• Immersed zone – portion of structural steel element which is continuously immersed or submerged in water. Immersed non-marine: non-corrosive are environments with fresh water or are tested and found not to meet the marine or non-marine: corrosive values.
• Tidal zone – portion of structural steel element in a marine environment between the Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) and the Mean High Water (MHW) based on the MLLW Datum.
• Splash zone – portion of structural steel element in a marine environment located above the MHW plus five additional feet or as otherwise determined for a specific site.
• Atmospheric - portion of structural steel element above the splash zone or above ground line as applicable. Page 6-46

Chapter 6
The section loss for H-piling and sheet piling shall be doubled to account for both surfaces being exposed. For piling exposed on one face and against the soil on the opposite, the appropriate exposure section loss values can be used per side and then added for a total loss. The interior surface of pipe piling and CFSTs are assumed to be sealed by concrete fill or a soil plug, which prevents sufficient oxygen to support significant corrosion. A micro-pile is considered a subset of pipe piles. The corrosion rates are based on information published in the CALTRANS , Corrosion Guidelines, version 3.0, the FHWA NHI-16-009 Design and Construction of Driven Pile Foundations - Volume I, and the Washington State Ferries Terminal Design Manual, 2016. A site-specific assessment should be performed to determine if a site is considered marine, non-marine: corrosive, or non-corrosive. If a site investigation is not performed, the values for a marine/non-marine: corrosive site shall be used unless otherwise approved by the State Bridge Design Engineer. Sampling of a site for corrosion assessment requires samples of the soil and/or water to be obtained from both the surface and subsurface materials to ensure representation of the strata at the site. Water samples in flowing streams and rivers shall not be taken when the water level is elevated due to storm conditions as they may dilute the chemical concentrations. The potential for scour need not be considered when choosing a design corrosion rate as it relates to zones of exposure. It is assumed any significant scour would be repaired and the applicable zone of a structural element would not be changed. However, if abrasion on the section is a concern, additional wall thickness should be considered. Refer to the discussion on abrasion in Section 6.7.2.5 for more guidance. A protective coating may be applied to the structural steel sections to increase the corrosion protection. If a coating is utilized, then the section loss corrosion is assumed to begin at the end of the effective life of the coating. Coating effective life is generally assumed to be 15 years. An appropriate coating system shall be specified to withstand damage from handling and driving. Contact the WSDOT Steel Specialist for recommendations on paint systems and coating thicknesses for use on steel piling. Coating requirements for steel piles in soldier pile walls (cantilever and tie-back) is covered by the Standard Specifications Section 6-16.3(4). Any portion of the pile embedded in concrete or CDF need not consider corrosion or section loss, but portions adjacent to the soil or exposed to the atmosphere shall consider section loss for the design life of the structure.
6.7.2
Corrosion and Abrasion of Metal Buried Structures Metal buried structures consist of steel or aluminum structural plate pipes, arches, and boxes and shall be designed in conformance with Section 12 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. Once a structural shape, size, material, and gage are selected, the designer shall perform a service life analysis to ensure a minimum structure service life of 75 years is provided. Issues affecting the service life include corrosive action of the exterior and interior environments and abrasive action of the hydraulic flow adjacent to the structure. Metal buried structures consisting of steel structural plate shall not be used in Marine and Non-Marine: Corrosive environments as defined in Section 6.7.1.

6.7.2.A
Corrosion
The design service life analysis shall include a check on both the outside or backfill and the inside or water side environments to determine which governs. The characteristics of the soil and water in contact with the structure that can contribute to corrosion include, but are not limited to, soluble salts, sulfates, soil and water resistivity, soil and water pH, and the presence of oxygen. During design, corrosion investigations of in-situ soils, fill material (native or imported) to be used as backfill, soils/materials to be used inside the buried structure and any water flowing into or around the structure shall be performed. Soils shall meet the requirements of Standard Specification 6-20.3(6) and 6-20.3(9)A. Soil and water sampling and testing procedures shall follow the requirements of the following or other approved test protocol: 1.
WSDOT T 417 (resistivity and pH of soil and water)
2.
CALTRANS Test 643 (resistivity of soil and water)
3.

9.

Water samples shall not be taken when the water level is elevated due to storm conditions as this may dilute chemical concentrations. 6.7.2.B
Steel Structures
For galvanized steel buried structures, once the controlling pH and resistivity values of the environment are determined, the designer shall utilize the chart in Figure 6.7-1 to determine the estimated service life of the structure. The chart is based on 18 gage galvanized sheet steel. If a gage thicker than 18 is used, the thickness factor table within the chart can be used as a multiplier on the estimated service life. Note: CALTRANS developed thickness modification factors up to 8 gage, which were then interpolated out to 1 gage by CONTECH Engineered Solutions. Thicknesses greater than 1 gage shall use the factors for 1 gage. If the estimated service life is less than 75 years, additional thickness shall be added beyond what is required for structural demands to achieve the 75 year service life. For aluminized steel buried structures, using aluminum-coated (Type 2) sheet steel in accordance with AASHTO M274, the service life and resistance to corrosion is generally more than galvanized steel structures. A similar chart and methodology can be used for aluminum coated structures and is found in Figure 6.7-2. The chart is based on 16 gage aluminized sheet steel. If a gage thicker than 16 is used, the thickness factor table within the chart can be used as a multiplier on the estimated service life. The service life is based on years to first perforation.

Chapter 6
Aluminum-coated steel structures should generally only be used when environmental conditions have a pH between 5 and 9 and a resistivity greater than 1500 ohm-cm. Recent studies documented in the National Corrugated Steel Pipe Association (NCSPA) Pipe Selection Guide indicated that 14 gage aluminum-coated structures can achieve over 75 year service life in these environmental conditions. The WSDOT Hydraulics Manual also recommends aluminum-coated pipe only be used with pH between 5 and 8.5 and soil resistivity greater than 1000 ohm-cm. These recommendations are based on assumed 50 year service life. 6.7.2.C
Aluminum Alloy Structures
Aluminum alloy plate has been shown to be more resistant to corrosion than either galvanized or aluminized steel. A chart for determining service life, similar to that for galvanized and aluminized steel, is located in Figure 6.7-3. The chart is based on 16 gage aluminum alloy plate and as with the aluminum-coated chart, the service life is based on years to first perforation. The chart was developed for aluminum pipe (Al-Clad 7072/3004) but is applicable to aluminum structural plate (5050 alloy). Aluminum alloy plate structures should generally only be used when environmental conditions have a pH between 4.5 and 9 and a resistivity greater than 500 ohm-cm. There is no upper limit on resistivity as soft water is not a concern. Figure 6.7-1

Alternative Coatings and Mitigation for De-icing Salts
Alternate coatings for buried metal structures, such as polymer, asphalt, concrete linings, and others are also available but are not discussed in detail in this section. The designer will need to evaluate the corrosion and abrasive potential and select the appropriate coating to achieve a 75 year service design life. If a coating is utilized, then the section loss corrosion and/or abrasion is assumed to begin at the end of the effective life of the coating. Any alternative coating selected shall be approved by the WSDOT Bridge Design Office. When a metal buried structure supports a roadway, and the minimum Fill Depth, as defined in Section 8.3, is less than 8 feet, a protection against roadway de-icing salts and chlorides by one of the following methods shall be provided:
• Providing an impermeable geomembrane with welded seams in the backfill over the Buried Structure that is sloped to drain water away from the Structure. The membrane shall be a minimum 30 mil thick polyvinyl chloride, ethylene interpolymer alloy, or polyurethane polymer, or a combination of these polymers.
• Preventing Roadway drainage from entering into the fill above the Buried Structure.
• Providing additional metal plate thickness. Regional WSDOT Maintenance staff shall be consulted to determine the type and frequency of de-icing salts used for the site specific location. 6.7.2.E
Abrasion
In addition to service life analysis for corrosion, abrasion of the invert and side walls shall be investigated. The designer shall consider the potential for lateral stream migration when considering abrasion on side walls. Abrasion risk and mitigation shall be considered the same for galvanized or aluminized steel and for aluminum plate structures. Three factors that must combine to cause abrasion include: 1.
Abrasive bed load
2.
Sufficient stream velocity to carry the bed load
3.
Flow duration and frequency
The WSDOT Hydraulics Manual M 23-03.06 (2019) provides guidelines for abrasion levels and the general site characteristics, which are described below: 1.
Level 1 - Nonabrasive: areas of little or no bed load and very low velocities of 3 feet per second (fps) or less. Slopes are generally less than 1 percent. This condition can be assumed for the soil side of the structure.
2.
Level 2 - Low abrasive: areas of minor bed loads of sand, silts and clays with velocities less than 6 fps and slopes generally range from 1 percent to 2 percent.
3.
Level 3 - Moderate abrasive: areas of moderate bed loads of sand and gravel with stone sizes up to approximately 3 inches and velocities between 6 and 15 fps. Slopes generally range from 2 percent to 4 percent.
4.
Level 4 - Severe abrasive: areas of heavy bed loads of sand, gravel, and rock with stone sizes up to 12 inches and larger and velocities exceeding 15 fps. Slopes are generally greater than 4 percent.

Stream velocities shall be based upon typical flows and water surface elevations for a 2-year event, minimum. For Abrasion Levels 1 and 2, no additional protection is required. For Abrasion Level 3, the thickness of the material shall be increased by one or two gages (approximately 1/64 inch) and/or a concrete lining shall be used. Alternatively, other protection such as streambed material or stilling basins are acceptable with the approval of the WSDOT Bridge Design Office. For Abrasion Level 4, abrasion protection shall be provided such as increased gage thickness, alternative materials, coatings, concrete linings, etc. and shall require approval of the WSDOT Bridge Design Office.

General Substructure Considerations Note that in the following guidelines where reference is made to AASHTO LRFD the item can be found in the current AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications (LRFD). And for any reference to AASHTO Seismic, the item can be found in the current AASHTO Guide Specifications for LRFD Seismic Bridge Design (SEISMIC).
7.1.1
Foundation Design Process A flowchart is provided in which illustrates the overall design process utilized by the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office to accomplish an LRFD foundation design. Note this process is also outlined in the Geotechnical Design Manual Section 8.2. The Bridge and Structures Office (BSO), the WSDOT Geotechnical Branch (GB) and the WSDOT Hydraulics Branch (HB) have been abbreviated. The steps in the flowchart are defined as follows: 7.1.1.A
Scoping Level Design
This phase of the design process involves the region requesting initial bridge options and costs for a future project. Depending on the complexity of the project, this phase could include a Type, Size and Location (TS&L) Report. This design step may result in informal communication between the BSO and the GB and/ or HB with the request for preliminary information and recommendations. The level of communication will depend on the available information provided by the region and the complexity of the project. The type of information that may be received from the GB and HB are as follows:
• Anticipated soil site conditions.
• Maximum embankment slopes.
• Possible foundation types and geotechnical hazards such as liquefaction.
• Scour potential for piers if a water crossing.
• Potential for future migration of a stream or river crossing. In general, these recommendations rely on existing site data. Site borings may not be available and test holes are drilled later. The GB provides enough information to select potential foundation types for an initial scoping level or TS&L level plan and estimate. 7.1.1.B
Develop Site Data and Preliminary Bridge Plan
In the second phase, the BSO obtains site data from the region, see Section 2.2, and develops the preliminary bridge plan. The preliminary pier locations determine soil boring locations at this time. The GB and/or the HB may require the following information to continue their preliminary design.
• Structure type and magnitude of settlement the structure can tolerate (both total and differential).
• At abutments – Approximate maximum top of foundation elevation.
• At interior piers – The initial size, shape and number of columns and how they are configured with the foundation (e.g., whether a single foundation element supports each column, or one foundation element supports multiple columns) WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Substructure Design
• At water crossings – Pier scour depth, if known, and any potential for migration of the water crossing in the future. Typically, the GB and the BSO should coordinate pursuing this information with the HB.
• Any known structural constraints that affect the foundation type, size, or location.
• Any known constraints that affect the soil resistance (utilities, construction staging, excavation, shoring, and falsework). 7.1.1.C
Preliminary Foundation Design
The third phase is a request by the BSO for a preliminary foundation memorandum. The GB memo will provide preliminary soil data required for structural analysis and modeling. This includes any subsurface conditions and the preliminary subsurface profile. The concurrent geotechnical work at this stage includes:
• Completion of detailed boring logs and laboratory test data.
• Development of foundation type, soil capacity, and foundation depth.
• Development of static/seismic soil properties and ground acceleration.
• Recommendations for constructability issues. The BSO may also request the HB to provide preliminary scour design recommendations if the structure is located over a water crossing. 7.1.1.D
Structural Analysis and Modeling
In the fourth phase, the BSO performs a structural analysis of the superstructure and substructure using a bridge model and preliminary soil parameters. Through this modeling, the designer determines loads and sizes for the foundation based on the controlling LRFD limit states. Structural and geotechnical design continues to investigate constructability and construction staging issues during this phase. In order to produce a final geotechnical report, the BSO provides the following structural feedback to the State Geotechnical Engineer:
• Foundation loads for service, strength, and extreme limit states.
• Foundation size/diameter and depth required to meet structural design.
• Foundation details that could affect the geotechnical design of the foundations.
• Foundation layout plan.
• Assumed scour depths for each limit state (if applicable) For water crossings, the BSO also provides the information listed above to the State Hydraulic Engineer to verify initial scour and hydraulics recommendations are still suitable for the site. (See Chapter 2 for examples of pile design data sheets that shall be filled out and submitted to the State Geotechnical Engineer at the early stage of design.)

Final Foundation Design
The last phase completes the geotechnical report and allows the final structural design to begin. The preliminary geotechnical assumptions are checked and recommendations are modified, if necessary. The final report is complete to a PS&E format since the project contract will contain referenced information in the geotechnical report, such as:
• All geotechnical data obtained at the site (boring logs, subsurface profiles, and laboratory test data).
• All final foundation recommendations.
• Final constructability and staging recommendations. The designer reviews the final report for new information and confirms the preliminary assumptions. With the foundation design complete, the final bridge structural design and detailing process continues to prepare the bridge plans. Following final structural design, the structural designer shall follow up with the geotechnical designer to ensure that the design is within the limits of the geotechnical report.
7.1.2
Foundation Design Limit States The controlling limit states for WSDOT projects for substructure design are described as follows: Strength I		 Strength III Strength V		 Extreme-Event I Service I
7.1.3
Relating to the normal vehicular use Relating to the bridge exposed to wind Relating to the normal vehicular use and wind Relating to earthquake Relating to normal operational use and wind
Seismic Design The seismic design of all substructures shall be in accordance with the AASHTO Seismic except as noted otherwise.
7.1.4
Substructure and Foundation Loads Figure 7.1.4-1 below provides a common basis of understanding for load location and orientations for substructure design. This figure also shows elevations required for abutment and substructure design. Note that for shaft and some pile foundation designs, the shaft or pile may form the column as well as the foundation element. Spread footings usually have a design orientation normal to the footing. Since bridge loads are longitudinal and transverse, skewed superstructure loads are converted (using vector components) to normal and parallel footing loads. Deep foundation analysis usually has a normal/parallel orientation to the pier in order to simplify group effects. Substructure elements are to carry all of the loads specified in AASHTO Seismic and AASHTO LRFD. Selecting the controlling load conditions requires good judgment to minimize design time. All anticipated dead load (DC) conditions shall be accounted for during a substructure design. Sidesway effect shall be included where it tends to increase stresses. For live loads (LL), the dynamic allowance (IM) shall be applied in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 3.6.2 and is not included in the design of buried elements of the substructure. Portions of the abutments in contact with the soil are considered buried elements.

Substructure Design
Chapter 7
Bridge design shall consider construction loads to ensure structural stability and prevent members from overstress. For example, temporary construction loads caused by placing all of the precast girders on one side of a crossbeam can overload a single column pier. Construction loads shall also include live loads from potential construction equipment. The plans shall show a construction sequence and/or notes to avoid unacceptable loadings. On curved bridges, the substructure design shall consider the eccentricity resulting from the difference in girder lengths and the effects of torsion. When superstructure design uses a curved girder theory, such as the V-Load Method, the reactions from such analysis must be included in the loads applied to the substructure. Figure 7.1.4-1
