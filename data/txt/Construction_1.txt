Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Engineering and Regional Operations State Construction Office
Foreword This manual is provided for our construction engineering personnel as instruction for fulfilling the objectives, procedures, and methods for construction administration of Washington State transportation projects. This manual contains two kinds of instructions depending on the subject matter and the nature of the work. In one case, where the activity is the inspection of contract work that is critical from a structural or operational viewpoint, the instructions prescribe detailed methods and procedures, or detailed performance measures, designed to assure the objective of a safe and adequate finished product. In other cases, typically in the areas of documentation and payment, the instructions are limited to describing the necessary objectives of the work without specifying the methods or procedures. The Construction Manual is intended as a reference book that is consistent with the language and intent of the Standard Specifications. In order to use this reference effectively, it is essential that the user has a thorough understanding of the contract, contract plans, contract provisions, and the Standard Specifications, as well as this manual. Where specific methods and procedures are not included, the intent of this manual is to provide the project staff with a statement of the outcomes required and to allow the Region Construction Management and the Project Engineer to devise procedures accordingly. This manual provides basic instruction for identifying policies or laws that affect the construction administration work, however, the manual generally does not interpret these policies or laws. Compliance with policies, laws, and regulations is the duty of the Project Engineer, who may call on others, especially those authorized to enforce laws and regulations, at any time for assistance. In order to respond to the many situations that may arise on different contracts with different types of work, the instruction provided by this manual is general in character and is not to be construed as replacing, modifying, or superseding any of the provisions of the contract, contract plans, contract provisions, or Standard Specifications. Decisions to deviate from the instruction provided in this manual must be based on engineering judgment and supportable as representing the best interests of the public and are to be made by the individual with appropriate authority. Comments about the manual are always welcome and will be considered in future updates.

Purpose and Scope of Manual This manual is published by the State Construction Office as a resource for construction engineering personnel. It provides instruction for administering Washington State transportation projects, recognizes established standards and describes accepted engineering practices. The instruction provided by this manual identifies desired results, establishes standardized requirements, and provides statewide uniformity in the administration and construction of transportation related contracts. Chapters 1 through 8 of the Construction Manual are organized with two types of content. General information that isn’t tied to any specific Section of the Standard Specifications is prefaced by “GEN” in the Section number. Information that is intended to complement and expand on sections of the Standard Specifications is prefaced by a “SS” in the section number. Not all sections of the Standard Specifications are addressed in the Construction Manual. Construction engineering staff should be familiar with the guidance and instructions included in this manual. The guidance presented by this manual complements the requirements of the Standard Specifications and the Contract Provisions and promotes uniformity of results among all Regions of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). Suggestions for corrections, additions, or improvements to this manual and to the Standard Specifications or General Special Provisions are welcomed and should be submitted to the State Construction Office in the form of a Word document in “track changes” format.
GEN 1-00.2
Definition of Terms Definitions of words or terms should be the same as set forth under “Definitions and Terms” in Standard Specifications Section 1-01. If a conflict occurs between the guidance or instructions offered by this manual and the Specifications or provisions identified in the Contract, the latter will always prevail. Unless exclusively stated in the Request for Proposal documents of a Design Build Contract, any reference of the Project Engineer in this manual will mean the WSDOT Project Engineer.

GEN 1-00.4(2) Regional Construction Manager In supervision of construction, the Regional Administrator is assisted by a Regional Construction Manager. The Regional Construction Manager, or those delegated Regional Construction Manager authority, assigns Project Engineers with appropriate supporting personnel and provides training and guidance to the Project Engineers. It is the responsibility of the Regional Construction Manager to ensure that sufficient personnel are provided on all projects at all times to ensure adequate inspection, documentation, and quality controls. GEN 1-00.4(3) Regional Administration of the Inspector Certification Program Goal – The purpose of the Inspector Certification Program is to provide training and resources for Construction Inspectors and to provide examinations to confirm the Inspector’s knowledge. This will ensure consistent administration of highway construction contracts. The monitoring of construction activities by Certified Inspectors will help to ensure that only quality materials and workmanship are employed on WSDOT construction projects. Definitions Director of the Construction Division (Director) – Individual delegated authority from the Secretary of Transportation to administer the Department’s Construction Program. Region Inspector Certification Manager (RICM) – Individual designated by the Director of the Construction Division to coordinate all construction training and Inspector Certification in that Region. Region Inspector Certification Official (RICO) – Appointing authority for Region Construction Project Engineers or an individual delegated this responsibility by the appointing authority. Department – Washington State Department of Transportation. There are two types of Inspectors, Interim Inspectors and those enrolled in the Inspector Certification Program (ICP). There are two different levels of certification, General and Divisional. An Interim Inspector is a person assigned to work under the supervision of a WSDOT Certified Inspector. This person may be a temporary employee, seasonal employee or permanent employee within the Department. Interim Inspectors should be considered for inclusion within the Inspector Certification Program. Interim Inspectors at the Transportation Technician 3 In-Training level and above may only serve as Interim Inspectors for six months before being required to obtain certification as a General Inspector. An Inspector is entered into the ICP through the Washington State Learning Center (TLC) Learning Management System (LMS). The employee’s supervisor will contact their Region Trainer who will assign the certification tests via the TLC.

Chapter 1
The Inspector will become certified as a General Inspector once they have successfully demonstrated proficiency by achieving a passing score of 75 percent on each open book examination for the following subjects:
• Technical Mathematics
• Contract Plans Reading
• Basic Surveying
• Composing an Inspector’s Daily Report
• Force Account Documentation and Payment
• Materials Documentation
• Inspector’s Role for Change Order Work
• Inspector Safety
• Utilizing Resources
• Environmental The Inspector may either take the courses first and then take the examination or take the examination without taking the course. If the Inspector does not achieve a passing score on an examination, they may retake that examination after waiting three days. If they fail an examination a second time, the Inspector will be required to successfully complete training before attempting another examination for that subject matter. Certification as a General Inspector shall not expire. The General Inspector may be required to successfully complete additional courses to maintain their General Inspector certification should the Department change its work methods or standards, pertaining to the subject matter covered in the General Inspector Certification. The purpose of the General Inspector Certification phase is to broaden the Construction Inspectors’ knowledge base through additional instruction and inspection experience. Division Certificates The next phase of the Inspector Certification Program includes modules for Division Certifications as shown below. Once the Inspector becomes a Certified General Inspector, they will be eligible for training and certification focus in at least one of the following Divisions as they become available. A Division Certification will include modules of training and exams for a particular item of work. Division 2

The Certified General Inspector will be certified in the Divisions listed above when they have successfully demonstrated proficiency by achieving a passing score of 80 percent on the examinations. After completion of the stated requirements, the individual will be granted the title of Certified Inspector in that Division. At this level, the Inspector would be expected to operate independently with limited supervision in that Division. Each year, the Construction Project Engineers will ensure that Inspectors assigned to them are afforded the opportunity to take additional courses to broaden their knowledge and certifications. All Division certification requirements may be completed by either successful completion of the required training courses and then passing the examinations or the examinations may be taken without completing the training courses. If an exam is failed the RICM will notify the Project Engineer. The Inspector must take an on-line or Instructor Led course for the affected subject prior to re-taking the exam. The exam may be retaken with a minimum of a three day waiting period from the date the original test was failed. If an exam is failed for a second time, the RICM will notify the Project Engineer and RICO. The Project Engineer and RICO will develop an action plan for training and mentoring on the subject. A period of 30 days minimum is required for the action plan to be completed, and then the Project Engineer will notify the RICM the Inspector is ready to retake the examination. An Inspector’s Division certification will be valid for a period of 4 years from the date of certification, after which they will be required to complete a recertification course and/ or examination. Certification Revocation Based on Lack of Proficiency If it is determined that a Certified Inspector has demonstrated a lack of proficiency, the RICO will work with the inspector’s Project Engineer to develop an action plan to correct the lack of proficiency. The action plan will include successfully completing course work identified and achieving a passing score on course examinations. If the inspector fails to successfully complete the action plan, the RICO will revoke the Inspector’s Certification and inform the Director of the Construction Division. The RICM will maintain a database of all certified Inspectors, in what areas they are certified, and any who have had their certification revoked. The RICO will initiate notification that a certification has been revoked. Notification shall be in writing and shall be mailed (“return receipt requested”) to the affected Inspector. A copy of the notification shall be sent to the employee’s supervisor. Prior to having the certification reinstated, the inspector must meet all requirements stated in their revocation letter and pass any applicable proficiency examination(s). Reporting Once each year the RICM will report actions taken under the Inspector Certification Program. The report shall include as a minimum the number of certified inspectors, the Inspector’s names, what certifications they hold, and any certification revocations, taken under the Inspector Certification Program. The report will be due to the Director by the last working day in January. Page 1-8

Relationship with Other Agencies
GEN 1-00.5(1) Federal Highway Administration The Federal Government provides transportation funding to Washington State through the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), a division of the U.S. Department of Transportation. These funds are subject to applicable Federal law, Executive Orders, regulations, and agreements. The WSDOT contact with FHWA for Construction Administration matters is the State Construction Office. In preparing and approving Standard Specifications, General Special Provisions, and this manual, the State Construction Office seeks the review and approval of FHWA. Use of approved provisions and meeting the required outcomes described in the manual become the basis of federal reimbursement. FHWA provides oversight of WSDOT work on some projects and has delegated that responsibility to WSDOT on others. A full discussion of WSDOT responsibilities under Stewardship is included in Section 1-00.10. GEN 1-00.5(2)
Local Agencies
Cities, counties, and other municipalities within the state may also perform work funded with federal dollars. When this happens, the money is passed through the Department of Transportation, and we will have entered into agreements with the local agencies to provide services. For example, WSDOT will allow the use of testing facilities by a local agency. GEN 1-00.5(2)A Project Engineer Administering Local Agency Project Occasionally, a WSDOT Project Engineer may be assigned to provide engineering and inspection services on a local agency project. The duties of the Project Engineer will be determined by the actual Contract Provisions and by any specific agreement made between the Region Administration and the local agency. The provisions of this manual may or may not apply, depending on the situation. GEN 1-00.5(2)B
Local Agency Administering Its Project on State Right of Way
In some cases, WSDOT may grant approval for a local agency to construct a facility on State Right of Way using local agency staff and contractors. (For example, a city funded overpass of an interstate). When this happens, a Project Engineer will be assigned to provide oversight of the local agency work. The Project Engineer is expected to assure that the local agency provides the same level of engineering and inspection that State employees would accomplish. While the Local Agency may have different administrative provisions with respect to risk-sharing and submittal requirements, all of the technical aspects of the Standard Specifications and this manual must be met. GEN 1-00.5(3) Other Federal, State, and Local Agencies The design and construction of transportation improvements often incorporates locations and features that fall within the jurisdiction of other agencies. It is the policy of WSDOT to cooperate with all agencies as partners in the completion of each project, recognizing and complying with each agency’s legal requirements. The Project Engineer shall WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-9
Chapter 1
Administration
cooperate with local authorities to help ensure that the contractor complies with local laws, ordinances, and regulations. However, unless specifically allowed in the statutes or the contract documents, no WSDOT employee shall engage in any kind of enforcement of laws, rules, regulations, or ordinances which are the responsibility of other agencies. WSDOT needs to maintain the confidence and build trust with resource agencies and the public, so it is critical that we take the proper actions when we are aware of an issue. When WSDOT employees observe something which is questionable or appears to not be in compliance with local laws, ordinances, and regulations, it shall be brought to the Project Engineer’s attention. The Project Engineer is responsible for bringing it to the Contractor’s attention for proper action. Rely on the Regional and Headquarters expertise and the appropriate agencies when dealing with complex issues such as environmental compliance, safety, or hazardous materials. GEN 1-00.5(3)A Highways over National Forest Lands WSDOT has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the United States Forest Service (USFS) and the Project Engineer is required to do the following when performing work on National Forest Service Lands: 1. Represent the department in all matters pertaining to the project. 2. Confirm that the USFS has been notified of the project advertisement and award. 3. Notify and obtain approval from the USFS for any changes in the project that will affect National Forest System Lands, beyond that of the original contract. 4. Notify the USFS when the project nears completion, at which time the USFS will indicate if they choose to participate in the final review of the project.
GEN 1-00.6
Relating to the Public Public confidence is enhanced by WSDOT personnel being responsive to reasonable requests for information, providing timely advanced notice of possible impacts, and reducing inconvenience to traffic while maintaining worker safety. When possible, the Project Engineer should rely on resources such as Regional Public Information Officers and the State Office of Communications and Public Involvement. If there is concern or reason to question the confidentiality or sensitivity of the information requested, consult with your supervisor or seek the advice of the Attorney General’s office.
GEN 1-00.7 Application of Contract Provisions, Plans, and Specifications GEN 1-00.7(1) Construction Contracts Information System (CCIS) The CCIS system is a mainframe application designed to track Contract information and generate reports for all WSDOT administered construction projects. The initial setup of Contract information into CCIS is done automatically by using information in CAPS and other systems. However, after the Contract has been executed, the Project Office must enter the majority of the Contract information into the CCIS system. The Project Engineer will verify that the initial Contract information in CCIS is correct. The data entered is then maintained and stored on the mainframe.
Page 1-10

Chapter 1
Among other things, CCIS generates and tracks the Weekly Statement of Working Days and Change Orders. The system creates the forms for these reports so a preprinted form is not needed. Following is a list of data that needs to be entered into the CCIS database over the life of the project: 1. Contract Information – This part of CCIS will contain general Contract information, including but not limited to:
• Region administering Contract
• Region the Contract is located in
• Regional Administrator
• Operations Engineer
• Project Engineer/PE Org code
• Description of Work
• SR Number(s)
• Begin and End mile post
• County
• Prime Contractor’s local address, if applicable
• Prime Contractor contact person
• Prime Contractor DMWBE type if applicable
• Prime Contractor ethnic code if applicable
• Date of Statement of Intent to Pay Wages – Prime
• Date of Contractor and Subcontractor/Agent Cert. for F.A. Projects
• Date of Affidavit of Wages Paid – Prime
• Date of Preconstruction Meeting Minutes
• Date time started
• Date work started
• Date Orig. Progress Schedule approved
• Date Last Supplemental Progress Schedule approved if applicable
• Date of Substantial Completion (if no Substantial Completion granted, use Physical Completion date)
• Date of Physical Completion
• Final Estimate to Contractor
• Date of Completion
• Final Estimate to State Construction Office (filled in by Region office)
• Contract time – Original Authorized Working Days 2. Contractor Information – This part of CCIS tracks information about Request to Sublet and Affidavits of Amounts Paid.
• Request to Sublet
• Affidavit of Amounts Paid

3. ECR Tracking – This part of CCIS tracks the Contractor’s training program, trainees, and MWDBE reviews.
• Training Program
• Apprentice/Trainee Approval Request
• DMWBE and EEO reviews 4. Change Orders – Change orders are created, printed, and tracked in this part of CCIS. It is very important to keep the information current to facilitate correct tracking and reporting.
• Approval (to proceed when granted)
• VECP Amount (if the change order is a VECP)
• A brief description of the change order (if the change order is a VECP)
• Date sent to Contractor
• Date received from Contractor
• Is there Surety consent
• Date of Surety consent
• Dates of approval and execution (Note: Line 4 “Date Executed” should only be used by Region or the State Construction Office)
• Change Order Voided (if applicable) 5. Weekly Statement of Working Days – The “Weekly Statement of Working Days” report is generated by CCIS, based on information entered into the system by the Project Office. This report details the number of workable/unworkable days charged to a project, the reason a day is charged as unworkable, daily weather codes, the current status of contract days, and a summary or the week’s construction activity. The Project Engineer must ensure that the appropriate information is entered into CCIS on a weekly basis, a “Weekly Statement of Working Days” is generated, and the report is sent to the Contractor by 5:00 p.m. the following Thursday. Weekly statements shall cease when physical completion is granted, or when substantial completion is granted and all working days are expended. Refer to the CCIS Users Guide for details on using the system. This guide is available on the State Construction Office SharePoint site in the Shared Documents folder. GEN 1-00.7(2) Order Lists Contract language requiring an order list can be found in Standard Specifications Section 6-05.3(2), which addresses piling other than cast in place concrete and steel piles, and in Section 8-21.3, which addresses the determination of lengths of wood and steel sign posts. In other types of work, such as drainage, guardrail, etc., the actual layout will often result in quantities and lengths that vary from the plan estimates. A Project Engineer could choose to communicate this information in several ways, one of which could be the development of a formal order list. If an order list is used, extra care should be taken to ensure its accuracy. An alternate method of notice could also be a walk through with the contractor representative after staking.

Chapter 1
Emergency Work Performed Under the Contract When a natural disaster impacting a wide area strikes, WSDOT may utilize an existing construction Contract in order to restore essential travel, minimize damage or protect remaining facilities. RCW 47.28.170(2) allows WSDOT to contract this work on a negotiated basis provided (a) the cost does not exceed force account rates for the work performed and (b) the Contract does not exceed thirty working days. There must be an emergency declaration by the appropriate authority, the Project Engineer must complete a DOT Form 300-001 Detailed Damage Inspection Report (DDIR) and the Project Engineer must contact the Regional Program Manager, since this work will initially be funded by state funds. The Project Engineer should follow the guidance provided in the WSDOT Emergency Funding Manual M 3014. Emergency repair work, when performed by the Contractor under an existing Federal-Aid Contract, may be eligible for Emergency Relief funding. In order to qualify for Emergency Relief funding, the repair work must be the result of a natural disaster over a wide area, such as a flood, an unusually severe storm or a landslide. The work must be demonstrated to be beyond the Contractor’s responsibility and not work that has already been scheduled for repair or replacement of deficient structures. Only the work required to protect and open the roadway is eligible for Emergency Relief funding. Adding emergency work to a State funded Contract would require the addition of all Federal-Aid specifications, and is not practicable. It is however acceptable to hire the existing Contractor to perform emergency work at the same location under a separate emergency force account Contract which would include all the Federal requirements.
GEN 1-00.9
Prime Contractors Performance Report The procedures for completing and submitting the Prime Contractors Performance Report are included with DOT Form 421-010 and in the Prime Contractors Performance Report Manual M 41-40. The requirement for this report and other direction can also be found in WAC 468-16-150 and WAC 468-16-160. Notify the Regional Construction Manager for assistance and advice if the Contractor’s performance on a project becomes below standard.
GEN 1-00.10
Stewardship Webster defines “steward” as “one who acts as a supervisor or administrator, as of finances and property, for another or others.” The designated steward of all federal highway funds is the United States Department of Transportation, acting through the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). In Washington State, FHWA is represented by its Washington Division. Washington Division has delegated a portion of its stewardship responsibility (and the corresponding authority) to the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) through the Federal-Aid Highway Program Stewardship and Oversight Agreement, signed on March 3, 2015. This Section describes further agreement between FHWA and WSDOT concerning the details of the part of the Stewardship Agreement and Construction Monitoring Plan that applies to construction. The subject matter of this subagreement is monitoring of construction performed on behalf of WSDOT by independent contractors.

Chapter 1
Administration
Scope of Construction Monitoring Plan – Outlines expectations for federally-financed construction projects performed under Contract with WSDOT and administered through the WSDOT State Construction Office. It is not intended to be all-encompassing and does not include: WSDOT Ferries Division Contracts for construction of vessels and facilities; Contracts administered through Local Programs; Utility Agreements; and Emergency Relief work administered by WSDOT Maintenance. Project Responsibility – FHWA Washington Division has delegated to WSDOT (and through the WSDOT delegation of authority to the State Construction Office) stewardship responsibility and authority for all federally-funded construction unless a project specific action (1) requires FHWA approval as defined in Attachment A of the Stewardship and Oversight Agreement or (2) the FHWA Division has retained approval as documented in an executed project specific Project of Division Interest (PoDI) plan. The State Construction Office has further delegated the stewardship reporting responsibility for projects with 251 or more working days, as defined in the Contract Provisions to the various WSDOT Regions. The delegation of stewardship authority from the State Construction Office to the Regions is through the Construction Manual. FHWA has also delegated to WSDOT the authority to accept projects unless FHWA has retained this action as documented in an executed project specific Project of Division Interest (PoDI) plan. FHWA Review/Approval Actions and Related Processes – With the pre-approval of specifications and processes and the extensive delegation of stewardship authority, there are relatively few approval actions needed from FHWA during actual construction. The following processes will apply: FHWA may retain the oversight role of interim, or project inspections and acceptance, and the approval of certain high-value change orders on PoDIs. All PoDIs will be governed by a separate PoDI Plan that specifies FHWA and WSDOT’s responsibilities for the project. The FHWA Area Engineer may choose to accompany WSDOT during the review of any federal-aid project. Such participation will be random and will be initiated by the Area Engineer. This participation by the FHWA will not change any delegation of oversight responsibility or authority in any way. When the Area Engineer has participated in a review, a copy of the summary report will be provided directly to the Area Engineer. Stewardship Summary Reports – It is important to note the difference between a steward and a stewardship reviewer/reporter. Stewardship on WSDOT federal-aid projects is provided by a wide cross-section of employees who make stewardship decisions according to the requirements of the Construction Manual and their own delegated responsibilities and authorities. From the Project Inspector who observes Contract work and prepares pay instructions, to the Project Engineer who reviews and approves a monthly progress payment, to the Region Construction Manager who executes a change order, to the State Construction Engineer who negotiates and approves a claim settlement, all are acting as stewards in their own job descriptions and assignments.

Administration
Chapter 1
The stewardship reviewer/reporter, on the other hand, is acting as an overseer, observing and collecting information about all of the stewardship activities, evaluating that information, making recommendations concerning the qualification of the covered work for federal funding and preparing reports to summarize the activities. Reviewers may be FHWA Area Engineers, State Construction Engineers, Region Managers or subordinate region specialists in documentation or contract administration. For the reports that it prepares, WSDOT may assign any person of the classification of Transportation Engineer 3 or above to this duty. The reviewer must not have been involved in the project-level administration and the report must be signed by someone with supervisory authority over the Project Engineer or management responsibility over the Contract itself.
• Interim Reports: At least once per year, the State Construction Office will create a list of all open, federally-funded projects that will be divided to assign responsibility for stewardship reporting by Region. Projects identified as requiring stewardship reporting will be required to complete and interim report. The State Construction Office delegates authority of stewardship reporting responsibility to the WSDOT Regions. Interim Reports are required on projects with 251 or more working days, as specified in the Contract Provisions. Interim Reports will be completed when a project is at 30 – 50% of working days completed. Interim Reports may be required at a greater frequency, on shorter-duration projects, or for a special purpose at the discretion of the State Construction Office. Copies of Interim Reports will be sent to State Construction Office and forwarded to FHWA.
• Content of Reports Interim Reports provide immediate summaries of uncompleted projects, communicating details in a concise and comprehensive manner. The report should clearly identify project progress, conditions that make the project unique, difficulties encountered and their resolutions. Job Description – A description of the major elements of the work. Include a narrative about the job. Include the Contractor’s name, the award date, amount of the bid and the working days specified in the Contract Provisions. Time and Damages – Discuss the present status of time and its relationship to the completion status. If behind, describe what is being done to catch up. Describe any suspensions or time extensions. Change Orders – Choose one executed change order to confirm that the change was approved according to the checklist before the work started and that a cost verification is on file. Include a detailed description of high impact change orders (e.g., scope change, claim settlements, major impacts to cost and schedule). Buy-America – Choose one applicable bid item and verify that a completed and signed Certificate of Materials Origin (CMO) was submitted to the Project Engineer prior to incorporation into permanent work. Discuss how the office is tracking foreign material used to ensure the amount does not exceed one-tenth of one percent of the total contract cost or $2,500.00. Materials – Review a process in progress by checking for submittals and approvals of RAMs, any drawing or catalog submittals, the testing method and frequency, adjustments to the ROM, observe field tests and include a summary report. Comment on the overall status of materials testing, documentation and adequacy. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

Chapter 1
Administration
Disputes, Claims – Note all claims or major disputes for the project and discuss resolution, if applicable. Traffic Control – Comment on the adequacy of the traffic control plans and unusual events during the project. Discuss the project’s use of flagging, devices, pilot cars, etc. Training and Apprenticeship – Verify that a plan has been submitted and approved, the current percentage attained, and efforts to recover if behind. Subcontracting – Discuss the level and nature of subcontracted work. Note any Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) requirements and any change orders modifying these requirements by deleting, adding or substituting DBE commitments. Make reference to any Condition of Award requirements. Review on-site reports for any DBE firm utilized, whether or not its utilization was mandatory. Other – Talk to the Project Engineer. Look for special notes. If there was an experimental specification or process, discuss how it is working on the project. If there was an unusual event or happenstance, discuss the circumstances that caused the event. Describe the overall impression of the contractual relationship. Describe any evidence of successful collaboration between the parties. Include any other information of interest. Note: As a significant part of any review, the reviewer must visit the jobsite and confirm that a project of approximately the nature and magnitude of that shown on the plans actually does exist. This is true for all stewardship reporting. Communication – Much of the day-to-day communication between WSDOT and FHWA is informal in nature. Verbal discussions, telephone consultations and email notices (including digital photos when needed for clarity) are used extensively. Except where formal written notices are specifically required, staff from both agencies will attempt to utilize the simplest form of communication that accomplishes the needed communication in the least time. All reports and correspondence related to a project shall bear both the WSDOT contract number and the FHWA project number as identifiers.
GEN 1-00.11 Bridge and Structures Office Support on Design-Bid-Build Projects During Construction The Bridge and Structures Office supports Project Offices, Regions and the State Construction Office on Design-Bid-Build projects when the Contract work involves bridges and structures. Support is provided in two primary areas; submittal review and processing, and technical support. When changes to structural engineered drawings occur, licensed professionals shall follow the requirements in Construction Manual SS 1-04.4 “Responsibility of Licensed Professionals for Changes to Structural Engineered Drawings During Design-Bid-Build Construction Contracts”. GEN 1-00.11(1) Submittal Review and Processing The Bridge and Structure Office coordinates and tracks submittals to be reviewed on WSDOT projects in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-05.3, Working Drawings. The Construction Support Engineers or Bridge Technical Advisors coordinate submittal reviews with the various SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) per Section SS 1-05.3 and Figure 1-1. For Contracts not using Unifier for submittals, the Region Project Office Page 1-16
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
electronically submits Working Drawings and design calculations in PDF format directly to: BridgeConstructionSupport@wsdot.wa.gov Bridge Construction Support maintains a database of submittals received and reviewed listed by Contract number at: www.wsdot.wa.gov/eesc/bridge/conlog for Contracts not using Unifier. Contracts utilizing Unifier will process submittals accordingly and will not be entered into Conlog. GEN 1-00.11(2) Technical Support Upon advertisement of a Contract that includes bridges or structures, the Bridge and Structures Office will identify a primary and secondary Bridge Technical Advisor (BTA) who will support the project during pre-bid questions and through construction. BTA assignments will be made for all Contracts with bridges or structures that were designed in-house as well as projects that were consultant-designed. Depending on the complexity of the project and the needs of the Region, some consultant-designed projects may use a consultant to provide primary BTA construction support. On these projects, a representative of the Bridge and Structures Office will provide secondary BTA support. BTA assignments will be available via the “HQ-Bridge-CN Support” MS Team, which is public and accessible to all WSDOT employees. Requests for BTAs not on the list may also be made within the Team via the Posts tab. The BTA coordinates structural support from the Bridge and Structures Office for the Project Engineer during Contract Work. BTA’s may be consulted for questions relating to structural design, inconsistencies or clarifications of structural plans, and for recommendations on structural issues that are identified during construction. The Assistant State Construction Engineer (ASCE) shall be included in correspondence on contract administration issues when:
• Work or recommendations of the BTA or others may result in a change to the Contract or are considered the practice of engineering in accordance with Construction Manual SS 1-04.4 “Responsibility of Licensed Professionals for Changes to Structural Engineered Drawings During Design-Bid-Build Construction Contracts”.
• Work of the BTA or others will result in a change to the Contract; approval for this change must come from the State Construction Office. The Project Engineer is encouraged to engage the ASCE early in the process prior to inclusion in a BTA response. BTAs and others shall comply with the following guidelines when supporting projects:
• Follow procedures in accordance with Construction Manual SS 1-04.4 “Responsibility of Licensed Professionals for Changes to Structural Engineered Drawings During Design-Bid-Build Construction Contracts”
• Develop the most economical recommendations while considering the Contractor’s means and methods
• Provide recommendations and support documentation to the Project Engineer and the ASCE in writing. Include a cost estimate of any change work
• Keep a project diary of all correspondence, activities and recommendations
• Defer contract administration issues or questions to the Project Engineer and the ASCE WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

• Conform to the field safety requirements of the Region and the Contractor
• Give the project priority but be prudent in the use of time and expense charges
• Avoid direct communications with the Contractor without coordinating through the Project Engineer
• Avoid directing the Contractor’s work Once a project is underway, the Project Engineer shall set up a meeting between the Project Office, ASCE and primary BTA to discuss project roles, responsibilities, and communication protocols. The BTA’s technical responsibility will be to the BTA’s supervisor in the Bridge and Structures Office.

Bid Procedures and Conditions
SS 1-02.2
Plans and Specifications When the design phase of a project is completed and funding has been secured, the public is then notified that WSDOT is ready to accept bids for completion of the Work involved. This notice is accomplished by publishing an advertisement for the project, along with an invitation to bid the work, in the “Daily Journal of Commerce.” The advertisement includes a specific date and time for the opening of bids along with the necessary information for obtaining plans, specifications, and bid documents. Once advertised, these plans and specifications are then made available to all Contractors who wish to study the project. Contract proposal forms or bid documents are also furnished, but only to those prospective Contractors who have been prequalified to bid on the types and quantities of Work involved. Once bids have been opened, an announcement in the “Daily Journal of Commerce” will also be made identifying the “Apparent Low Bidder.” Specific information regarding the advertisement phase and bidding procedures can be found in the Advertisement and Award Manual M 27-02.
SS 1-02.4
Examination of Plans, Specifications, and Site of Work If the Project Engineer determines that prospective bidders may have difficulty locating the project or determining the project limits, the Project Engineer may choose to post the project limits. Standard Specifications Section 1-02.4 requires that all requests for explanation or interpretation of the Contract documents be submitted, and be answered, in writing. Any answers that may interpret, clarify, or change the Contract shall do so by means of an addendum. Acceptable answers to pre-bid questions are: 1. Your question will be addressed by addendum 2. Refer to the contract documents – Page/sheet #XXX 3. Bid in accordance with the Contract Anytime the answer to a question from a prospective bidder might be perceived as interpreting, clarifying, or changing the Contract, the Project Engineer should immediately contact the Region Construction Manager or Region Plans Office to facilitate the preparation of an Addendum. Answers to such questions must be provided to all bidders in the same manner.
Page 1-18
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
All questions from prospective bidders regarding an advertised project should be referred to the Project Engineer listed in the “Notice to All Planholders” for a complete response. The Project Engineer will coordinate the effort to determine if any requested information needs to be addressed by an addendum. If no addendum is required, the response will be posted on the Contract Ad & Award web page. The Project Engineer shall send the response to: ContractAd&Award@wsdot.wa.gov for posting to the web page. When questions arise regarding the Transfer of Coverage (TOC) for the Construction Stormwater General Permit, the Project Engineer should go to the Environmental Service Office’s Erosion Control page on the internet for guidance.

Award and Execution of Contract
SS 1-03.2 Award of Contract Bids for the Contract are opened at a public meeting where each prospective bidder’s proposal is read and the Apparent Low Bidder is announced:
• Within 45 calendar days of bid opening, the proposals will be closely reviewed and the Contract will be awarded to the lowest bidder deemed responsive.
• The successful bidder is then allowed 20 calendar days to return the signed documents that are necessary to enter into a Contract with WSDOT, in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-03.
• The Contract Administration and Payment System (CAPS) Unit of Accountability and Financial Services (AFS) sends the awarded Contract to the Contractor for execution within 3 days of award. Additional copies go to the Region, State Construction Office, Bridge and Structures Office, other internal WSDOT divisions and railroads as needed. Once bids for the Contract have been opened, all communication with bidders shall be directed through the Contract Ad and Award Office. This moratorium on communication with bidders, including the Apparent Low Bidder, remains in effect until execution of the Contract.
SS 1-03.3
Execution of Contract After these documents are returned to WSDOT, the Contract must be approved and executed. No proposal submitted by a Contractor is binding upon WSDOT prior to the date of execution by WSDOT. No work is to be performed within the project limits or WSDOT furnished sites prior to the execution of the contract by WSDOT. Any work that is performed by the Contractor outside of these areas, or any material that is ordered prior to WSDOT execution, is done so solely at the risk of the Contractor. In order to ensure timely notification to the Contractor regarding execution of the contract and authority to proceed, the following procedure is used: 1. Immediately after execution of the Contract documents by WSDOT, the office administering the Contract is notified. The CAPS Unit of AFS notifies, by memorandum, the National Association of Credit Management, and internal interested parties that the Contract has been executed and/or the Work may proceed. For Region Ad and Award Projects, the Region Plans Office will notify the office administering the Contract and the Region Construction Manager.

Scope of the Work
SS 1-04.3
Reference Information Reference Information is information provided to the Contractor that is not part of the Contract. Reference Information often includes design files, CAD files, engineering calculations, survey information, geotechnical reports, bridge condition reports, etc. Because the Reference Information is not part of the Contract, any construction requirements described in the Reference Information will need to be captured in the Contract documents (for example, the plans or special provisions). Reference Information for most WSDOT projects should be linked through the Contract Ad and Award web site – “View Project Information” - under the Reference Information Section of the specific project page.
SS 1-04.4
Changes WSDOT reserves the right, under Standard Specifications Section 1-04.4, to make changes to the work, work methods, working days, or quantities, as necessary to satisfactorily complete the project as originally intended. Adding work beyond the original scope is, in essence, entering into a contract to perform work without the benefit of a competitive bid. There is a statutory (RCW 47.28.050) exception from the competitive bid requirement for work up to a value of $7,500. If the value of the work is in excess of $7,500 it is necessary to go through the competitive bidding process. Change order work may impact the design criteria used to develop the project. The Project Engineer must be alert to this and ensure that the Design Documentation Package is revised to reflect any such changes. Changes to the design may also require reevaluation of environmental processes (NEPA/SEPA), as well as permit modifications. The Project Engineer must contact the Region Project Development staff and Environmental Permit Coordinators to obtain approval for the change, and for guidance in documenting and incorporating the change into the Design Documentation Package.
Types of Changes There are several categories of changes that may occur during the work. A change may warrant additional payment to the contractor, a credit to the contracting agency or be a no cost change order. A change may also warrant an increase or decrease in the working days. Every situation is different. The Standard Specifications are very specific on what additional costs are eligible for adjustment. The balance of this discussion of types of changes is intended to help describe and explain the various categories of changes. The Project Engineer should also employ the guidance supplied by the WSDOT Construction Change Order Process Guide, which is available on the State Construction Office SharePoint site.

Chapter 1
Deletion of Items A. Authority to Delete – As provided in Standard Specifications Section 1-04.4 and 1-08.10(2), WSDOT may cancel all or portions of Work included in a Contract. Refer to Section 1-07.11 for information regarding changes or deletion of Work that affect COA requirements. B. Payment for Remaining Work – There are some limitations to payment that should be noted under Standard Specifications Section 1-09.5. When work is decreased or deleted by the contracting agency, payment will only be for the costs actually incurred for partially completed work. No profit will be allowed for work that was not completed. Consequential damages are also not allowed. Consequential damages may include such things as: loss of credit, loss of bonding capacity, loss of other jobs, loss of business reputation, loss of job opportunities, etc. In the case of a portion of a lump sum item or partially completed unit items, the value of this work will need to be determined. It may also be necessary to negotiate a price adjustment for the work that was performed and paid using a contract unit price if there is a material difference in the nature of the accomplished work when compared to the nature of the overall planned work. Under certain circumstances when the contractor says, “you eliminated all the easy work and left the difficult,” there may be entitlement to an adjustment. In the event that the deletion impacts the critical path for the project, an adjustment in working days may also be appropriate. C. Payment for Materials – When work is deleted from the project and the contractor has already ordered acceptable materials for such work, Standard Specifications Section 1-09.5 controls. 1. Contractor Restocks – The first and best method for disposing of the materials is to request that the contractor attempt to return the materials to the supplier at cost or subject to a reasonable restocking charge. If the materials are restocked then, in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-09, the contractor’s actual costs incurred in handling the materials may be paid. 2. Contractor Purchases – If WSDOT cannot utilize the materials, the contractor may elect to retain them for other work. Once again, in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-09, the contractor’s actual costs incurred to handle the materials may be paid. 3. State Purchases and Disposes – As a last resort, if the materials can not be disposed of at a reasonable cost to WSDOT, the Department may choose to purchase the materials from the contractor. There are some limitations that come with the use of federal funds that may require that the materials be purchased with state funds depending on the situation. The State Construction Office may be contacted for advice. If possible, such materials may be provided to a future contractor (work with Design) or to Maintenance (work with the Regional Maintenance Office). If the materials cannot be used, they shall be disposed of as described in the WSDOT Disposal of Personal Property Manual M 72-91. Once again, in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-09, the contractor’s actual costs incurred in handling the materials may be paid.

Contract Modifications Changes in Materials, Work Method, or Work Sequence may or may not be a change to the contract. The determining factor is if the change is a modification of a specific contract requirement. If the contract includes language such as “recommends,” “suggested,” or “approved equal” associated with the item or allows the engineer to approve changes, then a change order is probably not required. In essence, this would not be a violation of the contract and therefore, does not require a change to the contract. A common situation is when the contractor proposes a change to a submitted manufacturer’s recommendation, drawing or plan such as a falsework drawing or erection plan. Changes to those drawings/plans may be made by the same authority that approved them the first time. Once again, it is not a change to the Contract. Responsibility of Licensed Professionals for Changes to Structural Engineered Drawings During Design-Bid-Build Construction Contracts During construction, changes to engineered drawings are often required to address field conditions, plan errors, Contractor errors, repairs, differing site conditions, etc. The following policy defines the responsibilities of licensed professional engineers for changes to engineered drawings for bridges and structures after Contract award and execution. Practice of Engineering The practice of engineering is defined in RCW 18.43.020(5)(a): “Practice of engineering” means any professional service or creative work requiring engineering education, training, and experience and the application of special knowledge of the mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences to such professional services or creative work as consultation, investigation, evaluation, planning, design, and supervision of construction for the purpose of assuring compliance with specifications and design, in connection with any public or private utilities, structures, buildings, machines, equipment, processes, works, or projects. Structural Engineering Structural engineering is recognized as a specialized branch of professional engineering. See Bridge Design Manual 1.3.2.C for guidelines on providing structural engineering services for significant structures. Area of Expertise For a change to be within their area of expertise, the licensee shall be registered in the applicable technical field and qualified by education or experience as defined in the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) and Washington Administrative Code (WAC). The licensee shall be competent in the technology and knowledgeable of the applicable codes and regulations (see WAC 196-27A-020(2)).

Chapter 1
Evaluation of Changes for Practice of Engineering All proposed changes from what is shown in the engineered drawings shall be evaluated by the Project Engineer to determine whether they are considered practice of engineering. When the change is outside the area of expertise of the Project Engineer, they shall consult the ASCE and a licensed professional acting within their area of expertise to make this determination. Some examples of changes to engineered drawings that may be considered the practice of engineering include:
• Changes to engineered drawing details
• Material substitutions not allowed in the Contract documents, and possibly material substitutions when the Contract allows “approved equal” replacements
• Material properties outside of contract tolerances, even when the contract provides a method for acceptance such as for deficient strength concrete
• Changes in geometry or location of a component outside of contract tolerances when the capacity or function of the element or system is affected
• Changes to mandatory, prescriptive construction sequences shown in engineered drawings (e.g. including but not limited to sequencing and temporary work)
• Repairs that impact the capacity or function of the element. For example: –
Modifications to structural steel elements
–
Concrete repairs that involve modifications (splicing, coupling, doweling) to reinforcing steel
–
Repairs to structural elements that are already loaded by actions such as prestressing, release of falsework, subsequent material placement, etc.
• Modification to a concrete construction joint in a bridge column, bridge crossbeam, bridge deck, prestressed element, etc. (see Standard Specification 6-02.3(12)A)
• Modification of a concrete reinforcement splice (see Standard Specification 6-02.3(24)D) Some examples of changes to engineered drawings that may not be considered practice of engineering include:
• Editorial changes (such as corrections of spelling or grammar) with no effect on engineering performance
• Changes to quantities with no effect on engineering performance
• Corrections to sheet and detail references with no effect on engineering performance
• Addition of typical construction aids. For instance, in concrete construction, the addition of concrete embedments used to facilitate construction including inserts, reinforcement ties and chairs, reinforcement braces, form ties and hangers, strand deviators, CSL tubes, thermocouples, etc.
• Notation of which alternate or option was chosen when engineered drawings identify acceptable alternates or options for portions of the Work
• Application of pre-approved repair procedures

Documentation and Notification Requirements After determining whether a proposed change is the practice of engineering, the Project Engineer shall then ensure the requirements listed in the table below are met:
Practice of Engineering
Change to the Contract
• Change shall be prepared and sealed by a licensed professional acting within their area of expertise
Not a Change to the Contract
• Change shall be evaluated by a licensed professional acting within their area of expertise
• Notify the original Engineer-ofRecord of change if possible
• Notify the original Engineer-ofRecord of change if possible
• Document change in change order and in as-built
• Change need not be prepared and sealed by a licensed professional Not the Practice of Engineering • Document change in change order and in as-built
• Document change in as-built
• Document change in as-built
For proposed changes considered to be the practice of engineering, the Project Engineer shall require sealed engineering calculations and/or other documentation to show that the change complies with all design criteria or is otherwise structurally acceptable. If WSDOT prepares or evaluates the change, the calculations or other documentation will be generated and archived by the support group preparing the change as appropriate and need not be provided to the Project Engineer. Any sealed engineering calculations and/ or other documentation for structures that is not prepared by WSDOT shall be provided to the WSDOT Bridge & Structures Office who will archive it if appropriate in accordance with Bridge Design Manual Sections 1.3.3.C.4 and 1.3.8. The licensed professional engineer shall be a licensed structural engineer when providing structural engineering services for significant structures. Licensed professional engineers who sealed the current documents shall be notified of changes to their work (including Contract-allowed “approved equal” material substitutions) that are considered practice of engineering and shall be given an opportunity to review and comment, if possible. Licensed professional engineers who are no longer WSDOT employees or who are not available through a consultant services agreement need not be notified of changes to their work (see WAC 196-27A-030(9)). General Requirements for Changes to Engineering Drawings The location, extent and details of all physical changes to the Work shall be contained in the changed engineering drawings. If changes to engineered drawings are part of a Contract change order, the drawings shall identify the associated change order by number. Changes to Engineered Drawings Prepared and Sealed or Evaluated by a Licensed Professional Changes to engineered drawings may be prepared and sealed or evaluated by any licensed professional engineer who is working within their area of expertise. As a way to limits costs, it is recommended to have the engineering done by the person or party who may complete it most efficiently. Some general guidelines to consider include:
Page 1-24
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
• When WSDOT is the Engineer of Record, it is usually most efficient to have WSDOT prepare the changes to engineered drawings
• If there is a consultant Engineer of Record, and a consultant services agreement exists with them, they should prepare changes to the engineered drawings. Otherwise, changes to engineered drawings could be handled by a different consultant or by WSDOT
• When WSDOT has the contractual responsibility for the change, the engineering should be performed by WSDOT or by a consultant working for WSDOT
• When the Contractor has the contractual responsibility for the change, or the responsibility is not apparent, the engineering may be performed by WSDOT, a consultant working for WSDOT, or an engineer working for the Contractor – The Contractor may hire an engineer to make the changes to the engineered drawings. The modified drawings will require WSDOT review and concurrence – It may be more efficient for the Engineer of Record (WSDOT or a WSDOT consultant) to perform the engineering; we own the design so there is less startup effort needed to evaluate a change to an engineered drawing – WSDOT can require the Contractor to perform any needed engineering – For significant changes, WSDOT should consider reimbursement for our engineering costs through a credit change order Changes to engineered drawings shall be prepared on the most recent version of the existing drawings, on substitute drawings or on additional drawings. For revisions to existing engineered drawings, the licensee shall note the extent of their change and responsibility (see WAC 196-23-020(3)(a) and WAC 196-27A-030(9)). When revisions to existing engineered drawings will make the drawings difficult to read or interpret, the details and changes should be consolidated onto substitute drawings. Substitute drawings shall meet the detailing requirements of Bridge Design Manual Chapter 11 and Plans Preparation Manual Chapter 4. Preexisting seals of licensed professional engineers shall be preserved when revising existing engineered drawings but need not be preserved for substitute drawings. Provided a licensee is acting within the guidelines of their profession, during an emergency it is acceptable to certify documents after the emergent need is stabilized (see Secretary’s Executive Order E 1010.01 III.B). Contractor Endorsement/Unilateral Execution In order to facilitate timely processing of all change orders, the Standard Specifications require the Contractor to endorse or respond to a change order within 14 calendar days of delivery from WSDOT. With the exception of Minor Changes (see Section 1-04.4(1)), a Contractor signature is required for change orders. However, the Standard Specifications give the Project Engineer the authority to unilaterally execute change orders when the Contractor fails to respond within the time specified. When this happens, the Project Engineer should proceed with unilateral execution of the change order. This will ensure that all parties affected by the change are promptly paid. The Project Engineer must notify the Region Construction Engineer if a change order is unilaterally executed.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-25
Chapter 1
Administration
Requests for extensions of time for Contractor endorsement may be granted with sound justification from the Contractor. Items to consider for granting such requests are size, risk and complexity of the change, whether terms have been agreed to prior to sending the change order for signature, prompt payment and if surety consent is required. The Project office should consult the Region Construction Engineer prior to approving a time extension request for endorsement of a change order. Approval of Changes/Checklist In addition to noting who can execute a change order, the Change Order Checklist (DOT Form 422-003) further indicates who must approve the change prior to execution. The completed checklist will be a part of the change record and shall accompany the change order when it is transmitted to the State Construction Office, and represents the minimum information required to process the change order. Written approval constitutes agreeing with the general nature of the change and can be granted by memorandum, RFI response or email. The checklist works as follows: for any item marked “yes,” approval from the State Construction Office must be obtained if indicated by the column with the “Xs.” The Project Engineer and the Region Construction Office have the authority to decide not to proceed with the change. This approval does not constitute authority to proceed with the Work. Approval to proceed with the Work prior to executing the change order must come from the person who will execute the change order (see approval to proceed). In an emergency, the Region Construction Manager may authorize Work to begin on any change order if the assigned ASCE or other State Construction Office representative cannot be contacted for the required approvals and the Work must proceed. Approval to Proceed All change orders shall be executed prior to the work being performed unless otherwise approved as an exception. In all cases, approval requests (per the change order checklist) should occur immediately after the need for a change is identified and include at a minimum, why the change is necessary, general terms of the change, estimated cost (range of cost acceptable) and the change in contract time. If it is determined to be necessary to proceed with the change work prior to execution of the change order, this exception requires approval per the checklist and approval from the executing authority prior to beginning work. Such an approval to proceed might be warranted if it will provide a cost/time benefit to WSDOT or minimize a cost/time disadvantage to the Contractor. In the event that the Project Engineer determines that it is in the State’s best interest to proceed with the Work prior to having a signed change order, the permission of the executing authority and approval per the checklist to proceed with the change under these circumstances must be documented in the file. If approval is granted to proceed prior to an executed change order, the Project Engineer must process a change order prior to payment becoming due to the Contractor. For complex changes, this may necessitate issuing multiple change orders and/or paying for the initial Work on a Force Account basis until agreement on an overall equitable adjustment can be reached. In the event the Project Engineer determines, as part of the RFI, a change is required and that it is necessary to proceed with the change Work prior to execution of the change order, approvals shall be obtained prior to responding to the RFI.

A. FHWA Approval – On Projects of Division Interest (PoDI), written FHWA approval, or other less formal prior approval if the public interest is served by the more timely action, is required prior to beginning work on those change orders meeting the threshold as outlined in the project specific PoDI agreement. Who does what? – The Region will formally submit this type of change order to FHWA for approval if it is within Region approval authority. If it is outside Region approval authority, the State Construction Office will submit the change order to FHWA for approval. A guidance document regarding PoDI is available on the HQ Construction SharePoint site. B. State Materials Laboratory Areas of Responsibility – Standard Specifications Division 9 (see Section 1-00.3(2)) The State Materials Laboratory also advises the State Construction Office and Regions regarding an alternate material’s capability to perform the same function as a required material. However, the State Construction Office makes the final approval based on application of the material, maintenance concerns, etc., as to whether an alternate material is capable of performing. Delegation of Execution Authority Highway Construction The Change Order Checklist (DOT Form 422-003), in addition to describing the approval requirements previously described, also outlines who has authority to execute a change order. The State Construction Engineer (or designee) executes the change order:

Local Agency Projects When the project being administered includes local agency participation, the Project Engineer should coordinate with the Regional Local Programs Engineer and the local agency to establish an approval process acceptable to all the parties. Any funding constraints and timelines for reviews and approvals should be established per an agreement and specified in the contract, if appropriate. Absent an agreement, changes that affect permanent work incorporated within WSDOT right of way with use of local agency funds (regardless of which agency is administering the contract) will require following the WSDOT approval process and execution authorities. Documentation State Construction Office Role The State Construction Office will review Region executed change orders and provide appropriate feedback. Project Files A. CCIS Input – The Project Engineer shall ensure that the following information is input into CCIS accurately and in a timely manner:

If new items are created, contract items modified, or Condition of Award is modified by the change order, this information must be input into CCIS as well. It is important that CCIS input be accurate and timely. CCIS is used by internal and external customers to monitor project changes and costs. Information on change orders (including minor changes) is readily accessible through a numbering process and must be adequate so that everyone involved will understand the need for the change. Some key items to remember are as follows:
• Is there a clear description of the work?
• Is the origin and purpose of the change being entered using at least two of the reasons listed in the system?
• Was there an order, other than a signed change order, by the engineer for the contractor to proceed?
• Is there a reference to any key documents in the change order file?
• Are any increases or decreases in contract time associated with the change order entered in the appropriate field enabling the Weekly Statement of Working Days to be automatically updated?
• For condition of award change orders, are the appropriate fields filled in to generate the change order and automatically update the condition of award items?
• Are any disclaimers included in the change order and are any agreed upon disclaimers included in the text?
• Are all the appropriate dates entered?

B. Change Record (DOT Form 422-002) – The change record must accompany the change order describing the change in sufficient detail so that everyone involved will understand the need for the change, will see that the price is appropriate and that appropriate checks and consultations have been made. The following is a list of items to include in the change record accompanying the change order: 1. Evolution & Description of the Change
• What is required by contract?
• What is the change?
• How does it solve the problem?
• Reason for entitlement/why is this not paid under the contract?
• Is there time associated with the change?
• Did the contractor concur/if not why?
• Is FHWA participation appropriate?
• Does the change affect COA? 2. Basis of Cost & Justification
• Any increase or decrease in cost
• How it was established (see equitable adjustment)
• Force account must include estimate 3. Contract Time
• Does the change impact the critical path?
• How was any change in working days established?
• Note if a change in contract time affects the amount of liquidated damages 4. Prior Approval
• Was the change order executed by the appropriate WSDOT authority prior to proceeding with the work?
• If not, prior approval by whom and when 5. List Attachments
• Checklist
• Documentation of approval to proceed
• Any supporting documentation needed for understanding C. Distribution 1. Region-Executed – When the Region (PE or Region Construction Office) has executed a change, copies should be sent via email to the Contractor and the CAPS Unit of Accountability and Financial Services, (if necessary, the CAPS Unit of Accountability and Financial Services creates and coordinates new groups in “CAPS” and “TRAINS”). Region will enter change order information in CAPS, and may replace temporary item numbers with new permanent bid item numbers. A copy of the original signed change order, the change record and backup documents shall be sent to the State Construction Office for review via email, with the original signed hard copy to follow by mail.

Chapter 1
If the change order requires FHWA approval per Section SS 1-04.4, the Region will request approval from the FHWA representative at the time change approval is requested. If the change order utilizes the “Minor Change” process, the two page document substitutes for the change record and CCIS change order print out. The original two page “Minor Change” document shall be sent to the State Construction Office (up to 3 revised/new plan sheets allowed with minor change). 2. State Construction Office-Executed – If the change is required to be executed at the State Construction Office, a copy of the original signed change order, the change record and backup documentation shall be sent to the State Construction Office for review via email (flagged as high priority) with the signed original hard copy following via mail. The original hard copy sent by mail should be flagged with a colored cover sheet (Labeled “State Construction Office Executed Change”) to differentiate them from change orders executed by the region. Copies of the executed change order will be sent via email by the State Construction Office to the region, the CAPS Unit of Accountability and Financial Services, (if necessary, the CAPS Unit of Accountability and Financial Services creates new groups and/ or items) and, if appropriate, to the State Bridge Office, Design and the State Materials Laboratory. The Region shall provide a copy of the executed change order to the Contractor. If the change order requires FHWA approval per Section SS 1-04.4, the Assistant Construction Engineer will request approval from the FHWA representative at the time the initial approval is granted. 3. Protecting the Interest of the Surety – One area for the Project Engineer to watch is the interests of the bonding company. Consent of Surety should be required on any change order that expands the scope of the contract. It is also appropriate on any change of large value or risk. Failure to obtain consent of surety could weaken the State’s protection under the bond. 4. Requiring FHWA Approval – Upon receipt of the written approval by the FHWA representative, the State Documentation Engineer will route a copy via email to the State Construction Office files, the Region, and the change order final records file. D. Change Order Tracking In order to provide current status and communication of contract changes Project Offices need to maintain an active change order log. For consistency, a tracking template has been developed and can be found on the State Construction Office web page: www.wsdot.wa.gov/business/construction SS 1-04.4(1) Minor Changes All contracts will have a standard item for “Minor Change.” This item will be established in every group as a calculated lump sum. Credits, debits, changes in working days and no cost changes may all be processed under the Minor Change method subject to the listed criteria. The Contractor may submit an RFI, in accordance with Section 1-05.1(2) Requests for Information, requesting a change to the Contract so long as it meets the criteria for a minor change. The minor change should be used for simple and straightforward Contract WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

Administration
modifications. In any case, a Contractor-proposed change must be beneficial to the project. The Project Engineer is under no obligation to accept the proposal and the Contractor may not protest the Project Engineer’s decision. Criteria for Use Although the change meets the criteria for using the Minor Change process, the Project Engineer may decide that this process is not appropriate. The use of this item is at the Region’s and the Project Engineer’s discretion. Also keep in mind that the limitations and approvals required by the Change Order Checklist still apply as well as all other Change Order criteria not modified by this Minor Change section. Use of the Minor Change process is limited to changes that satisfy all of the following criteria:
• The value of the change (credit or debit) is estimated at $25,000 or less
• Any change in working days not greater than ten days
• The proposed change can be fully described and explained on page 1 (Change Order page) and with no more than 3 revised/new plan sheets Endorsement In the interest of being timely, the Change Order should be a tool to document agreement and not a negotiation tool back and forth. The Contractor’s authorized signature on the Change Order is desirable but not mandatory. A phone call or a verbal agreement with the Project Superintendent may be appropriate when payment is to be made under the item “Minor Change.” This may be a good discussion item at the preconstruction conference. The Project Engineer should determine when the Contractor’s signature is required based on when it is in the State’s best interest to document agreement prior to proceeding with a Change Order. Some situations that may warrant the Contractor’s signature are as follows:
• The Contract includes substantial incentives
• There are mutual benefits associated with the change
• The change might include impacts to time or other Work
• The change is proposed by the Contractor
• The change is a claim settlement In any case, a copy of page 1 (Change Order Page) of DOT Form 421-005A must be sent to the Contractor. If the Contractor does not agree with the terms or conditions of any Change Order and has not endorsed the change, then the Contractor is required to follow the procedure outlined in Standard Specifications Section 1-04.5. This orders the Work to proceed and puts the decision to continue negotiations in the Contractor’s hands as detailed in that section. The Contractor is obligated to endorse or protest as described in the Specification, and a timeline is provided for these actions. Execution Due to the criteria for the application of minor changes, the Project Engineer has the authority to execute these change orders, after obtaining all approvals required by the change order checklist. Approval is required prior to performing the work.

Payment by LUMP SUM The negotiation of prices for payment under the item “Minor Changes” is intended to be the same as any other change order. The focus, as always, should be forward pricing such that the Contractor controls the work and assumes the risk. However, situations occur where it makes sense to measure portions of the work in a variety of ways such as units, force account and/or lump sum. The method for establishing, measuring and monitoring the total may be by any combination of methods however, the payment will only be by a lump sum under the item “Minor Changes.” Project Files A. CCIS Input – “Minor Change” Change Orders must be entered into CCIS; however the required input is slightly abbreviated. Since a formal Change Order document as described in Section SS 1-04.4 is not processed, the Work Description Section in CCIS requiring a detailed upload of text is not required. However, the Short Description is required and should provide enough detail to identify the content of the “Minor Change” Change Order. All other information requested by CCIS, including changes to Working Days, is required. B. Transmittal – Under the Minor Change process (Change Order – Minor Change DOT Form 421-005A) substitutes for the transmittal included in the more formal process described above. The information on the Minor Change form should at a minimum briefly document three key items:
• A description of the change
• Reason for entitlement/why is this not paid by bid items
• Any increase or decrease in cost and time and briefly how it was established C. Distribution – When utilizing the Minor Change process, the Minor Change Form is substituted for the Change Order document and the change record. Backup documentation shall be kept in the project file at the Project Office, with a copy of the completed Minor Change form. The original, signed Minor Change form, change approval documentation, and the original, completed change order checklist shall be submitted to the State Construction Office. The Minor Change shall be fully documented on DOT Form 421-005A, which is limited to pages 1 (Change Order Page) and 2 (Change Record Page), with no more than three new or revised plan sheets included. A copy of the form may be used to document the payment. SS 1-04.4(2) Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP) It is the policy of WSDOT to encourage our contractors to be innovative in planning and performing the work when a cost savings can be realized. When a contractor identifies such a savings and provides a significant portion of the efforts needed to develop the proposal, WSDOT will share the resulting savings with the contractor. This policy is carried out through change orders containing Value Engineering Incentive Payments. The Project Engineer should encourage VECPs and seriously consider the mutual benefits of these proposals brought forth by the contractor as a partner in the contract. A VECP must meet all the requirements enumerated in Standard Specifications Section 1-04.4(2)A, General.

Procedure, Protest and Dispute by the Contractor During the course of a Contract, differences of opinion may arise over decisions and plan interpretations that benefit one party at the expense of the other. WSDOT pursues resolution of these differences at the earliest possible time, fully recognizing the contractual rights of the Contractor during the resolution process. These differences of opinion can become contentious and distracting for both WSDOT and Contractor staff. The Project Engineer should make every effort to maintain professionalism and collaboration between the parties while seeking timely resolution of these disagreements. In all circumstances, the Contractor must continue to proceed with the Work under the Contract. Disagreements, disputes, and protests are the responsibility of the Project Engineer until a Certified Claim is filed in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-09.11. The Project Engineer may employ a variety of techniques and procedures to pursue resolution of these issues. With the high potential for cost impact and delay, it is strongly recommended that all disagreements be identified, tracked, and communicated with the Region Construction Manager as they become apparent.
Protested Work When the Contractor disagrees with the requirements of a change order or a Project Engineer’s Written Determination, a written notice of protest must be submitted according to procedures of Standard Specification Section 1-04.5. While the Project Engineer may acknowledge a Contractor’s verbal protest, the Contractor should be advised that it must follow the procedures of Section 1-04.5 in order to pursue an adjustment of the payment or Contract time, and to avoid waiving its right to pursue a claim for protested work. While these provisions require the Contractor to keep accurate records for completing the protested work, it is not advisable for the Project Engineer to rely on these records to determine what may have taken place when trying to verify costs for protested work many months later. In order to help document the Contractor’s work, the form Report of Protested Work DOT Form 422-007 was developed as a tool for the Project Engineer’s use. If in the opinion of the Project Engineer, the Contractor has not supplied sufficient information to evaluate a protest, the Contractor may be allowed one opportunity to correct or amend their supplemental information. Corrections or amendments of the supplemental information must be furnished within 14 days of the Project Engineer’s notice. Page 1-34

Chapter 1
Only protests and supplemental information that follow the procedures set forth in Section 1-04.5 will be evaluated by the Project Engineer, with a Written Determination of merit provided to the Contractor within 21 days. If the Project Engineer determines that the protest has merit, then an adjustment of the payment or contract time will be made in accordance with Section 1-09.4. If the Project Engineer determines that the protest does not have merit the Contractor may continue to pursue the protest by following the dispute procedures outlined in Section 1-04.5(1). Regardless of the Contractor’s decision to continue the dispute, the Project Engineer must ensure the Contractor continues work. 1-04.5(1)
Disputes
The Contractor must exhaust the procedures for protest before pursuing the matter as a dispute. The Contractor is required to notify the Project Engineer within 14 days after receiving the Project Engineer’s Written Determination of merit of their protest. The Project Engineer should remind the Contractor of its obligation to furnish this notice if it wishes to pursue the dispute. The Contractor must exhaust the procedures in this section, including the use of a Disputes Review Board, before they may submit a Certified Claim under Section 1-09.11. Disputes Review Boards Unresolved Protests may be referred to a Disputes Review Board (the board). Whether the Contract includes the bid item for “Disputes Review Boards” will determine whether referral of the matter to the board requires mutual agreement of the parties or whether either party may refer a matter to the board. Not all matters are eligible to be heard by the board. Typically, the board is best suited to provide recommendations on matters of Contract interpretation or entitlement to additional compensation and time. Interpretations of the law and matters concerning the fairness of Contract terms are usually not appropriate for consideration by a board. In all cases, the Project Engineer must contact the State Construction Office for concurrence before presenting any matter to a Disputes Review Board. The Project Engineer and Contractor are responsible for selecting the board members. They may use the Statewide Prequalified Candidate Roster to select board members, but it is not required. Once established, regular meetings should be held to discuss the status of the project with the board. The board’s primary purpose in regular board meetings is claim avoidance. By monitoring key project indicators and facilitating communications between project participants, the board can be quite effective in helping the project avoid claims. The board may also assist with claim resolution by issuing written recommendations regarding a specific dispute that is referred to them. When the board issues a recommendation concerning a dispute, the Contractor and Project Engineer must respond and either accept the board’s recommendation, request a clarification or reconsideration from the board, or notify the other party that the dispute is unresolved. Although the board recommendations are not binding on either party, they should be weighed carefully and will be admissible in subsequent proceedings such as arbitration or litigation. The Project Engineer should consult with their ASCE if they are not in agreement with the board’s recommendations prior to responding in writing to the board and the Contractor.

SS 1-04.6
Administration
Variation in Estimated Quantities Contracts are set up with estimated quantities. Contractors provide unit prices and actual measured quantities are paid using those unit prices. What happens when the actual measured quantity varies from the estimated proposal quantity? Standard Specifications Section 1-04.6 require that variations of less than 25 percent be performed without changes in the bid price, but that variations greater than 25 percent may qualify for a payment adjustment of the contract bid. This distribution of estimating risk is a policy of WSDOT and is also a Federal requirement for any project with Federal funds. Variations may occur because field conditions cause a different quantity for the planned work than was envisioned during the estimating. Other variations may occur when work is added or deleted by change order and original contract unit items are included as the method of pricing the change order. Finally, quantity variations occur when work is added, deleted, or revised without a formal change order (constructive change) and units with unit prices are the only measure of the revision. The work represented by a constructive change order is in fact work not anticipated at the time the contract was bid and executed, and as such would be outside of the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 1-04.6. In other words, you cannot deny a payment adjustment based solely on the fact that the accepted quantity of a bid item is within 25 percent of the original proposal quantity. As discussed below, quantities included in formal change orders are excluded from consideration of quantity variations. The Project Engineer who allows constructive changes without formal documentation may find an additional negotiation waiting when final adjusted quantities are calculated and compared with the original proposal quantity. A unit bid price consists of four different parts. First, and most obvious, are the costs of labor, equipment, materials and services needed to accomplish the work. These are the “direct costs” involved and they vary directly with the amount of work. Second are the variable overhead costs, such as field supervision, field support items (phones, computer rental, payroll clerks, portable restroom, etc.) whose amounts will vary along with the direct costs. Third, and more difficult to assess, are unavoidable, distributed, fixed overhead costs. These are typically long term and exist whether the quantity varies or not. They include things like home office costs, field trailer setup, long term equipment rentals and other fixed costs. These are typically distributed to the project by allocating them to the plan quantity. Fourth, and finally, the unit price will include some amount for profit. A. Standard Specifications Section 1-04.6 – The standard contract provision calls for the calculation of an adjusted final quantity. This is the method of revising the final measured quantity to allow for proposal item quantities included in agreed change orders. Unit prices as originally bid will be utilized if the adjusted final quantity is more than 75 percent of the original proposal quantity and not more than 25 percent greater than the original proposal quantity. If the final adjusted quantity is outside these limits, then either party to the contract may initiate a renegotiation. If neither party does so, then unit prices will apply to the entire measured quantity of the item. Neither of these actions would be a change to the contract, as the provisions already allow a price change. A formal change order document might well be initiated to show the agreement, however, and would be the mechanism to create new prices.
Page 1-36
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
If a negotiation is initiated, the provision calls for a new price for the quantity in excess of the 25 percent overrun or a contract price adjustment to compensate for costs and losses associated with an excessive underrun. The renegotiated price for the overrun portion is not an equitable adjustment and this is an important distinction. The new price is based upon actual costs experienced and is completely unrelated to the old bid price. The typical discussion about “what’s different from the bid work and what number should be used to modify the bid price?” does not apply in this type of negotiation. The underrun compensation is an equitable adjustment, however, and much of the negotiation is related to the bid price and discussions of the actual work costs as opposed to the planned costs. Other features of the provision include an exclusion of force account items and other items where an amount has been entered solely to provide a common proposal for the bidders. Consequential damages and lost profits are specifically excluded. The effect of any unbalanced allocation of overhead costs is also excluded from compensation under the provision. Force accounts and calculated quantities are already taking actual costs into account for overruns. Because of the nature of these items, contractors are unable to allocate unavoidable fixed costs to them except as a share of the allowed markup. The contractor is aware of this provision at the time of bid and knows that this item will not be eligible for renegotiation in the case of an underrun. Consequential damages are those which are separated from the project and which might be presented as part of a negotiation. “Because of your overrun, I was unable to start work on my other project and had to do that other work in the wintertime.” This consequence of the quantity variation is not compensable because of the wording of the provision. Similarly, the profit that the contractor might have made on some other work but for the need to perform the extra work in an overrun is also not compensable. Unbalanced bidding might result in a significantly higher or lower price for an item than normal. It means that too much or too little of allocated overhead or other costs is assigned to the item. This is not a problem in a low bid situation when all items come in at plan quantity. The problem would arise if an unbalanced item were to be involved in an excessive underrun. This provision allows the Project Engineer to evaluate this possibility during an underrun negotiation (remember that the overrun pricing takes care of the problem automatically by assessing cost and ignoring the bid price.) Contract time may be affected by the first unit of overrun or underrun. It may be appropriate to add or delete working days; depending on how the quantity variation affects critical activities, as shown on the Contractor’s approved progress schedule. B. Negotiation Guidelines 1. Adjusted Final Quantity – The Standard Specifications language is quite clear on this subject. Start with the final measured quantity, the number that would be included in the final estimate for the item. Review all change orders that have been approved and have been accepted by the Contractor (see Standard Specifications Section 1-04.5 for a definition of contractor acceptance of change orders.) Identify change order increases in the item and subtract these from the WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-37
Chapter 1
Administration
final measured quantity. Identify change order decreases in the item and add these to the result of the previous subtraction. The result of these calculations is defined as the Adjusted Final Quantity. Compare the Adjusted Final Quantity to the original proposal quantity. If the Adjusted Final Quantity is greater than 1.25 times the original proposal quantity, then the item is eligible for an overrun renegotiation. If the Adjusted Final Quantity is less than 0.75 times the original proposal quantity, then the item is eligible for negotiation of an equitable adjustment due to underrun. 2. Renegotiation for Overruns – The first analysis should be to determine, if possible, where and when the overrun took place. This is not necessarily the work done after the quantity of 1.25 times proposal was reached. In many cases, a review of the work will disclose which part of the project actually experienced the low estimate and the resulting extra quantity. This is more common in physical items that are visible and can be measured by weight or physical dimensions (Roadway Excavation, Culvert Pipe, Select Borrow, etc.) These are often detailed in the plans to the extent that actual work can be compared with the relevant portion of the proposal quantity. When actual overrun work can be identified and when records exist showing the resources utilized for that work, then those records can form the basis for the revised payment amount. In other cases, the item is a support function, often measured by time, where the plan segments cannot be separated for analysis. This is common in Flagging, Pollution Control items, etc. To analyze these, the only choice is often to look at the actual work that occurred after the threshold was reached and price it. A third method, where records are adequate, is to evaluate the actual costs for the entire item, and apply those only to the overrun units. Regardless of method of determining direct cost, markups will be allowed. A good place to start would be the force account percentages described in Standard Specifications Section 1-09.6. If the contractor is providing other records for overhead and profit, these can be used, if they are reasonable. Any overhead items that are unavoidable, distributed fixed costs should be excluded. Remember that the Contractor has already been compensated for these one and a quarter times over. The revised price will apply only to the units measured in excess of 1.25 times the original proposal quantity. The overrun units between the proposal quantity and the threshold will be paid, according to the terms of the contract, at the bid price. 3. Equitable Adjustment for Underruns – The adjustment for an underrun is limited by the contract terms to three factors. The first of these is an adjustment for any increase or decrease in direct costs that result solely from the reduction in quantity. The most common example of this type of cost is the learning curve. “By the time my crew learned how to do this work at this site with these specifications, we were done. They should have been able to apply these skills to an additional 30, 40, or 50 percent of the plan quantity. I experienced the least efficient units and missed out on the most efficient.” in negotiation, this might be demonstrated by production rates, by inspectors’ reports or by the agreed judgment of the negotiators. If such a condition did exist, then an agreed amount for inefficiency during the learning curve could be included in the adjustment.
Page 1-38
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
The second factor has to do with the nature of the work actually done, when compared with the work shown in the plans. The most common manifestation of this is “You deleted the easiest units and left me with the most difficult,” or “You added units that were much more difficult than those shown in the plan.” Compensable, if true. Logic dictates that, if all of the work shown in the plans was performed and, if no work was added except by formal change order, then this factor can have no value. The work that was performed was what was shown in the plans and was what the Contractor bid. If, on the other hand, the project engineer has allowed constructive changes without formal documentation, then this factor could well come into play. Finally, the negotiation should include a look at reallocation of undistributed unavoidable fixed overhead costs. The contractor has allocated these to 100 percent of the proposal amount. The bid price is firm as long as 75 percent of the units are measured and paid. If the final adjusted quantity is less than 75 percent, then the anticipated contribution of the units not performed (up to 75 percent) can be identified, negotiated and included in the equitable adjustment. One Final Aspect of Underruns – There is a reality that, if more units were paid up to the 75 percent threshold, then there would be no eligibility for negotiation. Because of this, there is a limit to the equitable adjustment. The total paid for the item, including units actually performed and the equitable adjustment cannot exceed 75 percent of the original proposal quantity, multiplied by the unit bid price.
SS 1-04.7
Differing Site Conditions (Changed Conditions) There are two types of changed conditions. The first (Type I) is a hidden condition that is different from that indicated by the Contract (the borings do not show this rock). The second (Type II) is a hidden condition that is not shown differently in the Contract but is unusual and different from what a reasonably prudent Contractor would expect (i.e., “I’ve never seen this before and nobody else has ever seen it, either”). In either case, to qualify for renegotiation, the condition must have a “material” effect on the work. In other words, there must be a definable difference in the way the work will now be performed and that difference must be significant. The contractual rules included in Standard Specifications Section 1-04.7 are related to fair notice and to giving the State an opportunity to examine the condition and, perhaps, order a different approach to the work. If the contractor takes away this opportunity, then there may be grounds for denying compensation for the different approach to the work. In some cases, the changed situation is not recognized until much or all of the work has been done. In that case, the determining factor for notice is the time when the Contractor knew or should have known of the condition. Whenever notice is served, it must be written. Contractors work on tight schedules with one activity interdependent on others and it is not in the public interest to stop work while a changed condition discussion takes place. As soon as possible, to the extent possible, and in any manner which accomplishes the intent, the Project Engineer is expected to consult with the Region Construction Manager and the State Construction Office to obtain the approval before agreeing that a changed condition exists or before entering negotiations for price adjustments.

Control of Work
SS 1-05.1 Authority of the Engineer The Project Engineer is designated as the Contracting Agency’s representative who directly supervises the engineering and administration of the construction Contract. This provides considerable authority to enforce the provisions of the Contract under Standard Specifications Section 1-05.1. This authority is tempered by WSDOT’s policies and delegation of authority from the State Construction Engineer to the Project Engineer. Accordingly, considerable care and professional judgment must be exercised by the Project Engineer in order to avoid exceeding the authority as delegated and to avoid decisions or actions that may be contrary to WSDOT policy. Should there be any doubts as to the limits of authority; the Project Engineer should consult the Regional Construction Manager. In many cases the courts have held that where the Project Engineer has exceeded their delegated authority their actions are binding upon Contracting Agency. Because of this, it is important that the Project Engineer make no instructions, verbally or by written memoranda, that are outside of their authority. The term Written Determination is defined in Standard Specification Section 1-01.3. It is important for the Project Engineer to understand that the Written Determination initiates most of the contractual timelines related to protests, disputes, delays, and Contract changes. It signals to the Contractor that they have limited time to protect their contractual rights by either accepting the Project Engineer’s position, or by initiating a dispute or demand for additional compensation. A Written Determination must be transmitted to the Contractor by a letter or electronic mail, and it must be clearly identified as a “Written Determination”. SS 1-05.1(1) Oral Orders The Project Engineer may occasionally need to issue oral directions, instructions, interpretations and determinations in order to protect the traveling public or to avoid unnecessary delay to critical Work. While these circumstances are unavoidable, the Project Engineer should avoid giving oral orders, opting for other verifiable communication methods using a mobile electronic device or other means. If an oral order is given, the Project Engineer must send the Contractor a Written Determination within 3 days, documenting the order and specifying whether it constitutes a change to the Contract. Oral orders can be misunderstood or misinterpreted, making it crucial that the Project Engineer provide the order in writing so the Contractor may understand its rights and obligations under the Contract. During the course of the project the Contractor may believe it has been given an oral order that changes the Work. Standard Specification Section 1-05.1(1) requires the Contractor to notify the Project Engineer within 3 days of receiving an oral order. Upon receiving this notification from a Contractor, the Project Engineer will provide a Written Determination within 14 days. Having notified the Project Engineer of an oral order in Page 1-40
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
accordance with this section, the Contractor has preserved its rights to pursue a protest and dispute until the Project Engineer issues a Written Determination. The purpose of this procedure is to avoid misunderstanding between the parties, and to identify disagreements as early as possible. If the Contractor disagrees with any Written Determination, it must follow the procedure for protest in Section 1-04.5. SS 1-05.1(2) Requests for Information (RFI) The request for information is the procedure by which the Contractor may officially request an explanation or interpretation of the Contract. The Contractor is expected to notify the Project Engineer of ambiguities in the Contract as soon as they are discovered. Failure to do so may result in denial of any resulting claims. Requests for information must not be used as a means of providing notice of protest or notice of a differing site condition. RFIs should also not be used to request time extensions. However, the Contractor may submit an RFI for any of the reasons listed in the Standard Specifications. See Section 1-04.4(1) and 1-05.7 for more discussion on RFIs. The Project Engineer has a responsibility for resolving ambiguities in a timely manner. Therefore, they must respond to a RFI within the timeframe provided in the Contract. If more than 14 calendar days are needed, because of the complexity of the RFI, they should notify the Contractor. Responses to RFIs are considered Written Determinations and any disagreement from the Contractor should follow the procedure for protest. Rejection or non-approval of a RFI that requests a change to the Contract is not subject to protest. Project Engineer’s Relationship and Responsibilities The Region will appoint a Project Engineer to act as the authorized representative of the Secretary of Transportation for each contracted project. To avoid Contract claims, the Region and Project Engineer must not negotiate Contract items with the Contractor until the Contract has been executed by WSDOT (see Section 1-03.3). Prior to execution, the Region and Project Engineer must keep communication with the Contractor to non-contractual items such as congratulations, general introductions, or directing them to CAPS Unit for execution questions. After the Contract has been executed by WSDOT, the Region may provide the Contractor with written confirmation of the name and address of the Project Engineer assigned. (The Region may rely on the special provisions and forego this letter, unless a change is made.) If a letter is sent, the Contractor should be reminded to send all correspondence and forms regarding the project to the Project Engineer. The Project Engineer is then responsible for enforcement of the Contract Specifications and provisions and the completion of all work according to the plans. The Project Engineer supervises the work of WSDOT personnel assigned to the project and ensures that they perform their work in accordance with the Plans, Specifications and all applicable WSDOT policies. The Project Engineer is responsible for keeping complete and accurate records of all construction data and work progress, preparing progress and final estimates, and preparing other records necessary for a complete documentation of the project, including a performance evaluation of the Contractor (see Section 1-00.9).
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-41
Chapter 1
Administration
Changes made to the project or substitutions for work detailed in the contract plans or specifications, must be made in accordance with the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 1-04 and the guidance provided by Section SS 1-04.4. The Project Engineer should review the project on a regular basis with the Regional Maintenance personnel so they have an opportunity to present any maintenance problems that may arise. The Project Engineer must, at all times, stay aware of the design implications of actions taken during construction. Change orders and undocumented field adjustments can affect the design standards utilized. If change orders or field adjustments affect the project design criteria, the changes must be documented, approved, and incorporated into the Design Documentation Package. The Project Engineer shall contact the Region Project Development staff for guidance in documenting these design criteria changes. The Project Engineer should also consult with Region Environmental Permit Coordinators and Environmental Subject Matter Experts to make sure proposed design changes comply with environmental requirements. Responsibility as a Public Official The Project Engineer is responsible for a project that is affected by Federal, State, Tribal, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations. While no one could be familiar with every requirement, the Project Engineer should seek to understand as much as possible. Beyond that, the prudent Project Engineer will look for guidance and seek information related to whatever current issue is at hand. Legal requirements could affect State employees, those employed by the Contractor in performing the work, the materials to be incorporated, the equipment that is used on the project, or could otherwise affect the conduct of work. If the Project Engineer discovers that any provision of the contract, plans, or specifications appears to be inconsistent with a law, ordinance, or regulation, the inconsistency should be investigated and, if appropriate, referred to the Region Construction Manager. The Project Engineer should, at all times, strive to comply with all laws, ordinances, and regulations. Relationship with the Contractor The Project Engineer must be familiar with the conditions of the contract, special provisions, and specifications for the work. The Project Engineer must attend to any reasonable request of the Contractor, i.e., furnishing grades, stakes, plans, whenever necessary and within reason. In general, the Project Engineer should do all things necessary to enable the Contractor to work to advantage and without delay. The Project Engineer should not set any stakes or furnish to the Contractor any plans which are the responsibility of the Contractor to set or provide. The Project Engineer must ensure that the Contractor performs the work in accordance with the contract provisions, plans, and specifications. Integrity on the part of all employees is essential. The attitude of the Project Engineer and staff toward the Contractor and the Contractor’s personnel should be one of cooperation, consistent with the requirements of the Specifications. It should be recognized that both the State and the Contractor have explicit rights under the Contract and that both parties must respect those rights. The Contractor is generally trying to complete the Contract as required. Errors or difficulties are usually due to a lack of information or misunderstandings. If conflict should occur, the Project Engineer should make every effort Page 1-42
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
to determine the cause of the conflict and make appropriate corrections. The Contractor also has the responsibility, under 1-05.1(2) Requests for Information, to notify the Contracting Agency of ambiguities that exist in the Contract and should be encouraged to do so. Relationship with Other Government Agencies Other agencies responsible for such things as flood control, land development, resource protection, stream navigation, or pollution may be affected by the work. The Project Engineer must ensure that the contractor follows the contract pertaining to these and other related issues. The Project Engineer is encouraged to obtain a copy of commitments from the project design file or other sources, like the Commitment Tracking System. This should be available from a region or project design office. This file should contain environmental permits/agreements, real estate commitments, utility commitments, design deviations, and other important information. When the Contractor is specifically required by the contract to obtain an approval document from other agencies, the Project Engineer must confirm that the document was received. Other approvals required of the contractor, but not mentioned in the contract documents should be confirmed to the extent that the requirements are known and the confirmation is possible. If a representative of an agency visits the project, the Project Engineer or an inspector should accompany the representative on the visit. In carrying out construction work in forested areas, the Project Engineer should encourage the Contractor to comply with all Federal and State forest rules and regulations governing the protection of forests and the prosecution of the work within both national and State forests. The Contractor must take all precautions necessary to prevent and suppress forest fires. The Project Engineer shall report to the nearest forest fire warden at the earliest possible moment, the location and extent of any fire and shall take immediate steps to control the fire if practicable. Construction work in or near streams, rivers, or other bodies of water may require a permit from state and federal agencies, including but not limited to the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, Washington State Department of Ecology, or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Project Engineer is encouraged to coordinate closely with these (and other) agencies during permit acquisition to ensure the permits don’t contain conflicting conditions. Also, be sure to consult across agencies if one of these agencies request modifications to the project that may affect other permits. The Project Engineer should ensure that the provisions of environmental permits are rigidly enforced. If the Contractor’s method of operations, weather conditions, design changes, or other factors affect waters of the state in ways not anticipated or represented in the permit, the Project Engineer will work with the Region Environmental Office and the Contractor (if necessary) to modify the existing permit(s) or obtain a new or revised one(s) as appropriate. The U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) has jurisdiction over and inspects mine sites. A pit, quarry, or other aggregate production facilities may be considered a mine site and under the jurisdiction of MSHA. Testing facilities, personnel and equipment located within a mine site are subject to Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations Parts 46 Training and Retraining of Miners engaged in shell dredging or employed at sand, gravel, surface stone, surface clay, colloidal phosphate, or surface limestone mines and Part 56 Safety and Health Standards – Surface Metal and Nonmetal Mines. When possible, WSDOT-owned testing facilities should be located WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-43
Chapter 1
Administration
outside the fenced area of the mine. If testing facilities are located on mine property, they should be placed where other mine administrative offices are located. Before entering a mine site, contact the operator of the site and request site-specific hazard-awareness training which should include what personal protective equipment is required. This training is required by Title 30 CFR for facilities under MSHA jurisdiction. WSDOT employees are not considered miners and therefore must be escorted to/ through the mine site by a Trained Miner when obtaining samples, as required by Title 30 CFR Part 46. The U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration, Metal and Non-Metal Mine Health and Safety Division, 3633 136th Place SE, Suite No. 206, Bellevue, WA 98006, 206-553-7037, must be notified at the beginning and closing of all mining operations. This includes surface mining, such as our normal pit site operations. Notification is required for all crusher operations and for all pits and quarries, including borrow pits, which are separated from the roadway under construction. The owner, operator, or person in charge of the mine site is responsible for notification to MSHA for all mining operations; including those taking place in WSDOT furnished pits and must submit the required report as soon as the date of opening or closing can reasonably be determined. Whenever construction work is performed in navigable waterways, it is necessary to obtain a construction permit from the Coast Guard. One of the requirements of the construction permit is regular submission of Bridge Construction Progress Reports. Two copies of the report should be prepared by the Project Engineer sufficiently in advance of the first working day of the month and transmitted to the State Bridge and Structures Engineer. When a Coast Guard permit modification is proposed (by the Contractor or WSDOT), it shall be submitted to the Bridge and Structures Engineer for processing through the Coast Guard. The time required for approval/disapproval of the proposed permit modification is variable and depends on the nature and significance of the modification. Up to six months may be required. When all construction obstructions to navigation have been removed, the Project Engineer shall report that fact immediately to the Bridge and Structures Engineer indicating the date removal was completed. Upon completion of all permitted bridge work, a final report indicating the date of completion and certifying that the bridge has been constructed in compliance with the Coast Guard Bridge Permit shall be submitted by the Project Engineer to the State Bridge and Structures Engineer. Preconstruction Meetings, Discussions The Project Engineer is required to communicate with the Contractor for the purpose of discussing the project and exchanging a variety of information. Depending upon the complexity of the project, this information can be exchanged in any combination of the following methods:
• Information packets provided to the Contractor.
• Letters transmitting information.
• Informal meetings.
• A single multipurpose formal meeting.
• Several formal meetings with different purposes.
Page 1-44
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
If the Project Engineer decides that a formal meeting is necessary in order to successfully begin work on the project, a meeting should be arranged as soon as practical after the contract is awarded and the Contractor has organized for the work. In the case of a project that includes utilities to be adjusted, relocated, replaced or constructed by a utility, or their contractor, during the performance of the contract, the Project Engineer shall facilitate a mandatory utility preconstruction meeting with the Contractor, all affected utility owners and their contractors prior to any on-site work. The Project Engineer should request assistance from the Region Utilities Engineer for help in getting utilities to attend this meeting. This meeting should include a discussion of all utility work schedules, in order to enable the utilities and the Contractor to coordinate their work, resolve schedule conflicts, and eliminate delays. In the case of a project that includes work on or near a reservation, the Project Engineer should notify the appropriate Tribe of the preconstruction conference and invite them to attend. The Revised Code of Washington (RCW 47.01.300 and 47.85.030) requires that projects with environmental considerations be reviewed during the preconstruction meetings held with the contractor. The Memorandum of Agreement Concerning Implementation of Fish and Wildlife Hydraulic Code for Transportation Activities requires WSDOT to invite the Area Habitat Biologist for the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to all environmental preconstruction meetings. More information about discussing environmental topics at the preconstruction meeting is found in the Chapter 600 of the Environmental Manual. Verification of the Contractor’s Certified Erosion and Sediment Control Lead (CESCL) is required when the project has obtained a NPDES Construction Stormwater General Permit See the Erosion and Sediment Control webpage on verifying CESCL credentials. All information exchanged should be documented in the project records, by formal meeting minutes, by file copies of letters, or by diary entries. The nature, amounts, and methods of communication with the Contractor are left to the Project Engineer. As a minimum, the following subject areas should be covered during the preconstruction time period:
• Contractor WSDOT Relationships – The Project Engineer should begin to develop a positive and effective relationship with the Contractor as soon as the contract is awarded. This is also a good time to introduce the concept of “Partnering” if it has not already been introduced on the project. The Project Engineer should strive to create an environment that encourages a cooperative approach to completing the project. This can be helped by beginning the development of a team consisting of both the Contractor’s and WSDOT’s project people. The level of authority delegated to each member of the Project Engineer’s staff should be discussed with the Contractor. The level of authority of each member of the Contractor’s staff, in particular regarding change orders, should be discussed. In addition, the methods of establishing the Contractor’s Performance ratings can be reviewed (see Section 1-00.9 for additional information). The Contractor should also be informed that there is an opportunity to evaluate the WSDOT construction process as well. Especially on projects with Contractor surveying, it is strongly advised to invite the Region Survey Committee member or their representative to discuss the requirements for removing, disturbing, or re-establishing survey monuments. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-45
Chapter 1
Administration
• Environmental Commitments – Almost every project will have environmental commitments resulting from, but not limited to: 1) environmental processes like the National Environmental Policy Act or the Washington State Environmental Policy Act; 2) consultations with Federal agencies concerning endangered species; 3) obtaining Federal, State, and local permits; or 4) existing inter agency agreements. WSDOT uses the Commitment Tracking System (CTS) to store project specific environmental commitments and to organize them by ownership; Contractor, WSDOT, or both. It is WSDOT policy to incorporate all Contract-relevant environmental commitments into the Contract. As a result, the Special Provisions and the Plans should contain all the Contract-relevant environmental commitments not covered by the Standard Specifications. The Project Engineer is encouraged to review the Special Provisions and Plans with the Contractor at the preconstruction meeting. The Project Engineer should consider using relevant information from the Environmental Compliance Binder (See Environmental Manual Chapter 600) during the preconstruction meeting and throughout the project. The Contractor’s responsibility to obtain any local agency permits should also be discussed. For example if a rock crusher is required for a project, the State Department of Ecology registration requirements should be discussed (WAC 173-400). In addition, a written record of this discussion should be sent to the Regional Office of the State Department of Ecology so that they are aware of the timing and location of the rock crushing operation.
• Order of Work and Time Schedules – The Project Engineer needs to know the Contractor’s schedule of work in order to set up the crews, arrange for any special inspections, or provide timely reviews of submittals. The contract requirements for progress schedule or time for completion in accordance with Section 1-08, or as amended by the special provisions, can also be discussed. When shown in the Plans, the first order of work shall be the installation of high visibility fencing to delineate all areas for protection or restoration. The Project Engineer should review the Plans at the preconstruction meeting to ensure these resources are not disturbed during clearing and grading activities. See the Erosion Control website for the Project Engineer to ensure the clearing limits are properly marked in the field to protect sensitive areas.
• Subcontractors and Lower-Tier Subcontractors – In accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-08.1, the Project Engineer needs to become aware of the Contractor’s plans to delegate portions of the work to subcontractors. These plans must conform to the condition of award, if any, related to underutilized disadvantaged business enterprise participation. The Project Engineer should explain the requirements and process involved for subcontractor and lower-tier subcontractor approval, including the prevailing wage rate requirements outlined in the contract documents (see Section SS 1-07.9(1)), the requirement to verify that each subcontractor meets the responsibility criteria outline in 39.04 RCW and possesses any license required by 19.28 RCW or 70.87 RCW, and the requirement that all subcontracts (of whatever tier) on Federal Aid contracts must include FHWA-1273 and Amendments to FHWA-1273. WSDOT/Contractor/Subcontractor relationships should also be discussed. The Project Engineer should remind the Contractor that there is no contractual relationship between WSDOT and the subcontractors. All subcontractor correspondence with WSDOT should pass through the Contractor for submittal to WSDOT or vice versa. Contractor representation should also be Page 1-46
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
discussed. It will be necessary for the Contractor to be represented at the job site at all times, even when there is only subcontractor work in progress.
• Utilities, Railroads, and Other Third Parties – If the project affects or is affected by third party organizations, the Project Engineer must advise the Contractor about the relationships with the third parties and the expectations they hold regarding the actions of both WSDOT and the Contractor. The Project Engineer may wish to arrange face-to-face meetings with representatives of affected third parties. In the case of utilities, reference should be made to the underground locator services and the requirements to utilize them (see RCW 19.122). If WSDOT has agreed to notification time limits, these should be communicated to the Contractor. If special insurance is required by any agreements with third parties, then these requirements should be pointed out to the Contractor. If utilities are to be adjusted, relocated, repaired or constructed by the utility during the performance of the contract, the Project Engineer shall facilitate a separate, mandatory, utility preconstruction meeting with the Contractor, the utility, and their contractors. If public transportation agencies will be impacted, the Project Engineer will consistently supply information to WSDOT’s Construction Traffic Management team throughout the life of the project. Keep in mind that public transportation is not just fixed routes, but includes services for people with special needs, vanpools, park and ride lots, and other ride-sharing services. Traffic hot spots and other traffic information is accessible at: www.wsdot.wa.gov/construction/planning
• Safety and Traffic Control – The Contractor’s safety program should be discussed as outlined in Section SS 1-07.1. WSDOT has an interest in safe operations on the job and the Project Engineer should make clear that this interest will be protected. As part of a discussion of specific safety requirements of the particular work, safety considerations for workers and WSDOT personnel, such as safety zone requirements, vehicle intrusion protection, fall prevention, closed spaces, hazardous materials, work around heavy equipment, etc., should be addressed. The need for control of speed on all construction equipment should be emphasized. The Project Engineer should describe WSDOT’s traffic requirements. The Contractor’s Traffic Control Manager (TCM), Traffic Control Supervisor (TCS) and WSDOT’s traffic control contact person should be identified and their responsibilities and authorities clearly stated. Any traffic control requirements that are unique or restrictive should be emphasized and addressed by the Contractor with respect to construction operations. Unacceptable delays to traffic should also be discussed. The MUTCD, as adopted by WSDOT, is the legal standard for all signing, traffic control devices and traffic control plan requirements on the project. These standards have been incorporated into the project Traffic Control Plans (TCPs.) If the Contractor chooses to use these TCPs, they must be formally adopted in writing as required in Standard Specifications Section 1-10.2(2). If the Contractor wishes to use some other traffic control scheme, then that plan must be submitted and approved in advance. Flaggers and their intended locations must be included in the plans. When Flaggers are utilized, they must have a current flagging card and shall be equipped with hard hats, vests, and standard stop/slow paddles as required in Standard Specifications Section 1-07.8 and 1-10.3. Overuse of flaggers is not appropriate as “catch all” traffic control and should be discouraged. Safety of flaggers, through use of physical protection devices where practical, proper flagging methods and formulating an emergency escape plan, should be emphasized. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-47
Chapter 1
Administration
The Contractor and the Project Engineer should establish communication with the Washington State Patrol (WSP) and local law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement advice about traffic control should be considered. Arrangements for all law enforcement agencies to notify the Project Office about accidents near, or in, the construction area should be established, if possible. If WSP traffic control assistance is to be used, a general discussion of strategy and responsibilities should be included. Off-site hauling can pose a safety hazard to the public. WSDOT will cooperate with law enforcement agencies in the enforcement of legal load limit requirements and the covered load regulations. The Project Engineer should discuss this with the Contractor before any hauling begins. The Contractor should be reminded of Standard Specifications Section 1-07.1, requiring the Contractor to comply with all Federal, State, tribal or local laws, ordinances, and regulation that affect Work under the contract. Particular mention should be made of observance of Industrial Fire Precaution Levels (IFPL) when performing work on or adjacent to forest land under the purview of the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The Contractor is required to comply with all fire regulation including, but not limited to, fire shutdowns, fire fighting tools required, notifications, etc. Information regarding IFPLs may be found on the DNR webpage listed: www.dnr.wa.gov/RecreationEducation/Topics/FireBurningRegulations/Pages/ rp_fire_ifpl.aspx.aspx
• Control of Materials – The Contractor should be reminded of Standard Specifications Section 1-06.1, requiring the Engineer’s approval of all materials prior to their use. In order to expedite these approvals, the Contractor should be encouraged to make these requests as early as possible. The Project Engineer should provide the Contractor with a current copy of the Record of Materials (ROM) for the project. The Project Engineer should discuss the ROM with the Contractor, covering the various requirements for sampling, catalog cuts, shop drawings, certification requirements, etc., which may be needed for approval of materials prior to their use. If the project includes Federal funds, the Project Engineer should discuss the requirements of “Buy America” and DOT Form 350-109, Certification of Materials Origin. The requirements of Standard Specifications Section 1-06.2 for ongoing acceptance of approved materials prior to their being incorporated into the work, should also be discussed. The Project Engineer should discuss with the Contractor who should have access to the Statistical Acceptance of Material (SAM) program. If fabricated items will be needed, the inspection process for fabricated materials, including shop drawing approvals and notification requirements for fabrication inspectors, should also be outlined. The requirements of Standard Specifications Section 1-06.3 that require manufacturer certifications prior to use of the materials should also be reviewed. The Contractor should be reminded that, in order to avoid deferred progress payments for portions of work not completed, all necessary documentation for approval of materials and required certifications must be received and accepted prior to their use. A method of notification of intent to defer payment should be discussed with the Contractor, and an agreed upon method documented in the project files.
• Other Submittals – Discuss any other submittals that may be needed during the course of the contract. This may include Falsework and Forming Plans, Traffic Control Plans, Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Plans, Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plans, Schedules, Installation or Operating Procedures, Temporary Stream Diversion Plans, Painting Plans, or other Contractor initiated items requiring WSDOT review and/or approval. There are requirements for a number of submittals Page 1-48
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
which, if not satisfied in a timely manner, could delay the initial progress payment. These include the Statement of Intent to Pay Prevailing Wages, the Progress Schedule, and the Training Plan. There may be others depending on the work to be done and as required by the contract provisions. The Project Engineer should identify and remind the Contractor of these requirements and the potential for deferred payments.
• DBE Participation/EEO/Training – The Project Engineer should briefly discuss and answer any questions the contractor may have with regard to the efforts, reports, and monitoring necessary to ensure successful performance for DBE Participation, EEO, Apprentice Utilization, and Training. Section SS 1-07.11(2) of this manual provides a breakdown of these various programs and the general requirements each contains. However, the specific requirements and contractor performance information are included in the Standard Specifications, the Amendments included in the contract, as well as the contract specific special provisions titled Equal Employment Opportunity Responsibilities. If additional assistance or information is necessary, the Project Engineer could also request assistance from the Region EEO Officer, the State Office of Equal Opportunity, or the State Construction Office. The Contractor should be ready to discuss how utilizing the services of the Department of Employment Security’s Work Source will be incorporated into their recruitment program when filling new jobs on the project.
• Wage Rate Administration – Advise the Contractor of the requirement to pay prevailing wage rates as identified in the Contract. Advise the Contractor that it is their responsibility to work directly with Washington State Department of Labor and Industries (LNI) for approval of the Statement of Intent to Pay Prevailing Wages (SOI) and Affidavit of Wages Paid (AWP) and that: – The SOI and AWP will be on forms provided by LNI. – The forms will be filed electronically using LNIs online system – Prevailing Wage, Intents and Affidavits (PWIA). – The contractors, subcontractors, lower-tier subcontractors, suppliers, manufacturers, and fabricators that are required to submit SOIs and AWPs will pay the approval fee directly to LNI. – The Contractor will submit a copy of the approved forms (SOI, before any payment can be made for work performed and all AWPs before the contract can be accepted) to the Project Engineer through PWIA. – If payrolls are required, establish submittal deadlines in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-07.9(5) and describe the wage rate interview process. – Describe the required and/or recommended job site posters and provide them to the Contractor (see Section SS 1-07.9(2)). – On all Federal-Aid contracts, the Project Engineer must remind the Contractor that the work falls under the guidance of Davis-Bacon and Related Acts and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Acts. As indicated in Section SS 1-07.9(1), the U.S. Department of Labor may conduct investigations to ensure compliance with these Acts.
• Forms – The Project Engineer should provide the Contractor a description of all required forms, providing guidance on where the Contractor can find each www.wsdot.wa.gov/forms/pdfForms.html. Remind the Contractor that all form submittals, including those of subcontractors, lower-tier subcontractors, and suppliers, should be routed through the Prime Contractor for submittal to WSDOT. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-49
Chapter 1
Administration
• Request for Information – The Project Engineer will provide the Contractor a description of the Request for Information (RFI) – WSDOT Form 410-010 – and provide the Contractor a copy. The Project Engineer should discuss the RFI process as provided for in Standard Specification 1-05.1(2) and 1-05.7(1) to discuss the Contractor’s responsibility in this process. The RFI process is a tool for documentation and communication between the Contractor and the Project Engineer but should not take the place of building a working relationship with the Contractor. The Contractor is required to submit an RFI if they believe there is information missing or a clarification of the Contract is needed. At a minimum, the Project Engineer will communicate with the Contractor on a weekly basis the status of RFIs.
• Summary – While these issues are to be discussed with the Contractor in some manner at the beginning of each contract, the Project Engineer is free to select the most effective method of doing so. A formal preconstruction conference may or may not be the best solution. Perhaps a single meeting is adequate or several meetings may be required. The entire preconstruction communication may also be covered in a short meeting between the Project Engineer and the Contractor. The Project Engineer is responsible to address these subjects, inform the Contractor in some manner and maintain a written summary of the preconstruction meetings or discussions for the contract files. The Contractor and Project Engineer may be knowledgeable about those normal requirements listed above. In this situation, some items need only be listed in a mailing as a convenience to the Contractor’s staff. Unique features, constructability, and third party coordination should be focused on with as many of the interested parties as can be assembled. The key is effective communication, getting the right message to the necessary people. Additional meetings may be required as people change, as new facets of the work become imminent, or as the project goes into a second or third season. In order to assist this process, a checklist has been developed as a tool for the Project Office’s use. It can be used to help identify the issues and track them for completion through the various preconstruction communications.
SS 1-05.3
Plans and Working Drawings Working Drawings submitted by the Contractor must be reviewed and checked for conformance to Contract requirements by the Project Office. Submittals that are incomplete, not legible, or not in conformance with Contract requirements shall be Returned for Correction and shall not be distributed for review outside the Project Office. If the Contract submittal requirements require modification, the submittal cannot be submitted and reviewed until after a change order is processed revising the submittal requirements. A Change Order is required for any deviation from Contract requirements. Any conflicts with the Contract Plans that have been detected or revisions that may be desired by the Project Engineer should be noted on the copy being forwarded to Headquarters. If change orders to cover any deviations from the Contract Plans have been issued, or are being processed, those changes should also be noted and copies of the change orders shall be provided to the reviewers.

Figure 1-1 is a list of the most common Working Drawings and includes references to the Specifications that require them and the Section of this manual that covers the procedures for processing them. The WSDOT Review Groups column identifies the groups within WSDOT that need to review the various Working Drawings. All review by State groups (Bridge Technical Advisor, Bridge Construction Support, Bridge and Structures Architect, Geotechnical Engineer, State Materials Laboratory and Assistant State Construction Engineer) identified in Figure 1-1 is coordinated by the Bridge Technical Advisor or Bridge Construction Support. Submittals are coordinated by the Bridge Technical Advisor if they are listed as a review group in Figure 1-1, and all other submittals are coordinated by Bridge Construction Support. Bridge Technical Advisor and Bridge Construction Support assignments and can be found here: BTA List. The Project Engineer should use DOT Form 410-025 to transmit the Working Drawings with State review requirements to the Bridge and Structures Office. The Bridge Technical Advisor or Bridge Construction Support will then send a response back to the Project Engineer that incorporates comments from all State review groups. The Project Engineer should maintain a log of all shop plans or other drawings received for each contract. Shop plans for items that conform to the contract plans or a standard plan, except those listed in Figure 1-1, should be reviewed by the Project Engineer. Type 1 Working Drawings are generally informational in nature and are often used to provide the Project Engineer a description of work to be completed and allow the Project Engineer an opportunity to prepare for the inspection of this work. A Type 1 Working Drawing does not require a response to the Contractor. Should the Project Engineer determine the work proposed by the Contractor does not comply with the contract, a response should be sent to the Contractor. Type 2 and 2E Working Drawings are required for work that is more complex or specialized than what would be required for a Type 1 Working Drawing. A Type 2 Working Drawing is submitted to the Project Engineer for review and comment and will often be reviewed by support offices that specializes in the type of work. The Project Engineer is allowed up to 20 calendar days for review and the Contractor is not allowed to begin work until the Project Engineer has provided review comments. It is important that the Project Engineer complete the review and return comments, even if the plan is acceptable, to prevent a delay to the Contractor. Type 3 and 3E Working Drawings require WSDOT’s approval prior to the Contractor beginning work, and the Project Engineer is allowed 30 calendar days to complete their review. For Type 3 and 3E Working Drawings, it is important that the Project Engineer complete the review and reply to the Contractor within the allowed 30 calendar days. Should the Project Engineer fail to complete the review and respond to the Contractor within the allowable time for the Type 2 or 3 Working Drawings, the Contractor may be entitled to compensation for impacts due to the delay. At this time, not all sections of the Standard Specifications and Special Provisions have been updated to reflect the revisions to Section 1-05.3. There will still be some sections that reference different requirements for the submittal and review of Working Drawings. The Project Engineer should review the Contract to confirm the proper Working Drawing requirements are being followed.

Comments on Working Drawings should be related only to conformance of the Working Drawing to the contractual requirements. Possible responses to Working Drawings include:
• Approved (only use for Working Drawings that require WSDOT approval)
• No exceptions taken
• Make corrections noted
• Revise and resubmit
• Rejected Working Drawings that conform to the requirements of the contract will generally be returned as approved for Type 3 or no exceptions taken for Type 2. Working Drawings that don’t comply with the contract will be returned with one of the other responses depending on the nature and severity of the contractual compliance issues.

Conformity with and Deviations from Plans and Stakes
Permanent Monuments Most permanent monuments which are in the construction zone are relocated by the establishing agency. Normally these monuments are relocated prior to beginning of construction, but if monuments are found within the construction zone, they must be preserved until they can be moved. If the urgency of construction does not allow time for the relocation of the monument, it must be properly referenced so it may be reset or relocated at a later time. When a monument is found within the construction area, the proper agency shall be notified promptly and requested to relocate the monument. Property Corner Monuments and Markers It is imperative that land plats and property corners be preserved. The 1973 Legislature enacted a Survey Recording Act, RCW 58.09, to provide a method for preserving evidence of land surveys by establishing standards and procedures for monuments and for recording surveys as a public record. When a general land office corner, plat survey corner, or property line corner exists in the construction zone, it is necessary to properly reference it and reset it after the construction work has been done. RCW 58.09.040 requires that, for all monuments that are set or reset, a record of the monument be filed on a Monumentation Map with the County Engineer in the county in which the corner exists and the original sent to the State Right of Way Plans Branch, who will forward a copy to DNR for their records. Alignment Monumentation During construction, alignment monumentation may be altered to fit field conditions. Such changes may include:
• Normally all PCs and PTs are to be monumented. Additional point on tangent (POT) monuments are necessary where line of sight is, or may in the future be obstructed by the horizontal or vertical alignment, buildings, or other barriers.
• When the right of way and the construction alignment do not coincide, the monumentation shall be such that the exact right of way as acquired can be positioned in the field. This will generally require, as a minimum, that the right of way alignment be monumented.
• When safety of the survey crew or survival of the monuments is an issue, monuments may be offset from the true alignment. An extra effort in accuracy must be made when setting offset monuments to ensure an accurate reestablishment of the true alignment. The monumentation, including monument locations, reference distances, stations, and bearings, is to be shown on the as built plans. Surveying Provided by the State Unless the contract states otherwise, the Project Engineer is responsible for providing all surveying needed to locate and define the contract work. The staking done in construction surveying must assure that the work will conform to the plans and must also conform to the Contractor’s approach to the work. There are numerous survey techniques that will accomplish these objectives. Prior to each phase of the work, the Project Engineer must reach agreement with the Contractor concerning the method, location, and timing of construction staking. Once this agreement is reached, it must be shared with all WSDOT, Contractor, and subcontractor personnel who place or use construction stakes. Page 1-58
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
Contractor Surveying If the contract requires the Contractor to provide some or all of the construction surveying, the Project Engineer is required to provide only the primary control points staked, marked, and verified in the field and the coordinate information for the main alignment points in the plans. The plan alignment and the field control points must be referenced to the same grid coordinate system. The provisions for contractor surveying are intended to provide the stakes needed to inspect the work, as well as the primary function of locating and defining the work. If the survey stakes required by the contract do not provide the reference data needed for inspection, then the Project Engineer will have to provide additional survey work that is needed. As an alternative, a change could be negotiated with the Contractor to perform the added work. The Contractor’s survey work is a contract item, just like all other contract items. It must be inspected for adequacy and conformance with the contract. Once it is performed and inspected, it must be paid for. The wise Project Engineer will inspect the survey efforts and check as much of the contractor’s work as is practical. Any errors should be brought to the Contractor’s attention for corrective action. The inclusion of contractor surveying in a project transfers the risk of survey errors to the Contractor. The Project Engineer must assure that the survey work of the Contracting Agency does not relieve the Contractor of that risk. Subgrade Grade Control Tolerance The finish required on roadway subgrades shall ensure a final grade in as close conformity to the planned grade and cross-Section as is practicable, consistent with the type of material being placed. Subgrade blue tops shall be set 0.05 ft below subgrade elevation and be accurate to + or – 0.01 ft. The finished subgrade surface shall not deviate from the plan subgrade elevation by more than +0.00 to -0.05 ft. Where excessively rocky materials are being placed, deviations in excess of the above may be accepted where, in the opinion of the Engineer, closer conformance cannot be achieved by normal procedures and with a reasonable amount of effort and care on the part of the Contractor. Conformance to grade shall be checked by rod and level, straight-edging, or other appropriate engineering method as selected by the Engineer. Surfacing Grade Control Tolerance Red and Yellow tops for surfacing materials shall be set accurate to + or -0.01 ft. The finish of the compacted materials shall conform to the grade established by the blue tops as closely as is practicable and in general, should not deviate from the established grade in excess of the following: ballast and base course, + or – 0.05 ft; top course for bituminous surface treatment, + or – 0.03 ft; top course for asphalt concrete, + or – 0.02 ft; surfacing under treated base course, + or – 0.03 ft; treated base under Portland cement concrete pavement, + 0.00 to – 0/02 ft. Conformance should be checked by use of rod and levels from blue tops and/or by stringline or straight edge methods as determined appropriate by the Engineer. The above schedule refers to conformance both longitudinally and transversely to the traveled way. The outer shoulder line finished grades shall not exceed double the deviations outlined for the traveled way. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-59
Chapter 1
Administration
In the event that additional blue tops are not set for setting grade of surfacing courses, the grade of the surfacing shall be referenced to the earthwork subgrade blue tops and adequate controls shall be used to ensure the placement of the required thickness of surfacing and a final surface meeting the requirements outlined above. Inspection of Course Thicknesses Tabulated below are the permissible deviations in measured thickness for specified depths of surfacing and paving. While these are the maximum deviations that can be allowed, the Project Engineer may impose tighter requirements for conforming to the plan dimensions where there is a reason to do so. Material

SS 1-05.7
Removal of Defective and Unauthorized Work Contract Final Acceptance for all work completed on a project is made solely by the Secretary of Transportation acting through the State Construction Engineer. However, the Engineer relies heavily on the actions and professional opinions of others, involved throughout the course of work, in determining acceptability. Because of this, it is expected that the Project Engineer, working with the assistance of the Regional Construction Manager, as well as making full use of the many resources available at both the Regional and State level, particularly the office of the State Construction Engineer, will ensure that sufficient inspection is conducted in order to determine that the work performed or the materials utilized to construct the project comply with the requirements included in the contract plans and specifications. When inspections or tests are performed that indicate substandard work or materials, the Project Engineer should immediately notify the Contractor, rejecting the unsatisfactory work or material. The following types of activities will be considered unauthorized Work and will be completed solely at the risk and expense of the Contractor:
• Work performed contrary to, or regardless of, the instructions of the Project Engineer.
• Work and materials that do not conform to the Contract requirements.
• Work done beyond the lines and grades set by the Plans or the Engineer.
• Any deviation made from the Plans and Specifications without written authority of the Project Engineer.

WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
The Contractor is responsible for notifying the Project Engineer of any defective Work they discover. If the Project Engineer becomes aware of defective or unauthorized Work, they should first notify the Contractor. The Contractor should be notified as quickly as possible so that changes in materials or Work methods can be made to avoid materials or Work being rejected. Until all issues of material acceptance and conformity to the Contract Plans and Specifications can be resolved, unauthorized or defective Work will not be paid for by WSDOT. Once the unauthorized or defective Work has been discovered or the Contractor has been notified, the Contractor must immediately correct the deficiency. Standard Specification 1-05.7(1) provides the Contractor an option to submit an RFI to propose a repair procedure or method for correcting a deficiency. An RFI should be submitted when the repair would constitute a change to the Contract, or when the Contract does not include a specified remedy for the defect. The Project Engineer should ensure the Contractor has provided all the information needed to respond to the request and will discuss the request with the Contractor prior to providing a final response. Any engineering necessary to evaluate the acceptability and adequacy of the repair should be done by the Contractor and submitted to the Project Engineer with their RFI. All RFIs for repairs or corrections are considered Contractor-proposed changes and WSDOT is under no obligation to accept or approve them. Alternately, the Project Engineer may direct that all unauthorized or defective Work be immediately remedied, removed, replaced, or disposed of. If the defective Work is replaced with Work meeting the Contract requirements, approval from the Project Engineer is not needed, nor is an RFI. In correcting unauthorized or defective Work, the Contractor will be responsible to bear all costs to comply with the Engineer’s order. For additional guidance, see Standard Specifications Section 1-05.7. If the Contractor fails or refuses to carry out the orders of the Engineer or to perform Work in accordance with the Contract requirements, the Project Engineer should immediately notify the Regional Construction Manager of the facts in the matter, seek assistance and advice. Defective Materials The contract plans and specifications for construction of a project require that specific materials and/or work practices be utilized in completing the work. The Project Engineer may reject any materials not conforming to the requirements of the specifications. The rejected materials, whether in place or not, are to be immediately removed from the site of the work unless the following guidelines for acceptance of non-specification materials are followed: Material Not in Place There may be situations where WSDOT determines the use of nonconforming materials is acceptable. This requires prior approval of the State Construction Engineer and a change order modifying the project specifications. The Contractor is required to submit an RFI as provided for in Standard Specification 1-05.1(1) for any material substitution. The Project Engineer will discuss the request WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-61
Chapter 1
Administration
with the Contractor prior to providing a final response to the RFI. If this is not done prior to incorporating into the project, the material should be treated as defective or unauthorized Work. Material in Place 1. Price adjustments have been developed and are referenced in the contract for acceptance of certain materials whose properties cannot be determined until they are in place. Items this policy applies to include: concrete compressive strength, Portland cement concrete pavement thickness, hot mix asphalt mixture and density, and pavement smoothness. 2. Material incorporated into the Work that is subsequently found to be in nonconformance with the Specifications and for which price adjustments for acceptance are not included in the Contract, may be reviewed to determine acceptability. The determination of acceptability should be made only when, in the Project Engineer’s judgment, there is a possible service or benefit to be obtained from its use. If it is determined that no benefit or service is obtained from the material’s use, the Project Engineer should direct that the material be immediately removed and replaced at no cost to WSDOT. The Project Engineer may consult the State Construction Office, State Materials Laboratory, the State Bridge and Structures Office, or other design organizations for assistance in determining the usefulness of the nonconforming material. If consulted, these offices will offer technical advice to the extent that information is available. It is not intended to enter into extensive research to assess material which could be removed and replaced under the contract terms. If the material is acceptable for continued use, a determination shall be made by the Project Engineer of the possible reduced service life caused by the material substitution and the resulting credit assessed by change order. This determination of acceptability and the resulting credit must meet with the Region Construction Manager’s approval for execution of the change order. In addition, prior review and approval must be obtained from the State Construction Engineer with a recommendation from the State Materials Engineer for the intended application of the material. With this determination for acceptance of non-specification material, discussions should be initiated with the Contractor and a change order completed. If it is determined that the Specification violation will not compromise the performance of the material and the nature of the violation is more of a technical infraction of the Specification, the material may be accepted with a change order, possibly including a price reduction. If there is sufficient data and if the nature of the material makes analysis feasible, a pay factor may be determined using QC/QA methods similar to those described in Standard Specifications Section 1-06.2(2). If QC/QA cannot be applied, the Project Engineer may determine an adjustment subjectively, using whatever information is available. This assessment or price adjustment is typically based on the unit bid price and may vary from no price adjustment up to the total contract unit bid price for the item involved. If it is determined that the violation is serious enough that the material cannot be accepted for use on the project, the Project Engineer may direct its complete removal and replacement at no cost to WSDOT.

SS 1-05.9
Equipment The Contractor is required to furnish adequate equipment for the intended use. The Contractor’s equipment must also be maintained in good working condition. Prior to the start of work, the Project Engineer should ensure, by inspection, that the Contractor’s plant, equipment, and tools comply with the specifications. Whenever the specifications contain specific equipment requirements, the Project Engineer should verify that the equipment provided meets these specifications. This should be documented in project records such as the Inspector’s Daily Report. The Contractor is required to furnish, upon request, any manuals, data, or specialized tools necessary to check the equipment. It is most important that the operation of automatically controlled equipment be checked carefully and that the Contractor be advised immediately whenever the equipment is not performing properly. The Contractor’s supervisory personnel must be experienced, and able to properly execute the work at hand. If, in the Project Engineer’s opinion, the Contractor’s supervisory personnel are not fully competent, the Project Engineer should immediately notify the Regional Construction Manager of the facts in the matter, seeking assistance and advice. It is expected that, consistent with WSDOT’s policies and delegated authority, the Project Engineer will assist the Contractor in every way possible to accomplish the work under the contract. However, the Project Engineer must not undertake, in any way, to direct the method or manner of performing the work. Contrary to popular legend, this statement is true of force account work as well. Should the Contractor select a method of operation that results in substandard quality of work, non-specification results, a rate of progress insufficient to meet the contract schedule, or that otherwise violates the contract specifications or provisions, the Contractor should be ordered to discontinue that method or make changes to comply with the contract requirements. Where cooperation cannot be achieved, the Project Engineer should notify the Regional Construction Manager of the facts in the matter, seeking assistance and advice.
SS 1-05.10
Guarantees Standard Specifications Section 1-05.10 and 1-06.5 specifies the Contractor shall provide to the Project Engineer all guarantees, warranties, or manuals furnished as a customary trade practice, for material or equipment incorporated into the project. The Project Engineer should transmit the originals of any such guarantees/warranties or manuals to the organization that will be maintaining the items covered by the guarantee/warranty or manuals. The Project Office should maintain a copy of the guarantee/warranty, and a letter of transmittal for manuals, with the materials documentation file for the project.

Cooperation with Other Contractors When two or more Contractors, including any utility or their contractor, are working in the same area, Standard Specifications Section 1-05.14 will apply. The Contractor shall not cause any unnecessary delay or hindrance to the other contractors on the work, but shall cooperate with other contractors to the fullest extent. Progress schedules and plans for all contractors involved should be reviewed by the Project Engineer to detect possible conflicts which might be resolved before a delay of work is experienced or extra costs are incurred as a result. If an adjacent project requiring coordination is known prior to holding a pre-construction meeting, it would be beneficial to invite principals from that project to the meeting.

Control of Material
SS 1-06.3
Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance All material is to be accepted for use on the project based on satisfactory test results that demonstrate compliance with the contract plans and specifications. All work demonstrating compliance is to be completed prior to the material’s incorporation into the work. In many cases, this testing has already been completed in advance by the manufacturer. A Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance provides a means to utilize this testing in lieu of job testing performed prior to each use of the product. This provides for a timely use of the material upon arrival to the job site without a delay in waiting for the return of test results. The Project Office is required to complete and file a Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance Check List (DOT Form 350-572). This must be done in a timely manner and is necessary to ensure that the material meets all the requirements of the contract. Standard Specifications Section 1-06.3 describes the procedures for acceptance of materials based upon the Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance. Standard Specifications Division 9 describes those materials that may be accepted on the basis of these certificates. Since a certificate is a substitute for prior testing, it is intended that all certificates be furnished to the Project Engineer prior to use or installation of the material. However, there are some circumstances where the Contractor may request, in writing, the Project Engineer’s approval to install materials prior to receipt and submittal of the required certificate. The Project Engineer’s approval of this request must be conditioned upon withholding payment for the entire item of work until an acceptable Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance is received. Examples of materials that shall not be approved by the Project Engineer for installation prior to the Contractor’s submittal of an acceptable certificate are: materials encased in concrete (i.e., rebar, bridge drains); materials under succeeding items where the later work cannot be reasonably removed (i.e., culvert under a ramp to be opened to traffic); etc. The Project Engineer’s approval or denial shall be in writing to the Contractor, stating the circumstances that determined the decision. If the requirements of this provision are followed, including the written request by the Contractor and the written approval by the Project Engineer, then the remedy for failure to provide the Certificate is the withholding of 100 percent of the cost of the material and the cost of the work associated with the installation of the material.

Chapter 1
At the conclusion of the contract, there may still be some items that are lacking the required certificates. These items must be assessed as to their usefulness for the installation, prior to payment of the Final Estimate and subsequent Materials Certification of the contract. The review of these items may include:
• Comparison with the suitability of other shipments to the project or other current projects.
• If possible, sampling and testing of the items involved or residual material from the particular lot or shipment.
• Independent inspection on site of the completed installation. If it is determined that the uncertified material is not usable or is inappropriate for the completed work that incorporates the material, the Contractor should be directed to immediately remove the material, replacing it with other certified materials. If the material is found to be usable and is not detrimental to the installation it was incorporated into, it may be left in place but, if the provisions of Standard Specifications Section 1-06.3 were followed, with a reduction to no pay. The reduction in pay will be the entire cost of the work (i.e., unit contract price, portion of lump sum) rather than only the material cost. The Contractor should continue to have the option of removing and replacing the uncertified material in order to regain contract payment for the installation. If the provisions of Standard Specifications Section 1-06.3 were not followed, then there can be no withholding beyond the value of the missing work itself (the preparation and submittal of the Certificate.)
SS 1-06.6
Recycled Materials
SS 1-06.6(1) Recycling of Construction Aggregate and Concrete Materials Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1695 requires the use of recycled concrete aggregate in the amount of 25 percent on all WSDOT projects, and to report annual usage to the legislature. However, this requirement only applies to materials included in the Contract that are listed in Standard Specifications 9-03.21(1)E and that allow the use of recycled concrete aggregate. Recycled concrete is hardened concrete that is crushed and may contain coarse and fine mineral aggregate with Portland cement. The Standard Specifications encourage the use of recycled materials and requires that recycled concrete aggregates be incorporated into the work by the Contractor. Because it is important that the Contractor have a plan for using the required percentage of recycled concrete aggregates, the Standard Specifications require the Contractor to submit a utilization plan. The Contractor’s Recycled Concrete Aggregate Utilization Plan is to be submitted on DOT Form 350-075A – Recycled Concrete Aggregate Reporting - within 30 calendar days of Contract Execution, preferably at the Pre-Construction Conference. The recycled concrete aggregate utilization plan details how the Contractor will meet the 25 percent requirement. Each bid item that includes eligible material will be listed on the utilization plan and will include the percentage of anticipated recycled concrete aggregate that will be used. If the plan shows the Contractor will not meet the minimum 25 percent requirement, a cost estimate meeting the requirements of Standard Specification 1-06.6(1) A must be attached. The details of the plan are not required to be static as the Contractor WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

Administration
should be actively managing their use of recycled concrete aggregate throughout the Contract. Therefore, the Contractor may alter the utilization plan at their discretion without submitting a new one. Should the Contractor alter their plan, the Project Engineer may choose to review it. Within 30 days after Physical Completion, the Contractor is required to re-submit the Recycled Concrete Aggregate Reporting form (DOT Form 350-075A) to include the actual amounts of recycled concrete aggregate and virgin material used on the project. If the final tally of recycled concrete aggregate does not meet the 25 percent requirement, the Contractor is required to attach a cost estimate meeting the requirements of Standard Specification 1-06.6(1)A. The Project Engineer should review the cost estimate for reasonableness; an independent verification of detailed costs is not required as the Contractor certifies the accuracy of the information. The Project Engineer shall submit the Recycled Concrete Aggregate Reporting form to the Region Documentation Engineer for their review and approval prior to a copy of the form being sent to the Documentation Engineer at the State Construction Office. These reports will be used by the State Construction Office in the annual report submitted to the legislature.

Legal Relations and Responsibilities to the Public
SS 1-07.1
Laws to be Observed
Safety Safety is not optional in WSDOT. No employee will be permitted to disregard applicable safety and health standards of the State Department of Labor and Industries or other regulatory agencies. The Secretary of Transportation’s Executive Order E 1033 provides direction to all WSDOT employees to adhere to the following basic safety provisions in every work activity:
• Participate in your work group safety plan (or Safety Management System for WSDOT Ferries Division employees).
• Look for ways to prevent accidents.
• Immediately identify hazards and safety concerns.
• Always use personal protective equipment.
• Promptly report all injuries. The Order also states that all employees at WSDOT Ferries Division are already covered and shall continue to be covered by the existing Ferries Division Safety Management System. Therefore:
• All Ferries Division employees will refresh their knowledge of existing Safety Management System procedures and shall follow them accordingly.
• A concerted effort will be made to address existing and new Safety Management System safety reports in a timely manner.
• All Ferries Division employees shall address issues of concern with existing safety procedures using the existing Safety Management System reporting program. Page 1-66
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
All other WSDOT employees are covered and continue to be covered by the policies and procedures in the Safety Procedures and Guidelines Manual M 75-01, and other related policy documents. Therefore, a pre-activity safety plan is required prior to performing any new field work. Office staff will conduct a hazard assessment and mitigation plan for all office environments. Since WSDOT employees on transportation construction projects are routinely exposed to a variety of hazards, they must take adequate safety precautions at all times. The following items represent common activities that workers or work crews may encounter, and should be addressed in pre-activity safety plans as needed.
• The employee shall ensure that an area is safe before entering it for the purpose of inspection. For example, a deep trench must be adequately shored and braced before entering it.
• Aggregate production and material processing plants should be inspected for safety hazards. Corrective measures should be called to the attention of the Contractor or producer. Corrections must be completed before WSDOT personnel will be permitted to proceed with entry or work upon the premises.
• The employee must, at all times, watch for backing trucks and not depend upon hearing alone for warning. The noise of plants and other equipment often make it impossible to hear trucks approaching and the truck driver’s vision area is restricted when backing a truck.
• Parking WSDOT vehicles too close to the path of construction equipment, behind standing equipment, or in other hazardous locations is not permitted.
• Where traffic is maintained in work zones, care must be taken to avoid approaching traffic when it is necessary for inspectors and others to step onto or cross the traveled portion of the roadway. Whenever possible, work activities, ingress and egress, should be conducted within the relative safety of the work zone.
• WSDOT employees working on foot in the highway right of way and other areas exposed to vehicular traffic must comply with the high visibility clothing requirements of the WSDOT Safety Procedures and Guidelines Manual M 75-01 Section 4.2, Chapter 3.
• Where the engineering crew is working adjacent to traffic, without positive barriers, the work area should be marked with proper signs and traffic control devices as shown on the appropriate Traffic Control Plan (TCP). The crew may be protected by a certified flagger as needed.
• When the engineering crew is working under the protection of the Contractor’s flaggers and signs, other signs may not be needed, but a “STOP”/”SLOW” paddle should be available for use in special situations. Good communication with the Contractor and Flagger is needed to ensure that they are aware of crew activities within the work zone.
• A survey crew is typically exposed to traffic hazards and should conduct survey work under approved TCPs from the Work Zone Traffic Control Guidelines M 5444. The Region Traffic Office will assist survey crews with TCPs for situations not covered in this publication.
• During blasting operations, employees are instructed to seek cover at least 500 ft from the location of the blasting.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-67
Chapter 1
Administration
In addition to the above requirements for workers and work crews, supervisors also have the following responsibilities:
• Each supervisory employee is charged with the responsibility of providing safety leadership and safety enforcement when necessary.
• Supervisors shall give thorough instructions to employees under their jurisdiction on the safe use of tools, materials, and equipment and the safe prosecution of work on construction projects.
• The Division of Occupational Safety and Health requires that every foreman, supervisor, or other person in charge of a crew have a valid first aid card.
• When employees are injured on the job to the extent that the services of a doctor are required, the Regional Safety Officer shall be notified immediately.
• When traffic control measures are necessary, approved Traffic Control Plans (TCPs) should be used in conformance with the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), as adopted by WSDOT. Supervisors should ensure that the appropriate TCP is used and that the necessary signs, devices and equipment are available. Contact Region Traffic Office for assistance. Responsibility for Enforcement of Safety and Health Requirements All contractors doing work for WSDOT must provide safety controls for the protection of life and health of the Contractor’s employees and other persons, for the prevention of property damage, and for the avoidance of interruptions in the performance of the work under the contract. As the owner contracting agency, WSDOT has the responsibility for enforcement of the provisions of the contract, however, provisions and regulations which are by law the fundamental responsibility of other agencies, both from the standpoint of interpretation and enforcement, should be monitored by WSDOT, but with full recognition as to the responsibilities and authorities of those agencies. The Project Engineer will cooperate fully with the responsible agency. Any violations noticed by the Project Engineer will be brought to the attention of the Contractor for correction. The Project Engineer will also notify the responsible agency (if that action is deemed necessary by the Region Construction Manager) and utilize such sanctions as are consistent with contract terms in assisting the responsible agency in enforcing laws, rules, and regulations. The Contractor is obligated by law to comply with both State and Federal safety regulations. State regulations are administered by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries under the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act (WISHA). Federal regulations are administered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) of the U.S. Department of Labor, which has jurisdiction over federal safety requirements for pit and quarry operations up to the point where materials leave the quarry area or go into a batch plant. Inspectors from any or all of these agencies may review the Contractor’s operations at any time. (See Standard Specifications Section 1-07.1.) In order to fulfill WSDOT obligations to monitor contract operations in accordance with the above, the following procedures should be followed on both Federal-aid and non Federal-aid contracts.
Page 1-68
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
Precontract Preparation
• The Project Engineer shall obtain the WISHA manuals, particularly Safety Standards for Construction Work WAC 296-155, General Safety and Health Standards WAC 296-24, and General Occupational Health Standards WAC 296-62, and shall review them with the key field WSDOT inspectors to ensure reasonable familiarity to the extent that they can recognize important requirements.
• The Contract Plans and contract provisions should be reviewed to identify those aspects of the work meriting special attention from the standpoint of potentially dangerous types of work and hazard elimination.
• The project site should be reviewed to identify those aspects of the location that present hazards such as limited sight distance, confined spaces, difficult terrain, extreme temperatures, illegal encampments, or exposure to biological and physical hazards associated with animals or humans. Preconstruction Duties As part of the Preconstruction Meetings and Discussions (see Section SS 1-05.1), the Contractor’s safety program should be discussed. Some of the things that the Project Engineer may want to consider are:
• The contractual obligation of the Contractor for complying with State and Federal construction safety standards (see Standard Specifications Section 1-07.1).
• The availability of the safety standards that apply to the Contract.
• The accident prevention program of the Contractor – organization, staff, names of responsible individuals, meetings, training, reports, etc. A review of specific areas for which plans are required (especially those also affecting WSDOT personnel). These might include Fall Protection, Confined Spaces, Respirators, Hearing, and Hazardous Materials plans. Implementing a mechanism for employees to report “near misses” and/or work zone accidents.
• The Contractor’s responsibility for seeing that subcontractors comply with safety regulations.
• The Contractor’s plans for meeting specific safety requirements and for eliminating potentially critical hazards on the project for all Contractor employees, Contracting Agency employees, and the public.
• The Contractor’s responsibility to meet the requirements of WAC 296-800, which requires employers to provide a safe workplace. Particular mention must be made to WAC 296-800-11025, which prohibits alcohol and narcotics from the workplace. The PE’s Role in Safety on the Project It is difficult to generalize about safety. It’s a judgment call which is dependent on risk, knowledge, authority to direct corrections, etc. As people, professionals and representatives of the State, Project Engineers have an obligation to act if they become aware of a situation that presents an immediate threat. Project Engineers should advise their employees on what the lines of communication are and what the procedures are for alerting the responsible agencies regarding serious safety hazards. Employees should be made aware that the Contractor is obligated to make the worksite safe, to their satisfaction, for inspection activities. Anyone who is uncomfortable with access for inspection should inform their supervisor of the situation and expect WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

Administration
resolution. Project personnel should also be made aware of project specific hazards and be trained in specific areas as the project warrants. For example: fall protection, confined space requirements, respirator training, lead paint hazards, hazardous material training, and exposure to medical waste (sharps). It is suggested that the expertise of the Regional Safety Officers or Headquarters Safety Office be utilized as appropriate. Be aware that the construction contract requires the contractor to perform any measures or actions the Engineer may deem necessary to protect the public, and that the Engineer may suspend work if the Contractor fails to correct unsafe conditions. Project staff should continuously monitor the Contractors’ work activities for potential violations of legal safety requirements, and for any condition that poses an immediate threat to the health of any person. Immediately notify the Contractor upon becoming aware of any such condition. Additional information, such as safety regulations and Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) contacts are available on the internet at www.wa.gov/lni. Keep in mind that many WSDOT employees are not trained to interpret and apply safety regulations; however, employees need to have a reasonable understanding of what hazards may be encountered on a project. Many, but not all, of the requirements are listed under WAC 296-155 Safety standards for construction work under the various “Parts a through V.” State L&I offers consultation service (advise is given) and enforcement (assessment of a violation would result in a citation being issued). A listing of the various L&I field offices is as follows:

Fire Prevention and Merchantable Timber Requirements
SS 1-07.3(1) Fire Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan A Fire Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan (FPCC) Plan is required on every project, regardless of proximity to forestland. The plan is required to be submitted as a Type 2 Working Drawing no later than the date of the preconstruction conference. The Project Engineer will review the FPCC plan for completeness as outlined in Standard Specification 1-07.3(1)A1. The required elements listed in the plan must be periodically verified by Project Inspectors. An updated FPCC plan is due annually on multiple year Contracts, and a revised FPCC plan is required as site conditions change. Most of Washington State is covered under the Industrial Fire Protection Level (IFPL) system which, by law, is managed by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The IFPL system was established to identify fire risk levels and accordingly prohibit certain high risk work activities during periods of dry weather. The risk level for a given area is regularly assessed and can change daily. In certain areas, jurisdiction is transferred to the United States Forest Service (USFS) or to the local fire authority. The Project Engineer is encouraged to establish a working relationship with the local agency responsible for fire protection (DNR, USFS, Tribe, or the local fire district) early in the project. It is important for the Project Office to know and understand the different laws of the jurisdiction governing the work site. The Project Office should also check the IFPL website daily during the closed season (April 15 – October 15) to verify the fire threat level for the project site. It is recommended that fire protection be discussed at the weekly safety meeting, or more frequently if levels warrant further discussion. In the event the IFPL requires either a partial or general shutdown of Work, the Contractor may obtain a waiver to continue certain work activities. The Project Office will verify that the Contractor has received a waiver from DNR before allowing continuation with prohibited Work. If the IFPL requirements prohibit the Contractor from performing Work, the Contractor may be eligible for an unworkable day in accordance with Section 1-08.5. When it is in WSDOT’s interest to pursue a waiver, and after receiving ASCE approval, the Project Engineer will lead the effort to obtain the waiver while working closely with the Contractor and the agency responsible for fire protection. The Project Engineer must discuss pursuing a waiver with the ASCE, as the Department bears additional risk and cost when WSDOT is the initiating party. The potential need for a waiver should be discussed with the regulatory fire agency prior to or early in the fire season. Factors such as work activities, location, and shortened work windows are some examples of risks to consider at the beginning of the project. Requesting the waiver in the middle of the fire season, or at the last minute, is not advisable. If the project is contained within the paved roadway surface or is an emergency operation, the Project Engineer can allow work to continue during restrictions, however, all effort should be made to follow the IFPL restrictions. WAC 332-24-405 requires the Contractor and WSDOT Inspectors to have certain equipment available and in working order. The requirements are:
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-71
Chapter 1
Administration
Contractor 1. Fire extinguisher of at least a 5 B C rating
WSDOT Inspector 1. Fire extinguisher of at least a 5 B C rating
2. Approved exhaust system
2. Approved exhaust system
3. Shovel (mounted on all vehicles/ equipment)
3. Shovel
4. Two serviceable five gallon backpack pumps filled with water 5. Firewatch (with portable power saw operation)
The purpose of the equipment is to extinguish fire when initially started while it can be controlled or extinguished by portable fire extinguishers or small hose systems without the need for protective clothing or breathing apparatus. Project Inspectors are not required to compromise their personal safety in fighting fires. If a waiver is issued to the Contractor to continue work during a shutdown, the Contractor must have all the required tools noted above in addition to the specific mitigation measures in place listed in the approved waiver. SS 1-07.3(1)A2
Forest Fire Prevention
When the project limits are next to or extend into a State or Federal forest, the Contract may contain an appendix with additional USDA Forest Service requirements that need to be included in the FPCC plan and the Contractor must take extra steps for fire prevention. When approving the FPCC Plan in these areas, the Project Engineer may elect to contact the local forest supervisor or regional manager to ensure the Contractor has obtained the information required in Standard Specification 1-07.3(1)A2.
SS 1-07.4
Sanitation
SS 1-07.4(2) Health Hazards Site Cleanup – Some contracts contain specifications for site cleanup. This may include the removal of illegal encampments, unauthorized pedestrians, personal property, refuse, and other biological and physical hazards from the work area. The Contractor is required to perform all necessary work, and to take precautions to maintain the health and safety of all workers and the public, who may be in the work area. It is the responsibility of the Project Engineer to inspect the Contractor’s work and ensure compliance with the contract requirements and with all applicable laws. Each Project Engineer should appoint a contact for encampment removal issues. The Contractor is required to have a Health and Safety Plan, and to submit the plan to the Project Engineer prior to commencing any cleanup work. The Project Engineer should ensure that the plan is prepared in accordance with contract provisions. The Contractor will furnish and install “No Trespassing” signs in all areas where pedestrians may be encountered, except where pedestrians are legally allowed. “No Trespassing” signs must be posted no less than 72 hours prior to beginning site cleanup work or any other potentially hazardous work. If the site contains encampments, the signs should be posted at each encampment. The Project Engineer should conduct a site visit in order to verify that the signs are posted correctly and meet the requirements of the contract. Page 1-72
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
At the time the signs are posted the Contractor should provide written notification to the Project Engineer and local jurisdictions. When the work includes removal of encampments the Contractor should also notify local advocacy groups that site cleanup and removal is scheduled. After the initial removal of encampments, the Contractor should revisit the area at regular intervals, and if encampments persist, permanently post the area with “No Trespassing” signs and proceed with removal activities. Immediately prior to commencing cleanup and removal, brush clearing, or other potentially hazardous work, and periodically throughout the day, the Contractor should visually inspect the area to ensure that no unauthorized pedestrians are present. The Project Engineer should verify that the site is cleared of pedestrians and that periodic area checks are being done. Special attention should be given to areas hidden from view, such as in dumpsters or equipment, or under blankets. The Project Engineer may consider the use of non-invasive detection aids, such as infrared detectors, to ensure that no unauthorized persons are present. Removal, Storage, and Return of Personal Property – The Contractor will remove personal property that is not refuse. Items will be placed in large transparent plastic bags, labeled, and stored for return to the property owner. The Project Engineer should ensure that personal property is handled and stored in accordance with the requirements of the contract and all applicable laws. Further WSDOT policy information and guidance is available on the State Construction Office Webpage at: www.wsdot.wa.gov/Business/Construction/TechnicalGuidance.htm
SS 1-07.5
Environmental Regulations The following procedure pertains to WSDOT personnel on all WSDOT contracts and contains duties and activities by persons other than the project staff, but all of which are related to construction contracts and affect the Project Engineer to one degree or another. The Project Engineer must stay aware of this procedure and follow it as written.
Environmental Compliance Assurance Procedure The purpose of the Environmental Compliance Assurance Procedure (ECAP) is to recognize and rectify environmental non-compliance events during the construction phase on WSDOT highway and modal construction sites, and to ensure prompt notification to WSDOT management and regulatory agencies. For purposes of this procedure, non-compliance events are defined as actions that violate environmental permits, agreements, laws, or regulations. When non-compliance is suspected or known, the Project Engineer (PE) shall initiate the Notification and Resolution process. The Regional/Modal Environmental Manager will serve as a resource to the PE and give priority to addressing the non-compliance event. The Project Engineer and Environmental Manager will work together on an appropriate response to avoid or minimize environmental damage.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-73
Chapter 1
Administration
Notification and Resolution Process When a non-compliance event is suspected or known, the following steps must be taken: 1. The person who discovers an event must immediately notify the PE. 2. The PE must: Step A – Immediately notify the Contractor of the situation and suspend all work that is causing non-compliance. Step B – Immediately contact the Environmental Manager or designee to confirm whether or not it is a non-compliance event. If the event is compliant, stop the notification process and resume work activity. If not compliant, collaborate with the Environmental Manager to determine the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction. Notify all regulatory agencies with jurisdiction. Step C – Consult with the Environmental Manager regarding response actions taken and any additional remediation actions that may be necessary. Step D.1 – Highway Projects: Notify the appropriate Assistant Region Administrator or Mega Projects Engineering Manager for Construction and the assigned Headquarters liaison (i.e. Assistant State Construction Engineer). If resolving the non-compliance event requires any design decision, notify the appropriate Assistant State Design Engineer. Step D.2 – WSF Projects: Notify the Terminal Engineering Construction Engineering Manager and the Terminal Engineering Design Engineering Manager. Step E – Additional notifications from the PE are necessary when the noncompliance event:
• results in a formal written/verbal enforcement action from a regulatory agency;
• presents risk to public health or the environment; or
• creates a public controversy. Step E.1 – Region Highway Projects: Notify the Region Administrator and the State Construction Engineer. Step E.2 – Mega Projects Highway Projects: Notify the Mega Project’s Program Administrator. Step E.3 – WSF Projects: Notify the Terminal Engineering Director. 3. The Region Administrator, State Construction Engineer, Mega Projects Program Administrator, and/or Terminal Engineering Director must notify the appropriate agency executives as warranted by the situation. 4. The Environmental Manager must: Step A – Notify the Director of Environmental Services Office (ESO) when the noncompliance event:
• results in a formal written/verbal enforcement action from a regulatory agency;
• presents risk to public health or the environment; or
• creates a public controversy.

Chapter 1
Step B – Assist the PE in recognizing the underlying cause that resulted in the noncompliance event, and determine how to prevent a reoccurrence of the event. Step C – In consultation with the PE, identify and obtain new or modified permits, approvals, or agreements as needed to rectify the non-compliance event. 5. The Director of ESO must notify the ESO Compliance Solutions Branch Manager. Documentation 1. The PE and the Environmental Manager shall coordinate and prepare the appropriate responses to all regulatory agencies with jurisdiction. The responses shall include documentation about the non-compliance event and how it was recognized and rectified. 2. The Environmental Manager, with assistance from the PE, shall record the details of the non-compliance event in the WSDOT Commitment Tracking System (per RCW 47.85.040), including but not limited to:
• Project Name and location, plus the name of PE and Contractor.
• Date of event.
• Location(s) on the project where the non-compliance event occurred.
• The type of work and the underlying cause that resulted in the non-compliance event.
• The environmental, permit, agreement, law, or regulation violated.
• Description of how the non-compliance event was recognized, rectified, and the lessons learned.
• Which regulatory agencies and staff were notified, including dates of notification and any tracking numbers provided.
• Whether or not regulatory agency staff conducted a site review in response to the notification. 3. The ESO shall produce a yearly report of all written notifications or violations to the Washington State Legislature (per RCW 47.85.040). SS 1-07.5(3) Working in Water When working in water, the Project Engineer shall ensure the Contractor complies with the environmental and navigation provisions of the contract. If the contract requires the Contractor to obtain special permits, the permits shall be obtained before the work covered by them is begun. Project work occurring in water must meet state water quality standards. Monitoring is required to verify the work achieves compliance with state water quality standards. WSDOT is required by law to report noncompliance with water quality standards to the Department of Ecology. Please follow the Environmental Compliance Assurance Procedures if standards are not achieved (see Section SS 1-07.5). (I)
Monitoring Water Quality WSDOT is responsible for monitoring water quality during the Contractor’s work in the water. Information is available that helps the Project Engineer successfully apply WSDOT’s Monitoring Guidance for In-Water Work and collect a representative sample.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-75
Chapter 1
Administration
The Project Engineer may need to prepare a Water Quality Monitoring and Protection Plan (WQMPP) if required as a condition of a permit. Check the permits early and prepare the plan in advance to prevent delays in the Contractor conducting the work. A procedure exists (PRO610-e) that helps the Project Engineer develop the WQMPP. Note that water quality monitoring of work occurring in water is different than monitoring construction stormwater discharging from a construction site. Refer to Section 8-1.3 for information about monitoring stormwater discharges from construction sites. (II)
Work Area Isolation/Stream Diversions
WSDOT has a General Special Provision for this type of work and will be part of your contract. The contractor will be required to submit a Temporary Stream Diversion (TSD) Plan for WSDOT to review and provide comments. Make sure to include your Region Environmental Permit Coordinator and Biology staff in reviewing the submittal. A TSD reviewer’s checklist is available on the WSDOT SharePoint site. Do not allow any TSD Work until all comments on the Contractor’s plan are addressed. (III) Fish Moving Protocols and Standards The Project Engineer should check project permits to determine whether WSDOT is required to isolate and remove fish from the work area in advance of the Contractor’s work. The Project Engineer must coordinate these activities with the WSDOT biologist. Refer to the WSDOT Fish Exclusion Protocols and Standards to learn about the roles and responsibilities for these activities. (IV)
Reporting Monitoring Data
The Project Engineer is responsible for ensuring any monitoring data is submitted to the Washington State Department of Ecology’s Federal Permit Coordinator. The Project Engineer should coordinate with Region Environmental Staff to ensure that reporting is done correctly. (V)
Reporting Spills to Water
Work that results in a spill to water generates multiple reporting obligations. At a minimum, the Project Engineer must follow the Environmental Compliance Assurance Procedure (see Section SS 1-07.5) of this manual) to start WSDOT’s internal spill response. Also, the Project Engineer must ensure the Contractor enacts the spill response Section of their Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures Plan. Infiltration of Slurry In accordance with 8-01.3(1)C, some classifications of shaft drilling slurry wastewater may be disposed of on-site by using upland infiltration. If the Contractor plans to infiltrate these types of slurry wastewater on-site, they must submit a Shaft Drilling Slurry Wastewater Management and Infiltration plan in accordance with Section 8-01.3(1) C. Project specific site conditions, such as a high water table or contaminated soil, may exclude the use of on-site infiltration as a slurry disposal option. The Project Engineer shall review and accept the plan prior to any on-site slurry wastewater infiltration.
Page 1-76
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
Guidelines for reviewing and accepting Contractor plans are as follows: 1. The classification of slurry wastewater to be infiltrated and the Contractor’s Shaft Drilling Slurry Wastewater and Infiltration plan both meet the specified requirements in Section 8-01.3(1)C. 2. The proposed best management practices (BMPs), controls, or other methods included in the plan are adequate to prevent surface wastewater runoff from leaving the infiltration location. What is “adequate” is site specific and dependent on how much water is being infiltrated and where, some examples may include:
• The basis for the selection of an infiltration location (e.g., subsurface conditions, soil type, estimated infiltration rate, location of surface water)
• Barrier BMPs (e.g., sandbags, berms, water bladders, silt fence) used to prevent surface wastewater runoff from leaving the infiltration area.
• Interceptor BMPs (e.g., trenches, traps, pipe drain to containment area) used to capture wastewater surface runoff before it leaves the infiltration area.
• A metering device that can be adjusted to discharge water to the ground at a rate that will prevent surface runoff from developing.
• Digging a temporary infiltration containment area to hold a specific volume of wastewater. Keep in mind that digging will diminish the layer of unsaturated soil (prior to infiltration occurring, there must be a minimum of 5 feet of unsaturated soil between the soil surface where the infiltration will occur and the saturated soil). In addition, using heavy equipment to dig the infiltration containment area may cause soil compaction at the location, thereby lowering the effective infiltration rate. 3. The Contractor’s plan includes an adequate level of detail to demonstrate that the planned controls and methods will prevent potential impacts to receiving waters of the State, including groundwater, for example:
• Containment strategy for wastewater prior to infiltration.
• Strategy for managing wastewater pH neutralization prior to infiltration.
• Monitoring strategy to ensure infiltration activity is in compliance. 4. The Contractor’s plan identifies a contingency plan that will be implemented immediately if it becomes evident that the controls and methods in place are not adequate to meet the requirements in Section 8-01.3(1)C. Contingency plans must be capable of being implemented immediately, such as:
• Identifying procedures for rectifying plan deficiencies.
• Having additional BMP materials on hand.
• Eliminating the discharge to the ground (stopping infiltration activity). Responsibility for Environmental Considerations During the precontract period, the Project Engineer should obtain copies of the final environmental documents and permits related to the project. The Project Engineer should review all contract commitments in the WSDOT Commitment Files and participate in any Environmental Commitment Meetings. It is important that all key personnel become familiar with the environmental decisions considered during the design process. The contract documents should include any necessary provisions for protection of the WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

environment and cultural resources, including requirements that the Contractor secure all permits as required by the contract and abide by regulations of appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies. Any changes in contract work that may become necessary must also be reviewed to ensure conformance with the requirements, and commitments established during the environmental design of the project.

• Prior removal of any nest
SS 1-07.9
Wages
SS 1-07.9(1) General The payment of predetermined minimum wages on Federal-aid Contracts is derived from the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 and is prescribed by 23 USC 113. The payment of predetermined minimum wages on State funded Contracts is partly modeled after the federal Davis-Bacon Act. Both Acts are intended to protect the employees of Contractors who are performing public works construction from substandard earnings and to preserve local wage standards. The guidance provided herein is intended to help those Project Offices administering construction Contracts understand the laws, regulations and contractual obligations regarding prevailed wages. It is not meant to be a substitute for reading and understanding Federal and State laws and it is not intended to be legal advice. If a labor issue arises and cannot be resolved at the Project Office level, it must be elevated to the Region Construction Office and if necessary, the State Construction Office. Complaints Any complaints regarding violations of minimum wage rate regulations that are referred to the Project Engineer by employees of the Contractor, Subcontractor, or lower-tier subcontractors should be treated as confidential. All issues of noncompliance involving either the Contractor, Subcontractor, or any lowertier subcontractors must be addressed through the Prime Contractor for resolution and elevated to the regulatory agency if necessary. If no violation is found, the employee making the complaint will be notified by WSDOT staff, however the Contractor does not need to be informed.

Chapter 1
Federally Funded Contracts All complaints brought to any WSDOT staff by a worker employed on the project must be promptly investigated by the Project Engineer using DOT Form 424-003. Follow the guidance provided in the Section titled Employee Interviews. If the Project Engineer finds an apparent violation of prevailing wages, the Contractor must be informed and prompt corrective action must be made. State Funded Contracts All complaints brought to any WSDOT staff by a worker employed on the project must be promptly investigated by the Project Engineer using certified payrolls that have been submitted through PWIA. If the Project Engineer finds an apparent violation of prevailing wages, the Contractor must be informed and prompt corrective action must be made. WSDOT staff should also refer the individual to LNI’s website under Workers Rights. Federal Prevailing Wage Enforcement of Federal Prevailing Wage Provisions In addition to the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 1-07.9, all Contracts financed with Federal funding includes the Required Contract Provisions for Federalaid Construction Contracts (FHWA-1273). These provisions identify Federal wage requirements. The Federal prevailing wage requirements included in these provisions are also commonly referred to as Davis Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA). It is the Project Engineer’s responsibility to monitor and enforce these provisions to the degree necessary to ensure full compliance. In order to comply with these requirements, the Contractor must:
• Submit weekly certified payrolls to the Project Engineer through LNI’s Prevailing Wage Intents and Affidavits (PWIA) system.
• Ensure each Subcontractor, and each agent or lower-tier subcontractor submits weekly certified payrolls to the Project Engineer through PWIA.
• Post wage rate posters.
• Post the Federal Wage Determination included in the Contract Provisions.
• Allow interviews of employees during working hours by authorized representatives of WSDOT, the Federal Highway Administration, and the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL). The Contractor is ultimately responsible for all Subcontractor, agent, or lower-tier subcontractor compliance with the requirements for Federal prevailing wages. When the Contract is subject to both State and Federal hourly minimum rates, the Contractor is required to pay the higher of the two rates unless specifically preempted by Federal law. The wage must be verified using the specific wages included in the Contract Provisions.

Federal Prevailing Wage Violations In the event the Project Engineer identifies an error during an inspection of Federal certified payroll regarding:
• improper application or nonpayment of Federal prevailing wages
• improper application of overtime pay
• other requirements noted in the FHWA-1273s The Project Engineer will immediately notify the Contractor requesting an explanation or prompt corrective action within a mutually agreed timeframe. If the Project Engineer finds the Contractor has failed to make the corrections or provide an explanation within the time period determined, the matter must be elevated to the Region Construction Manager. Employee Interviews The Project Engineer must conduct periodic employee interviews using Employee Interview Report Form DOT 424-003. The purpose of these interviews is to establish, with reasonable certainty, that the provisions for Federal prevailing minimum wages are being complied with and that there is no misclassification of workers or disproportionate employment of laborers, helpers, or apprentices. The occupation description must be shown on the form used for the employee interview noted under current duties. The occupation description is noted in the wage listing included in the Contract Provisions. Some employees may refuse to reveal their rate of pay. This is acceptable and should be noted in the remarks column. Many employees do not know or may guess the rate. If possible, a determination of the accuracy of the stated rate should be made, and any uncertainty noted in the remarks column to reduce the need for follow up interviews. If either the stated rate (from the employee) or the record rate (from the certified payroll) is below the minimum rate (from the Contract wage listing), an investigation by the Project Engineer must be conducted. The investigation may be as simple as a follow up interview with the employee, or a more in depth investigation may result in a requirement for a supplemental payroll. In any event, the matter must be resolved so that the employee interview report describes what corrective action was taken to ensure that the employee has been paid the minimum prevailing wage rate. This corrective action is to be reported under remarks on the form or by an attached memo if more space is needed. All discrepancies found must be resolved. The frequency and extent of these interviews will be sufficient to ensure a representative sampling has been made for all classes of workers employed on the Contract. A minimum sampling includes employees of the Contractor and a random sampling of 10% of all subcontractors. The interviews should be made with such frequency as may be necessary to ensure compliance. Department of Labor Investigation USDOL may investigate compliance with the DBRA and the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standard Act (CWHSSA) when conducting any investigations relative to compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act or any other acts under its enforcement authority. Investigative action taken by the USDOL with respect to DBRA and CWHSSA do not, Page 1-80

Chapter 1
in any way, change the degree of authority or responsibility of WSDOT for enforcement of these Acts. Any actions taken by USDOL should be considered a service we may use to assist in our enforcement activities but does not relieve WSDOT of our basic responsibility to fully investigate all potential violations and to apply such sanctions that are deemed applicable under our enforcement authority to ensure compliance. Request for Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate USDOL issues Wage Determinations under the Davis-Bacon Act (DBA) using available statistical data on prevailing wages and benefits paid in a specific locality. On occasion, the data does not contain sufficient information to issue rates for a particular classification of worker needed in the performance of the Contract. Because of this, DBA provisions contain a conformance procedure for the purpose of establishing an enforceable wage and benefit rate for the missing classification (Standard Specifications Section 1-07.9(1) and FHWA-1273). Contractors are responsible for determining the appropriate staffing necessary to perform the Contract work. Contractors are also responsible for complying with the minimum wage and benefits requirements for each classification performing work on the Contract. If a classification considered necessary by the Contractor for performance of the work is not listed on the applicable Wage Determination, the Contractor must initiate a request for approval of an additional classification along with the proposed wage and benefit rates for that classification. The Contractor initiates the request by preparing form SF1444, Request for Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, at the time of employment of the unlisted classification. (Reference FAR 22.406-3 and 52.222-6(b), and Title 29 CFR Part 5, Section 5.5(a)). The Contractor completes blocks 2 through 15 on the form. Standard Form 1444 is readily available via the internet and is accessible by going to www.gsa.gov/portal/ forms/type/sf, and searching by the form number. The Contractor submits the request to the State Construction Office via the Project Office. The Project Office will need to review the request and if applicable, provide backup data showing that the requested classification(s) have been prevailed in other counties within the state. The Project Office will also need to describe the work being performed and verify that the duties performed, as described in the request, are not covered by any other classification(s). This documentation, along with the request, will be forwarded from the Project Office, through the Region Documentation Office, to the State Construction Office. The State Construction Office reviews the request for completeness and signs the form designating the Contracting Agency’s concurrence or disagreement with the Contractor’s proposal. If the Project Engineer or the State Construction Office indicates disagreement with the Contractor’s proposal, a statement must be attached supporting a recommendation for different rates. The State Construction Office then submits the proposal with all attachments to USDOL for approval. The Contractor is obligated to pay the proposed wage and benefit rates during the request for determination and pending a formal response from USDOL. When a determination has been received from USDOL, the Contractor is obligated to pay that determined wage and benefits. If the Contractor has underpaid the employee(s), they are required to make back payment and re-submit corrected certified payrolls. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

State Prevailing Wage Enforcement of State Prevailing Wage Provisions Except as noted for missing Statements of Intent, routine monthly progress payments made to the Contractor for work completed should not be deferred for enforcement of State prevailing wage laws. State Prevailing Wage Violations The State Construction Office will refer matters to LNI for further investigation that may be appropriate. If LNI chooses to investigate, they will establish the amount of unpaid wages due to employees. In order to recover these wages for employees, LNI may choose to file a claim against the Contractor’s retainage held under the Contractor by requesting that the Project Engineer withhold funds from monthly progress estimates for work completed by the Contractor. Refer to SS 1-09.9, Withholding of Payments, for more information. Owner-Operators of Trucks and Other Hauling Equipment The FHWA neither defines the term “owner-operator” nor uses it in regulation. The FHWA regulates “employers” and “drivers.” An owner-operator may act as both an employer and a driver at certain times or as a driver for another employer at other times depending on contractual arrangements and operational structure (Federal Register/Vol. 62, No. 65/Friday, April 4, 1997/Rules and Regulations). Bona fide owner-operators of trucks and similar construction hauling equipment, who are independent Contractors, are not subject to enforcement of Contract labor standard provisions of the Davis Bacon Act and/or RCW 39.12. Owner-operators of other nonhauling type equipment (dozers, scrapers, backhoes, etc.) are considered a Subcontractor, a lower tier subcontractor or an employee of the Contractor or of a Subcontractor. If they are an employee of the Contractor or a Subcontractor, they must appear on that Contractor’s payroll as an employee, not as an owner operator. A ruling by USDOL states in effect that: Because owner-operators usually work under payment arrangements based on a unit price (e.g., so much per cubic yard hauled) rather than on an actual truck or equipment rental rate plus the driver’s (or operator’s) rate, and, because of difficulties that have arisen with respect to securing adequate data on rental arrangements in order to determine whether Contract minimum rates are being paid, therefore, as a matter of administrative policy, the provisions of Davis-Bacon and related acts will not be applied to bona fide owner-operators of trucks or other similar construction equipment used exclusively for hauling and who are independent Contractors. Certified payrolls for owner-operators shall be in accordance with the FHWA-1273. The certified payroll only needs to show the owner-operator’s name, the week ending date, and if any work was performed. This does not apply to owner-operators of other equipment such as bulldozers, backhoes, cranes, welding machines, etc. These other owner-operators are considered to be operators and subject to labor standard provisions.
Page 1-82

Administration
Chapter 1
If the owner-operator employs additional drivers, all such employees shall be listed on the payroll with a complete breakdown of hours worked, hourly rate paid, and all other required information according to the FHWA-1273. Though owner-operators who drive their own trucks may not be subject to prevailed wages as defined in the Davis Bacon Act and RCW 39.12, they are required under State statute to submit Statement of Intent to Pay Prevailed Wages and Affidavit of Wages Paid. The Statement of Intent will identify if the company filed as an owner-operator. There is no exception to this requirement. SS 1-07.9(2) Posting Notices Jobsite posters are required on all Contracts administered by WSDOT. Funding on each of these jobs will determine which posters are required. Each poster must be visible and readily accessible to employees. See Standard Specification 1-07.9(2) Posting Notices for each poster that is required. In addition to the required job site posters, the following publications will be made available and readily accessible to employees:
• A copy of the approved Statement of Intent to Pay Prevailing Wages for the Contractor and each Subcontractor and lower-tier subcontractor is required in accordance with RCW 39.12.020
• A copy of the Contractor’s company EEO policy. In addition, Federally funded Contracts requires a copy of each Subcontractor’s and lower-tier subcontractor’s EEO policy.
• A copy of prevailing wage rates from the Contract Provisions
• Emergency phone numbers for Safety and EEO officers for the Contractor and each Subcontractor and lower-tier contractor. Fraud Notice Poster Fraud Notice, FHWA-1022, Title 18 USC 1020, must be displayed on all Federally funded projects during the course of the work. This notice points out the consequences of any impropriety on the part of any Contractor or WSDOT employee working on the project. Federal Prevailing Wage Rates The Contractor must post the Federal Wage Determination, consisting of the wage listing included in the Contract Provisions, in a prominent place where it can easily be seen by workers. Standard posters (form WH 1321) are also to be posted and are available to the Region from the Support Services Supervisor, FHWA, Olympia, Washington. SS 1-07.9(3) Apprentice Utilization Apprentice Participation Special Provision – General Apprentice utilization of 15% of all labor hours is a requirement on every Contract estimated to cost $2 million dollars or greater, regardless of the funding source or delivery method. The Apprentice Utilization Requirement is a separate obligation than the Federal Training Program and promotes the use of any apprentice enrolled in an apprenticeship program approved by the Washington State Apprenticeship Council. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-83
Chapter 1
Administration
It is important to note that while the State Apprentice Utilization Requirement and the Federal Training Program are two separate programs, both could be a requirement on a Contract with Federal funding. A female or minority apprentice enrolled in a program approved by the Washington State Apprenticeship Council may meet both requirements and could be counted toward both goals with appropriate approvals. Only apprentices enrolled in an apprenticeship program approved by the Washington State Apprenticeship Council may be counted toward attainment of the Apprentice Utilization Requirement. The Apprenticeship Registration and Tracking System (ARTS) can be used to verify apprentice enrollment. The Contractor may attain the Apprentice Utilization Requirement as part of their work activities or through the work activities of Subcontractors or lower tier subcontractors. Utilization will be calculated using the Department of Labor and Industries (LNI) Prevailing Wage Intents and Affidavits System (PWIA) automatically, using certified payrolls and Affidavits of Wages Paid submitted by the Contractor, Subcontractors and lower tier subcontractors. Utilization is calculated in PWIA by dividing the total labor hours worked by apprentices into the total labor hours worked by apprentices and journey level workers on each project. Hours include those working offsite at fabrication sites, plant operations, and truck drivers. Per RCW 39.04.310 the total labor hours performed on the project do not include hours worked by foreman, superintendents, owners, and workers if they are not subject to prevailing wage requirements. WAC 296-127-015 defines a supervisor, while WAC 296-127-026 defines owners. A supervisor (foreman, general foreman, superintendent, etc.) is subject to prevailing wage requirements when they spend more than 20% of their week performing manual/physical labor on the project. If the supervisor performs physical labor between 20% and 50% of their time during the week, they must be paid prevailing wages for each hour worked performing trades work. These hours must be reported to LNI and be included in the total labor hours considered for apprentice utilization. If more than 50% of the supervisor’s time is spent performing trades work during the week, all the supervisor’s hours for the week must be paid prevailing wages. These hours must be reported to LNI and be included in the total labor hours considered for apprentice utilization. Apprentice Utilization Plan The Contractor is required to submit an Apprentice Utilization Plan on DOT Form 424-004 within 30 days of execution of the Contract. The Apprentice Utilization Plan shall be submitted by uploading the document to the PWIA system. Although the plan is not submitted for approval, the Project Engineer must verify that the plan is reasonable to complete the Contract work. The intent of the plan is to provide the Project Engineer with enough information to track the Contractor’s progress in meeting the Apprentice Utilization Requirements. If the plan indicates that the Contractor will not attain the Apprentice Utilization Requirements, then the Contractor must submit Good Faith Effort (GFE) documentation to the Project Engineer for review and comment with their Apprentice Utilization Plan. The GFE shall be uploaded to the PWIA System at the time of the Apprentice Utilization Plan submittal. Submitting a GFE early does not excuse the Contractor from continuous attempts to solicit apprentices.

Chapter 1
Apprentice Reporting Each Contract with an Apprentice Utilization Requirement will be marked as such in the PWIA system by the State Construction Office upon Contract setup. Apprentice reporting is done automatically through the PWIA system when the Contractor submits their certified payroll. The PWIA system calculates the apprentice utilization based on submitted certified payrolls by each Contractor working on the project and is considered real time data. The Project Engineer must verify utilization through the life of the Contract at least monthly and should bring concerns up early and often if it appears like the goal is no longer attainable. Apprenticeship must be discussed at the preconstruction conference, and the Project Engineer is encouraged to bring up apprenticeship goals as necessary, if it appears as though the goal will not be met. The Project Office should compare the PWIA generated report and the Apprentice Utilization Plan at least quarterly to measure the Contractor’s progress toward attainment of the Apprentice Utilization Requirement. If apprentices are not being reported on the project when the plan shows that they should be working, the Project Engineer should request a revised plan. Compliance A Contractor can meet the Apprentice Utilization Requirements by either of the following: 1. Meeting the Apprentice Utilization Requirements through labor hours performed by apprentices, meeting or exceeding 15% of total project hours or 2. Submitting GFE documentation explaining why the Contractor failed to meet the Apprentice Utilization Requirements, and the Project Engineer approves the GFE. In the event that the Contractor is unable to achieve the Apprentice Utilization Requirement, the Contractor shall submit GFE documentation for review and approval to the PWIA system. The GFE documentation shall be submitted after Substantial Completion but no later than 30 days after Physical Completion. If GFE documentation was previously submitted as part of the Apprentice Utilization Plan, it shall be updated and resubmitted. The Project Engineer must notify the Contractor in writing of the approval or rejection of the GFE. The response letter must be uploaded into the PWIA system. It is at the Project Engineer’s discretion to allow revisions to GFE documentation. If the Contractor fails to submit GFE documentation or if the Project Engineer does not approve the GFE, the Contractor will be subject to disciplinary actions as allowed under WAC 468-16-180. Good Faith Effort Notification of Rejection or Non-Submittal of the GFE The Project Engineer must notify their Assistant State Construction Engineer and the Construction Administration Specialist at the State Construction Office when a GFE is not approved or if it is known that a GFE will not be submitted by Contractor. When a Project Engineer rejects a GFE, the notification needs to include a copy of the Contractor’s GFE and Project Engineer’s reason for not approving it. Notification of either acceptance or rejection must be in letter format and must be uploaded into the PWIA system. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

Disciplinary Measures for Non-Compliance The first and second offense in not meeting Apprenticeship Utilization Requirements requires that a letter be sent to the Contractor informing them that they failed to meet the requirement of the Contract Specifications for apprenticeship. The letter will be sent from the State Construction Office to the Contractor, with a copy of the letter to the Project Engineer and the Contract Ad and Award Office. The letter will contain the following information at a minimum:
• Contractor name
• Contact person
• Contract number
• Contract title
• Percentage of Apprentice labor hours required
• Actual percentage of labor hours performed by apprentices
• Reason for the rejected GFE or statement that GFE documentation was not submitted
• Notification that the Project Engineer will note the missed requirement in the Prime Contractors Performance Report
• If second offense, a letter will provide the date the first letter was sent and inform the Contractor of the second offense in not meeting the Apprenticeship Utilization Requirements on a Contract.
• Notification that other active Contracts with WSDOT at the time of offense will require the Contractor to submit a Plan to the State Construction Office within 30 days of receipt of the letter. Failure to comply will lead to actions taken under WAC 468-16-180(3) & (4). The Plan will include the following at a minimum: – The Contract number and name of each active Contract with Apprentice Utilization Requirements; and identify the percentage of apprentice labor hours required per the Contract and the percentage of apprentice labor hours achieved at time of plan submittal – Provide the dates the Contracts were awarded and provide the substantial, or physical dates if those dates have been received – Provide, in Contractors best judgment at the time of plan submittal if they will meet the percentage of apprentice labor hours required in the Contract – If they do not plan to meet apprenticeship labor hours, what course of action will they pursue (such as GFE submittal) to meet apprenticeship attainment requirements
• Notice that future letters of non-compliance may result in action being taken as allowed under WAC 468-16-180 (3) & (4)
• Inform the Contractor that that this first offense will stay in effect until the Contractor has either: – Met Apprentice Attainment requirements on three consecutive completed Contracts, or – Two calendar years have passed If after the second letter to the Contractor, they fail to meet apprenticeship requirements before they have successfully completed three Contracts meeting the Apprenticeship Utilization Requirement, a third certified letter will be sent to the Contractor.

• Notification that the Project Engineer will note the missed requirement in the Prime Contractors Performance Report
• Notification that this is the third offense letter on not meeting the Apprenticeship Utilization Requirements (provide the dates the first and second offense letter were sent)
• Should the Contractor have other active Contracts with WSDOT at the time of the third offense letter, then the letter will require the Contractor submit a Plan to the State Construction Office, within 30 days of receipt of the letter. Failure to comply will lead to further actions taken under WAC 468-16-180(3)(e). The requirements of the Plan submittal are the same as those listed in the first offense letter.
• Notification that the Contractor is suspended of qualifications for a period of six months as allowed under WAC 468-16-180 (3) (f) & (4) (b) starting on date established by the State Construction Office. After the suspension period, the next offense will be a first offense. Inform that a third offense within two years of previous suspension, prequalification may be revoked as allowed under WAC 468-16-190 Revocation of qualifications.
• Notification that if additional non-compliance occurs during the suspension period, the State Construction Office will determine further warranted action. SS 1-07.9(5) Required Documents The requirements for the Contractor’s compliance with prevailing wages are noted in Standard Specifications Section 1-07.9. Specific wage rate determinations for State prevailing wages are noted in the Contract and are verified through the PWIA system. Effective January 1, 2020, all certified payrolls, Statement of Intents to Pay Prevailing Wages (Intents) and Affidavits of Wages Paid (Affidavits) are required to be submitted to the Project Engineer through LNI’s PWIA system. The State Construction Office will enter each Contract into PWIA after award and before execution. The funding source and apprenticeship requirements will be selected at the time the Contract is established in PWIA. Statement of Intent Every Contractor, Subcontractor, agent, or lower tier subcontractor performing work on a public works contract must submit a Statement of Intent to Pay Prevailing Wages to LNI for approval. Separate Intents are required for each Request to Sublet submitted on the project. Hiring Contractors are required to file an Intent if they hire a lower tier subcontractor subject to prevailing wages. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-87
Chapter 1
Administration
The Project Office will verify Intents are filed and approved by LNI using PWIA. No progress payments can be released to the Contractor for work completed by the Contractor, or for portions of work completed by Subcontractors, agents, lower-tier subcontractors, fabricators or suppliers, whom LNI have determined as being covered by State prevailing wage laws, prior to the Project Engineer’s verification of the approved Intent for the entity performing the work. Fabricators or suppliers of material whom LNI has determined as being covered by State prevailing wage laws will require an Intent. Project Office staff are required to monitor PWIA for Contractors that are not considered Subcontractors, but are subject to State prevailing wage laws. LNI will approve the Intents and further certify that the documents meet the requirements of State laws. Submittal and approval dates of the Intents can be found within PWIA. Affidavit of Wages Paid Prior to Contract Completion, the Contractor, all Subcontractors, agents and lower-tier subcontractors must submit an Affidavit of Wages Paid to the Project Engineer using PWIA. The form may be submitted earlier by a Subcontractor or lower-tier subcontractor if that firm’s work is completed prior to Completion of the Contract. All Affidavits must be approved by LNI prior to Contract Completion. In the event a Subcontractor or lower-tier subcontractor cannot or will not provide a completed Affidavit, the Contractor should consult with LNI to seek assistance in filing an Affidavit “On Behalf Of” these Subcontractors. Failure to provide all required Affidavits for all Contractors who worked on the project will result in the withholding of Contract Completion, the Notice of Completion and the release of retainage or bond. PWIA will display those Contractors who have not submitted their Affidavit. If an Affidavit has not been submitted after Physical Completion, the Project Office should send an email to the Contractor through PWIA requesting the missing Affidavits. Affidavits are required for each fabricator or supplier who was also covered by State prevailing wages, and are required for every firm that submitted an Intent. Certified Payroll Certified payroll must be submitted to the Project Engineer through PWIA for each Contractor, Subcontractor, and each lower tier subcontractor performing work on the project, regardless of funding source or delivery method. Certified payrolls are required from the time each Firm begins performing Contract work until the time the Affidavit is visible in PWIA, or until the Contractor has identified their last certified payroll has been submitted. Once the Affidavit is visible in PWIA, the Affidavit has been approved by LNI. The last working day is included on the Affidavit, and the Project Office should compare this date to the last certified payroll submitted. A tracking sheet is required to document when Project Office staff verify that certified payrolls are received through PWIA. The frequency of verification depends on the funding source of the project. Weekly verification is required for federally funded projects, while monthly verification is required for state funded contracts. The tracking sheet needs to Page 1-88

indicate that all active Contracts have been checked for late or missing certified payrolls. PWIA will be used to track requests made for missing certified payrolls. Project Office staff must ensure payrolls are not printed and stored on computers or as paper copies due to privacy laws. A separate tracking sheet may be used to track which certified payrolls have been verified for each project. State funded projects require a minimum of monthly submittals, however, each week must be reported. State funded Contracts:
• Monthly submittals
• Affirmation Statement is electronically signed by the Contractor
• LNI will verify wage rate based on the prevailed wage at time of bid opening for bid build (at award time for design build), however, will allow the Contractor to enter a rate lower than the minimum
• Required for every week, including weeks that no work was performed Federally funded projects require weekly submittals. Further review of the payroll will be required to ensure the Federal prevailed wage rate is met using the Wage Determination included in the Contract Special Provisions. Federally funded Contracts:
• Weekly submittals
• No leniency on late submittals
• Statement of Compliance meeting CFR requirement is electronically signed by the Contractor
• System will redact employee addresses and display the last four digits of the employees SSN
• Wages must be verified using the Wage Determination included in the Contract Provisions (PWIA will not verify)
• Required for every week, whether work was performed or not
• Enforcement of all Federal requirements will remain WSDOT responsibility Certified Payroll Inspection – Federal Funded Projects The FHWA-1273 requires the Contractor, Subcontractors, agents or lower-tier subcontractors to submit certified payrolls for each week in which any Contract work is performed on the project for projects funded with any amount of federal dollars. These payrolls are to be checked by the Project Engineer to ensure that the required information has been included, is correct, and employees have been paid correctly. The Project Engineer should accomplish this by making a complete check of the first payroll submitted on the project by each Contractor, Subcontractor, and lower-tier subcontractors. Once satisfied the first payrolls are correctly prepared, subsequent payrolls may be accepted by a random spot checking of approximately 10 percent of the payrolls submitted. If errors are found during any spot-checking of the payrolls, a more complete or thorough check should occur until the Project Engineer is satisfied that the Contractor is in compliance. Monitoring can then be returned to approximately 10 percent of certified payrolls submitted. The FHWA-1273 identifies the required items to be included in certified payrolls. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-89
Chapter 1
Administration
The first complete check of payroll submitted should confirm that the following items are present:
• The Contract number, title, and payroll period
• The name of the employer, identifying the Contractor, Subcontractor, or lower-tier subcontractor, must be shown.
• A specific minimum wage rate is to be identified for each worker. The Standard Specifications require the Contractor to use work descriptions for the labor classifications that are included in the Contract Provisions identifying federal wage rates, and are to be used on all payrolls. Standard Specifications Section 1-07.9 permits the Contractor to use an alternative method to identify or correlate the labor descriptions used, if approved by the Project Engineer, in order that they may be compared to the Contract Provisions.
• Each employee’s unique identification number (i.e., last four digits of the employee’s Social Security Number). The payroll shall not include the full Social Security Number or home address of the employee; however, the Contractor or Subcontractor shall maintain this information on file and provide this information upon request by the Agency.
• Payroll deductions must conform to Section IV of the FHWA-1273. If payroll deductions are questionable, contact the State Construction Office for assistance.
• Every laborer or mechanic working on the Contract must be classified for the proper minimum prevailing wage in accordance with the designated Wage Determination. If a classification of worker is used that does not appear in the Contract Special Provisions, Standard Specifications Section 1-07.9 requires the Contractor to contact the USDOL (through the Project Engineer) for a determination of the proper wage rate. The FHWA-1273 provides a method for resolving this.
• Each payroll submitted shall be accompanied by a Statement of Compliance, signed electronically by the Contractor or Subcontractor or their agent who pays or supervises the payment of the persons employed under the Contract, certifying the requirements listed in item (2), under part 3 of the FHWA-1273. It is the Contractors responsibility to ensure all Subcontractors and lower-tier subcontractors complete and submit their certified payrolls to the Project Engineer using PWIA. Any payrolls which do not comply fully with the requirements outlined above must be corrected by a supplemental payroll. This is done by amending the original payroll through PWIA. Federally funded projects require weekly submittal of certified payrolls. If the Contractor is unable to submit their payroll electronically using PWIA, they must submit the certified payrolls directly to the Project Office. When accepting these payrolls, the Project Office should request the Contractor use a unique employee identification number that is not the last four digits of the SSN. In addition, the Contractor must still submit the certified payrolls to PWIA to remain compliant with State law. Non-compliance or non-submittal could result in the Project Engineer withholding an appropriate portion of payment (see Section SS 1-09.9).

Other Requirements
• A Contractor or Subcontractor may enter into an agreement with his or her employees to work 10 hours per day without having to pay overtime. This is provided that no employee works more than 4 calendar days a week. The 4-10 agreement must be uploaded into PWIA and will be verified by LNI When working on Force Account copies of the 4-10 agreements will need to be verified by the Project Office if working 10 hour days to ensure proper payment. This can be done by either sending the agreements directly to the Project Office or uploading them in the FILES tab in PWIA.
• LNI has also defined “Contractor” to include some fabricators or manufacturers who produce nonstandard items specifically for use on the public works project. Additionally, some companies who may contract with the Contractor, Subcontractors, or lower-tier subcontractors for the production and/or delivery of gravel, concrete, asphalt, or similar materials may perform activities that cause employees of these firms to be covered by State prevailing wage laws.
• Specific circumstances that may cause employees of these firms to be covered by State prevailing wage laws are described in LNI publications. These publications are included in the Provisions of each Contract adjacent to the State Prevailing Wage listings. Where these firms are covered by State prevailing wage laws, an approved Intent and Affidavit must be submitted to the Project Engineer into PWIA.
• If a lower tier subcontractor submits an Intent through PWIA, the Hiring Contractor must also submit an Intent. This is monitored through PWIA. If the Hiring Contractor does not submit an Intent, the lower tier subcontractor will appear as an “orphan” Contractor in PWIA. PWIA will verify that certified payrolls meet or exceed the State prevailed wage rate, however, it is the Project Office’s responsibility to verify the Federal prevailed wage rate has been met. The higher of the two rates (State prevailed wage and Federal prevailed wage) takes precedent. References, but not limited to:

SS 1-07.11 Requirements for Nondiscrimination SS 1-07.11(1) General Application DBE, MSVWBE, and Training Every Contract administered is funded either with State, Federal funds, or a combination of both. As a result, individual Contracts may have different guiding requirements depending on what laws were in place at the time the Contract was executed and how the Contract is funded. The Special Provisions, Standard Specifications, and Amendments specify the specific requirements for each Contract. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

Administration
SS 1-07.11(2) Contractual Requirements The type of funding used for each Contract will determine whether mandatory or voluntary goals are included. Contracts funded with only State funds have voluntary MSVWBE goals. Contracts over $100,000 with any amount of Federal funding may include DBE mandatory Contract goals, of not less than two percent as part of a Condition of Award (COA), or a mandatory Federal Small Business Enterprise (FSBE) goal if no COA is established. FSBE goals are not a Condition of Award. All payments made towards MSVWBE and DBE Subcontractors shall be reported by the Contractor using the application available at: https://wsdot.diversitycompliance.com. Payments made to MSVWBE and DBE Subcontractors will only be counted towards Contract goals if the noted Subcontractor is determined to be performing a Commercially Useful Function (CUF) and a type of Work for which they are certified through Washington State Office of Minority and Women’s Business Enterprises (OMWBE). The Department includes MSVWBE, DBE or FSBE goals to promote diversity in support of inclusion in each Contract, therefore, it is important that the Project Office diligently tracks and monitors the accomplishments of all programs. The State MSVWBE and Federal DBE program contribute to the Agency’s inclusion goal as specified in the strategic plan. Contractors are encouraged to achieve voluntary goals and required to meet mandatory Contract goals. The Office of Equal Opportunity (OEO) and the Region OEO Compliance Specialist should be contacted for Program questions and the State Construction Office should be consulted for Contract administration matters. Minority, Small, Veteran and Women Owned Business Enterprise (MSVWBE) - State Funded Only Contracts MBE, SBE, VBE or WBE are the designations for holding State certification as a minority, small, veteran or women owned business enterprise. OMWBE certifies businesses as either a minority owned business (MBE), a women owned business (WBE), or a combination of both minority and women owned business (M/WBE). The Department of Veteran Affairs certifies a business as a veteran owned business (VBE), and small businesses (SBE) are registered in Washington’s Electronic Business Solution (WEBS). Contracts funded only with State funds require the Contractor submit an MSVWBE Participation Plan, except for those Contracts with an estimated value of $250,000 or less. WSDOT provides guidelines for creating a MSVWBE Participation Plan which is available at: MSVWBE Participation Plan Drafting Guidelines When the Project Office receives the Contractor’s MSVWBE Participation Plan, it will be reviewed for completeness. Incomplete plans will be returned for correction and resubmittal. The Project Office will transmit reviewed plans to their Region OEO Compliance Specialist who will review and either accept the plan as submitted, with or without comments, or return the plan if incomplete or inadequate. Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) - Federally Funded Contracts As a condition of receiving Federal funding, WSDOT has given assurance to FHWA that it will comply with Title 49 CFR Part 26. For Contracts under the authority of the Regions and State Construction Office, all contractual matters relating to the DBE program will be elevated through OEO. The OEO DBE Liaison Officer (DBELO) has the authority for the following: Page 1-92
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
• Regular Dealer determination
• Pre Award and Post Execution Contract specific approval
• Review and Approval of Pre Award, End of Contract and Termination/Substitution Good Faith Efforts (GFE)
• Pre Award clearing of DBE commitments
• Approval of changes to COA DBE commitments
• Commercially Useful Function reviews
• Applicable Sanctions
• Joint Check Agreements Any contractual DBE issues, including those listed above must be elevated through the State Construction Office, who will seek the approval of OEO, including concurrence from the DBELO. OMWBE certifies DBEs and maintains the certified DBE directory. Each DBE is certified in a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code that most closely represents the type of work that the DBE is said to perform. It should be noted that the NAICS code doesn’t always represent the specific types of work in which the DBE owner has the ability to control, thus, the need for a more specific breakdown, as shown in the Description of Work section of the DBE’s profile (in the DBE Directory). The NAICS codes listed on the certification directory are primarily used to determine whether the firm meets the size standards for a small business and may also aid in evaluating the degree of control exercised by the owners of the DBE firm. Payments made to DBE Subcontractors will be counted toward DBE participation goals if the Subcontractor is determined to be performing a commercially useful function for Work in which they are certified to perform (per the Description of Work section as shown in their profile in the DBE Directory). COA DBE participation will only be counted towards Contract specific and Department goals if the DBE firm being listed as a Condition of Award and is certified in the type of work involved prior to the due date for bids on a prime Contract. Payments reported to non COA DBE firms for certified Work will count toward the Department goal as race neutral participation. In situations where subcontract opportunities arise subsequent to execution of a prime Contract, a DBE must be certified prior to execution of the subcontract in order to count as DBE participation. Federal Small Business Enterprise (FSBE) - Federally Funded Contracts The Federal Small Business Enterprise (FSBE) program is an added element of the DBE program, requiring the same level of monitoring, reporting, and verification. FSBE goals are mandatory and assigned as a percentage of the final Contract amount, but are not a Condition of Award. It is important to remember that if the Contract increases in dollar value, the amount required to fulfill the FSBE goal will increase concurrently. The FSBE goals are not attached to specific Subcontractors at the time of award, and can be met through utilization of any firm designated as a DBE, UDBE or SBE in the OMWBE certified directory.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

Administration
Good Faith Effort documentation meeting the requirements of the Contract will be required if the FSBE goal is not met. If at any time during the Contract it appears that the FSBE goal will not be met, work with the ASCE and Region OEO Compliance Specialist to determine appropriate actions. For purposes of tracking and reporting, a Federal Small Business will be designated as FSBE (Federal Small Business Enterprise) on the Request to Sublet and in CCIS. Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Condition of Award Participation – Federally Funded Contracts When a COA goal is specified, the Contractor shall be held to its DBE Contract commitments, unless otherwise established through a Change Order. The Contractor shall submit the DBE Utilization Certification Form (DOT Form 272-056U) with the Bid. The DBE Utilization Certification Form identifies the Contractors’ monetary commitment amount and the general scope of certified work the DBE is to perform. Once the Bid is submitted, the Bidder has 48 hours to submit the following documents:
• DBE Written Confirmation Document (DOT Form 422-031U)
• DBE Trucking Credit Form (if required) (DOT Form 272-058)
• DBE Bid Item Breakdown (DOT Form 272-054)
• Good Faith Effort Documentation (required if the bidder did not certify adequate participation to meet the goal) The DBE Bid Item Breakdown is the initial submittal for the Contractor’s DBE Utilization Plan and is used to identify the bid items and dollar amounts specific to the scope of certified work being committed to the DBE. The information is verified and entered into CCIS by HQ OEO. Subcontracts – Applies to DBE and FSBE Prior to a DBE or FSBE performing Work on the Contract, the Contractor is required to submit a copy of the executed subcontract between the firm and the Contractor that hired them to the appropriate email address identified in the Contract. The Region OEO Compliance Specialist will review submitted subcontracts and if no comments for noncompliance are issued, no further action is required by the Project Office. If the Region OEO Compliance Specialist contacts the Project Engineer due to nonsubmittal or noncompliance of subcontracts, language will be provided by the Region OEO Compliance Specialist to be used to inform the Contractor of non-compliance or non-submittal. Trucking – Applies to DBE and FSBE Each trucking firm performing only trucking or hauling Work, certified as DBE or FSBE must submit a Primary Truck Unit Listing Log, including all applicable rental/lease agreements. The form will identify all trucks that will be used on the Project by the trucking firm, and must be designated as Primary. If additional trucks will be added to the Primary Truck Unit Listing Log, a new form will be required and identified as the Updated Primary.
Page 1-94
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
The same form will also be utilized as a daily trucking report, required to be submitted for each day the trucking firm is on-site, listing not only the truck information but also the driver name(s) and hours worked, and marked as the Daily.
• Primary Truck Unit Listing Log – DOT Form 350-077 – Initial Submittal due prior to trucking firm performing work – Updated and resubmitted as necessary (identified as Updated Primary) – Drivers names and hours worked are not required – Lease/rental agreements must be attached – Submitted to the Project Engineer – Project Office uploads into DMCS – Requires field verification with the CUF On-Site Review Forms received with incomplete or missing supporting documentation must be returned to the Contractor for correction.
• Daily Truck Unit Listing Log – Daily reporting – Weekly submittal – Driver names and hours are required to be reported – Submitted to OEO Region mailbox – Region OEO Compliance Specialist verifies a minimum of 10% of the Daily Truck Unit Listing Logs – Region OEO Compliance Specialist uploads into DMCS If the Region OEO Compliance Specialist contacts the Project Engineer due to forms received with incomplete or missing information, language will be provided by the Region OEO Compliance Specialist to inform the Contractor of non-compliance. Primary – Prior to any trucking services being performed on the Contract, a Primary Truck Unit Listing Log must be submitted. The Project Office will review and upload the Primary Truck Unit Listing Log to DMCS. When reviewing the Primary DBE Truck Unit Listing Log verify:
• The trucking firm has signed each lease agreement
• The truck lease agreement is with DBE or FSBE trucking firms or commercial truck leasing companies
• The license plate numbers on each lease agreement match the Primary Truck Unit Listing Log
• The lease agreements are reasonable to perform the work Updates to the Primary Truck Unit Listing Log must be resubmitted within 10 calendar days of the change. The Project Engineer will upload any Updated Primary Truck Unit Listing Logs into DMCS. Daily –By the Friday of the week after Work was performed by the trucking firm, the Daily Truck Unit Listing Log is required to be submitted to the Region OEO mailbox. After the initial submittal, the Daily Truck Unit Listing Log will be required to be submitted on a weekly basis.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-95
Chapter 1
Administration
The Daily Truck Unit Listing Log will include the same list of trucks that was included on the Primary Truck Unit Listing Log, and will also include each driver’s name and the hours worked for the specified day. In addition to CUF review(s), the Region OEO Compliance Specialist will verify a minimum of 10% of certified payrolls (listed truck drivers) against the daily logs throughout the life of the trucking firm’s work on the project. The verification may require the use of supporting documentation such as:
• Inspector Daily Reports
• Delivery Tickets and Field Note Records– can be requested from the Project Office
• Dispatch Tickets – can be requested from the Contractor If the Region OEO Compliance Specialist notices discrepancies during their review, the Project Engineer will be notified immediately. Additional field verification using the accepted Primary Truck Unit Listing Log may be required by the Project Inspector. Field verification is required to ensure that trucks used on the Contract by the trucking firms are listed on the accepted Primary Truck Unit Listing Log. Verification records will be retained in the Contract files with the Project Offices’ copy of the trucking firm’s CUF OnSite Review, and it is recommended that the two activities occur at the same time. Use the accepted and most current Truck Unit Listing Log as the verification record. If during the verification process a truck is found to be on-site that is not on the accepted Truck Unit Listing Log, the Project Engineer will immediately notify the Contractor of the following in writing:
• A trucking firm used trucks that were not included on the accepted Truck Unit Listing Log, therefore, cannot be counted as participation towards the commitment
• An Updated Primary Truck Unit Listing Log is required to be sent to the Project Engineer for acceptance within 10 days of when the truck started the work, in order to count its participation Upon accepting the Updated Primary Truck Unit Listing Log, the Project Engineer will perform a field verification. A new on-site review is not required for every Truck Unit Listing Log verification. If the Contractor fails to provide an acceptable list within 10 days of the truck performing any work, contact the Region OEO Compliance Specialist for guidance, as the Contractor is at risk of a potential CUF infraction. Trucks not listed on the approved list cannot be counted towards the Contract goal, but are allowed to work on-site. If the Project Inspector witnesses new trucks onsite at any time during the project, additional field verifications of the trucking inventory are required. Changes to the Condition of Award (COA) Any change to reduce the COA DBEs scope or commitment amount will be processed as a Change Order, requiring State Construction Office and HQ OEO approval, to terminate COA work and a substitution is required to fulfill the COA commitment amount. If approval is not granted prior to any termination and substitution, the Contractor will not be entitled to any payment for COA work not performed by the existing DBE. Substitution of a COA DBE cannot occur without termination. The Project Engineer will discuss the Contractor’s plan for substitution as part of the termination approval process.
Page 1-96
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
Exceptions to the substitution requirement may be allowed in the following circumstances:
• WSDOT deletes the COA firm’s intended work or,
• The work has progressed to the point where no other work remains to be subcontracted The State Construction Office will approve any substitution with concurrence from the Office of Equal Opportunity. Condition of Award (COA) Change Orders Changes to COA DBE Subcontractors’ scope or commitment amounts must be made through a Change Order executed by the State Construction Office. Approval is granted by the assigned ASCE, with the concurrence of OEO. This approval must be obtained and documented prior to the changed work, and any related work, being performed. Types of COA Change Orders may include:
• Substitution – Contractor requests to terminate a COA DBE Subcontractor in whole or part for good cause and substitute with another COA DBE Subcontractor. The COA Change Order will include a DBE termination for the DBE Subcontractor being replaced and assigning an equal or greater amount of COA work to another DBE Subcontractor.
• Using COA DBE for Type of Work Not Listed – Contractor requests to use COA DBE Subcontractor for a type of work that is not listed on the DBE Utilization Certification. In order to be counted toward the COA Goal amount, a COA Change Order must add this work to the COA items for the COA DBE Subcontractor. The COA DBE Subcontractor must be OMWBE certified to perform this type of work prior to execution of its original Subcontract on the Contract.
• Change Due to Contractor Initiated Change – Contractor proposes a change that deletes or reduces work to be performed by a COA DBE Subcontractor. This is a termination, and therefore must follow the requirements associated with terminating a DBE. The Contractor shall find substitute work to replace this COA work. If the Contractor cannot guarantee COA DBE participation the requested change order cannot be approved.
• Change Due to Owner Initiated Change – Owner initiates a change that deletes or reduces COA DBE work. This could have the same effect as termination, therefore, the ASCE should negotiate inclusion of additional COA DBE work (may include paying a premium) or require a GFE to be included in the change order. The amounts shown in the COA Change Order should meet or exceed the credit necessary to accomplish the original Contract DBE commitment amount. The Request for Approval, Change Order and Change Order Package will contain the following information:
• An explanation of why the change is necessary
• Identification of all deleted work and all added work
• Revised subtotals for all affected COA DBE firms. The change order only needs to address each affected DBE firm, not all COA DBE firms.
• Revised total attainment for DBE participation.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-97
Chapter 1
Administration
When submitting the Change Order to the Contractor for signature, the Project Engineer will send copies to the affected DBE firms as notification of the change and will advise the Contractor that this has been done. Termination of DBE Subcontracts Prior to requesting termination of a DBE Subcontractor, the Contractor shall submit, in writing, a letter to both the DBE Subcontractor and Project Office explaining the reason for termination. The DBE Subcontractor has five days to respond to the letter, either in support or objection to the termination. The Contractor must have good cause to terminate, as specified in the General Special Provision. The Project Office will work with the ASCE and HQ OEO for approval of the termination. If termination of the DBE Subcontractor is approved, the Contractor shall substitute for the DBE with another DBE Subcontractor in an amount equal to the value remaining from the previous DBE’s work. A revised Utilization Plan to achieve the UDBE commitment amount shall be submitted to the Project Engineer within two days of the approval of termination or the Contract may be suspended until the plan is submitted. Commercially Useful Function On-Site Reviews The Project Engineer will assist WSDOT OEO in performing CUF On-Site Reviews on each MSVWBE, and DBE Contractor, Subcontractor, Regular Dealer (Federal funds only), Supplier or Manufacturer performing work or supplying materials. The reviews are required whether the Contract is established with voluntary or mandatory goals, and regardless of COAs. Contracts funded with only State funds will use the following forms, as applicable:
• DOT Form 226-013, MSVWBE On-Site Review for Construction Subcontractors/Supplier/ Manufacturers
• DOT Form 226-014, Project Office On-Site Review for Architect & Engineering and Professional Services Firms Contracts funded with Federal funds will use the following forms, as applicable:
• DOT Form 272-052, Commercially Useful Function On-Site Review for Construction Contractors/Subcontractors
• DOT Form 272-064, Commercially Useful Function On-Site Review for Regular Dealer/ Manufacturers
• DOT Form 272-051, On-Site Review Form/Commercially Useful Function Architect & Engineering/Professional Services Firms While it is the responsibility of the Project Inspector to complete the entire MSVWBE On-Site Review Forms, the Commercially Useful Function On-Site Review forms for Federally Funded projects are to be completed by three separate entities: the Project Inspector, the Office Engineer, and the Region OEO Compliance Specialist. Once the On-Site Reviews are completed within the Project Office, enter the following information into CCIS:
• The date the review was completed by the Project Office Staff
• The name(s) of the individuals conducting the review
Page 1-98
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
The CUF On-Site Review form is sent to the Region OEO Compliance Specialist for completion with a copy of the Inspectors’ Daily Report (IDR). The Project Inspector should attach a copy of the CUF On-Site Review form to their IDR. Photographs capturing the work, equipment, and materials used should be attached to the CUF On-Site Review and the IDR. If a Regular Dealer is utilized, the Region OEO Compliance Specialist will notify the Project Office. Coordination between the Project Office and the Region OEO Compliance Specialist may be necessary to conduct the CUF On-Site Review for Regular Dealers, due to their rarity and typical short duration on the project site. All CUF On-Site Reviews will be conducted at the peak of the firms’ on-site work and whenever a firm begins performing work under a different scope of work or Contract. An additional CUF On-Site Review will be completed each calendar year for multi-year Contracts. A CUF On-Site Review is a “snapshot in time” and should record the personal observations, personnel interviews, and results of documentation reviews. It is the Project Inspectors’ responsibility to work with Contractor personnel to gather and report accurate data. If the interviewee is unsure of a question, this should be reflected in the answer. Instructions and clarifying statements are included in each of the forms. Once the review is complete and the date and initials of the interviewer have been entered into CCIS, the Project Office will send the original review to the Region OEO Compliance Specialist within 10 calendar days. An accurate and thorough CUF On-Site Review is critical, as the review is used to help determine participation credit to both the Contract and Department goals, as well as prevent fraud. If the Project Inspector or Office Engineer are unclear of a question, they are encouraged to inquire to either their Project Engineer or their Region OEO Compliance Specialist for further clarification. As previously mentioned, the CUF On-Site Review assists when determining participation, but if at any time the Project Inspector witnesses activities that could result in nonparticipation, notify the Project Engineer immediately. Any issues regarding DBE compliance should be brought to the attention of the assigned ASCE, who will then coordinate with OEO to take appropriate actions. On rare occasions, OEO may elect to perform a more in-depth investigation after the CUF On-Site Review is complete. OEO will contact the Project Office directly to inform them of the investigation, however, no further action will be needed by the Project Office. Note:
• Practices that violate CUF criterion may not be excused by forfeiting credit for that portion of the work. Violation may result in none of a MSVWBE or DBE’s work being eligible for credit and will not count towards DBE goals.
• After the MSVWBE or DBE firm has met their obligation under their subcontract and total commitment, the Contractor may utilize the firm for additional work.

Brokering, Flagging, and Traffic Control Services The CUF for traffic control work is specific to the type of work and credit allowed under the terms of the Contract. The following is guidance specific to brokering, flagging and traffic control services. Brokering A business firm that provides a bona fide service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services and assistance in the procurement of essential personnel, facilities, equipment, materials, or supplies required for the performance of the Contract; or, persons/companies who arrange or expedite transactions. MSVWBE Participation Credit (State Funding) When a MSVWBE participates as a broker, only the dollar value of the fee or commission charged, or 20 percent of the total dollar value of expenditures by the MSVWBE (whichever is greater) counts toward the MSVWBE Voluntary Goal if the firm performs a CUF. DBE Participation Credit (Federal Funding) When a DBE participates as a broker, credit may be allowed for the reasonable fees or commission charged by a DBE broker or a DBE behaving in the manner of a broker. To be considered reasonable, the fee must not be excessive as compared with fees customarily paid for similar services, and shall not exceed 5 percent of the value of the goods or services. If Brokering is identified as part of the commitment amount, the DBE Utilization Certification form (DOT Form 272-056U) is required. The cost of materials and supplies provided by the prime Contractor cannot count towards any portion of the DBE goal, unless the prime Contractor is certified as DBE. Flagging When MSVWBE or DBE traffic control companies are listed in the MSVWBE Participation Plan or DBE Utilization Certification as providing “Flagging”:
• The MSVWBE or DBE shall be in control of its work inclusive of supervision
• The Traffic Control Supervisor (TCS) shall be employed by the MSVWBE or DBE firm and be responsible for managing and supervising the flagging operation and perform all duties required in Standard Specification 1-10.2(1)B
• All Flaggers shall be employed by the MSVWBE or DBE firm
• The MSVWBE or DBE firm shall provide all flagging equipment Credit: when providing both flaggers and TCS, the value of the labor is eligible to be credited toward the goal. If the DBE is acting as a broker, only their fee for service would be eligible towards the DBE goal.

Chapter 1
Traffic Control Services When MSVWBE or DBE traffic control companies provides “Traffic Control Services” as designated in the MSVWBE Participation Plan or DBE Utilization Certification:
• The MSVWBE or DBE shall be in control of its work inclusive of supervision
• The Traffic Control Supervisor (TCS) shall be employed by the MSVWBE or DBE firm and be responsible for managing and supervising the flagging operation and perform all duties required in Standard Specification 1-10.2(1)B
• The MSVWBE or DBE firm shall provide all traffic control items to perform the work under their subcontract
• The MSVWBE or DBE traffic control company shall not lease or use equipment supplied by the prime Contractor The State Construction Office should be consulted if questions arise about required equipment. Joint Checks Prior to the use of a joint check by a MSVWBE or DBE, for the purchase of materials or supplies required for the project, the MSVWBE or DBE shall submit the DBE Joint Check Request Form (WSDOT Form 272-053) accompanied by a copy of the Joint Check Agreement between the parties to the Project Office. The Project Office will forward these documents to the Region OEO Compliance Specialist for review. If the Project Office and Region OEO Compliance Specialist are satisfied that the Joint Check request meets the requirements of the Contract, the documents will be forwarded to the ASCE for approval and concurrence from OEO. Note: Joint checks for anything other than materials and/or supplies will not be accepted. The Joint Check Agreement must be specific to the current project, and include, among other things, a detailed description of the materials/supplies covered by the Agreement. Escalation and Enforcement The Department’s MSVWBE and DBE programs are managed by OEO. For day-to-day issues, the Project Engineer should communicate with the Region OEO Compliance Specialist and their assigned ASCE. Any questions received from the Contractor or Subcontractor about MSVWBE or DBE Provisions or enforcement should be answered only with full knowledge and at the direction of the State Construction Office and HQ OEO. Project Inspectors working with MSVWBE or DBE Contractors must notify the Project Engineer immediately if violation of CUF or other unfavorable practices are suspected. Once the Project Engineer is aware of the situation, it is their responsibility to escalate the problem as outlined:
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-101
Chapter 1
Administration
Upon confirmation of any infractions found by the Region OEO Compliance Specialist, the Project Engineer will issue a Notice of Non-Compliance letter to the Contractor. The Contractor will have 14 calendars days from receipt of the letter to respond with a corrective action plan. The letter must contain a detailed list of the infractions that occurred and a list of all applicable sanctions if the Contractor remains non-compliant or non-responsive. The Region OEO Compliance Specialist will be available to assist the Project Engineer with the Notice of Non-Compliance Letter. If it is determined the Contractor remains non-compliant, sanctions may be applied in accordance with Standard Specification 1-07.11(5). On-the-Job Training (OJT) – Federally Funded Contracts The Federal government requires Contracting Agencies to include these Training Provisions as a condition attached to the receipt of Federal Highway Funding. The training and upgrading of minorities and women is a primary objective of this Training Special Provision. The amount of training hours are determined by HQ OEO. The requirements for trainee, training plan approval, and trainee payment are all specified in the Contract Special Provisions. On Design-Build Contracts, the Contractor does not submit a monthly invoice for payment. Refer to the Request for Proposal (RFP) for training requirements. The Contract Provisions allow the Contractor to accomplish required training hours as part of their work activities, or through the activities of their Subcontractors or lower-tier Subcontractors. However, the Contractor is designated as being solely responsible for the completion of the training requirements. Payment for Training The Contractor shall submit a certified invoice requesting payment for training. The invoice shall provide the following information for each trainee:
• The related weekly payroll number
• Name of trainee
• Total hours trained under the program
• Previously paid hours under the Contract
• Hours due for current estimate
• Dollar amount due for current updated estimate Retroactive payment may be allowed provided:
• The Training Program was approved prior to the trainee beginning work on the project
• There are no outstanding issues or circumstances that would have prevented approval of the trainee Increases in training hours are allowable and may be approved on a case by case basis by the Project Engineer in consultation with the Regional EEO Officer.

On-the-Job-Training Required Reports
• DOT Form 272-049, Training Program This report shall be submitted to the Project Engineer for approval prior to commencing Contract work. The Project Office has the authority to approve Apprenticeship, Training, Employer and Labor Services (ATELS) or State Apprentice and Training Council (SATC) programs provided they meet the requirements specified in the Contract provisions. The Region OEO Compliance Specialist will review any non-ATELS/SATC training plans submitted under Section III of the form for compliance and submit the plan to HQ OEO for concurrence and submittal to FHWA for final approval.
• DOT Form 272-050, Apprentice/Trainee Approval Request Approval of an individual trainee cannot be authorized until an approved Training Program is filed with the Region. This form shall be submitted by the Contractor for each trainee to be trained on the project. When an ATELS/SATC trainee is first enrolled, a copy of the trainee’s certificate showing training registration shall accompany the Trainee Approval Request. Trainees are approved by the Project Office based on the criteria in the special provisions. If the Contractor submits a request for approval of a trainee who is neither female, nor a minority, the Contractor shall submit a GFE and the Project Office will obtain concurrence from the Regional EEO Officer and OEO prior to approval.
• DOT Form 226-012, Trainee Interview Questionnaire One trainee interview is to be conducted for each craft designated on an approved training program for Contracts which have 600 or more training hours or as designated by the Region EEO. The Region EEO shall designate additional Contracts on which trainee interviews are to be completed in conjunction with those that meet the criteria above to insure that trainee interviews are conducted on at least one fourth of all the Contracts that have training hours established for any given construction season. The intent of these training interviews is to document that the trainees are working and receiving proper training consistent with their approved programs, that the trainee is being paid at the appropriate wage rate, and that discrimination/harassment is not occurring. Interviews are to be confidential and aside from the Contractor and Subcontractors unless the Trainee states otherwise. The individual’s identity should not be disclosed to the employer without employee’s written permission. Submit completed interviews to the Region EEO Office.

Requirements for Affirmative Action to Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity EEO (State Funded Projects) The Contractor shall comply with the EEO requirements detailed in Standard Specifications Section 1-07.11. The Project Engineer should be alerted and respond to any indications or accusations of discrimination. If the Project Engineer, or any other Project Office staff, becomes aware of any indications or accusations of discrimination, they will immediately notify the Region OEO Compliance Specialist, who will in turn immediately notify OEO. OEO will handle any investigation that is warranted. EEO (Federally Funded Projects) WSDOT has committed to FHWA to perform comprehensive construction compliance reviews, consistent with WSDOT’s approved EEO Assurances Program document, to ensure compliance with the Federal non-discrimination requirements (ref. Standard Specifications Section 1-07.11 and the FHWA 1273). This review is performed by OEO on a select number of FHWA Funded Contracts and may take place at any time, including after Contract Completion. These reviews do not normally involve the Project Office other than notification of their occurrence and the resulting findings, however, OEO may elect to interview Project Office staff associated with the Contract as part of their review. OEO will contact the Region OEO Compliance Specialist or Project Office to facilitate the timing of the review. SS 1-07.11(5) Sanctions The Project Engineer shall take steps to stop any acts that are harassing in nature as described in the Standard Specifications Section 1-07.11(2). These steps may include removing a Contractor’s employee pending outcome of an investigation. ASCE approval is required in the case where the Project Engineer determines that the conditions warrant removal of a Contractor’s employee. It is important to note that this is not a request that the employee be terminated by the Contractor, just that they are removed from this Project. The ASCE will consult with the Region OEO and investigate the conditions prior to directing the removal. Care should be taken to ensure that all parties are treated with respect and in a nondiscriminatory manner. The facts should be established and everyone should be given a chance be heard.

Federal Agency Inspection
Construction Work in International Boundary Strip The International Boundary Commission of Washington, D.C., by treaty with Canada, has the exclusive jurisdiction of the 20-ft boundary strip, 10 ft on each side of the International Boundary. Any construction work within this strip must be with the exclusive permission of the International Boundary Commission (IBC). Boundary monuments are not to be moved or disturbed in any manner without the expressed approval of the IBC. It is expected that permission for all work within the boundary strip will be obtained from the IBC during the design stage of a project. However, it is the Project Engineer’s responsibility to ascertain that permission has, in fact, been obtained from the IBC for all

work performed within the boundary strip. The Region shall be immediately notified if, upon construction, it is found that permission has not been obtained to relocate boundary markers or perform construction work in the 20 ft boundary strip. Responsibilities When Working on Tribal Lands Indian nations have the political distinction of being sovereign. This is different from being designated as having protected group status based on racial classifications. Being sovereign, tribes have the ability to create and enforce tribal ordinances such as Tribal Employment Rights Ordinances (TERO). These are legal requirements pertaining to work within the boundaries of the reservation which are enforced by the respective tribes. When a contract includes work on a reservation, the project should include a general special provision “Indian Preference and Tribal Ordinances” that alerts the contractor to the possibility that TERO requirements may apply and provides a contact person for the tribe. The provision also reminds the contractor to bid any costs associated with TERO compliance into associated items of work. TERO requirements may take a variety of forms, some of which are listed in the noted provision. The provision also notes that complying with TERO requirements shall not be a violation of the contract equal employment opportunity requirements. The end result is that the contractor is expected to comply with TERO requirements as they would any other legal obligations. The underlying intent is to reduce Indian unemployment and most tribes are willing to work with contractors to best meet this goal. We want to avoid creating any contractual requirements that interfere with their ability to do so. Our role is to assist in communication but not become involved in determining or paying the tax. Cargo Preference Act (CPA) 46 CFR Part 381 The Contract Provisions for federal-aid construction contracts (FHWA 1273) requires the implementation of the Cargo Preference Act (CPA) of 1954. The regulations for the Act are given in 46 CFR Part 381, and require that at least 50 percent of any equipment, materials or commodities procured, contracted for or otherwise obtained with funds granted, guaranteed, loaned, or advanced by the U.S. Government, and are transported by ocean vessel, shall be transported on privately owned United States-flag commercial vessels, if available. A listing of United States-flag commercial vessels is maintained by MARAD at: www.marad.dot.gov/wp-content/uploads/pdf/MAR620.US_.Flag_.Vessels.pdf The Federal Highway Administration has stated that Part 381.7 (a)-(b), shown below, are the appropriate clauses for use in the Federal-aid highway program. (a) Agreement Clauses. “Use of United States-flag vessels: “(1) Pursuant to Pub. L. 664 (43 U.S.C. 1241(b)) at least 50 percent of any equipment, materials or commodities procured, contracted for or otherwise obtained with funds granted, guaranteed, loaned, or advanced by the U.S. Government under this agreement, and which may be transported by ocean vessel, shall be transported on privately owned United States-flag commercial vessels, if available. “(2) Within 20 days following the date of loading for shipments originating within the United States or within 30 working days following the date of loading for shipments originating outside the United States, a legible copy of a rated, ‘on-board’ commercial ocean bill-of-lading in English for each shipment of cargo described in paragraph (a) (1) of this Section shall be furnished to both the Contracting Officer (through the prime Page 1-106

The CPA requirements are not applicable for goods or materials that come into inventories independent of an FHWA funded-contract. For example, the requirements would not apply to shipments of Portland cement, asphalt cement, or aggregates, as industry suppliers and contractors use these materials to replenish existing inventories. In general, most of the materials used for highway construction originate from existing inventories and are not acquired solely for a specific Federal-aid project. A test for whether CPA requirements apply or do not apply to shipped goods or materials would be if the goods or materials are what one would consider to be common inventory supplies for highway construction contractor, then CPA would not apply. If the materials or goods are considered to be supplies one would consider to be not common supplies of a highway construction contractor then CPA would apply. When the CPA requirements apply, the Contractor must furnish within 20 days following the date of loading for shipments originating within the United States or within 30 working days following the date of loading for shipments originating outside the United States, a legible copy of a rated, ‘on-board’ commercial ocean bill-of-lading in English for each shipment of cargo as described in 46 CFR Part 381.7 (b) (1). Copies shall be provided to the Contracting Agency (Engineer) by the Contractor (through the prime contractor in the case of subcontractor bills-of-lading), and also to the Division of National Cargo, Office of Market Development, Maritime Administration, Washington, DC 20590.

Contractor’s Responsibility for Work
SS 1-07.13(1)
General
Standard Specifications Section 1-07.13(1) specifically designates the Contractor as being solely responsible for the completed work or material until the entire improvement has been completed. All work and material, including change order work, is at the sole risk of the contractor and when damaged must be rebuilt, repaired, or restored. When these damages occur to either the permanent or temporary work, and have occurred prior to the contract Completion Date, the costs for these repairs shall be entirely at the Contractor’s expense. However, the specification does provide the contractor exceptions for causes that are generally beyond the contractor’s control. While the Contractor is fully responsible for the work and materials, the Section does provide the contractor some options for relief. Relief is broken into 2 categories. The first category is relief of maintenance and protection for portions of works that have been completed. The second category is for relief of damage caused by the public when it is necessary that the public use the facility during construction. Both options for relief have specific criteria in order to exercise them. While a brief explanation of each option is provided, the Project Engineer should review the entire Standard Specifications Section 1-07.13 to ensure that the extent of responsibilities are understood and that any relief from responsibility is granted in accordance with those provisions. SS 1-07.13(2)
Relief of Responsibility for Completed Work
Standard Specifications Section 1-07.13(2) provides relief to the Contractor from maintaining and protecting specific portions of contract work as they are completed. The Contractor must submit a written request for relief to the Project Engineer. Before granting any relief, the Project Engineer will review the request to ensure that the items of work noted conform to the requirements and limitations outlined in Standard Specifications Section 1-07.13(2) and have been fully completed in all respects of the contract. The Regional Construction Manager or designee may approve these requests for relief. Relief may be granted for several specific items, for example: “Item 17, Beam Guardrail, Type l; Item 18, Beam Guardrail Anchor Type l; etc.” Relief may also be granted for all work except certain items, for example: “All work except Item 38, Electrical.” the approval of the Contractor’s request must be in writing. SS 1-07.13(3)
Relief of Responsibility for Damage by Public Traffic
When it is necessary for public traffic to utilize a highway facility during construction, Standard Specifications Section 1-07.13(3) provides relief of responsibility to the Contractor for damage caused to the permanent work by the public traffic. When the conditions specified in this Section are met, the Contractor is automatically relieved of this responsibility. However, this Section may not provide relief for damage caused by vandalism or other causes. The Contractor will resume full responsibility for both temporary and permanent work if traffic is relocated to another Section of roadway. This responsibility will again continue until contract completion unless the Section is reopened to public traffic or the Contractor is granted relief under Standard Specifications Section 1-07.13(2).

Chapter 1
The first paragraph of Standard Specifications Section 1-07.13(3) refers to damage to “permanent work.” This refers to work included in the contract that is being constructed in accordance with the requirements noted in the plans and specifications and is damaged. The intent is to exclude equipment, temporary facilities and temporary materials such as formwork and falsework and “Temporary Traffic Control Devices.” SS 1-07.13(4)
Repair of Damage
Section SS 1-07.13(4) details when WSDOT assumes responsibility and pays for third party damages. The WSDOT Enterprise Risk Management Manual M 72-01, provides detailed guidance on procedures, including lines of communication. Payment should be made under the item “Reimbursement for Third Party Damages.” This item is only intended to be used for costs that are the responsibility of the contracting agency. If this item was not included in the contract, it may be added by change order using a separate group for each Control Section (as shown in the Plans) in which an incident occurs. Risk Management has created a form that is to be used to report each new occurrence of Third Party Damages, “DOT Form 350-013”. The form is available from Forms Management. Any supporting documents should be attached to the form and submitted as well. The form should be filled out and submitted per the routing listed on the bottom of the form. This routing includes:
• AFS – Contract Payments
• Enterprise Risk Management – For AFS and Risk Management use thirdpartydamage@wsdot.wa.gov
• Region Construction Office Region Construction may need to send to Region Program Management and to Region Financial Services if additional funds are required. If this item was not included in the contract, it may be added by change order using a new group for the Control Section (as shown in the Plans) in which an incident occurred. Once the item has been added to the contract, use DOT Form 350-013 when establishing the group for the occurrence. This group will be used for only one occurrence. A new group will be required for each new occurrence. If the item is included in the contract and a new occurrence of Third Party Damage occurs, use DOT Form 350-013 to add a group for each new occurrence. You will need a group for each occurrence of Damage. If additional information (responsible party, police reports, Field Notes, paynotes, etc.) becomes available after the initial report form has been submitted, you may send an updated form to the same routing. Be sure to indicate that this is a revised form by selecting the “Revised Report” radio button.

Responsibility for Damage
Claims Against the Contractor – Damage The Department has a claims office, now known as the WSDOT Risk Management Office (RMO). All receptionist job descriptions, all Region operations manuals, and all telephone training is set up to refer citizens with damage claims related to construction to the RMO and to provide the toll free number (1-800-737-0615). The RMO will react to the call, issuing claims forms, contacting the contractor, and following up on the actions taken. The Project Engineer’s role is to appropriately advise the RMO, if needed. There may be confusion about which contract is involved. Field office knowledge about the incident and the surrounding circumstances may be solicited. The contractor’s insurance and the insurance provided by the Contractor for the State may be involved and information about the policy will, most likely, be requested. If, in spite of the Department process, the claimant contacts the field office directly, the Project Engineer should refer the claimant to the State Risk Management Office (1-800-737-0615). Claims Against the Contractor – Money Claims received by the Region for money owed by the Contractor should be referred to the Contractor. A claimant should be advised of the legal right to file a lien against the retained percentage or performance bond for claims involving labor, equipment, or materials used on the project and be referred to the Accounting and Financial Services Division for obtaining the necessary lien forms. Claims Against Officials and Employees The statutes provide that claims may be filed against the State of Washington, State officers and employees, for damages resulting from their conduct and prescribes the manner in which the action must be taken. Whenever this occurs, the state will furnish the legal defense and pay any judgments if the act which caused the alleged damage was within the scope of the person’s duties, was in good faith, and without negligence.
SS 1-07.15
Temporary Water Pollution Prevention
SS 1-07.15(1)
Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures Plan
Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plans are written by the Contractor to prevent, respond to, and report hazardous material spills in a safe and effective manner. All WSDOT projects should have a project specific SPCC Plan and the plan must be submitted to the Project Engineer prior to starting any on-site work. The plan should be reviewed by the Project Office for compliance with the WSDOT Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Manual M 3109. WSDOT personnel who review SPCC Plans are required to take the Spill Plan Reviewer and Preparedness Training class available through the Learning Management System (LMS). SPCC Plans should include information regarding the project site and contractor activities as they relate to spill prevention, control, and response activities. Additionally, SPCC Plans should identify possible sources of hazardous materials, methods to prevent and control spills, and spill response procedures. SPCC Plans are written and maintained by the Page 1-110
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
Contractor and are required on all WSDOT projects, regardless of the size or duration of construction activities. SPCC Plans are applied to the life of a construction project and may need to be amended over time with changing conditions. Periodic inspections will ensure that the required preparation and preventative steps identified in the SPCC Plan have been taken to keep the site in compliance throughout the life of the project. The Standard Specifications provide the complete list of required contents for the Contractors SPCC Plan in Section 1-07.15(1).
SS 1-07.16
Protection and Restoration of Property
SS 1-07.16(1)
Private/Public Property
Standard Specifications Section 1-07.16(1) restricts the contractor from using Contracting Agency owned or controlled property other than property directly affected by the contract work without the approval of the Engineer. The Engineer has the authority to allow the use of Contracting Agency owned or controlled property within the project limits and any other property specifically listed for use in the contract. The use of any other Contracting Agency owned or controlled property would require a lease agreement as detailed in WSDOT Right of Way Manual M 26-01 Chapter 11. In many cases the courts have held that where the Project Engineer has exceeded their delegated authority their actions are binding upon Contracting Agency. Because of this, it is important that the Project Engineer make no instructions, verbally or by written memoranda, that are outside of their authority. SS 1-07.16(4) Archaeological and Historical Objects It is both National and State policy to preserve historical or prehistorical objects and ruins. These objects and ruins may include sites, buildings, artifacts, fossils, or other objects of antiquity that may have particular significance from a historical, cultural, or scientific standpoint. If provisions for archaeological and historical salvage have not been made in the contract and it appears that significant historic or prehistoric objects or ruins have been or are about to be encountered, the Project Engineer should immediately take steps to preserve and protect the objects or ruins. Once the objects or ruins have been sufficiently protected, the Project Engineer should immediately notify the Region Construction Manager, who will provide any necessary initial assistance to the Project Engineer. Where the Region determines appropriate, the Project Engineer will contact and inform through existing Region Environmental staff, the Cultural Resources Consultant, the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), FHWA, and affected tribes of the discovery. The Project Engineer will also help facilitate any on-site meetings for the appropriate parties should either FHWA, SHPO, or the cultural resources consultant believes it necessary.

Administration
Cultural Resource Monitoring When cultural resource monitoring is necessary for a project, the Project Engineer will invite the Cultural Resource Specialist to the preconstruction meetings to review and explain project specific cultural monitoring requirements. The Project Engineer will coordinate with the Contractor to ensure that notice is provided to the Region Environmental Office seven (7) calendar days prior to the beginning of any ground disturbing activities in any area designated as requiring monitoring. The Project Engineer will coordinate with the Region Environmental Office to ensure that a monitor will be present on-site prior to the Contractor beginning any ground disturbing activities in any area designated as requiring monitoring. On any project that has Cultural Resource Monitoring commitments, the Project Engineer will coordinate with the Region Environmental Office to ensure that a monitor is present and the appropriate notifications are made prior to the Contractor beginning any ground disturbing activities in any area designated as requiring monitoring. Responsibilities Following Unanticipated Discovery of Cultural Resources Given the wealth of historical and archeological resources found in Washington, the Project Engineer should be familiar with the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA), Standard Specifications Section 1-07.16(4), and any contract specifications regarding the discovery of cultural resources. The Project Engineer should discuss these requirements with the Contractor and WSDOT staff at the Pre-Construction Conference. These resources include, but are not limited to:
• Human skeletal remains
• Anthropogenic soil horizons (areas showing the influence of humans on nature), occupational surfaces (areas showing evidence of human activity or habitation), midden (refuse heap), etc.
• Areas of charcoal or charcoal-stained soil and stones.
• Stone tools or waste flakes (i.e., arrowheads or stone chips).
• Bones, burned rocks, or other food related materials in association with stone tools or flakes.
• Clusters of tin cans or bottles.
• Logging or agricultural equipment more than 50 years old. The Project Engineer will include a project-specific unanticipated discovery plan (UDP) in the project provisions for use by the Contractor. A sample of a UDP may be found at www.wsdot.wa.gov/Environment/CulRes/Compliance.htm. The Cultural Resources Office, at the Environmental Services Office, will assist with completing the plan. Discovery of Human Skeletal Remains The following guidance is given to assist the Project Engineer when construction activities cause disturbance to human skeletal remains. All human skeletal remains, which may be discovered, shall at all times be treated with dignity and respect. Should any WSDOT employee, contractor, or subcontractor believe that he or she has discovered human skeletal remains; the following steps shall be initiated: Page 1-112
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
1. Ensure that all work adjacent to the discovery has ceased. The area of work stoppage shall be adequate to provide for the total security and protection of the integrity of the human skeletal remains. 2. The Project Engineer shall: a. Notify the Region Construction Manager. b. Immediately notify the local coroner and the local sheriff, or other appropriate law enforcement official, requesting that a person who is competent and qualified to identify human skeletal remains be present. Do not call 911 or the media.
• No persons other than the coroner or proper law enforcement personnel, WSDOT Cultural Resources staff, SHPO (State Historical Preservation Officer), and DAHP (Department of Archeological and Historic Preservation) staff will be authorized direct access to the discovery location. This access must comply with all safety and security procedures.
• The coroner will make a determination as to whether the human skeletal remains are forensic (evidence of a possible crime) or non-forensic (historical). If the human skeletal remains are determined to be forensic, the coroner will retain control of the human skeletal remains and the discovery site will be treated as a crime scene. If the human skeletal remains are determined to be non-forensic, the coroner will notify DAHP.
• The DAHP state physical anthropologist will make the initial determination as to whether the human skeletal remains are of Native American ancestry. If the human skeletal remains are determined to be of Native American ancestry, DAHP will notify the affected tribe(s). c. Notify the WSDOT Cultural Resource Manager at Environmental Services Office, who will notify:
• FHWA Area Engineer or Environmental Program Manager.
• State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO).
• WSDOT Tribal Liaison Office. The WSDOT Tribal Liaison Office will contact the affected tribe(s) and notify them of the unanticipated discovery.
• Region Environmental Manager. 3. If the human skeletal remains are determine to be of Native American ancestry, tribal access will be allowed to the designated representative(s) of the affected tribe(s). WSDOT and FHWA will make a good faith effort to accommodate requests from affected tribe(s) to be present, prior to implementation of mitigation measures. The Project Engineer, WSDOT Cultural Resources, SHPO, and the affected tribe(s), in consultation, will determine what treatment is appropriate. If disinterment of Native American remains becomes necessary, FHWA, WSDOT, SHPO, and the affected tribe(s) will jointly determine the final custodian of the human skeletal remains for re-interment. Discovery of Other Cultural Resources The following guidance is given to assist the Project Engineer when construction activities cause the disturbance of cultural resources, other than human skeletal remains.

Should any WSDOT employee, contractor, or subcontractor believe that he or she has uncovered a cultural resource, at any point in the project, the following steps should be initiated: 1. Ensure that all work adjacent to the discovery has ceased. 2. Immediately notify the Project Engineer. The Project Engineer shall immediately notify: a. The Region Construction Manager b. The WSDOT Cultural Resource Manager at the Environmental Services Office who will notify:
• FHWA Area Engineer or Environmental Program Manager
• State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)
• WSDOT Tribal Liaison Office
• Region Environmental Manager 3. Ensure that the area of work stoppage is adequate to provide total security and protection of the integrity of the resource. Vehicles, equipment and unauthorized personnel will not be permitted to traverse the site, nor will work resume, until treatment of the cultural resource is completed. 4. All archeological deposits discovered during construction are to be treated as if they are eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historical Places (NRHP). Intentional disturbance of archeological sites without a permit from DAHP is prohibited by RCW 27.53. Disturbance of Indian burials, cairns and glyphs is prohibited by RCW 27.44. 5. If cultural resources are discovered, but additional project effects to the resource are not anticipated, project construction may resume, away from the site of the discovery, while documentation and assessment of the resource proceeds.
SS 1-07.17
Utilities and Similar Facilities
Relationship with Public and Private Utilities In some cases, utility adjustments will be completed prior to contract work. In other cases, adjustments are to be made concurrently with the work. The Project Engineer and the Contractor should meet with the public utility companies, individuals, and others owning or maintaining utility features within the limits of the highway right of way and confirm the relationship, the terms of the relocation agreements, and the relocation work schedule. Where the feature will require adjustment during construction, notice should be provided far enough in advance to allow the utility to perform the adjustment without affecting the Contractor’s work schedule. Utilities should have been given prints of the preliminary plans, prior to awarding of the contract, showing grade lines and right of way to enable them to prepare plans and estimates for making the necessary changes to their facilities in as timely a manner as possible. The Project Engineer should determine that plans for the work have been made, that the relocated facilities will be clear of the construction, and that the utilities coordinate with the Contractor’s operations to the fullest extent possible.

WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
When utilities are known to exist within the limits of the project and are not planned for relocation but may be affected by the Contractor’s construction activities, the Project Engineer and the Contractor should become familiar with the requirements of RCW 19.122, Underground Utilities. The Project Engineer may wish to obtain copies of the RCW for review at Preconstruction Meetings. The approximate locations of most existing underground utilities are shown on the contract plans. However, the existence of some underground utilities may not have been known or detected during design. If a one number locator service is available, the Contractor must utilize it in an attempt to locate all affected utility features. If no one number locator service is available, notice shall be provided individually to those owners of underground facilities known to have or suspected of having underground facilities within the area of proposed excavation. Even areas covered by a one number service may contain utilities not included in the service. If the Contractor discovers underground facilities which are not identified, the Contractor shall cease excavating in the vicinity of the facility and immediately notify the owner or operator of such facilities, or the one number locator service. Work Performed Under Utility Agreements Utility agreement work associated with a contract exists in two categories. The first is work done for a utility by WSDOT that is included in the contract and performed by the WSDOT contractor. The second is work done, either by the utility or the utility’s contractor, that is associated with and done near the WSDOT project. If the utility work is included in the contract, the plans will show the work and will include pay items exactly as if the work was part of the transportation improvement. The responsibility of the Project Engineer is to treat this work the same way that “normal” work is handled. There will be a necessity for communication with the utility itself, inviting comments and joint reviews and inspection of the work. In many cases, the utility will provide materials or equipment to be incorporated into the work. The utility will also provide certification that provided material meets the requirements of the contract. If problems arise and changes are considered, there are additional paperwork demands. The Project Engineer should consult with the Utility and the Region Utility Engineer. If the work is associated with the project, or if unrelated work is being done nearby, and the utility or its contractor is performing the work, the Project Engineer should treat the neighboring work in the same manner that adjacent WSDOT work would be treated (see Standard Specifications Section 1-05.14 and Section SS 1-07.17.) Responsibility for Coordination of Railroad Agreements When railroads are involved within the project limits, an agreement covering the work involved is usually entered into between WSDOT and the Railroad Company. Upon identifying that the contract involves work or involvement by a railroad, the Project Engineer should immediately obtain a copy of the Railroad Agreement or contact the Region Utilities Engineer to determine the status of the agreement and to make sure it contains all elements needed to accommodate the construction of the project. If an agreement has not been made with the railroad, the Project Engineer should coordinate and monitor the development and processing of the agreement through the Region Construction and Region Utilities Engineers. Where notices are required, The Project Engineer should ensure that proper notice is provided to the railroad company and that WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

such notice is acknowledged by them. The Project Engineer should work with the Region Construction Manager and Utilities Engineer to resolve any conflicts with the Railroad Company and prevent delays to the Contractor’s operations. Work Performed Under Railroad Agreements Railroad work associated with a contract exists in three categories. The first is work done for a railroad by WSDOT that is included in the contract and performed by the WSDOT contractor. The second is work done, either by the railroad or the railroad’s contractor, that is associated with and done near the WSDOT project. The third category is railroad protective services. Protective services, such as flagging, are typically provided by the railroad. If the railroad work is included in the contract, the plans will show the work and will include pay items exactly as if the work was part of the transportation improvement. The responsibility of the Project Engineer is to treat this work the same way that “normal” work is handled. There will be a necessity for communication with the railroad itself, inviting comments and joint reviews and inspection of the work. In many cases, the railroad will provide materials or equipment to be incorporated into the work. The railroad will also provide certification that provided material meets the requirements of the contract. If problems arise and changes are considered, there are additional paperwork demands. The Project Engineer should consult with the Railroad Company and the Region Utility Engineer. If the work is associated with the project, or if unrelated work is being done nearby, and the railroad or its contractor is performing the work, the Project Engineer should treat the neighboring work in the same manner that adjacent WSDOT work would be treated (see Standard Specifications Section 1-05.14 and Section SS 1-07.17.) Protective services may be called for when the Contractor is performing work on railroad facilities (first category above) or when the Contractor’s work is conflicting or adjacent to a railroad facility that is not being changed. Typically, the railroad will determine the need for service, provide the protective services, and send the bill to WSDOT. There may be an agreement in place, or the railroad’s actions may be unilateral. On all projects including railroad flagging, the Project Engineer will notify the Railroad Company when all work involving the railroad is physically complete. The addition or revision of agreements with the railroad can be lengthy processes. The Project Engineer should stay alert for possible changes and the nee
