Introduction
Special Provisions
Format
600.01 Introduction
Contract Provisions are legally enforceable specifications to contracts formed between the
Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and contractors.
The HQ Construction Office desires to maintain consistency, accuracy, and legality with project specifications. For this reason, a project designer should always try to use the specifications listed in the Standard Specifications or General Special Provisions (GSPs). It is not uncommon for a project to have a method of work or a working window of time that differs from those listed in the Standard Specifications. There are also items of work that are region-specific and as such aren’t covered in the Standard Specifications. In the case of a region nonstandard item of work, the region may write Region General Special Provisions (RGSPs) to describe the work.
In some cases where there is a nonstandard item of work in a project, a Project-Specific Special
Provision may be written to describe the work. Consult with your Region Plans office or ASCE prior to writing a Project-Specific Special Provision. Approval of Project-Specific Special
Provisions or revisions to already established Standard Specifications, GSPs or RGSPs must be given by the HQ Construction Office for Divisions 1-8 or any standalone provisions, and HQ
Materials Lab for changes to Division 9. Consult with the Assistant State Construction Engineer (ASCE) for assistance in obtaining approval from the Approval Authority. Approval authorities for
Project-Specific Special Provisions or changes to the Standard Specification, GSPs or RGSP, are all listed in the Construction Manual. In the case of federally funded projects, changes to Standard
Specifications, and GSPs and RGSPs in Divisions 1-02 though 1-09 that change policy, intent or potentially affect Federal eligibility will also require FHWA approval (see Section 600.02(4)). The
Region and ASCE work collaboratively when FHWA approval is required.
Once a new RGSP has been approved by the HQ Construction Office or Materials Lab, if not modified, it can then be used on future projects without being submitted for another approval, unless the instructions for the RGSP state that approval is required for each project.
Project-specific Special Provisions, when approved are only to be used on the project for which they were written. They cannot be used on another project without reacquiring HQ approval.
When referencing the Standard Specifications in a Project-Specific Special Provision, the headings from the Standard Specifications are never to be changed. When a section of the
Standard Specifications is “Vacant,” do not to use these sections when drafting a Project-Specific
Special Provision.

2. 3. 4. 5. 600.01(2) PS&E Word Program
This section discusses the PS&E Word Program, GSPs, RGSPs and project-specific provisions.
The Special Provisions sections of the Contract Provisions are created using the WSDOT “PS&E
Word Program”. Each GSP and RGSP is given a unique file name. That file name is a number that corresponds to the section of the Standard Specifications being supplemented or revised by the document. Project-specific provisions are assigned a unique file name by the writer of the document.
The designer makes a list, called the run-list, of the applicable file names, and the computer system compiles the actual documents in the order requested on the run-list.
The PS&E Word Program is a Microsoft Word based macro program that creates uniform project specifications using pre-loaded templates and pre-approved special provisions. The program allows the designer to access the GSPs through the region’s computer network system and enables designers to: •
Read the documents. •
Compile the run-list. •
Write the project-specific information.

600.02 Special Provisions 600.02(1) General
The Special Provisions consist of the General Special Provisions (GSPs), Region General Special
Provisions (RGSPs), and the project-specific provisions. 600.02(2) General Specical Provisions (GSPs)
GSPs are provisions that are written to cover legal and construction requirements that may occur on a project. They supplement or revise the Standard Specifications and are written to provide statewide standardization for the work covered. The State Construction Engineer, or delegated authority, is the approving authority for all changes made to the Standard
Specifications, including GSPs. Consequently, after approval, these are available for use, in their original state, for multiple projects without modification beyond the fill-ins.
The Index to the GSPs contains the file name, section heading, date of last revision, and instructions for use.
The GSP file names are directly related to the divisions in the Standard Specifications. For example, 8-01.3.OPT1.GR8 would be a GSP that either revises or supplements Section 8-01.3.
The extension GR (General Roadway) is followed by the division number of the Standard
Specification. The file name 8-01.3 refers to the section (8-01) and subsection (03) in the division. A FR extension (ie. FR8) indicates that a fill in is required by the designer which will be described in the GSP index.) A GB or FB extension indicates that the bridge office is the author of the GSP.
Use the GSP as is if it is applicable to the project being developed. HQ Construction Office approval is needed for any revisions to GSPs. After HQ approval, any GSP that is revised will become a Project-Specific Special Provision and the date will be removed and replaced with (******).

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 6-3 Contract Provisions and PS&E Word Users Guide
Division 6 600.02(3) Region General Special Provisions (RGSPs)
RGSPs are provisions that are written to cover the legal and construction requirements that occur on projects that correspond to region needs. They supplement or revise the Standard
Specifications and are written to provide regionwide standardization for the work covered.
RGSPs are approved for region use by the Assistant State Construction Engineer or delegated authority. After initial approval, an RGSP can be incorporated into your contract package. Any modifications to an already approved RGSP require resubmittal to the Assistant State
Construction Engineer or delegated authority.
The Index to the RGSPs contains the file name with a region identifier, section heading, date of last revision, and instructions for use.
The RGSP file extension has a region identifier assigned to each region after the file name. The identifier is .DT1 through .DT6 depending on what region is applicable. For example, 8-01.DT1 would be for the Northwest Region.
The file extensions for each region are provided on the following table.

600.02(4) Project-Specific Special Provisions
The project-specific provisions are written by the designer to supplement or revise information in the Standard Specifications to make them fit the project being developed. Project-specific provisions are not to duplicate information contained in the Standard Specifications, GSPs, or plans.
Approval of project-specific specifications that alter the Standard Specifications (WSDOT Spec. book) is required prior to inclusion in the contract. Send all project-specific specifications, along with justification, to the Assistant State Construction Engineer, or delegated authority for concurrence and approval.
Special provisions prepared by a support group must be reviewed to ensure they fit within the specifications/Special Provisions of the project. Any changes to a support group Special
Provision must have concurrence and approval prior to sending it to the State Construction
Engineer, or delegated authority.
FHWA retains approval authority for any modifications to Division 1-02 through 1-09 of the
Standard Specifications, General or Region General Special Provisions, and any Project-Specific
Special Provisions on Federal-aid contracts that: Change policy, Change content that may
Page 6-4

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 6
Contract Provisions and PS&E Word Users Guide materially affect the specification’s intent, or Change content that may affect federal eligibility or involve federal regulations. Therefore, any proposed revisions to Divisions 1-02 through 1-09 must be presented to the State Construction Office as early as possible to determine if FHWA approval will be required. If FHWA approval of a Project-Specific Special Provision is required, allow a minimum of 30 days to submit the changes and receive comments or FHWA acceptance.
If FHWA approval of a Project-Specific Special Provision is required, the project cannot be advertised prior to receiving that approval.
Project-specific provisions are actually project-specific supplements or revisions to the Standard
Specifications. Base the content of Project-SpecificSpecial Provision on the related information provided in the Standard Specifications. Because field inspectors and others refer to the
Standard Specifications during the course of construction, and are accustomed to the style and approach used there, consider using that document as a template and design tool when writing
Project-Specific Special Provisions.
Project-specific provisions will include six asterisks in parentheses (******). See the PS&E Word
User Guide for more information.
If there is a missing heading or subheading file from the standard specifications, contact
Standard Specifications@WSDOT.wa.gov to set up another one that can be added.

600.03 Format 600.03(1) General
Special Provisions follow the format of the Standard Specifications. Most of the information will appear under the same main headings as the division headings in the Standard Specifications.
Generally, Divisions 2 through 8 in the Standard Specifications each have the following five sections: 1. Description 2. Materials 3. Construction Requirements 4. Measurement 5. Payment
There will be occasions when the work being performed does not fall under one of the divisions in the Standard Specifications and the designer will have to write a complete new specification called a stand alone special provision. However, when drafting a special provision always provide information for all five sections listed. Stand Alone Special Provisions do not revise or supplement divisions. In these types of specials, do not include a reference to a division being supplemented or revised. Whenever possible, include references to established standard specifications to avoid conflicts between the standard specifications and language in the stand alone special provision.
Prior to writing a special provision, first assess the need to for it based on a thorough analysis of the related section(s) of the Standard Specifications. When drafting a Special Provision, strike a balance between providing too much information and too little information, with the goal of addressing the issue raised by the original need for the provision, without creating undue burden on the contractor or inspector in their effort(s) to implement it.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 6-5 Contract Provisions and PS&E Word Users Guide
Division 6 600.03(2) Description
The description is a brief statement of what the work is, written in the following format example: “This work shall consist of removing and disposing of concrete inlets.”
If the work is “furnishing and installing modified catch basins,” a description would not be required, since the description in Section 7-05 of the Standard Specifications covers the construction of all kinds of manholes, inlets, and catch basins. The writer could move on to the materials section and explain any differences in the materials for the modified catch basin.
If a description is required, it will not contain: •
Detailed information, such as station limits of the work or quantities. •
Phrases like “as detailed in the Plans,” “as shown in the Plans,” or “as directed by the
Engineer.” (see below)
Note that the location of items of work are required to be in the plans. It is not necessary to keep stating this in the Special Provisions.
Engineers do not direct the work on the project—they administer the project. The only work that is “directed” by the Engineer is force account work and work that is done off the project; for example, “the Contractor shall deliver the salvaged material to the maintenance site and stack it as directed by the Engineer.”

600.03(3) Materials
The Materials section will normally reference the appropriate section of the Standard
Specifications or the appropriate section of a nationally recognized material specification such as
AASHTO or ASTM.
Provide all information about materials in the Materials section of the Special Provisions. If a detail in the plans has materials information on it, do not repeat the information in the Special
Provisions. However, provide a reference to that information in the Special Provisions to let the reader know where to find the information. For example, a statement such as “Materials requirements for (work item X) are on the detailin the Plans” is all that is required. Do not indicate a specific plan sheet number, but rather reference a series of plans (such as Drainage
Plans or Drainage Details) using the same wording as shown on the Index sheet, so the information can be easily found.
The Standard Specifications defines the requirements for materials used in road and bridge construction. There are occasions when the regions have the need to change these requirements by Special Provision. Consult with the Construction Materials Engineer at the HQ
Materials Laboratory and request concurrence with the specification change prior to including the Special Provision in the contract documents.
In some situations, the regions may have a need to reduce the testing frequency of certain materials. This can be accomplished by one of the two following methods: •
Before construction: Contact the Construction Materials Engineer at the HQ Materials
Laboratory and request concurrence with the frequency change prior to reducing the testing frequency. •
During construction: Follow the guidance in Section 9-1.1B of the Construction Manual,
Reducing Frequency of Testing.

Page 6-6
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 6
Contract Provisions and PS&E Word Users Guide
To change the testing requirements of a material, such as testing aggregate by visual inspection, request and obtain approval from the HQ Construction Materials Engineer.
When writing a materials specification that includes a revision to Division 9 materials requirements, include the materials requirements within the Special Provision it pertains to—do not place the materials specification in Division 9. 600.03(4) Construction Requirements
Write the construction requirements section so that it clearly describes the work to be performed, and requirements that need to be met, in order for the work to be considered complete. Do not specify how to do perform the work, or explain why the work needs to be done.
When possible, construction requirements are to be shown in the order in which the work is to be performed.
In cases where a detail in the plans is a useful resource for the contractor related to the special, provide a statement in this section such as “construct the (work item X) as detailed in the
Plans.” 600.03(5) Measurement
The measurement statement describes how the work or material will be measured, not the pay item name. For example, write “measure the removal of linear feet of drainage structures,” not “Removing Drainage Structures,” (pay item name), or “measure culvert pipe,” not “Schedule A
Culv. Pipe 12 In. Diam.” (pay item name).
Review the measurement statement found in the Standard Specifications prior to drafting this section. Many times, that section will apply to items that may seem project-specific. For example, if the project has the item "Special Culv. Pipe 12 In. Diam.," the measurement statement found in the Standard Specifications applies to all culvert pipe: standard, special, modified, and so on.
To be complete, the measurement statement needs to include not only the unit of measure, but information as to when and where the measurement will be made. For example, “The length of culvert pipe or pipe arch will be the number of linear feet of completed installation measured along the invert.”

600.03(6) Payment
Write the bid item in the payment statement in quotes, followed by the unit of measure.
The bid item must exactly match the same name found in the Summary of Quantities; for example, “Adjust Catch Basin”, per each. Generally this is all that would be required for the payment statement.
If there is additional work associated with the item, the payment statement needs to also describe the work included. For example: “Removing Manhole”, per each.
The unit contract price per each for “Removing Manhole” shall include all costs for sawcutting existing pavement associated with the removal.
For example, if sawcutting is required and is to be included in the cost of the catch basin removal, make sure that the work is described in the appropriate section of the Special
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 6-7 Contract Provisions and PS&E Word Users Guide
Division 6
Provision, and not only found as a statement in the Payment section as being required and included in the cost of the item.

600.03(7) Text General Guidelines
Special Provisions and the plans shall adhere to the following general guidelines: 1. Write in a clear, concise, and complete manner. 2. Avoid the use of nonstandard words or numerous cross-references to other specifications. Use terminology consistent with the Standard Specifications, WSDOT Manuals, or other Industry
References. 3. When cross-referencing is necessary, ensure the provision is capable of standing alone as an explanatory document. 4. Place punctuation outside the quotation marks used with a bid item. 5. Capitalize the defined words within the text. Defined words are listed in Section 1-01 of the
Standard Specifications. 6. Use "all costs" or "all expenses," but not both. 7. Use "as shown in the Plans" rather than "as shown on the Plans." 8. Avoid repetition of information available from other parts of the contract document, including the Standard Specifications. 9. Avoid abbreviations, except for those included within a bid item name. 10. Use the word "shall" to denote work to be done by the Contractor. 11. Use the word "will" to denote something the State is to do. 12. Do not use "Incidental to and included in" as a combination phrase. "Incidental to" refers to a general type of work, such as earthwork or paving, whereas "included in" links payment to a specific item of work. 13. Avoid "As directed by the Engineer." Both "As designated by the Engineer" or "As staked by the
Engineer" are applicable within the project limits. 14. Avoid using "to the satisfaction of the Engineer." If enough information is available to describe a standard of work, the description is preferable. 15. Avoid "and/or" where possible. For example, "steel, wood, or both" is preferable to "steel and/or wood." 16. Avoid "as per" as a substitute for "in accordance with." 17. Use alpha notation when referring to a number of things; for example, install two catch basins. 18. Express all measurement units in Arabic numerals; for example, 6 inches, 20 feet, 1.5 miles, and so on. 19. Express counted numbers as follows: •
Spell out numbers 1 through 10 (for example, six working days, seven catch basins, and so on). •
Use Arabic numerals for numbers larger than 10 (for example, 35 working days, 24 hours, and so on).
Page 6-8

Spell out all numbers that begin a sentence. If your sentence starts with a large number, try to reconfigure your sentence.
Do not use Arabic and spelled-out numbers together.

700.01 General Requirements 700.01(1) Federal and State Contract Participation Goals
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goals for federally funded projects are condition of award goals. In order for the bid to be considered responsive, the low bidder must either meet the established goal or demonstrate Good Faith Efforts in meeting the goal. The HQ External
Civil Rights Office is part of the HQ Office of Equal Opportunity (OEO). This group establishes these goals and monitors DBE participation. State funded projects have participation goals including Disadvantaged Minority, Small, Veterans, and Women Owned Business Enterprises.
Prior to Advertisement, contact the OEO to establish goals, obtain Special Training hours, and determine which WSDOT General Special Provision (GSP) is needed for your project.
Contact email: WSDOT OEO Goal Requests
For more information, see the Construction Manual, Advertisement and Award Manual and
Standard Specifications. 700.01(2) Alternate/Cumulative Bids 700.01(2)(a)
Alternate Bids
It is, at times, desirable to solicit bids using alternates for specific bid items for work to be performed under the contract. The contract Estimate, Proposal, and Summary of Quantities will be divided into sections. One section will contain the base information, and there will be a section for each of the alternates. This requires the contractor to bid the base portion of the project and to bid the alternates as required by the Special Provisions. By comparing the base bid plus the alternate bids, WSDOT is able to determine the most economical combination.
One of the conditions of setting up a project in this manner is that WSDOT has to treat each of the alternates as equal, and make the decision regarding which is the best bid based on the lowest cost Alternate Plus Base Bid.
This is different than allowing the contractor the latitude to choose between different material options available for a contract item.
For additional information concerning alternates, refer to the EBASE Users Guide. 700.01(2)(b)

Cumulative Alternative Bids
Use in contracts when the award process is modified to include Cumulative Alternates. The
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.08
Page 7-1 Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
Division 7 region shall determine and notify the Ad and Award Office of the Funds Available. The bid items shall be segregated into a Base Bid and Alternates, as appropriate. Fill-ins consist of a brief description of the portion of the project or of the work that is included in the noted Alternates.
The specification language may be adjusted to suit the number of Alternates.
For further information on how this is to be used in a project, see Division 1-02.6, General
Special Provisions. 700.01(3) Addenda
Addenda are revisions to the plans and contract provisions that are made during the advertising period. Addenda are to be issued only when the revision will affect the contractor’s ability to provide a responsive bid. Consult with the Region Plans Office to coordinate preparation and notification of addenda to plan holders.
Items to be considered for preparing addenda, which would affect the scope of work and the contractor’s ability to accurately bid the project, might include: • Material specification changes. • New bid item(s). • A substantial quantity revision (generally, a 25% or greater increase or decrease) for an item in the bid documents. • A revision to a legal requirement in the contract. • A new supplement or a revision to the Special Provisions. • Contract errors and omissions that create conflicts.
Small adjustments to quantities, spelling, and punctuation, and design changes that do not affect quantity and relocation of items of work within the project will not normally require an addendum because they will not affect the way the contractor bids the project. These items are not to be ignored, but the information, in the form of revised plan sheets, need only be passed along to the office of the construction project engineer, so they can be incorporated into the project and given to the contractor that is awarded the project.
For example: • Addenda Not Required: The advertised project has 23 catch basins to be installed, and it is discovered that an additional catch basin, not shown on the plans, will be required. This would not warrant an addendum if this were the only change being made. The small change in quantity will not impact the contractor’s bid. This can be handled under construction as any other increase in quantity. • Addenda Required: The addition of the one catch basin causes the 18-inch-diameter pipe item to increase from 985 feet to 1,250 feet. This increase in pipe length is greater than 125% of the original, which could cause this item to be renegotiated under the contract, so the addendum would be justified. Since the addendum is required for the pipe, the additional catch basin would also be included in the addendum.
For instructions and procedures on preparing addenda, see the Appendices.

700.01(4) Reference Information
Reference Information is information available to the contractor during the bidding period that is not part of contractual documents (see Standard Specification 1-04.3). Reference information needs to be provided electronically on WSDOT’s ftp directory linked to the Contract’s
Page 7-2
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 7
Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
Advertisement webpage. Reference Information to be provided includes, but is not limited to: 1. Survey Information: If you provide electronic data Reference Information, it is recommended you provide the existing ground DTM, the finished grade DTM, and alignment and project control file. The electronic DTMs can be provided in XML format that is universally accepted by other earthwork software. 2. Cross sections or Roll plots. 3. Structural Reference Information: Include bridge inspection reports for all bridges within the project limits and as-built plans for all bridges which are being modified as part of the
Project scope including but not limited to widening, repair, retrofit (rail, seismic, etc.), painting, overlay and paving. Structural Reference Information should be listed by bridge number. 4. Geotechnical Reports - Include full reports electronically including all supplements, amendments, test pit data, and borings. For all reports include the title, author, and date.
The Summary of Geotechnical Considerations and borings should be included in the
Appendices of the Contract to ensure they are a contractual document. 5. Final Hydraulics Design Reports. 6. Other Text Reports.
No guarantee or warranty is made by the Contracting Agency that the content of Reference
Information is accurate. For further detailed information, review Division 1-04 of the WSDOT
Construction Manual and the WSDOT Advertisement and Award Manual. Contact your Assistant
State Design Engineer (ASDE) for more information.
There are rare cases where the project office may want to keep the information on the website after ad and award. In this case, special fees may apply. Contact the HQ Contract Ad & Award
Office for additional information.

700.01(5) Standard Plans
WSDOT’s Standard Plans are made a part of contracts by reference in the Special Provisions.
Whenever possible, utilize the Standard Plans in conjunction with Standard Pay Items.
Standardized work results in less documentation, fewer change orders, reduced construction costs, and greater maintainability. Do not draw plan details that duplicate Standard Plans. In certain circumstances a plan detail may need to be developed that is very closely modeled off a
Standard Plan in order to make a construction feature work with site specific constraints. In these cases, consult with Region and HQ subject matter experts to determine feasibility and potential documentation needs. 700.01(6) Competitive Bidding, Proprietary Items, and Use of the Qualified
Products List (QPL) 700.01(6)(a)
Competitive Bidding
WSDOT uses competitively acquired products to fulfill the requirements of a contract whenever feasible. This helps achieve the lowest prices, the best product quality, and the most efficient use of resources.
There are several ways to specify bid items or materials in a contract that create a competitive bidding environment. Following are three different methods, listed in order of preference:
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Page 7-3 Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
Division 7 1. Specifying by Standard or Nonstandard Bid Items
This method does not use brand names. The contractor is allowed to choose the product, as long as it meets the requirements of the Standard Specifications and contract provisions. This method fosters a competitive bidding environment and does not require approval for proprietary items. 2. Specifying Brand Names and Allowing for Approved Equals
When brand name specifying, provide the bidder with options by naming at least two products or manufacturers that are acceptable and allow for “approved equals” followed by a performance specification. When this is done, no approval is required for usage; it is not considered a proprietary item.
A good specification for brand name specifying will read as follows:
The (type of product) furnished shall be (brand name, model), (brand name, model), or an approved equal having the following features (functions): a. (feature) b. (feature) c. (feature)
In order to find the two acceptable items, look for certain features or functions. These features or functions are the ones that need to be clearly identified in the Special
Provision. 3. Specifying at Least Three Brand Names
Listing a reasonable number (three or more) of brand names/models that are acceptable is a competitive bidding environment also and doesn’t require approval. A performance specification is not required. 700.01(6)(b)
Specifying Proprietary Items

There are instances in which competitive bidding may not or cannot be provided and a specific proprietary product is allowed. This applies to temporary items/ materials as well as permanent items/materials incorporated into the project.
WSDOT has adopted the following policy for use of proprietary items on all projects. Use of proprietary items must meet at least one of the following and are approved at the region level: 1. It is purchased or obtained through competitive bidding with equally suitable other items (the three methods found above). 2. It is certified and approved that: a. The proprietary item is essential for synchronization with existing highway facilities.
Synchronization may be based on: • Function (the proprietary product is necessary for the satisfactory operation of the existing facility. A product could be essential due to the fact that it has been tested with other components and is documented to work with existing components or that it is a one-of-a-kind item. A product or manufacturer could be essential because using anything else would require replacing other components of the existing highway system,

Miscellaneous Contract Considerations • Aesthetics (the proprietary product is necessary to match the visual appearance of existing facilities), • Logistics (the proprietary product is interchangeable with products in an agency’s maintenance inventory), or • Any combination thereof with region approval.
Or, with region approval: b. No other equally suitable alternative exists: • The product (or manufacturer) is one of a kind. • Other workable alternative products or manufacturers are not equal in longevity, cost, delivery, durability, compatibility, warranty, and so on. 3. It is used for research or for a distinctive type of construction on relatively short sections of road. It is for experimental purposes to obtain experimental information on a product or manufacturer for the public good. When requesting this type of usage, approval documentation showing the scheduling, monitoring, results, and conclusion are needed. 700.01(6)(c)
Using Proprietary Items in Contracts
Before inclusion in the PS&E and prior to advertisement, request and receive written region approval for any proprietary material, work, manufacturer, or product included in a project.
Submit a memorandum of justification to the approval authority in sufficient time for it to be reviewed and acted upon.
There are two basic types of requests that can be submitted for approval: • Use of the proposed proprietary item will be allowed for regionwide or statewide use, referred to as a “blanket certification” (this is usually valid for a biennium). Place a copy of the original certification in the Project File.
Find all current blanket certification memos by selecting the Tools templates & links tab on the Design tools & support website. • Use of the proposed proprietary item will be allowed for a specific project only (just for the duration of the project). Retain the original signed region approval in the Project File.
Approval of a proprietary item does not override the federal specification for foreign steel (Buy
America) or the applicable General Special Provisions (GSP, Division 1).
When a proprietary item has been certified or approved, provide in the Special Provisions the product manufacturer, model, model number, and any additional information required to ensure only the specified item will be furnished. There will usually be only one item named in the Special Provisions when listing a proprietary item. The phrase “or approved equal” will never follow the naming of a proprietary item in a Special Provision. There are no options allowed. The contractor’s bid is to reflect the price to supply and incorporate the one item specified. 700.01(6)(d)

Using the Qualified Products List (QPL)
There is a definite difference between specifying a proprietary item and specifying a brand name, and using the Qualified Products List (QPL) which has nothing to do with either proprietary or brand name specifying.
The QPL is a list of products and materials that have been preapproved for use on WSDOT
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 7-5 Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
Division 7 projects. If the contractor chooses to provide items listed on the QPL, there is no need to submit a Request for Approval of Materials. For some products or materials on the QPL, there is no requirement to submit the items for testing prior to using the product or material on the project. However, the listing of a product in the QPL does not preclude the need for a proprietary item request if the conditions described in the previous sections apply.
The preapproval of items in the QPL does not mean they are the only products or materials that will be allowed. The contractor can provide any product or material that meets the specifications, whether they are listed in the QPL or not. 700.01(7) Buy America
For projects with federal funding in any phase (Right of Way, Design, or Construction), Buy
America obligates steel and iron construction material permanently incorporated into the project greater than $2,500, to be manufactured in the United States of America. Incorporate
GSPs associated with Buy America requirements as necessary. Check with the HQ Design Office during project development to verify whether or not Buy America is required for the project.
Check with HQ Construction Office for contract compliance related inquiries during construction. Use this link to review the Buy America memorandum from FHWA and the HQ
Design/Construction Offices:  https://wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2021­ 12/BuyAmericaMemo.pdf.
Due to the conditions set forth by Buy America, both new and salvaged materials fall under the same requirements when applied to Buy America.
Buy America requirements do not apply to steel items that are considered to be temporary, such as form work or false work. Projects involving Federal Transit Administration funds have
Buy America requirements as well.
For more information see the following links for Buy America requirements. •

FHWA: https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/construction/contracts/buyam_qa.cfm •
FTA: https://www.transit.dot.gov/buyamerica 700.01(8) Legal Relations and Responsibilities to the Public
Section 1-07 of the Standard Specifications requires the contractor to comply with all federal,
Tribal, state, or local laws and regulations that affect work under the contract. These laws and regulations do not need to be identified in the contract. However, certain project-specific regulations, such as permits, agreements, MOUs, licenses, variances, or others, and our commitment to meet them need to be identified in the contract. Examples of such regulations with conditions that need to be part of the contract are: HPA, EIS, Noise Variance, Shoreline
Permit, Department of Ecology MOU, and other documents that would affect or restrict work on the contract.
In many cases, the GSPs will trigger the need for the text of such documents to be listed in the
Special Provision, either as a fill-in or as an appendix. When construction activities require the need for a permit, variance, agreement, MOU, or other regulations, always discuss the need for such documents to be put in the contract with the appropriate region support personnel or region plans office.

Miscellaneous Contract Considerations

Decommissioning of Wells Procedure
The Geotechnical Design Manual Chapter 3 and the Design Manual Chapter 610 provide policy and procedure for protection and decommissioning of wells. Contact the Geotechnical office for support on decommissioning wells during project development.
See Plans Preparation Manual Division 4 Contract Plans for instruction on showing wells in the plans. The Electronic Engineering Data Standards Manual provides symbology for wells. 700.01(9) Washington State Laws
Following is a partial listing of laws that are frequently used in the administration of WSDOT contracts: 1. RCW 4.24.360: Any clause in a construction contract that disallows a contractor, subcontractor, or supplier any damages due to unreasonable delays in performance caused by WSDOT is void and unenforceable. 2. RCW 18.27.090: Contractors are exempt from contractor registration laws provided they are prequalified by WSDOT. 3. RCW 18.104.048: Prior notice of well construction, reconstruction, or decommissioning of wells is required (see 700.01(8)(a)). 4. RCW 19.122.040: Existing utility locations (see 400.06 for the contents of this RCW). 5. RCW 39.12: Wages (see Section 1-07.9 of the Standard Specifications). 6. RCW 39.19: See the GSP concerning minority and women’s businesses. 7. RCW 46.44: Vehicle weight limitations within project boundaries. 8. RCW 47.28.030: State Force Work and materials (see 700.09(10)(a)). 9. RCW 47.28.035: Related to RCW 47.28.030, State Force Work and materials (see 700.09(10)(b)). 10. RCW 47.28.070: Prequalification of contractors (see Section 1-02.1 of the Standard
Specifications). 11. RCW 47.28.100: Contractors are allowed 20 days after award to execute a contract. WSDOT may extend this time no more than an additional 20 days (see Sections 1-03.3 and 1-03.5 of the Standard Specifications). 12. RCW 47.28.120: Contractors must file their claims within 180 days after acceptance (see
Section 1-09.9 of the Standard Specifications). 13. RCW 47.30: Requirements for paths and trails. 14. RCW 49.28: Wages – overtime. 15. RCW 60.28.011: WSDOT must hold 5% of the contract amount in reserve for material and worker claims. Contractors can post a bond in lieu of the reserve fund (see Section 1-09.9 of the Standard Specifications). 16. RCW 78.44: A Contract Reclamation Plan is required for every WSDOT contract that contains a WSDOT-furnished materials source (see 400.06).
Some of the laws are referenced in the Standard Specifications or the GSPs; some are not. In either case, these laws are not to be altered. All Special Provisions that appear to alter a law

should be questioned. 700.01(10) Asbestos
There are GSPs that are to be included in the contract provisions regarding asbestos presence or absence in the project work. Provide the asbestos Good Faith Inspection report as part of the bid package to notify contractors of the presence or absence of asbestos containing materials prior to bid opening. Consult Environmental Manual Chapter 447 for detailed policy. 700.01(11) Permits
Ensure all permits necessary for the project are completed and signed prior to the project going to Ad. However, in the event this cannot be accomplished, it is the responsibility of the region to determine the risk involved in going to Ad without the completed permit, in accordance with the Advertisement and Award Manual. Refer to the Design Manual and Environmental Manual for more information on types of permits and associated requirements. 700.01(12) Training Goals
The bid item for “Training” is to be provided on most federal-aid projects. For projects with federal-aid dollars, 23 CFR Part 230.111 requires all state highway agencies to review projects to determine their ability to support the inclusion of “Training Special Provisions” hours. The training goals, in terms of the total number of training hours required, are established by the
HQ External Civil Rights Office. The number of training hours, if assigned to a project, is based on the following: • Total estimated project labor hours • Availability of minorities, women, and other disadvantaged individuals • Potential for effective training • Duration of the contract • Dollar value of the contract • Anticipated workforce size • Project location • Scopes of work
The region may submit a training recommendation for consideration by the HQ External Civil
Rights Office. If the region is submitting a training recommendation, it needs to provide an estimation of total projected project labor hours.
Note: If you have any questions regarding either of the two programs referred to above, please contact the WSDOT Office of Equal Opportunity at 360-705-7090. 700.01(13) Assigning the Risk
It is important that the contractor be able to determine whether the risks on the project will be the contractor’s responsibility or will be borne by WSDOT. In most cases, it is best to assign the risk to WSDOT. This keeps the contractor from having to inflate bid prices to offset the possible risks of doing the work. These inflated prices cost WSDOT extra dollars when the problem does not materialize.

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 7
Miscellaneous Contract Considerations • For example, do not say, “The contractor may encounter obstructions during the excavation.” The contractor has to assume that obstructions will be encountered and that they will be the contractor’s problem when they are. The unit price for the excavation will include the cost of obstruction removal, and WSDOT will pay for the removal even if there are no obstructions encountered. • Instead say, “If obstructions are encountered during excavation, the Engineer will pay for the removal of the obstruction in accordance with Section 1-09.4 of the Standard
Specifications.” Now the contractor can bid the actual cost of doing the excavation work and be confident that if something out of the ordinary is encountered, the cost of removal will be dealt with fairly, and if there are no obstructions encountered, there is no cost to
WSDOT. 700.01(14) Agreements
An agreement (for the purpose of this section) is a written contract between WSDOT and another party or parties (public, private, or both) establishing an exchange of benefits and/or obligations.
Another party may be financially responsible for some of the work in WSDOT’s contract, such as the construction of sidewalks, utility installations, signal systems, pavement markings, intersection improvements, and so on.
Agreements that include work that WSDOT’s contractor will perform, or work performed by others that WSDOT will reimburse a third party for, need to be addressed by Standard
Specifications or in the project Special Provisions.
Ensure that the quantities, bid item names, units of measurement, and prices in the agreement are the same as those in the PS&E.
Each bid item needs to be set up with a separate bid item name and placed in a separate group in the Summary of Quantities. If a nonstandard bid item is used, a project-specific provision will be required with prior approval from the Assistant State Construction Engineer. Each bid item needs to be addressed, clearly, in the Standard Specifications or Special Provisions.
When preparing the estimate of cost for an agreement for work under the contract that is the financial responsibility of an outside agency, include mobilization, engineering, and contingencies.
Complete and sign all agreements necessary for the project before the project is advertised. If this cannot be accomplished, it is the responsibility of the region to determine the risk involved in going to Ad without the completed agreement, in accordance with the Advertisement and
Award Manual.
See the Agreements Manual for guidance on agreement elements, structure and processes or contact region personnel responsible for processing agreements or the HQ Utilities, Railroad, and Agreements Section. 700.01(14)(a)

Haul Road and Detour Agreements
When the project provides a materials source, or requires traffic to be detoured from the state highway, the region may be required to acquire agreements with the owners of the roads that will be used as the haul road or the detour route. (See the Haul Road/Detour Agreements chapter in the Agreements Manual for guidance.) The process of generating an agreement should be started as early in the design phase as possible. Discuss with region personnel
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 7-9 Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
Division 7 responsible for processing agreements. The lack of a completed agreement may cause a project
Ad date to be delayed. It is the responsibility of the region to determine the risk involved in going to Ad without the completed agreement, in accordance with the Advertisement and
The agreement will normally provide compensation to the owner of the haul road or detour for damage done to the road by the hauling equipment or by the extra traffic on the roadway. The compensation may be in the form of work to be done under the contract to bring the roads back to precontract conditions, or the owner may be paid a cash settlement and would be responsible for making the repairs.
All haul roads and detours are to be clearly shown and labeled on the Vicinity Map. 700.01(15) Vehicle Weight Limitations Within Project Boundaries
Review each individual project to determine whether the vehicles employed in the construction that exceed the gross weight limitations, per RCW 46.44, can be tolerated.
When existing bridges or major drainage structures are involved, obtain overweight clearance from the HQ Bridge and Structures Office and include it in the Project File.
Use the information in the Standard Specifications section 1-07.7, or include the appropriate
GSP in the contract provisions, to inform the contractor of the load limit restrictions for the project.

700.01(16) Working Days
Give careful consideration to the number of working days allowed for a project. Too many working days can cause as many problems as not enough working days.
The following are example considerations for working days that can make a difference between a one and two season project. Evaluate working days with these types of restrictions in mind. •
The time of advertisement •
Materials procurement time •
Restrictions to the duration and when closures can occur •
Water work windows restrictions
The determination of working days for the different work items is to be based on production rates and other considerations (see the Appendices). Using the time required for the individual work items, the Critical Path Method (CPM) (see Appendix 6) is then used to determine how the project work will fit together, and the total number of working days will be determined.
The working days required for bridge construction are to be coordinated with the working days required for the other construction.
Place the CPM in the Project File.

Miscellaneous Contract Considerations 700.01(17) Liquidated Damages 700.01(17)(a)
HQ Construction Office Approval Required
Liquidated damages are monies assessed or withheld from the contractor’s payment for failure to complete the project within a specified period of time. Liquidated damages are not to be considered a penalty, but reimbursement for the costs to the contracting agency for the contractor’s failure to perform within the time frame of the project.
There are two types of liquidated damages to be considered for a project: 1. Contract Time-Related Liquidated Damages
Liquidated Damages are calculated for each WSDOT Design-Bid-Build project for failure to complete the physical work within the allotted contract time. Liquidated Damages are not to b
