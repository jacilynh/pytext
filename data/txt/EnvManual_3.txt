y context for terms in this chapter. The associated links provide technical definitions. These terms may have other meanings in other chapters. Many of the terms below are included in the definitions in Title 33 Navigation and Navigable Waters, Part 332 Compensatory Mitigation for Losses of Aquatic Resources: 33 CFR § 332.2. Advance Mitigation – Compensatory mitigation that is accepted by regulatory authorities as being established before an impact occurs. This is a form of permittee -responsible mitigation. Buffer – An upland, wetland, or riparian area that protects or enhances wetlands or aquatic resource functions from disturbances associated with adjacent land uses. Compensatory Mitigation – The restoration (re-establishment or rehabilitation), establishment (creation), enhancement, or in certain circumstances preservation of wetlands or other aquatic resources for the purposes of offsetting unavoidable adverse impacts which remain after all appropriate and practicable avoidance and minimization has been achieved. Enhancement – Changing a wetland to improve specific aquatic resource functions. Enhancement results in a gain in aquatic function but does not result in a gain in wetland area. 
Chapter 431
Wetlands and other waters
Establishment – Converting an upland area to a wetland or other aquatic resource. Establishment results in a gain in wetland area and functions. (Equivalent to the term ‘creation’ used previously.) Impact – Adverse effect, whether direct, indirect, temporary, or cumulative. Typical adverse effects to wetlands or other waters include filling, draining, altering natural drainage patterns, increasing or decreasing water levels, discharging sediment or toxicants from runoff, mechanically removing wetland vegetation, altering wetland or stream buffers, or compacting wetland soils. In-Lieu Fee Program – A program administered by a governmental or nonprofit natural resources management entity that provides compensatory mitigation and sells mitigation credits. With regulatory approval, the obligation to provide compensatory mitigation is transferred from the permittee to the in-lieu fee entity when the credit purchase is complete. Mitigation – Avoiding adverse impacts to wetlands, streams and other aquatic resources, where practical; minimizing unavoidable impacts; and compensating for all remaining unavoidable impacts. Mitigation Bank – A property developed for the purpose of providing compensatory mitigation in advance of authorized impacts to aquatic resources where wetlands are established, restored, enhanced, or preserved. A mitigation bank may sell credits to and assume the mitigation obligations of third parties. With regulatory approval, the mitigation obligation is transferred when the credit purchase is finalized. Mitigation Sequence – An ordered approach to mitigation that involves analyzing the affected environment, determining the effects of projects, avoiding and minimizing adverse impacts, and compensating for the remaining unavoidable impacts. Permittee-Responsible Mitigation – Compensatory mitigation for which the permittee retains full responsibility. Preservation – Removing a threat to or preventing a decline of aquatic resources by implementing legal or physical mechanisms to provide permanent protection. Preservation does not result in a gain of wetland area or functions. Restoration – Changing a site so natural or historic functions are returned to a former or degraded wetland. For tracking net gains in wetland area, restoration is divided into Re-establishment and Rehabilitation. Re-establishment results in a gain in wetland area; rehabilitation results in a gain in aquatic resource function, but not in area. Waters of the state – Lakes, rivers, ponds, streams, inland waters, underground waters, salt waters and all other surface waters and watercourses within the jurisdiction of the state of Washington (RCW 90.48.020).
Wetlands and other waters
Chapter 431
Waters of the United States – Briefly, all waters that are: 1. Used in interstate commerce, including tidally influenced waters. 2. Interstate waters including interstate wetlands. 3. All other waters such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams (including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, playa lakes, or natural ponds. 4. Some impoundments. 5. Tributaries of the above. 6. Territorial seas. 7. Wetlands adjacent to waters. 8. Excludes prior converted croplands and waste treatment ponds. Wetland – In general, wetlands are areas that are normally wet enough to support plants typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Washington State and federal jurisdictional definitions of wetlands are slightly different. Wetland and Stream Assessment Report – Describes the location, classification, ratings and functional assessment for each wetland based on field work by a qualified wetland biologist and a land survey. The project area for this report should include all potential work areas so the report does not have to be updated unless the project area changes. Wetland and Stream Mitigation Plan – Describes measures taken to avoid and minimize wetland impacts and the way compensatory mitigation will be accomplished. This plan may have several iterations and levels of detail depending on the stage of design and discussions with regulatory agencies. It is finalized as permits are issued, and often is incorporated into the permit conditions. Wetland Discipline Report – Uses the wetland boundaries and categories in the Wetland and Stream Assessment Report and the project footprint for each alternative to estimate impacts to wetlands and other waters. It may be updated as design modifications change the adverse impacts. Wetland Reconnaissance Memo – Describes the presence or absence of wetlands based on a brief field visit. The project area for this report should include the potential work areas for all alternatives.

432.01 Introduction This chapter addresses the potential impact of WSDOT projects on special flood hazard areas. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), requires that all actions sponsored, funded, permitted, or approved by federal agencies undergo planning to ensure that environmental considerations are given due weight in project decision making. For work in special flood hazard areas that requires permit approval, environmental documentation must explain the impacts the project will have on these areas, and on the resources within those areas. The State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), mandates a similar procedure for state and local actions. The primary concern with floodplain is increasing the frequency or severity of flooding caused by obstructing flood flows or filling floodplain storage. Flood flows are obstructed by under sizing hydraulic structures or blocking natural flow paths causing flood water to back up behind the highway. Filling floodplain storage also increases flooding by reducing the floodplain attenuation of peak flows. Consequently, all WSDOT projects that encroach upon a regulatory special flood hazard area must have a floodplain discipline report. In addition, during the design process, the Project Engineer must also develop a Specialty Hydraulics Report, to evaluate the project’s potential effects on the floodplain and floodway. The WSDOT Floodplain Discipline Report Checklist includes floodplain issues to be addressed in project development, and sources of information. Other references, documents, MOUs, Interagency Agreements, and permits included in this chapter add relevant details. The Hydraulics Manual M 23-03 provides details and requirements for preparing the Specialty Hydraulics Report. Process guidance documents “Flood Risk Assessment Process for WSDOT Fish Passage Projects (Exhibit 432-2)” and “Outreach to Local Governments on Flood Risk Assessment for WSDOT Fish Passage Projects (Exhibit 432-3)” have been prepared and are discussed further in Sections 432.04 and 432.05, respectively. The current versions of the documents have been attached as exhibits in Section 432.11.

432.03 Considerations during project development The level of analysis for special flood hazard areas changes with the stage of project development. Analysis maybe very generalized and qualitative for during planning and become very detailed and quantitative during design.
432.03(1)
Planning
During the planning phase of a project it is expected that the project planners identify special flood hazard areas. EO 11988 requires that floodplains be avoided when practicable, consequently documentation is required to demonstrate that alternatives have been considered to minimize floodplain impacts. Local floodplain development permit requirements should also be identified.
432.03(2)
Scoping
During the scoping process it is expected that project engineers are considering project designs that accommodate floodplain issues that were identified in the planning stage. These considerations include sizing hydraulics structures to minimize flood flow obstruction, identifying locations that may need to be acquired for compensatory storage. It is also expected that project engineers will consult with the ESO Fish Passage Program to determine if hydraulic structures are located on fish bearing water courses that will require specialized design to ensure fish passage.
432.03(3)
Design
During the design process it is expected that project engineers and HQ Hydraulics Section will be working together, to provide a quantitative analysis of the project impacts on floodplains including changes in flood flows, sizing of hydraulics structures and provisions for compensatory storage if needed. In addition, the design team shall consider the effects of scour and climate change to ensure the project is resilient to changes that may occur over the design life of the project. The design team is also responsible for preparation of the technical engineering materials to support the Federal, State and local permits from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the US Army Corps of Engineers, the US Coast Guard, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, as well as the local jurisdiction.
432.03(4)
Construction
There are no construction requirements for Floodplains. However, if a project requires a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) or Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) As-Built survey data is required to comply with the local permits.
432.03(5)
Maintenance and Operations
There are no maintenance and operations requirements for Floodplains.

432.04 Analysis & documentation requirements This section describes analysis and documentation requirements based on regulatory requirements. Determine level of detail based on complexity/size of project, expected severity of impacts, and potential for public controversy.
432.04(1)
Analysis & documentation for NEPA
A Floodplain Discipline Report must be completed whenever a proposed project intersects with, or is located in, a special flood hazard area, particularly when the placement of new fill, structures, in-water structures (such as wood, barbs or weirs), bridges, channel modifications or re-locations are involved within a floodway. The WSDOT Floodplain Discipline Report Checklist ensures that floodplain issues are considered in the design of projects. The discipline report should provide the information required for an EIS, EA, or CE, and for floodplain development permits. The extent of analysis should be proportionate to the level of impact without over analyzing or providing unnecessary information. The checklist includes these sections: 1. Introduction and preliminary drainage survey. 2. Affected environment, shown mainly by mapping regulatory floodplains. 3. Studies and coordination including flood history, climate impacts vulnerability assessment and identification of permits required. 4. Summary. The summary should include enough detail so it can be included in an EIS with only minor modification. The 1998 FHWA Environmental Flowchart on Floodplains (Exhibit 432-1) provides an overview of floodplain issues.
432.04(2)
Analysis & documentation for SEPA only (No federal nexus)
The requirements are the same as federal.
432.04(3)
Analysis & documentation for local floodplain development permits
As described further in Section 432.07, local floodplain development ordinances are the key regulatory instrument governing floodplain management. Local ordinances must comply with minimum federal standards set by FEMA in the NFIP; however, local jurisdictions may adopt more stringent regulations. This process is described in Sections 432.05 and 432.07 and the current guidance documents are attached as Exhibits 432-2, 432-3 and 432-6. However, HQ Hydraulics Section should be contacted to obtain the most up to date guidance.
Chapter 432
Special Flood Hazard Area
432.05 External engagement Floodplain impacts follow the standard NEPA/SEPA scoping, public noticing, accepting agency and public comments, and responding to comments appropriate to the level of the environmental review process. However, all floodplain development requires to follow the FEMA Procedures for No-Rise Certification For Proposed Developments in the Regulatory Floodway guidance document. In addition, external engagement may, however, inform the development of the projects as other resources such as cultural, wetland, and farmland are commonly found in floodplains. Altering the floodplain may also trigger Environmental Justice concerns. It is necessary, however, to engage the local floodplain management agency early in the development process to determine what is necessary to obtain a floodplain development permit in the affected community. Generally, the special flood hazard area that the project encroaches upon determines the levels of analysis required to obtain a floodplain development permit. WSDOT has developed a special flood risk assessment process for fish passage projects (Exhibit 432-2) along with companion guidance for outreach to local government (Exhibit 432-3). This guidance lays out a process for the Regions to reach out to local governments about fish passage projects that have been identified within their jurisdiction. The Regions should share the fish passage delivery plan with the local government representatives and discuss the FEMA effective FIRMs for each crossing in their jurisdiction, WDSOT’s flood risk assessment process, and WSDOT’s hydraulic modeling approach. As fish passage projects are developed, the Regions should meet with the local jurisdictions, as needed, throughout the design process to share modeling results; zero rise analyses; CLOMR and LOMR processes, if needed and the overall floodplain development permitting approach.
432.06 Internal roles and responsibilities 432.06(1)
Region/Modal Environmental Manager
The Region/Modal environmental manager’s role is to oversee the general preparation of environmental review documents, providing expert guidance to Region staff to as to the type of analysis needed and identifying need for specialized analysis. The manager provides quality assurance and quality control. The manager is responsible for disseminating new or updated guidance and verifying that the guidance is being followed. The manger is also responsible for reporting to ESO when guidance is not adequate, confusing, or in need of revision.
432.06(2)
Project Engineer
It is the project engineer’s role and responsibility to oversee that all engineering studies and technical reports are prepared consistent with Hydraulics Manual M 23-03 and provide appropriate levels of analysis to support the environmental review process and permitting activities to the environmental staff. It is also the Project Engineers responsibility to reach out to local floodplain development managers to secure floodplain development permits.
Special Flood Hazard Area
432.06(3)
Chapter 432
Region Environmental Coordinator
The region environmental coordinator role is to oversee the development of the environmental review documents. The coordinator is responsible to for exchange of information between the project engineer and the environmental review specialists on the team and to ensure that any environmental requirements are incorporated into the project design as well as engineering information needed for permits and other agency approvals is provided.
432.06(4)
ESO
ESO role is primarily to keep the guidance current with evolving and changing rules and regulations. ESO staff also provide expert assistance for developing scopes of work for consultants and internal WSDOT staff as well as reviewing floodplain discipline reports and environmental review documents.
432.06(5)
Headquarters Hydraulics Section
HQ Hydraulics role is to provide guidance to project engineers, other WSDOT engineering staff, and consultants in the preparation of hydrologic and hydraulic analyses as described in Chapter 1 of the HM and HQ Hydraulics Section also prepares specialized hydraulic studies and reviews consultant work products for concurrence by the State Hydraulic Engineer. HQ Hydraulics oversees the preparation of Preliminary and Final Hydraulic Design (PHD and FHD) for fish passage projects. The PHD or flood risk assessment technical memorandum is used to coordinate with local agency floodplain managers to facilitate the floodplain development permit process. Floodplain mitigation measures (compensatory storage or larger structures), if needed, would be included in the FHD.
432.07 Applicable permits & approval process Local floodplain development ordinances are the key regulatory instrument governing floodplain management. Local ordinances must comply with minimum federal standards set by FEMA in the NFIP; however, local jurisdictions may adopt more stringent regulations. The specifics of each permit are unique to each community. For more information on the permitting process, see Chapter 500.
432.08 Mitigation The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) prohibits encroachments within the regulatory floodway unless it can be demonstrated that the proposed encroachments would not increase the 100-year flood levels. Hydraulic and hydrologic analysis is required to document a No-Rise Certification. Some local jurisdictions are also adding “compensatory storage” requirements to their floodplain ordinances. These statutes require the excavation of floodplain storage areas to compensate for fill placed in floodplains. They may also stipulate elevation requirements for the location of the compensatory storage area.

432.10 Glossary Avulsion – A sudden, dramatic shift of the river into a new course or channel. Base Flood Elevation (BFE) – The elevation of surface water resulting from a flood that has a 1% chance of equaling or exceeding that level in any given year. The BFE is shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) for zones AE, AH, A1–A30, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1– A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, V1–V30 and VE. Compensatory Storage – The NFIP floodway standard in 44CFR 60.3 (d) restricts new development from obstructing the flow of water and increasing flood heights. However, this provision does not address the need to maintain flood storage. Especially in flat areas, the floodplain provides a valuable function by storing floodwaters. When fill or buildings are placed in the flood fringe, the flood storage areas are lost and flood heights will go up because there is less room for the floodwaters. This is particularly important in smaller watersheds which respond sooner to changes in the topography. Community – 1. A group of people living in the same locality and under the same government, or a political subdivision of a state or other authority that has zoning and building code jurisdiction over a particular area. 2. A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction. 3. A network of individuals and families, businesses, governmental and nongovernmental organizations and other civic organizations that reside or operate within a shared geographical boundary and may be represented by a common political leadership Flood – A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of 2 or more acres of normally dry land area or of 2 or more properties (at least 1 of which is the policyholder’s property) from: 1. Overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 2. Unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; or
Special Flood Hazard Area
Chapter 432
3. Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current.; or 4. Collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or similar body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels that result in a flood as defined above. A flood inundates a floodplain. Most floods fall into three major categories: riverine flooding, coastal flooding, and shallow flooding. Alluvial fan flooding is another type of flooding more common in the mountainous western states. Floodplain – Any land area susceptible to being inundated by flood waters from any source; usually the flat or nearly flat land on the bottom of a stream valley or tidal area that is covered by water during floods. Floodplain Boundaries – Lines on flood hazard maps that show the limits of the 100- and 500-year floodplains. Floodway – A “Regulatory Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. Communities must regulate development in these floodways to ensure that there are no increases in upstream flood elevations. Regulatory Floodplain – The currently effective floodplain that has been mapped under the NFIP. Special Flood Hazard Area – An area having special flood, mudflow or flood-related erosion hazards and shown on a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or a Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, AH, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AR/A1-A30, V1-V30, VE or V. The SFHA is the area where the National Flood Insurance Program’s (NFIP’s) floodplain management regulations must be enforced and the area where the mandatory purchase of flood insurance applies. For the purpose of determining Community Rating System (CRS) premium discounts, all AR and A99 zones are treated as non-SFHAs. Zone A – Areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event generally determined using approximate methodologies. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) or flood depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and floodplain management standards apply. Zones AE and A1 A30 – Areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and floodplain management standards apply. Zone AH – Areas subject to inundation by 1-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet. Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and floodplain management standards apply.
Chapter 432
Special Flood Hazard Area
Zone AO – Areas subject to inundation by 1-percent-annual-chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and floodplain management standards apply. Some Zone AO have been designated in areas with high flood velocities such as alluvial fans and washes. Communities are encouraged to adopt more restrictive requirements for these areas. Zone AR – Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and floodplain management standards apply. Zone A99 – Areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction Federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) or depths are shown. Zone V – Areas along coasts subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event with additional hazards associated with storm-induced waves. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) or flood depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and floodplain management standards apply. Zone VE and V1-30 – Areas subject to inundation by the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event with additional hazards due to storm-induced velocity wave action. Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and floodplain management standards apply. indicates additional coastal flooding hazards such as storm waves. Study is detailed and BFEs are shown. Zone X, B (moderate-rise zones) – An area of moderate flood hazard that is determined to be outside the Special Flood Hazard Area between the limits of the base flood and the 0.2-percent-annual-chance (or 500-year) flood. Zone X, C (low-rise zones) – An area of minimal flood hazard that is determined to be outside the Special Flood Hazard Area and higher than the elevation of the 0.2-percentannual-chance (or 500-year) flood.

Flood Risk Assessment Process for WSDOT Fish Passage Projects
Per the Coordination Meeting between Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Washington State Department of Ecology and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife on 12/15/20, consult HQ Hydraulics Office’s Preliminary Hydraulic Design (PHD) Tracking spreadsheet for preliminary determination of special flood hazard area (SFHA) zone (check status here: HQ PHD STATUS). Begin coordination with local governments (locals) for all WSDOT Fish Passage projects early in the process and on-going during the PHD development. Confirm WSDOT’s assessment of whether the project is within a FEMA regulatory floodway or SFHA zone and/or will require a floodplain development permit with the locals. Also, confirm the local floodplain management codes for flood risk assessment methodology with the locals. For more guidance on reaching out to locals, refer to WSDOT’s Outreach to Local Governments on Flood Risk Assessment for WSDOT Fish Passage Projects. 1. HQ Hydraulics completes an internal flood hazard memo after the draft PHD. This memo defines the FEMA floodway classification and informs the region of flood hazard risks. (Note: memo completed for all projects.) This memo is for the project team to assess project risks to make decisions; this memo can be used to coordinate with locals, but it is not official documentation for permitting. 2. For projects within FEMA regulatory floodways based on FEMA’s effective flood maps (e.g., Floodway Zone AE): a. HQ Hydraulics conducts no-rise analysis based on FEMA’s standards.1 b. If there is no rise in Base Flood Elevation (BFE): i.
Region requests that the local review and approve the no-rise certification.
ii. Region submits floodplain development permit application to the local (if required per local code). c. If there is a reduction in BFE OR changes to the extent of the floodway: i.
Region submits floodplain development permit application to the local.
ii. HQ Hydraulics submits Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) to FEMA through the local after construction is completed based on as-built conditions.2 d. If there is a rise in BFE: i.
Region submits floodplain development permit application to the local and HQ Hydraulics submits Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) application to FEMA through the local.3
ii. HQ Hydraulics submits LOMR to FEMA through the local after construction is completed based on as-built conditions.2

3. For projects not in a regulatory floodway, but in a SFHA based on FEMA’s effective flood maps (e.g., Floodplain Zone A): a. HQ Hydraulics establishes the existing conditions model and conducts no-rise analysis based on floodplain impacts not greater than 1 foot from existing conditions model.1 (Note: Locals may have a more restrictive requirement.) b. If there is no rise above 1 foot: i.
Region requests that the local review and approve the no-rise certification.
ii. Region submits a floodplain development permit application to the local (if required per local code). c. If there is a reduction in the existing condition elevation OR changes to the extent of the floodplain: i.
Region submits floodplain development permit application to the local.
ii. HQ Hydraulics submits LOMR if requested to FEMA through the local after construction is completed based on as-built conditions.2 d. If there is a rise above 1 foot: i.
Region submits a floodplain development permit application to the local and HQ Hydraulics submits CLOMR application to FEMA through the local.3
ii. HQ Hydraulics submits LOMR to FEMA through the local after construction is completed based on as-built conditions.2

Outreach to Local Governments on Flood Risk Assessment for WSDOT Fish Passage Projects
WSDOT’s Flood Risk Assessment Process for WSDOT Fish Passage Projects includes coordinating with local governments early in project development (refer to the process document for more information regarding floodplain analysis). Note: pursuing a floodplain development permit does not preclude a project from qualifying for a Fish Habitat Enhancement Project (FHEP) hydraulic project approval (HPA). The following are suggested talking points and considerations for coordination with local governments:
• Prepare for outreach with the local government (local): – Region reviews FEMA’s effective flood maps at each barrier site to determine if it’s within a FEMA regulatory floodway or special flood hazard area (SFHA) zone by doing the following:
• For sites that have a Preliminary Hydraulic Design (PHD) started, check status here: HQ PHD STATUS.
• For other sites, check with HQ Hydraulics. – Region reviews the local code. It is important to note whether the local’s floodplain development regulations fall under their Critical Areas Ordinance (CAO). If the flood regulations are included within the CAO and the project ultimately qualifies for FHEP, the project will apply for a floodplain development permit but should not be subject to any other local permits. – Prior to meeting with the local, it is recommended to have a prep meeting that includes the PEO, HQ Hydraulics, and Region Environmental to discuss the agenda for meeting with the local. Suggested topics include:
• Project overview
• WSDOT’s Flood Risk Assessment Process and modeling approach with SRH2D
• Permitting approach – The sooner the Region engages with the local, the better, to keep the hydraulic work progressing.
• When reaching out to the local, request that the local’s floodplain manager attend the meetings.
• Initially provide the local with a list of upcoming projects within their jurisdiction. Update the list as needed and refer to the list as the projects develop. Contact the ESO Fish Passage Delivery Team for any questions on the delivery plan.
• If the local says that a project does NOT need a floodplain development permit, contact ESO Permitting & Compliance Program Manager regarding next steps.
• For projects within a FEMA regulatory floodway or SFHA, coordinate with the local throughout the no-rise analysis and CLOMR or LOMR (if needed) processes, as well as the floodplain development permitting process. For reference:

436.01 Introduction Sensitive wildlife, fish, plants, and their habitat require special consideration during project planning and development. Many federal, state, and local regulations apply to projects that may affect natural resources. The Washington State Department of Transportation’s (WSDOT) policy is to follow and comply with all federal and state mandated regulations (RCW 47.04.280). Therefore, WSDOT biologists are involved in all stages of project development, evaluating potential adverse effects and recommending impact avoidance or minimization measures. Projects with a federal nexus, meaning they have federal funding, requires a federal permit, or takes place on federal lands, must follow the most prominent laws; the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). All projects, regardless of funding source, must comply with Section 9 of the ESA, the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) (RCW 43.21C), Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA), and local ordinances. Ferry, rail, airport, or non-motorized transport systems are subject to the same policies, procedures, and permits that apply to road systems, but are generally funded under different authorities such as Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Federal Railway Administration (FRA), or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Each of these federal agencies may have slightly different approaches for document preparation, review, and submittal procedures or overall process goals and directives regarding fish, wildlife, and vegetation resources. Washington State Ferries (WSF) must follow strict guidelines to work in nearshore environments (see Section 436.06). These guidelines include avoidance of eelgrass and forage fish spawning habitat, restrictions on construction materials, and specific Best Management Practices (BMPs) for removal of creosote treated wood associated with docks, pilings, and piers. In addition, some regulations may be more applicable to non-road projects. For example, ferry projects occur within marine waters and require consideration of regulations under the MMPA and the Shoreline Protection Act. Public use airports must address specific wildlife hazards on or near airports. These issues are addressed in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Publication, Hazardous Wildlife Attractants On or Near Airports (No. 150/5200-33B, August 28, 2007). The main focus of this chapter is to summarize regulations associated with fish, wildlife, and vegetation resources

436.03 Considerations during project development 436.03(1)
Planning
Sensitive wildlife, fish, plants, and their habitat require special consideration during project planning. Many federal, state, and local regulations apply to projects that may affect natural resources. Some considerations include timing restrictions to avoid or minimize project effects to species, and anticipated time to complete ESA consultation. Based on the location and preliminary nature of the project, many environmental issues can be anticipated. During scoping, the Environmental Coordinator and Project Biologist may be able to determine
Fish, wildlife and vegetation
Chapter 436
whether the project will be covered by a USFWS/NMFS programmatic consultation or will require an individual consultation. Depending on the project, the Fish and Wildlife Program may prepare a Habitat Connectivity memorandum for the region.
436.03(2)
Scoping
During the Scoping phase, the Project Biologist will determine those state and federal regulations that will likely apply to the project. Bridge projects often require a bird management plan to comply with the MBTA. Projects with in-water pile driving may require a monitoring plan to determine if predicted noise levels are accurate. In marine waters, projects that generate underwater noise will likely require an MMPA Incidental Harassment Authorization for marine mammals. If your project requires a HPA permit, see if your project qualifies for any existing GHPAs.
436.03(3)
Design
The Project Biologist works closely with the Project Engineer obtain details regarding stormwater design, new pollution generating impervious surface, pile driving and other project elements that may affect species and habitats. It is during the Design phase that the Project Biologist conducts early coordination with USFWS/NMFS liaisons. These initial pre-BA meetings are coordinated and facilitated by the Fish and Wildlife Program. The programmatic form or an individual BA are prepared by the biologist during this phase and submitted by the region. The programmatic consistency finding, letter of concurrence, or biological opinion must be received prior to construction. Many I-4 fish passage and chronic environmental deficiency project qualify for WDFW’s Fish Habitat Enhancement Process (FHEP). FHEP is a streamlined process that does not require SEPA or local permits or, except for Floodplain Development permits. WDFW requires applicants to submit a FHEP sponsorship letter and a form for most FHEP projects. However, WDFW does not require FHEP sponsorship letters and FHEP cover sheet for WSDOTsponsored fish passage barrier removal FHEP projects that are on WDFW fish passage list. If applicable, the biologist must also prepare an MMPA application and receive the IHA prior to construction. Similarly, coordination with the USFWS regarding the MBTA and BGEPA must be completed prior to construction.
436.03(4)
Construction
Projects that require in-water work nearly always include work site isolation and moving fish out of the work area. In marine waters, MMPA compliance usually includes marine mammal monitoring. The Project Biologist is responsible for coordinating these efforts. Other requirements may include implementation of bird protection plans and monitoring specific habitat enhancement measures such as large wood placement in a stream. The Project Biologist is responsible for reinitiating ESA consultation if, among other things, the project changes significantly, allocated take limits are exceeded, or when a new species is proposed for listing. WSDOT activities need to follow the Hydraulic Code in RCW 77.55 and HPA permit provisions. Details of the Hydraulic Code WAC only apply when the HB includes them within the HPA provisions. If compliance issues arise, WDFW first seeks voluntary compliance when issues arise through education and technical assistance through HPA early coordination, the permit application process, and onsite compliance and technical visits. WDFW can perform 
Chapter 436
Fish, wildlife and vegetation
compliance inspections without notification (WDFW-WSDOT Hydraulic Code MOA). When voluntary compliance does not occur, WDFW may use a range of increasingly strict enforcement rules which ranges from issuing notices of correction and stop work orders to penalties. Additional details about these tools are available in WAC 220-660-480. WDFW’s HPA Compliance Program complements WSDOT’s existing Environmental Compliance Assurance Procedure (ECAP) process. Our agencies have a long history of working well together when non-compliance issues arise during construction and maintenance activities. We anticipate this will continue as WSDOT staff continue to follow ECAP and closely collaborate with WDFW when potential HPA non-compliance issues arise.
436.03(5)
Maintenance and Operations
In some situations, a Maintenance activity may require a separate ESA consultation and other environmental permitting. Maintenance activities that may affect freshwater habitats are usually covered under the 4(d) rule. In terrestrial areas where potential disturbance to listed species may occur, the Fish and Wildlife Program has prepared species specific BMPs that avoid or minimize impacts to sensitive wildlife and vegetation. There are no Operations phase requirements for Fish, Wildlife, and Vegetation.
436.04 Analysis & documentation requirements This section describes analysis and documentation requirements based on regulatory requirements. Determine level of detail based on complexity/size of project, expected severity of impacts, and potential for public controversy.
436.04(1)
Analysis & documentation for NEPA
NEPA, 42 USC 4321, requires that all major actions sponsored, funded, permitted, or approved by federal agencies undergo planning to ensure that environmental considerations such as impacts related to fish and wildlife are given due weight in decision making. Federal implementing regulations are at 23 CFR 771 (FHWA) and 40 CFR 1500-1508 (NEPA). WSDOT’s policy is to follow all guidance and direction provided by the federal lead agency on NEPA related documents. The analysis of impacts to fish, wildlife and vegetation can be recorded directly in the project’s environmental document. In rare cases when warranted by the nature of the project, the analysis can be documented in separate Fish, Wildlife, and Vegetation discipline reports. Templates and checklists provide document requirements for WSDOT projects. For additional details on NEPA procedures see Chapters 400 and 412.
436.04(2)
Analysis & documentation for SEPA only (No federal nexus)
WSDOT typically documents SEPA as part of the NEPA documentation when both NEPA and SEPA are required. Find step-by-step guidance for compliance with SEPA rules in the Washington State Department of Ecology’s (Ecology) SEPA Handbook. For additional details Chapter 400.

436.04(3)
Chapter 436
Analysis & documentation for ESA
Both the state and federal agencies regulate threatened and endangered species in Washington. WSDOT complies with the ESA, which is administered by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). The USFWS is primarily responsible for terrestrial and freshwater species, while NMFS responsibilities lie mainly with marine wildlife and anadromous fish. Significant sections of the Act include:
• Section 4 of the ESA allows for the listing of species as threatened or endangered based on habitat loss or degradation, over utilization, disease or predation, inadequacy of existing regulation mechanisms, or other human caused factors. Section 4(d) allows for the promulgation of regulations to provide for the protection and conservation of listed species. It may allow for “take” of threatened species. In , NMFS adopted a rule under Section 4(d) of the ESA (65 FR 42422), which allows take of threatened fish species. Under this rule, the take prohibition is not applied to threatened species when the take is associated with one of NMFS’s 13 approved programs or limits. The 13 limits can be considered exceptions to the 4(d) take prohibition. NMFS has determined that these programs, activities, and criteria contribute to species conservation and therefore it is not necessary to impose take prohibitions. NMFS updates the rule to include new species listed as threatened. The rule applies to any agency, authority, or private individual subject to U.S. jurisdiction that applies for coverage under the rule. In 2003, WSDOT applied for and received approval as part of the Regional Road Maintenance Program (RRMP) for take exception under the 4(d) rule. WSDOT’s routine, unscheduled, and emergency/disaster maintenance activities are covered under the Routine Road Maintenance limit along with 29 other cooperating agencies. The program defines general practices (such as adaptive management, monitoring, and training) and specific Best Management Practices that WSDOT uses to avoid adverse effects to aquatic environments.
• Section 7 of the ESA requires each federal agency to ensure actions it carries out, authorizes, permits, or funds do not jeopardize the continued existence of any threatened or endangered species. It describes consultation procedures and conservation obligations. All projects with a federal nexus are subject to Section 7 of the ESA and an analysis is required to ensure compliance with the ESA. The project biologist – either a WSDOT biologist or a consulting biologist – conducts a preliminary evaluation to determine the level of project effects on listed species or designated critical habitat. Depending on the level of effect, preparation of a “no effect” letter or a biological assessment (BA) will be required. Templates are required for projects with FHWA as the lead action agency. WSDOT has developed extensive guidance and protocols for ESA Section 7 Compliance. There are three primary types of documentation that can be completed: No Effect Letter or Assessment, Programmatic Biological Assessment, or Individual Biological Assessment. For each listed species evaluated, a BA must arrive at one of three conclusions:
• The action will have “no effect” on the species.
• The action “may affect, not likely to adversely affect” the species.
• The action “may affect, likely to adversely affect” the species. BAs prepared for WSDOT must follow specific guidance developed through cooperative agreements and in collaboration with FHWA, NMFS, and USFWS. The guidance standardizes analyses, improves consistency and facilitates quality control reviews. The 
Chapter 436
Fish, wildlife and vegetation
guidance is updated regularly and the website should be checked regularly for current guidance. Guidance includes:
• BA Preparation Seminars taught regularly by WSDOT.
• Consulting biologists on contract with WSDOT must be qualified to write BAs for WSDOT.
• Required methods for analyzing the effects of stormwater on ESA listed fish species.
• Identifying the extent of aquatic and terrestrial noise effects.
• Required method for analyzing delayed consequences of a project. BAs are submitted to the appropriate Service (USFWS or NMFS) depending on the species addressed. A non-federal agency (such as WSDOT) designated by a federal action agency may submit a BA for informal consultation. During informal consultation, the Service reviews the BA and ascertains if they concur with the effect determination conclusions. If the agency concurs in writing, then no further consultation is needed. The agency may request additional information before giving concurrence and the project biologist should respond to such requests within two weeks. However, if the Service does not concur with the effect determinations, the consultation enters formal consultation at the request of the federal action agency. Formal consultation involves a “may affect, likely to adversely affect” determination for one or more listed species or designated critical habitats. Formal consultation packages are submitted to the Service(s) by the federal action agency (i.e., FHWA, FTA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers). During formal consultation, NMFS/USFWS may recommend modifications to eliminate or reduce adverse effects. If effects can be reduced to an insignificant or discountable level, then consultation proceeds informally. Formal consultation ends when NMFS/USFWS issues a biological opinion (BO). The ESA mandates that BOs be completed within 135 days, although extensions are possible at the request of the consulting Service. However, formal consultations typically take much longer (averaging 300 days or more) and this timeline should be factored into project schedules. Questions on current consultation timelines can be directed to the Environmental Services Office Fish and Wildlife Program.
• Section 9 of the ESA prohibits a “take” of listed species. “Take” is defined as to “harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, capture, or collect or attempt to engage in such conduct” (1532(18)). Through regulations, the term “harm” is defined as “an act which actually kills or injures wildlife. Such an act may include significant habitat modification or degradation where it actually kills or injures wildlife by significantly impairing essential behavioral patterns, including breeding, feeding, or sheltering.” Section 4(d) of the ESA allows for each service (USFWS and NMFS) to develop special rules (4(d) rules) to conserve species listed as threatened. These protections allow some take of threatened species that does not interfere with survival and recovery. Section 4(d) protective rules for threatened species may apply Section 9 take prohibitions to threatened species. There may be an “exception” from the prohibitions if a program adequately protects listed species. In other words, the 4(d) rule can “limit” the situations to which the take prohibitions apply. Many of WSDOT maintenance activities are covered under existing Section 4(d) rules. All projects are required to conduct an ESA review. If during the review it appears that incidental take cannot be avoided, the project will be modified or a federal nexus identified for Section 7 consultation.
Fish, wildlife and vegetation
Chapter 436
• Section 10 of the ESA lays out guidance on permits that may be issued to authorize “take” as defined in Section 9. – Section 10(a)1(A) allows permits for take of listed threatened or endangered species for scientific research or purposes of propagation or survival. – Section 10(a)1(B) allows permits for incidental take of threatened or endangered species through the development and approval of Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP). WSDOT has made ESA compliance an agency wide priority. Therefore, all WSDOT projects are required to comply with Section 9 of the ESA (prohibited acts). If the project has a federal nexus, such as federal funding, permitting, or is on federal lands, it is also subject to Section 7 of the ESA. Projects located on lands covered by an HCP must comply with rules defined in the plan. Standard maintenance operations are covered under Section 4(d) Rules for fish species under NMFS jurisdiction. WSDOT identifies potential effects to listed or proposed species and critical habitats associated with a proposed action and then attempts to avoid, minimize, or eliminate these effects. For some actions, WSDOT conducts preliminary environmental reviews to identify likely effects early in the project design. This approach allows for design adjustments if effects to listed or proposed species or critical habitats are identified.
Analysis & documentation for MMPA The Marine Mammal Protection Act establishes responsibilities for conservation and management to protect marine mammals. It establishes a moratorium on the taking and importation of marine mammals and marine mammal products. The MMPA defines “take” as “to hunt, harass, capture, or kill” any marine mammal or attempt to do so. WSDOT projects that involve marine waters, as well as the Columbia River up to Bonneville Dam, must consider potential effects of project activities and operation on marine mammals. If a project will impact marine mammals, a permit request for incidental harassment may be required from NOAA. Contact the Environmental Services Office Fish and Wildlife Program for additional information and guidance.
Analysis & documentation for MBTA and BGEPA Two federal regulations administered by the USFWS mandate WSDOT’s responsibilities to minimize impacts to protected bird species. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) makes it unlawful to take, import, export, possess, sell, purchase, or barter any migratory bird, with the exception of the taking of game birds during established hunting seasons. The law also applies to feathers, eggs, nests, and products made from migratory birds. This law is of particular concern when birds nest on bridges, buildings, signs, illumination, and ferry dock structures. WSDOT has developed guidance on avoiding active nests during highway construction, bridge maintenance, bridge inspection, and other relevant activities to ensure compliance with the MBTA. See Regional or Headquarters biology staff on how to proceed if guidance is necessary. The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA), similar to the MBTA, makes it unlawful to take, import, export, sell, purchase, or barter any bald or golden eagle, their parts, products, nests, or eggs. “Take” includes pursuing, shooting, poisoning, wounding, killing, capturing, trapping, collecting, molesting, or disturbing eagles. All WSDOT projects must comply with the BGEPA. To avoid potential disturbance to bald eagles, the National Bald Eagle Management Guidelines (guidelines) provide recommendations that will likely avoid 
Chapter 436
Fish, wildlife and vegetation
take for a list of activities. WSDOT biologists and consultants address compliance with the BGEPA through a Bald Eagle form that documents compliance with the National Bald Eagle Management Guidelines. If take is unavoidable, contact regional or headquarters biologists on how to proceed. State law also requires authorization to handle, kill, or collect wildlife of the state. The Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) administers this law under RCW 77.12.240 and applies to all wildlife. If you believe your project may require take of state wildlife, including birds, amphibians, reptiles, invertebrates, and mammals, contact the Environmental Services Office Fish and Wildlife Program.
Analysis & documentation for Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) Under the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976, NMFS was given legislative authority to regulate the fisheries of the United States. In 1996, this Act was amended to emphasize the sustainability of the nation’s fisheries and create a new habitat conservation approach called Essential Fish Habitat (EFH). In 1999 and 2000, the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) added provisions for the protection of EFH to three Fishery Management Plans (Coastal Pelagics, Groundfish, and Pacific Coast Salmon) in the Pacific Northwest. Federal agencies, and agencies working on their behalf, must consult with the NMFS on all activities, or proposed activities, authorized, funded, or undertaken by the agency that have or may have an adverse effect to EFH. The WSDOT Biological Assessment Preparation Manual contains a chapter detailing WSDOT procedures for completing EFH consultations with NMFS.
Construction in State Waters A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between WSDOT and WDFW addresses transportation construction work in state waters. The purpose of the MOA is to establish and promote mutual agreement of the needs and mandates of the respective agencies, to facilitate the consistent and efficient administration of Hydraulic Project Approvals (HPAs) for transportation projects under RCW 77.55 (Construction Projects in State Waters), and WAC 220‑660 (Hydraulic Code Rules); to ensure that fish passage at transportation projects is facilitated through RCW 77.57 (Fishways, Flow, and Screening); and facilitate the implementation of the WSDOT Chronic Environmental Deficiency Program.
436.05 External engagement 436.05(1)
Working on Public Lands
Specific regulations apply to projects located on public lands. These projects may include a federal nexus as described previously, or not. In either case, public land managers (US Forest Service (USFS), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR), National Park Service (NPS), and others) may require additional review to meet their regulatory obligations and mission goals. WSDOT policy encourages coordination and cooperation with public land agencies and adherence to their regulations. National Forest Management Act (NFMA, 16 USC 1604 (g)(3)(B)) requires the Secretary of Agriculture to assess forest lands, develop a management program based on multiple use, sustained-yield principles, and implement a resource management plan for each unit of
Fish, wildlife and vegetation
Chapter 436
the National Forest System. The NFMA applies directly to lands administered by the USFS, but also provides direction for BLM land management plans. The BLM and USFS have integrated NEPA requirements with their land management regulations. In 2008, the USFS implemented new planning rules that offer a more strategic approach to land management plan development, amendment, and revision, as well as expanded public involvement. The USFS has developed forest specific “forest plans” which identify “species of concern” found within each forest. Species lists are comprised of several categories of species such as federally listed species, USFS sensitive species, survey and manage species, and state listed species. Forest plans can cover a wide range of species (mollusks, lichens, mammals, and others). Individual forest staff or regional foresters decide which designated species to include on its species of concern list. Project requirements are associated with species ranking. However, actions on federal land must always comply with the ESA (see Section 436.03). Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) is a management plan affecting federal forest lands within the range of the northern spotted owl in western Washington, Oregon, and northern California. The standards and guidelines set forth in this plan supersede any existing forest plans within the range of the spotted owl. All WSDOT projects occurring on federal forest lands within the range of the northern spotted owl must follow the standards and guidelines within the NWFP. WSDOT projects that involve federal forest lands must comply with regulations under the NFMA and the NWFP. The USFS policy (FSM 2670.32) states that all programs and activities will be reviewed in a Biological Evaluation (BE) to determine the potential effect of such proposed activities on sensitive species. Guidance for developing BEs is located in the USFS Manual or the BLM Policy Manual. In most cases, WSDOT BA formats and programmatic documents can meet USFS and BLM requirements by adding in information on sensitive species. Further, the policy states that impacts of such activities must be avoided or minimized and any permitted activities must not result in a loss of viability or create significant trends towards Federal listing. Similar to the USFS policy, the BLM Manual 6840 describes policy regarding special status species on BLM lands. Lists of special status and sensitive species for USFS and BLM as well as recent policy can be obtained from the Interagency Special Status/Sensitive Species Program. The regional or state office of the federal agency responsible for the affected federal lands should be contacted to obtain a species of concern (special status or sensitive) list, information on necessary surveys and other guidance on needed documentation. Depending on the federal land ownership, this could include, but is not limited to, coordination with BLM, USFS, or NPS. Before any ground disturbing activity can occur, surveys may be required for each managed species that may be present in the project area.
436.05(2)
Working on Tribal Lands
Projects on tribal lands may be subject to tribal laws that regulate fish, wildlife, and habitat. Projects not on tribal land could affect treaty reserved resources or species of tribal significance. The appropriate tribal biologist should be contacted to discuss any regulations that may apply to the project. Contact the WSDOT Tribal Liaison for more information or guidance.

Fish, wildlife and vegetation
Chapter 436
Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) – If a project may affect essential fish habitat, WSDOT must prepare and submit an Essential Fish Habitat Assessment to NMFS. This assessment is included in an individual biological assessment or programmatic form. When ESA species are not present, a stand-alone EFH assessment may be required. Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) – The Fish and Wildlife Program applies for an annual MBTA permit from the USFWS that covers most compliance issues. The project biologist will determine if a project requires the preparation of a Bird Protection Plan. This document includes measures to avoid or minimize impacts to nesting birds. Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA) – If a project may affect an active or inactive eagle nest, the project biologist will prepare a Bird Protection Plan, and coordinate with the Fish and Wildlife Program to obtain authorization from the USFWS. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) – Projects that may disturb marine mammals must apply for an Incidental Harassment Authorization from NMFS.

436.09 Glossary Candidate Species – Any species of fish, wildlife, or plant considered for possible addition to the list of endangered and threatened species. These are taxa for which NMFS or USFWS has on file sufficient information on biological vulnerability and threat(s) to support issuance of a proposal to list, but issuance of a proposed rule is currently precluded by higher priority listing actions. Critical Habitat – Under the Endangered Species Act, (1) the specific areas within the geographic area occupied by a federally listed species on which are found physical or biological features essential to conserving the species, and that may require special protection or management considerations; and (2) specific areas outside the geographic area occupied by a federally listed species when it is determined that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species. Effects of the Action (ESA) – Effects that are caused by the proposed action and are later in time but are still reasonably certain to occur. (50 CFR 402.02) Endangered Species – Any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Federal Nexus – A project with a federal nexus either has federal funding, requires federal permits, or takes place on federal lands.
Fish, wildlife and vegetation
Chapter 436
Habitat – The physical or natural environment where a species or population may live. Incidental Take (ESA) – Take of listed species that results from, but is not the intention of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity. Jurisdiction – Governing authority which interprets and applies laws and regulations. Listed Species – Any species of fish, wildlife, or plant which has been determined to be endangered or threatened under Section 4 of the ESA. Programmatic Biological Assessment – A biological assessment that establishes conditions allowing multiple actions on a program, regional or other basis to proceed through streamlined consultation processes with the Services. Proposed Species – Any species of fish, wildlife, or plant that is proposed by NMFS or USFWS for federal listing under Section 4 of the ESA.

446.01 Introduction Noise is defined as unwanted sound. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) developed noise regulations to investigate traffic noise impacts in areas where humans exist adjacent to highways and effective control of the undesirable effects of traffic noise. The regulation requires investigation of actions that have the potential to alter the existing traffic noise environment such as the proposed construction of a new highway, significantly changing the horizontal or vertical alignment of an existing highway, increasing the number of throughtraffic lanes. Noise levels near roadways depend on six variables: 1. Traffic volume 2. Traffic speed 3. Percent of heavy trucks 4. Distance from the roadway 5. Intervening topography 6. Atmospheric conditions Generally, traffic noise increases with heavier traffic volumes, higher speeds, and more heavy trucks. WSDOT uses several strategies to control traffic noise at nearby noise sensitive receivers:
• Construct noise barriers (walls or earthen berms)
• Reduce traffic speeds
• Coordinate with local agencies to prevent “noise sensitive” development near highways
• Preserve existing buffer zones and beneficial topographic features
• Support local jurisdictions to establish principal routes for buses and trucks See the noise study process flow chart in the Exhibit below and for detailed information see WSDOT’s Noise webpage.

446.03 Noise considerations during project development 446.03(1)
Highway Projects
Planning Under Section 1310 of MAP-21, the Federal lead agency may adopt and use planning products in the environmental review process of a project, even where planning begins at the local level. This can provide an opportunity for noise-compatible land use planning or reconsideration of project alternatives.
Scoping Determine if the project is a Type 1, Type 2, or Type 3 project according to the definitions in 23 CFR 772.5 and WSDOT Noise Policies and Procedures (2020) or identify what information is needed to make this determination during design phase. Refer to the current retrofit barrier priority list and determine whether there are any retrofit (Type 2) noise barriers within the project corridor.
Noise
Chapter 446
If the project is Type 1 and there is high density housing within the project corridor that do not already have a noise wall, conduct a noise screening analysis following WSDOT Noise Policies and Procedures (2020) to determine potential need for noise barriers. This information can help to provide more accurate project cost estimates prior to design phase. Recommend including replacement of access doors on existing noise walls within project as necessary.
Design The intent of the WSDOT Noise Policies and Procedures (2020) is to minimize and avoid noise impacts from transportation systems and facilities. Many of the Technical Guidance documents in Section 446.02, above, also function as Policy Guidance. Related guidance is available in the following documents. 1. FHWA Highway Traffic Noise Analysis and Abatement, Policy and Guidance – The basis for all state noise policies and the accompanying guidance used to support state DOT policy development.

FTA lead/co-lead projects For many projects involving passenger rail, transit, and/or park and ride facilities, FTA criteria applies as outlined in FTA Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment Manual,  (Report No. 0123). Noise studies are also required for these facilities. An Interagency Agreement for coordinated noise analysis and abatement policy and procedures has been developed by FTA, FHWA, WSDOT, and Sound Transit. The current agreement (as of ) documents an agreed upon noise methodology and criteria for integrated highway and transit projects. A copy of the agreement is included in Appendix B of the EM. FTA technical guidance for mass transportation noise analysis is available in the FTA Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment Manual,  (Report No. 0123). The FTA General Noise Assessment Spreadsheet is designed as an aid in using the FTA General Noise Assessment Procedures.
FRA Lead/Co-Lead Projects Evaluation of railroad sound levels is regulated under 42 USC 4916 and WAC 173-58. Rail projects may require a vibration analysis. Rail projects may also require a horn noise analysis if a new rail crossing is created, or an existing crossing is modified to introduce new horn warning signals. A process to address train horn noise and establish community quiet zones is now available through the Federal Rail Administration (FRA).
Noise
Chapter 446
WSF Projects Ferry projects are considered multimodal facilities and are typically addressed under FTA criteria and policy for noise and vibration. Noise studies following FHWA criteria may also be required for these facilities. Ferry projects may require an Incidental Harassment Authorization (IHA) permit for pile driving in water. Biological Assessments (BA) should address noise impacts to species listed under the Endangered Species Act. Ferry vessels are regulated for noise under RCW 79A.60.
WSDOT Airports WSDOT airports have noise compatible land use guidelines.
Construction Ensure Contractor complies with noise variance conditions set by local jurisdictions for night work. Respond to community complaints in a timely manner. Provide Design Builder with timely comments on potential design changes and/or updated noise study to ensure that they achieve the same results as in the original environmental documentation. For more information on environmental commitments during construction see Chapter 600.
Maintenance and Operations Repair noise wall panels damaged by errant vehicles, paint over graffiti.
446.04 Analysis & documentation requirements This section describes analysis and documentation requirements based on regulatory requirements. Determine level of detail based on complexity/size of project, expected severity of impacts, and potential for public controversy.
446.04(1)
Analysis & documentation for NEPA
When noise impacts are found or anticipated on highway projects a full noise analysis and report must be completed following WSDOT Noise Policies and Procedures (2020). Noise analysis, where there are federal funds or a federal nexus associated with the project, must include the entire project corridor and both sides of the highway regardless of whether there are Type 1 activities along the entire project corridor or not. If no noise impacts are anticipated on a highway project a noise screening analysis can be conducted using a ‘straight-line’ model or under specific conditions the FHWA Traffic Noise Screening Tool (TNST) can be used following WSDOT Noise Policies and Procedures (2020). A simple memorandum report format is acceptable.
Chapter 446
Noise
446.04(2)
Analysis & documentation for SEPA only (No federal nexus)
If there are no federal funds or no federal nexus associated with the project, the same applies as it does for NEPA above, however, in Appendix 1 of WSDOT Noise Policies and Procedures (2020) there is an option to analyze only those areas and only the side of the roadway where Type 1 activities are occurring on the project. For projects with no federal funds or federal nexus, areas where no Type 1 activities are occurring may be eliminated from the analysis and reporting.
446.04(3)
Analysis & documentation for projects under FTA/FRA under NEPA/SEPA
For projects involving passenger rail, transit, and/or park and ride facilities, FTA criteria applies as outlined in FTA Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment for both NEPA and SEPA documentation. Reporting under NEPA would include a full noise and vibration report and a simpler memorandum format could be used under SEPA reporting.
446.05 External engagement 446.05(1)
Methods of public outreach for noise abatement
The WSDOT Air Quality, Noise and Energy Program manager, with the project engineering office, will decide on the appropriate method and level of initial public involvement. Depending on the size, controversy, and impact of the project, public outreach may include:
• Open houses
• Community group briefings
• Environmental document hearings
• Mailers
• Workshops
• Community polling
• Joint WSDOT / Citizen committees For communities where noise levels are above the impact criteria and abatement is not proposed for construction and there is significant community concern about noise, the project design team may augment its community involvement activities to conduct specific outreach. This is intended to determine if there are other possible low-cost solutions to address the community concerns within the existing project budget (WSDOT Noise Policies and Procedures 2020, Appendix 2). These would not be eligible for federal-aid highway funds. It is generally assumed that noise abatement is desired by a community, however, if there is opposition to the proposed abatement by the community the project engineering office will be responsible for:
• Ensuring that the department is aware of these concerns
• Documenting the concerns
• Considering changes to the design if possible
• Responding to those who expressed concerns
• Working with the WSDOT Air Quality, Noise and Energy Program manager, conduct a poll of eligible property owners and residents

Project engineer office
The Project Office provides traffic data, MicroStation design files including alignments, cross sections, contours, and structures out to 500 feet from the edge of pavement to the noise analyst. The Project Office reviews the draft and final noise discipline report to ensure that it aligns with the project description and they incorporate any noise walls recommended for construction into the final design. For some larger projects (e.g., Megaprograms) the staff editor performs a final editorial review. If there are any conflicts with construction of the proposed noise wall (e.g., buried utilities or overhead powerlines), the Project Office communicates these to the noise analyst. If the noise wall requires changes in the alignment due to these conflicts the noise analyst must update the noise study.
446.06(3)
Region environmental coordinator
The environmental coordinator reviews the draft and final noise discipline report to ensure that it aligns with the project description, ensures the format is consistent with the other discipline reports, and checks for grammatical errors.

Environmental services office
The Air Quality, Noise and Energy Program manager reviews the draft and final noise discipline report to ensure that it is consistent with the FHWA regulations and WSDOT Noise Policies and Procedures, that the methodology is technically correct, and checks for grammatical errors. During the final design stage, the Air Quality, Noise and Energy Program manager ensures that the designed top of wall elevation is consistent with what was proposed in the noise discipline report. The Program manager also leads all consultations with FHWA if needed to clarify any policy or regulatory questions or changes. The Air Quality, Noise and Energy specialists conduct air quality and noise and energy studies, provide technical assistance and advice pertaining to air quality and noise and vibration issues on projects, working with the environmental coordinator and the Project Office obtain nighttime noise variances or exemptions for night work in various jurisdictions and working with Local Programs provide technical reviews of air quality and noise reports.
446.07 Applicable permits & approval process The only permits required for noise are variances or exemptions from state and local noise regulations for construction and maintenance activities during nighttime hours (WAC 173-60). Nighttime noise limits are typically in effect between 10 pm and 7 am but vary by jurisdiction or type of land use adjacent to the construction noise source. For details, see the WSDOT Local permits and approvals webpage. The application process will vary by jurisdiction and Tribe. Contact the Air Quality, Noise and Energy Program manager for information or assistance. For more information on the permitting process, see Chapter 500. 
Chapter 446
Noise
446.08 Mitigation Avoiding or minimizing noise impacts through the design process is always the first choice, but it is not viable in all locations. Where noise impacts are present, a noise barrier or berm near the source or the receiver provides the most efficient form of noise mitigation (abatement). Regardless of the type of noise abatement proposed, it must meet both feasibility and reasonableness criteria to be considered noise abatement and be eligible for federal funds. Any noise abatement constructed is required to be maintained in-perpetuity. For projects where noise impacts occur and noise abatement does not meet the feasibility and reasonableness criteria and there are substantial concerns from the community regarding noise, other options can be considered that will not provide noise reduction but can either give the perception of noise reduction or address other community issues using a ‘green to gray’ approach (WSDOT Noise Policies and Procedures, 2020, Appendix 2). These community-scale options are intended to enhance community participation. They are not eligible for federal funds and must be within available project scopes and budgets. WSDOT cannot use quieter pavement or insulation of non-institutional and non-public use facilities.

447.01 Introduction This chapter contains policies for dealing with known or unknown hazardous and regulated materials (HazMat) encountered on WSDOT right-of-way (ROW) during the planning, scoping, property acquisition, and construction stages of projects. WSDOT conducts hazardous materials investigations that meet regulatory requirements as early as possible in the project development process. WSDOT has a responsibility to consider HazMat issues that may impact a WSDOT project when encountered or improperly managed throughout the lifecycle of a project in order to:
• Provide increased safety by mitigating potential dangers to WSDOT personnel, contract employees, the public and the environment from exposures to hazardous or regulated materials,
• Reduce the likelihood of project redesign, delay, or termination and costs increases.
• Reduce the possibility and costs of litigation against WSDOT during both design and construction.
• Minimize and manage agency cleanup risk and liability. WSDOT must abide by numerous federal, state, and local regulations that govern the handling, transporting and disposal of HazMat. WSDOT projects have the potential to encounter or generate solid waste, which may not designate as hazardous or dangerous waste. Visit the WSDOT HazMat webpage for additional information and procedural guidance on addressing HazMat issues.

Scoping
Region staff determines how to proceed with hazardous materials documentation based on the likelihood that a project will encounter contamination. This is a professional judgment made during project scoping when staff completes the Environmental Review Summary (ERS) in the Project Summary Database (Section 300.02). Region staff answers the questions in the ERS to determine if further investigations should be scoped into the project to identify potential HazMat issues at a site or within the project area. They also use the information to assess potential project impacts (including to the project budget and schedule), mitigations, and required permits or approvals. Please see well decommissioning requirements for the removal of piezometers and the decommissioning of wells (see Geotechnical Design Manual Chapter 3). Additional information regarding the ERS Hazmat documentation is located at the WSDOT HazMat Investigations and Documentation webpage.
Chapter 447
Hazardous Materials (HazMat) and Solid Waste
447.03(3)
Design
Cleanup costs for contaminated properties can be extraordinary and cleanup actions can take many years. For this reason, WSDOT seeks to minimize liability by identifying the nature and extent of contamination at properties prior to acquisition and construction. This process is commonly known as completing “due diligence.” Region staff reviews the ERS information and determines if additional investigations are necessary. Types of further investigations will be discussed later in this chapter within both sections 447.03 and section 447.04 ‘Analysis and Documentation Requirements’ and may include Hazardous Materials Discipline Reports for NEPA/SEPA, Phase I and II Environmental Site Assessments, and Asbestos Good Faith Inspection reports. If the region staff classify a project as a NEPA Categorical Exclusion, the information from the ERS is transferred to the Environmental Classification Summary (ECS) and becomes the hazardous materials NEPA documentation for the project (Section 300.04). Although both forms ask the same questions, the supporting information and level of detail required in an ECS is greater. During the Design phase of a project WSDOT staff follows the Design Environmental Compliance Assurance Procedure (ECAP) as described in Design Manual Section 225.05(1). The Design ECAP includes steps for notifying WSDOT management and regulatory agencies. Additional information regarding the ECS Hazmat documentation is located at the WSDOT HazMat Investigations and Documentation webpage.
Hazardous Materials Discipline Reports for NEPA/SEPA WSDOT conducts hazardous material investigations that meet regulatory requirements as early as possible in the project development process. It is essential that the extent and risk of liability be identified before property acquisition. WSDOT identifies potentially contaminated sites through research and environmental documentation completed during the NEPA/SEPA process to determine if a right-sized discipline report will be required. There are three levels of right-sized discipline reports based on project complexity:
• Comprehensive discipline report
• Standard discipline report
• Memorandum
Phase I and II Environmental Site Assessments WSDOT performs investigations called Environmental Site Assessments (ESAs) on known or suspected contaminated properties identified in the initial ERS review and/or the rightsized discipline report. The ESAs may be performed either independent of, or in conjunction with, the NEPA/SEPA process; however, ESAs are not necessary to satisfy NEPA/SEPA environmental documentation requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognizes two American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International Standards, which WSDOT uses to meet compliance when conducting ESAs:
• Phase I ESA (ASTM E 1527-05 / 1527-13)
• Phase II ESA (ASTM E 1903-11)
Hazardous Materials (HazMat) and Solid Waste
Chapter 447
Asbestos Good Faith Inspections WSDOT performs pre-bid asbestos Good Faith Inspections (GFI) on all suspect materials found in buildings, bridges, culverts and other structures that will be disturbed during renovation or demolition activities associated with capital construction projects. The asbestos GFI must be performed by an accredited Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) Building Inspector. The AHERA Building Inspector must be a WSDOT employee or a consultant retained by WSDOT. The AHERA Building Inspector determines the level of inspection necessary to identify the presence or absence of asbestos containing materials (ACM) that could be disturbed by the work. The AHERA Building Inspector also must write a concise asbestos GFI report that summarizes their inspection and findings of the presence or absence of ACM. WSDOT must provide the concise asbestos GFI report as part of the bid package to notify contractors of the presence or absence of ACM prior to bid opening, satisfying the Communications of Hazards requirement pursuant to Chapter 296-62-07721 WAC. If a project bid package does not communicate the presence or absence of ACM prior to bid opening, WSDOT staff will initiate the Design ECAP.
Planning for sediment management Projects that occur in marine or freshwater environments, including ferry terminals and bridge crossings, may need to evaluate and characterize sediment for chemical contamination. WSDOT uses the Sediment Management Standards (Chapter 173-204 WAC), promulgated by Ecology, to sample and evaluate sediments that may be disturbed. The sediment regulations impose a number of specific requirements, including special sampling and laboratory analysis procedures that make early coordination critical to WSDOT project schedules. If a project will involve dredging, WSDOT also follows the requirements of the Dredged Material Management Program (DMMP) administered by the US Army Corps of Engineers. The DMMP provides criteria for in-water disposal of dredged sediment. If the sediments are not suitable for open-water disposal, they will need to be disposed of at an appropriate upland disposal facility.
447.03(4)
Construction
Managing HazMat During Construction WSDOT contractors are responsible for the safe management and disposal of known or suspected HazMat when encountered at a site, as described by Contract Plan Sheets or the use of a Special Provision, and should manage HazMat in a cost-effective manner in accordance with all federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and standards. Even with advanced planning, it is not possible for WSDOT to know the entire history of every site, and encounters of unknown hazardous or regulated materials may occur. WSDOT remains prepared for unexpected situations during construction by having policies and procedures in place for the following:
• Encountering unknown underground storage tanks (USTs)
• ACM not previously identified
• Lead based paint 
Chapter 447
Hazardous Materials (HazMat) and Solid Waste
• Encountering unknown contamination
• Responding to spills from construction activities
• Reporting spills caused by the traveling public If the contract does not address unknown encounters, the PE works with the region environmental office, a consultant, or ESO HazMat Program and the contractor to coordinate the management of these materials. The WSDOT contractors are also responsible for managing all HazMat that is brought or generated on site during all construction activities. These unexpected situations require rapid response actions to minimize impacts to the environment and the project work. WSDOT staff follows the Construction Environmental Compliance Assurance Procedure (ECAP) as described in Construction Manual M 41-01. The Construction ECAP includes steps for notifying WSDOT management and regulatory agencies. The subsections below describe each situation and related reporting requirements in more detail. WSDOT must appropriately manage the material prior to reuse or disposal at a permitted disposal facility willing to accept the material. For more information about HazMat during construction, visit the Hazardous Materials Investigations and Documentation webpage. Only qualified WSDOT HazMat Specialists, Certified Industrial Hygienists, and qualified consultants and/or contract personnel are qualified to handle HazMat and collect samples. If a contractor hires or utilizes qualified consultants or personnel, the Project Engineer should include the WSDOT HazMat Program on all correspondence. The management of HazMat may include any or all of the activities listed below. Visit the WSDOT HazMat webpage for information on each topic:
• Identifying the type, concentration, and extent of the contamination
• Stockpiling and covering HazMat or otherwise containing liquids
• Sampling and submitting samples for laboratory analysis
• Labeling containers and drums
• Characterizing the material for reuse, or disposal at a permitted disposal facility able to accept the material
• Submitting information to regulatory agencies If project waste materials designate as dangerous waste, WSDOT assumes responsibility as the generator of the waste for reporting purposes. Per Chapter 173-303 WAC, WSDOT must obtain a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Site Identification (ID) number from Ecology. WSDOT is required to track and count quantities of all Dangerous Waste generated and disposed. While the EPA Site ID number remains open in Ecology’s system, the PE is required to submit an Annual Report1 to Ecology due no later than March 1st of each year. Where possible, the PE should consider the opportunity to minimize WSDOT’s future cleanup liability, cleanup areas where final construction might prevent or obstruct future cleanup, and perform cleanup to protect environmentally sensitive areas. Visit the HazMat webpage for more information about cleanup options. 1Ecology implemented an electronic submittal process for annual reports.

Encountering unknown underground storage tanks (USTs) Due to potential explosion hazards and the specific statues and regulations associated with UST decommissioning, USTs require special consideration when encountered at a WSDOT site. When a contractor encounters a UST, WSDOT policy is for the contractor to stop work in the immediate area and notify the WSDOT Project Engineer (PE). The PE will initiate the Construction ECAP. Ecology has the authority over all “regulated” USTs in Washington State pursuant to Chapter 173-360 WAC. Some USTs are exempt in accordance with WAC 173-360-110, but may be regulated by local agencies. WSDOT or the contractor must contact the local fire marshal, health department, and planning department to determine local requirements. Local health and fire departments may also require notification of UST site closures.
• Pierce County Health Department Permit
• Pierce County Health Department Process
• King County Health Department A registered UST Decommissioner will know local regulations regarding tank removal. If there is a confirmed release from a regulated UST, Chapter 173-340 WAC will also apply. In the case of a confirmed release, WSDOT must ensure that Ecology receives notification within 24 hours. A status report is then due to Ecology within 20 days. A Washington State certified International Fire Code Institute (IFCI) UST Decommissioner must be utilized to remove regulated USTs and a Washington State certified UST Site Assessor must be present during removal to sample and document UST closure activities. Thirty days prior to removing a regulated UST, a 30-Day Notice is due to Ecology. WSDOT can ask Ecology to waive this requirement if it will cause schedule delays. The ESO HazMat program has certified UST Site Assessors to assist in UST removal. If there is no contamination discovered during a regulated UST removal, Ecology must receive a Closure and Site Assessment Notice, a Site Check/Site Assessment Checklist, and a Site Assessment Report within 30 days. If there is contamination from a regulated UST or an exempted UST identified as referenced in WAC 173-360A-0110 Ecology must receive a Site Characterization Report within 90 days. The reports should contain required information detailed in the 2003 Ecology document Guidance for Site Checks and Site Assessments for Underground Storage Tanks. For more information, see the Ecology UST webpage.
Encountering unknown contamination When a contractor encounters unknown hazardous or regulated materials, usually identified by sight or smell, WSDOT policy is for the contractor to stop work in the immediate area and notify the WSDOT PE. The PE initiates the Construction ECAP and should coordinate with the region environmental office, a consultant, or ESO HazMat Program to determine whether WSDOT workers can safely continue working in the immediate area. The PE follows notification procedures established in Construction ECAP to determine internal and external reporting requirements. The region environmental office, a consultant, or ESO HazMat Program can help to coordinate any required regulatory reporting. Per WAC 173-340-300, WSDOT is required to report to Ecology hazardous substances that 
Chapter 447
Hazardous Materials (HazMat) and Solid Waste
may be a threat to human health or the environment based on best professional judgment. WAC 173-340-300(2)(b) does provide a non-exhaustive list of reportable events and some examples are presented below.
• Contamination in a water supply well.
• Free product such as petroleum product or other organic liquids on the surface of the ground or in the groundwater.
• Any contaminated soil or unpermitted disposal of waste materials that would be classified as a hazardous waste under federal or state law.
• Any abandoned containers such as drums or tanks, above ground or buried, still containing more than trace residuals of hazardous substances.
• Sites where hazardous substances have leaked or been dumped on the ground.
• Leaking underground petroleum storage tanks not already reported under WAC 173-340-450. If project waste materials designate as dangerous waste, WSDOT assumes responsibility as the generator of the waste for reporting purposes. Per Chapter 173-303 WAC, WSDOT must obtain a Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Site Identification (ID) number from Ecology. WSDOT is required to track and count quantities of all Dangerous Waste generated and disposed. While the EPA Site ID number remains open in Ecology’s system, the PE is required to submit an Annual Report2 to Ecology due no later than March 1st of each year. WSDOT Regional Project Offices should provide copies of all Ecology letters related to contamination on WSDOT properties to ESO HazMat Program within 30 days of receipt. The ESO HazMat Program tracks the information and uses it for GASB 49 reporting.
Responding to spills from construction activities Spills caused by WSDOT contractors during project construction are the responsibility of the contractor to clean up, report, and dispose of properly. Ecology and Local Jurisdiction Health Departments require confirmation sampling to verify that the spill was adequately cleaned up and to avoid having the site location listed on Ecology’s facility database. The Contractor should hire a qualified consultant at their expense to conduct the remedial cleanup activities, and the Regional Project Office may contact the ESO HazMat Program when a spill has occurred to oversee that the cleanup process was appropriately completed. As a way to prevent and respond to spills on project sites, WSDOT requires contractors to prepare and implement a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan for all projects. The SPCC Plan is a Type 2 Working Drawing and must address the required elements in their respective order as identified in Standard Specifications Section 1-07.15(1), including reporting requirements. The contractor may not begin any onsite construction activities until the Type 2 Working Drawing review and comment process in Standard Specifications Section 1-05.3 is completed. The SPCC Plan must remain on site at all times until the completion of the project. The SPCC Plan shall be considered a living document that is required to be updated to reflect current site conditions. For example, if the Contractor adds additional spill kits or moves the existing spill kits to another location of the project, this must be reflected in an updated SPCC Plan. 2 Ecology implemented an electronic submittal process for annual reports. For user guide information see www/ecy.wa.gov/ programs/hwtr/waste-report/index.html

Chapter 447
If a spill occurs on a project, WSDOT staff follows the Construction ECAP. Visit the WSDOT Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures webpage for additional guidance, resources, and training information. WSDOT has a Spill Reporting Flow Chart (pdf 42 kb) that contractors and staff can use as a quick reference for how to report spills.
Reporting spills caused by the traveling public (Third-Party) WSDOT personnel or Contract personnel may be a witness to or have to respond to an inadvertent spill from a Third-Party accident. If a spill from the traveling public occurs within a WSDOT construction project or ROW, WSDOT personnel shall immediately notify Washington State Patrol (WSP) and Ecology to report the spill, and if possible, identify the responsible party. WSDOT must report a spill if they have knowledge of a spill that may threaten human health or the environment, or where sites have been leaked or been dumped on the ground pursuant to WAC 173-340-300(3)(b)(iv)(viii). If the spill is an immediate threat to human health or the environment (e.g., tank truck leaking into a water body), WSDOT personnel within their limits of expertise should take action to contain the spill until Ecology or the WSP arrive on the scene. Cleanup costs may be recovered at a later date if and when the responsible party is identified. In accordance with the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 70.136.030, the WSP is the “hazardous materials incident command agency” along state and interstate highway corridors and coordinates all activities at the scene of a spill. Should WSDOT enter into an emergency assistance agreement with the WSP, the agreement does not obligate WSDOT to assist as WSDOT would be considered exercising the “Good Samaritan” law in pursuant to RCW 70.136.050, and WSDOT would not be liable for any civil damages resulting from the manner in which it conducted the cleanup except for gross negligence or willful or wanton misconduct. Ecology is not obligated to respond to every spill on WSDOT ROW. Upon receiving notification from the WSP Incident Commander, Ecology’s Spill Response Team will determine if the release warrants a response. In accordance with RCW 90.56.020 and 90.56.350, Ecology is obligated to respond and cleanup spills of oil or other hazardous substances that have discharged or have the potential to discharge into the Waters of the State. In addition, other factors may influence the lack of a response such as limited resources. The cleanup of spills by the traveling public is regulated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) Section 9607(b), which states, “There shall be no liability under subsection (a) of this section for a person otherwise liable who can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance and the damages resulting therefrom were caused solely by— (1) an act of God; (2) an act of war; (3) an act or omission of a third party other than an employee or agent of the defendant, or than one whose act or omission occurs in connection with a contractual relationship, existing directly or indirectly, with the defendant (except where the sole contractual arrangement arises from a published tariff and acceptance for carriage by a common carrier by rail), if the defendant establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that (a) 
Chapter 447
Hazardous Materials (HazMat) and Solid Waste
he exercised due care with respect to the hazardous substance concerned, taking into consideration the characteristics of such hazardous substance, in light of all relevant facts and circumstances, and (b) he took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of any such third party and the consequences that could foreseeably result from such acts or omissions; or (4) any combination of the foregoing paragraphs” (see also RCW 70.105.040). In most cases spills are reported to Ecology through the Environmental Report Tracking System (ERTS). This information is sometime then relayed to either the WSDOT Incident Response Team (ICR) or Regional Maintenance Offices. The WSDOT Hazardous Materials Program occasionally receives notification letters of Third-Party Spills, or through a tracking system called GASB which identifies sites that have been listed on Ecology’s databases. WSDOT can assume financial liability for a Third-Party spill if the spill is not reported, or a liable party (individual who caused the spill) was not identified, then under RCW 70A.300.060, WSDOT as the owner of the property or facility will assume liability of any future cleanup of contamination left in place. Under CERCLA, persons may be held strictly liable for releases or threatened release of hazardous substances at properties they owned or operated at the time of release. This rule means that a potentially responsible party may be liable for contamination based solely on property ownership without regard to fault. Petroleum products are specifically excluded from the CERCLA “hazardous substances” in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 9601(14), however are still considered hazardous substances under MTCA.
Reusing or disposing of project waste materials WSDOT is ultimately responsible for the reuse and disposal of project waste materials. Disposal of materials can be costly and may impact project schedules. It is for these reasons that WSDOT coordinates the sampling and characterization of HazMat as described above. The decision to reuse or dispose of project waste materials is influenced by the following factors:
• Type and level of contamination (e.g., petroleum product vs. solvents)
• Future site use (e.g., residential vs. industrial, a parking lot or roadway)
• Site access and presence of environmentally sensitive areas
• Permit requirements and environmental commitments WSDOT addresses the reuse and disposal of solid wastes during construction in Standard Specifications Sections 2-01.2, 2-02.3, and 2-03.3(7). If a contractor provides a disposal site, they are required by Section 2-03.3(7)C to provide the PE with the location of the disposal site and copies of required permits and approvals before they transport any waste off the project site. The Contractor shall provide the Engineer with a copy of the shipping manifest or bill of lading for each load indicating the quantity of material hauled to disposal, and bearing the disposal site operator’s confirmation for receipt of each load of material. The PE keeps a copy of the disposal documentation in the project file.
Hazardous Materials (HazMat) and Solid Waste
Chapter 447
When HazMat is addressed by a project Special Provision, WSDOT includes a description of the materials and identifies the type of disposal facility that will accept the materials. As a common practice, WSDOT does not direct contractors where to take materials for disposal. It is required that contractors dispose of waste in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The WSDOT HazMat webpage provides information about and disposal options for the types of waste listed below. Consult the region environmental office, a consultant, or ESO HazMat Program with project-specific questions.
• Solid Waste
• Dangerous Waste
• ACM
• Lead-Based Paint
• Treated Wood
Using construction specifications and provisions When WSDOT staff follows the policies in this chapter and the procedures on the HazMat webpages, WSDOT can reasonably anticipate and address HazMat issues prior to the advertisement of a project. During construction, WSDOT may need to have a contractor handle and manage issues such as contaminated soil or water, USTs, ACM, cementitious material or wastes, lead based paint, potentially hazardous chemicals such as detergents, polymers, dust palliatives, concrete curing compounds, form release oils, or spills. WSDOT relays this information to contractors bidding on the work in four main ways:
• Standard Specifications M 41-10, which are standard protocols that are required for all WSDOT projects.
• General Special Provisions, which are provisions written to describe specific construction requirements and are available for use on multiple projects.
• HazMat Special Provisions and Plans Sheets, which are project-specific amendments that describe the location of, and how to handle, HazMat issues requiring special attention.
• Hazardous Materials Management Plans, which are project-specific supplements to a HazMat Special Provision and provide detailed instructions for managing materials. For complex issues, the region environmental office, a consultant, or ESO HazMat Program are available to assist with writing or reviewing HazMat Project-Specific Special Provisions. Often these provisions define areas with differing types or depths of contaminated soil or water. The Project-Specific Special Provision describes how the Contractor will handle and manage the material. Information about how WSDOT will characterize the material for disposal is also often included. Further information about how specifications and provisions address HazMat topics is available on the WSDOT Investigations and Documentation webpage. Maintenance and Operations No Maintenance and Operations activities are being performed by the ESO HazMat Program at this time.

447.04 Analysis & documentation requirements 447.04(1)
Right-sizing hazmat discipline report for NEPA/SEPA
A right-sized HazMat Discipline Report (Report) is prepared to satisfy project NEPA/SEPA requirements for environmental documentation. Region staff in coordination with the ESO HazMat Program determine the appropriate level of effort required when they complete the ERS. The purpose of the Report is to identify all potential hazards encountered during a project which may:
• Affect the environment or human health during construction
• Create significant construction impacts
• Incur cleanup risk and liability for WSDOT. The right-sized Report must document significant unavoidable adverse impacts that WSDOT cannot reasonably mitigate. Whenever possible, include the Report directly in the NEPA/ SEPA document. Factors such as project size and type of construction activities, past and current land use in an area, excavation depths and acquisition plans help WSDOT staff determine the best approach. WSDOT provides Right Size Guidance that describes three levels of Reports, as well as situations where no documentation may be required. Rightsize is a common term used to describe the level of detail necessary to analyze a specific project given the setting and anticipated impacts. The level of detail must be sufficient to allow region staff to make informed decisions regarding the selection of alternatives and mitigation measures. Region staff should be able to use the Report to assess budget and schedule impacts and decide when to engage in early coordination with regulatory agencies. The documentation must provide site-specific recommendations for additional investigations needed prior to acquisition and construction. Right-sizing keeps documentation short and concise as required by NEPA/SEPA.
447.04(2)
Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (Phase I ESA)
Although similar to a HazMat Discipline Report for NEPA/SEPA, a Phase I ESA as a standalone document does not fully satisfy NEPA requirements. The purpose of a Phase I ESA is to evaluate the environmental conditions of an individual’s property as part of a real estate transaction and assess the likelihood of assuming liability from any contamination which may determine the property to be considered as a Recognized Environmental Condition REC3; whereas, NEPA documents a comprehensive study that details all potential significant impacts from various disciplines relating to the entire project footprint. WSDOT routinely uses the HazMat Discipline Report for NEPA/SEPA in the environmental document to identify potentially contaminated properties; WSDOT does not automatically complete Phase I ESAs for all individual sites. A Phase I ESA in full compliance with the ASTM standard should be conducted for properties that may be substantially contaminated and require WSDOT acquisition. If the proposed acquisition is considered substantially contaminated and may pose a significant financial risk, WSDOT must complete a Phase I ESA prior to acquisition to fulfill the requirements of 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 312, Standards and Practices in order to meet “All Appropriate Inquiry” (AAI) as defined by the USEPA and qualify 3 A recognized environmental condition (REC) refers to the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substance or petroleum
product on a property under conditions that indicate an existing release, a past release, or a material threat of a release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products into structures on the property or into the ground, groundwater, or surface water of the property. The term is not intended to include “de minimis” conditions that do not present a threat to human health and/or the environment and that would not be subject to an enforcement action if brought to the attention of appropriate governmental agencies.
Hazardous Materials (HazMat) and Solid Waste
Chapter 447
for one of the defenses under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)—aka the Superfund law—to limit cleanup liability and potentially recover future cleanup costs. WSDOT also uses the information to assess potential impacts on project design and construction. In accordance with 40 CFR 312.21, an Environmental Professional must complete the Phase I ESA. Additional information regarding a Phase I ESA is available on the WSDOT HazMat Investigations and Documentation webpage. Under current federal and state hazardous waste cleanup statutes, all former, current, and future property owners can be held individually liable for 100 percent of the cleanup cost for a contaminated property. This is referred to as “joint and several liability” and means that when WSDOT acquires contaminated property, it may be held liable for any or all cleanup and restoration costs regardless of the “degree of guilt.” WSDOT can also be held liable as a prior owner, thus, selling land does not protect the department from liability. To claim protection from liability as an innocent landowner, contiguous property owner, or bona fide prospective purchaser; property owners, including state and local governments, must conduct an AAI within one year prior to purchasing or acquiring the property as referenced in 40 CFR 312.20(a) and pursuant to CERCLA section 101(35)(B), and must purchase without knowing, or having reason to know, of contamination on the property. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of the above section, in accordance with 40 CFR 312.20(b) the following components of the AAI must be conducted or updated within 180 days of and prior to the date of purchase or acquisition of the subject property:
• Interviews with past and present owners, operators, and occupants (see 40 CFR 312.23)
• Searches for recorded environmental cleanup liens (see 40 CFR 312.25)
• Reviews of federal, tribal, state, and local government records (see 40 CFR 312.26)
• Visual inspections of the facility and of adjoining properties (see 40 CFR 312.27)
• The declaration by an Environmental Professional (see 40 CFR 312.21(d)) If the inquiry and subsequent site investigation identifies actual soil and/or groundwater contamination, the purchaser may pursue a “private right of action” with past or current owners of the property. A private right of action is a legal claim authorized by MTCA (70A.305.080) under which a person may recover costs of remedial action from other persons liable under the Act provided that a cleanup is “substantially equivalent” to a cleanup performed or supervised by Ecology. If the source of contamination is on an adjacent property, the persons liable for the adjacent contamination could be responsible for costs associated with cleanup of a site and costs to repair damages to natural resources. WSDOT also uses property appraisals performed by the WSDOT Real Estate Services Office (RESO) as described in the Right of Way Manual M 26-01. Right of Way Manual Chapter 4 instructs appraisers to document potential HazMat issues on parcels such as odd soil odors or colors, the presence of tanks or drums, and suspected asbestos containing materials. If observed, the manual provides directions on how to proceed with the appraisal. If acquiring contaminated properties, WSDOT RESO staff follows the steps outlined in Right of Way Manual Chapter 6 to identify and mitigate risk as much as possible. Actions may include, but are not limited to, valuing the property as clean and holding funds in escrow for cleanup, including an indemnification clause, or a creating a Prospective Purchaser Agreement. Once the purchase of a contaminated property is complete, the RESO is required to report the information to the Environmental Services Office (ESO). 
Chapter 447
Hazardous Materials (HazMat) and Solid Waste
ESO tracks contaminated properties that WSDOT owns, and their associated cleanup liability, and uses the information to report to the Washington State Office of Financial Management. This reporting is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement 49, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pollution Remediation Obligations. When appropriate, WSDOT tracks remaining residual contamination in WSDOT right of way (regardless of liability) after a MTCA cleanup.4
447.04(3)
Phase II Environmental Site Assessment (Phase II ESA)
A Phase II ESA is performed to investigate sites that may have contamination based on the findings of the HazMat Discipline Report for NEPA/SEPA or Phase I ESA. The Phase II ESA is conducted to characterize the nature and extent of potentially contaminated media prior to acquisition and construction. WSDOT uses information obtained in previous reports, planned areas of construction, and acquisition plans when conducting the assessment. A Phase II ESA is limited in scope and will not always identify all the contamination on a site. When site specific documentation exists in the Ecology files for the planned acquisition or construction areas a Phase II ESA may not be necessary. Additional information regarding a Phase II ESA is available on the WSDOT HazMat Investigations and Documentation webpage. WSDOT may identify or encounter contamination during geotechnical exploration drilling. As described in the Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03, prior to any drilling activities crews complete a geotechnical field exploration and an environmental assessment5. The manual also provides procedures for planning, storing, and disposing of potentially contaminated material generated during drilling activities. Additional information regarding Geotechnical Soil Boring Procedures is available on the WSDOT HazMat Investigations and Documentation webpage. Identifying the extent of contamination through a Phase II ESA helps WSDOT:
• Select project alternatives and/or mitigation options.
• Prepare real estate transactions and determine fair market property value.
• Determine appropriate property management options.
• Identify construction impacts and associated costs for mitigation and/or disposal of material.
• Consider worker health and safety needs. Selection of analytical methods and proper sample-handling techniques are critical to a successful Phase II ESA. Most laboratory methods are selected based on the specific objective of the Phase II ESA, although many are dictated by specific provisions of regulatory requirements. Laboratory analysis must be performed by an accredited analytical laboratory, pursuant to WAC 173-50. Improper or incomplete sample or analysis collection may invalidate sampling results or make the results legally indefensible. Proper handling of samples is also crucial to obtaining usable and defensible data, which includes selecting of correct sample containers, properly storing and transporting, meeting holding time requirements, and following strict chain-of-custody protocols. 4 An Implementation Agreement (IA) was signed in 2015 between Ecology and WSDOT. WSDOT has agreed to update the Right of Way Manual, utility manuals and right of way plan sheets to identify residual contamination for select sites after a MTCA cleanup has taken place. Ecology submits the proposed IA sites to WSDOT for approval. The ESO HazMat Program and regional environmental managers will review the proposed IA site documentation to affirm, modify, or reject the proposal. 5 The Environmental Assessment, at a minimum, should address environmentally sensitive areas, potential cultural resources, and documented or suspect contamination.
Hazardous Materials (HazMat) and Solid Waste
Chapter 447
Per the ASTM standard, field sampling and report writing should be performed only by or under the direct guidance of an Environmental Professional, which may be a WSDOT employee or a consultant retained by WSDOT.
447.04(4)
Asbestos Good Faith Inspection (GFI)
The purpose of the pre-bid asbestos GFI is to determine the presence or absence of ACM in suspect materials found in buildings, bridges, culverts, and other structures that will be disturbed during renovation or demolition activities, and to sufficiently notify employees and contractors of asbestos hazards that may be present and could be disturbed by the work. The asbestos GFI is completed with the intent of complying with and providing an AHERAlevel assessment in accordance with federal, state, and local asbestos laws and regulations. These statutes are generally focused on identifying airborne emissions of asbestos fibers. This information can be used to address public and worker health concerns about exposure to ACM during construction, renovation, demolition and general housekeeping activities. An asbestos GFI must be conducted pre-bid by an accredited AHERA Building Inspector prior to any renovation or demolition in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 763, Subpart E, Appendix C, and Chapter 296-62-07721 WAC. Local Clean Air Agencies may also have specific requirements and directives which must be met, in addition to Washington State Department of Labor & Industries (LNI) and other applicable asbestos regulations listed in EM 447.02. Pursuant to Chapter 296-62-07703 WAC, an “Accredited inspector” means any person meeting the accreditation requirements of the Federal Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA). The AHERA Building Inspector must be a WSDOT employee or a consultant retained by WSDOT. An AHERA Building Inspector reviews available existing objective data to aid in the identification of suspect materials that may contain ACM. Existing data can include asbuilt information and corresponding design plans and specifications, and previously written asbestos GFI reports. After reviewing existing objective data, the AHERA Building Inspector determines the level of additional inspection necessary, which can include performing a site visit to visually inspect to identify and/or collect material samples for laboratory analysis in order to determine the presence or absence of ACM. The scope of the visual inspection and/or sampling should consider site specific conditions and/or project specifics (i.e., full demolition, renovation, or minor repair). An asbestos GFI is not required if WSDOT assumes the suspect materials to be disturbed are ACM, however, this information must be provided in the project bid package to ensure contractors are notified of the presence or absence of ACM prior to bid opening. After completing the GFI, the AHERA Building Inspector will write a concise GFI report that summarizes their inspection and findings of the presence or absence of ACM. Once completed, the asbestos GFI report must be uploaded into the WSDOT ECM Portal for documentation and tracking. The ESO HazMat Program can provide assistance with uploading completed asbestos GFI reports into the WSDOT ECM Portal. WSDOT staff and consultants that are accredited AHERA Building Inspectors are qualified to perform asbestos GFI work and write a concise asbestos GFI report summarizing their inspection and findings of the presence or absence of ACM. If region staff need additional assistance with conducting GFIs, preparing GFI reports, or reviewing GFI reports, please contact the ESO HazMat Program for assistance.
Chapter 447
Hazardous Materials (HazMat) and Solid Waste
447.05 External involvement When applicable, Local Clean Air Agencies and LNI are required to be notified prior to ACM abatement and demolition. Abatement of ACM must be performed by an accredited abatement contractor with certified supervisors and workers. ACM waste generated during construction must be properly stored, transported and disposed of in a permitted landfill.
447.06 Internal roles and responsibilities The region environmental offices, consultants retained by WSDOT, and the ESO HazMat Program supports WSDOT’s capital construction program to effectively align with all phases of WSDOT project delivery and all delivery methods used by WSDOT to ensure actions and business practices comply with applicable federal, state and local hazardous and solid waste management laws & regulations.
447.07 Applicable permits and approvals Below are the most common permits or approvals that may be required as part of a HazMat investigation:
• Well installation and decommissioning associated with Geotech and Construction
• Asbestos abatement and demolition
• Waste disposal at an approved facility
• Dangerous waste / RCRA identification More information on HazMat permits and approvals is available on the HazMat webpage. For more information on the permitting process, see Chapter 500.
447.08 Mitigation The impacts and mitigation measures address typical impacts that WSDOT may encounter on construction projects. The typical impacts apply to sites of concern identified in the HazMat Discipline Report for NEPA/SEPA. Sites of concern are rated based on relative risk to impact the project (low, moderate, or high) and the level of complexity to manage the site (straightforward or complicated). Standard impacts and mitigation measures typically apply to sites with low or moderate risk that are straightforward to manage. Generally, sites ranked with low or moderate risk and straightforward complexity are situations that can be reasonably predicted based on experience and where mitigation measures can effectively control and/or minimize the impact based on best professional and engineering judgment. Mitigation measures are actions taken prior to and during construction to avoid or reduce the hazardous material impact. Mitigation measures prevent or reduce environmental impacts, minimize construction costs, and avoid or reduce WSDOT’s future long-term cleanup costs associated with managing, remediation, and monitoring work. The table detailing select mitigation measures is organized by Environmental (Direct, Indirect, Cumulative), Construction and Liability impacts and is available on the HazMat webpage. HazMat Discipline Report writers should select only the appropriate standard impacts and mitigation measures and tailor them for the project.

Hazardous Materials (HazMat) and Solid Waste
447.10 Glossary WSDOT uses the common term “Hazardous materials” to describe waste materials that require special handling and disposal. The term covers all types of contaminated or hazardous media including dangerous waste and regulated materials. The definitions below describe the different terms found in state and federal regulations. Asbestos Containing Material – Any material containing more than 1% asbestos. Dangerous Waste – Solid wastes designated in WAC 173-303-070 through WAC 173-303-100 as dangerous or extremely hazardous or mixed waste. Dangerous waste includes all federal hazardous waste, plus certain wastes exhibiting specific characteristics based on toxicity and persistence. The regulatory requirements for disposal of dangerous waste are more complex than the requirements for disposal of problem waste and place additional responsibility both on WSDOT as the generator and on the contractor for safe handling and disposal. Hazardous Substance – Hazardous substance designated under CERCLA 40 CFR 116 that pose a threat to public health or the environment. Federal regulation of hazardous substances excludes petroleum, crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids or synthetic gas usable for fuel. State regulation of hazardous substances is more stringent and includes petroleum products, as addressed in WAC 173-340-200. Hazardous Waste – Solid wastes designated in 40 CFR 261 and regulated as hazardous and/or mixed waste by the USEPA. Mixed waste includes both hazardous and radioactive components; waste that is solely radioactive is not regulated as hazardous waste. Hazardous waste includes specific listed waste that is generated from particular processes or activities or exhibits certain reactive, corrosive, toxic, or ignitable characteristics. Hazardous waste is also regulated by Ecology as dangerous waste and State-only dangerous waste. Solid Waste – State regulation Chapter 173-350 WAC defines “solid waste,” “waste materials,” or “wastes” as all putrescible and nonputrescible solid and semisolid wastes including, but not limited to, garbage, rubbish, ashes, industrial wastes, swill, sewage sludge, demolition and construction wastes, abandoned vehicles or parts thereof, contaminated soils and contaminated dredged material, and recyclable materials. See WAC 173-350-021 to determine if a material is solid waste.

455.01 Introduction Land use is a term that describes the modification and management of the natural environment for human purposes. Land use and transportation are closely related. Transportation decisions affect land use by modifying accessibility to an area. Land use decisions affect transportation by changing traffic patterns around that area. This chapter includes policies relating to the integration of land use and transportation, including bicycling and pedestrian facilities, transit, farmland, resource conservation areas, recreational lands, and wild and scenic rivers.

455.03 Land Use and Transportation considerations during project development 455.03(1)
Planning
See Chapter 200, it explains WSDOT’s transportation planning and environmental linkage efforts. Determine if a WSDOT transportation plan has been done for your project area. Determine the existing and planned land uses that are adjacent to, and served by, the study area. Land use is controlled by city and county governments through the comprehensive planning process under the Growth Management Act (GMA). WSDOT plans must be consistent with adopted comprehensive plans developed under GMA. In addition, determine if there are federal land management plans, metropolitan and regional multimodal plans, areas habitat plans, or tribal land use plans that are relevant to your project area. Consider planned development, population growth, changes in land use, effects on communities and the environment, future demand on the system, applicable or likely zoning changes, travel trends, and other relevant issues for your planning product’s conclusions and recommendations. Review WSDOT’s modal and system plans on the Statewide Plans webpage to ensure your project’s land use considerations are consistent with applicable approved statewide plans. Under 23 USC 168(d), the Federal lead agency may adopt and use planning products in the environmental review process of a project.
455.03(2)
Scoping
See Chapter 300 for more information on Scoping. Review any relevant planning products. The following are documented in the Environmental Review Summary (ERS) Land Use tab to help determine the level of analysis needed for National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). These assessments are usually conducted as a desktop exercise and do not require field verification.
• Determine if there are any properties within the project limits that used funds from the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act (1965) or any other RCO grant funds. If yes, refer to the Section 455.04(2) and Section 6(f) guidance.
• Determine if there is a Wild and Scenic River (state or federally designated, ‘study river’, or on the Nationwide Rivers Inventory (NRI) in or near the project area. If yes, refer to the Wild and Scenic Rivers guidance.
• Determine if the project is located on a state or national scenic byway. If yes, the project may need a visual assessment. Refer to Chapter 459 and WSDOT’s visual resources webpage.
• Determine if your project area includes designated farmland. If yes, refer to WSDOT’s Farmland guidance.

455.03(3)
Design
The design of state transportation improvement projects should support approved land use and transportation plans. Follow the Design Standards in WAC 468-18-040. Refer to Design Manual Section 1102.02 for Land Use context. Refer to Design Manual Section 1102.03 for Transportation context. Early consultation is required with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and appropriate state and local agricultural agencies where farmlands are directly or indirectly impacted by any alternative (see WSDOT’s Farmland guidance). Consultation with the National Park Service (NPS) is required for projects that may affect rivers in the NRI that are suitable for inclusion in the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. If NEPA is complete, then there may still be design needs for permitting. For example, wetland mitigation site design can impact farmlands.
455.03(4)
Construction
Take measures to reduce impacts to all modes of transportation and surrounding land uses during construction. Implement agreed-upon mitigation actions during construction to offset construction impacts. For more information on incorporating environmental commitments into contracts, see Section 590. For information on commitments during construction, see Section 600.03. If construction has significant impacts to traffic, as defined in Design Manual Chapter 1010, follow the approved Transportation Management Plan.
455.03(5)
Maintenance and Operations
WSDOT owns and manages approximately 100,000 acres of unpaved land adjacent to the highway system. Performance criteria for maintaining these areas is outlined in region maintenance area Integrated Roadside Vegetation Management Plans.
455.04 Analysis and documentation requirements The land use and transportation analyses are core elements, providing the basis for modal choice, alternative development, and selection of design elements. The project’s study or identified influence area should be large enough to encompass a greater area than just the highway corridor and should allow for adequate evaluation of the relationship between land use and transportation in the project vicinity. The potential effects of projects on transit, pedestrians, bicycles, rail crossings, ferry operations, airport safety zones, parking, local development patterns, and vehicle traffic on adjacent and connecting roadways need to be evaluated and discussed in the environmental document. The effects can be positive or negative, temporary, or long-term. Mitigation for unavoidable impacts should also be discussed. Consult with local, regional, and tribal entities to ensure consistency with land use plans.
Land Use and Transportation
Chapter 455
The goal of the analysis is to help decision makers understand the effect the transportation project has on land use and development patterns. The analysis must:
• Describe any direct project impacts resulting from the conversion of land to transportation uses. The analysis should include a discussion of the temporary (construction) impacts and long term (operational) impacts. It is best to include a map showing the existing and proposed right of way lines, existing land use (as described in the adopted comprehensive plan) and acreage to be converted to transportation uses in support of the analysis.
• Determine if the project is consistent with the existing adopted comprehensive plans and development policies. In Washington State, land use is controlled by city and county governments through the comprehensive planning process required by the GMA. The state Local Project Review Act of 2001 precludes WSDOT from revisiting land use decisions included in the adopted comprehensive plan during project review. To receive Federal funding, a transportation project must be consistent with local planning (i.e., the goals and objectives of the project should match the goals and objectives stated in the comprehensive plan).
• Describe development trends in the study area and any reasonably foreseeable impacts caused by development that may occur in response to the project. This includes potential development or redevelopment of buildable lands within the influence area of the transportation project. These changes are driven and constrained by social and economic factors beyond WSDOT or the local public agency’s control. Such effects are difficult to predict and often controversial. Projects that do not increase vehicle capacity, change the Level of Service (LOS), or significantly reduce travel time are unlikely to change land use. However, projects that add transit or active transportation capacity can have positive impacts on land use and economic development. Project teams should also review the potential impacts of planned local development or redevelopment on the project. See Chapter 412 for more information on indirect and cumulative effects.
• Discuss actions that were taken to avoid, minimize, or mitigate direct land use impacts. Potential or recommended mitigation measures for indirect impacts should also be described. The discussion should include the party responsible for such mitigation and the likelihood of implementation of such measures. See more in Section 455.08 Mitigation.
• Evaluate and compare the potential impact for all alternatives, including the NoBuild alternative (see Section 400.07). The results of this analysis should inform the indirect effects analysis conducted for other disciplines and support the cumulative effects analysis.
455.04(1)
Right size to classification (CE, EA, EIS) or level of significance to land use and transportation
Determine the level of detail that is needed based on complexity/size of project and severity of impacts. Projects classified as Categorical Exclusions / Categorical Exemptions (CE – see Chapter 300) typically do not require analysis for potential land use impacts under 23 CFR 771.117(a) because, by definition, these projects:
• Do not induce significant impacts to planned growth or land use.
• Do not require relocation of significant numbers of people.
• Do not have significant impacts on travel patterns.
• Do not have significant environmental impacts. 
Chapter 455
Land Use and Transportation
For CEs, document:
• The potential direct project impacts to resource lands (critical areas, shorelines, forest/ timber lands, mineral resource lands, farmland, scenic highways and byways, and parks and recreation lands) by completing the appropriate section of the ERS/ECS form and/or a SEPA Checklist (see Chapter 400).
• The temporary construction impacts to traffic and ways to minimize those impacts in the ERS/ECS form (see Design Manual Chapter 1010) or by completing a SEPA checklist. If the project has significant construction impacts to traffic, as defined in Design Manual Chapter 1010, attach a copy of the Transportation Management Plan to the ECS form. More detailed analysis may be needed for complex projects that do not qualify as a CE. This may include projects:
• With substantial direct land use effects (positive or negative) despite proposed mitigation (e.g., a project with a large number of right of way acquisitions or displacements).
• With substantial indirect effects (positive or negative) on land use despite proposed mitigation (e.g., a project that would cause sizable changes in planned development within the study area, or a project found to be inconsistent with planned growth).
• In fast growing areas with significant amounts of undeveloped land, where additional analysis is needed to determine probable effects (e.g., construction of a new interchange in a rural area).
455.04(2)
Analysis and documentation for NEPA
This section describes the analysis requirements and what to consider when evaluating the significance of potential impacts for actions that are subject to NEPA.
Land Use Large, complex, or environmentally controversial projects will need more detailed documentation of the land use analysis. Because the land use analysis influences many other disciplines (transportation, noise, air quality, visual, and social) it is important to thoroughly document the participants, assumptions, methodologies, results, and uncertainties to provide transparency and legal sufficiency. This may be done in a technical appendix to the environmental document. Four key areas should be documented: 1. Identify and explain key underlying assumptions (such as growth rates) and explain how those assumptions were made. 2. Describe the methods used to develop land use forecasting results. Explaining the inherent advantages and limitations in the analysis process and data sources can be especially useful in establishing a “reasoned basis” for the methodology. 3. Summarize and explain the land use analysis results including an explanation of patterns in the data, causal relationships, and anomalous or unexpected results. 4. Systematically review assumptions, data, and results to ensure internal consistency across related disciplines (noise, air quality, visual quality, and social) to make sure they do not contradict the land use analysis results.
Land Use and Transportation
Chapter 455
Growth Management Act (GMA) RCW 36.70A.070 requires that cities and counties that are subject to the GMA include a land use element in their comprehensive plan. Determine existing and planned land uses in cities and counties and how the project may affect local land use decisions.
Transportation The transportation analysis supports the Purpose and Need by providing quantitative measures that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed project. It may also provide a method of comparing the relative merits of the alternatives. The transportation analysis should consider the significance of estimated induced demand. Induced demand is the volume of traffic that is drawn to a new or expanded road by providing additional capacity. The induced demand comes from numerous sources, including trips diverted from other routes, discretionary trips that may not have been made without the service improvement, and improved access to employment and other activity locations. Induced demand may be estimated using models, such as travel or trip generation models. Although models may be used to approximate results, all models rely on assumptions and are inherently limited. Therefore, known assumptions and limitations should be documented with any modeling results. Section 24 of FHWA’s Technical Advisory TA 6640.8A states that the analysis should include:
• A review of the local comprehensive transportation and land
