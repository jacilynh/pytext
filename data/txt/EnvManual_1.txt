200.01 Introduction and overview This chapter describes how considering environmental context can inform decisions during transportation planning, and how the planning process can inform the environmental review process. It also describes the federal Planning and Environmental Linkages (PEL) process and the authorities supporting federal PEL. Transportation planning is a decision-making process that evaluates the transportation system to identify performance issues, consider alternatives, and make recommendations at a corridor, network, or subarea level. It involves engagement with the public, government agencies (federal, state, local, tribal), organizations, and various transportation interests to inform decision-making by:
• Identifying current and future transportation needs.
• Providing opportunities for the public to have a meaningful impact on plans and programs that affect them.
• Identifying environmental resources that need to be protected.
• Maximizing health, safety, and economic well-being. Federal, state, local, and tribal governments develop transportation plans that are subject to federal regulations, state laws, legislative provisos, agency guidelines and expectations, and/or local ordinances. For more information on transportation planning, see the Joint Transportation Committee Transportation Resource Manual and the Washington Transportation Plan Phase 2, Appendix A. See WSDOT’s Environmental Guidance for Planning Studies webpage for more information on integrating transportation planning and environmental review, including technical guidance for PEL teams.
200.02 Secretary’s Executive Orders, policy statements, and state requirements This section provides WSDOT Secretary’s Executive Orders and Policy Statements that direct agency planning activities related to considering environmental context. The Secretary’s Executive Order (E 1018.03) is the agency’s Environmental Policy Statement. This policy statement provides that the cultural, historic, and environmental context should be considered in all WSDOT plans. It also directs WSDOT to engage all communities that are likely to be affected by proposed transportation plans, including minority and low-income populations and those with limited English proficiency.
Chapter 200
Environmental considerations in transportation planning
The Secretary’s Executive Order (E 1102.00) directs WSDOT to protect and preserve Washington’s wetlands, to ensure no net loss of wetlands caused by department actions, and to increase the long-term quantity and quality of wetlands. Planners must identify areas of potential wetland impact as early as possible in system and corridor planning processes and use the information to inform project scoping and advance mitigation planning. A 2013 federal court injunction requires WSDOT to significantly increase efforts to remove barriers in western Washington that block salmon and steelhead from accessing upstream habitat. The injunction specifically applies to culverts in the Puget Sound and Washington coast area. More information about the injunction, a list of fish passage barriers relevant to the injunction, and WSDOT’s progress in complying with the injunction can be found in WSDOT’s Annual Fish Passage Progress Report. The Secretary’s Executive Order on Protections and Connections for High Quality Natural Habitats (E 1031.02) directs WSDOT to promote and support PEL processes that identify potentially affected fish and wildlife habitats as early as possible. This should be done during the planning process. Early consideration of fish and wildlife habitat protection and connectivity increases the likelihood that reasonable approaches can be incorporated into projects. See WSDOT’s Environmental Guidance for Planning Studies webpage for technical guidance on how to include fish and wildlife habitat connectivity information in transportation plans.
200.03 Right-sizing Transportation plans can vary greatly in size and scope. Therefore, it is important to right-size efforts to incorporate environmental information. This section describes flexible, scalable, and adaptable approaches to including environmental context in transportation plans and planning studies. Planning and environmental staff should work together to develop the best approach for the planning effort. An early review of environmental information can inform future planning level or project level decisions. Examples of planning level decisions include identifying desired performance and recommendations to close performance gaps. Examples of project level decisions include developing the Purpose and Need, refining alternatives, and identifying stakeholders and potential site-specific concerns. These efforts can also be spatially scaled, from studying a corridor to planning for service levels for a particular mode of transportation (such as Amtrak Cascades service). WSDOT develops two types of modal plans: state owned plans and state interest plans. State owned plans include recommendations for facilities or services that WSDOT owns or manages. These plans include the Highway System Plan, Ferry System Plan, and the Intercity Passenger Rail Service Plan. These plans may include recommendations for projects. State interest plans include recommendations for facilities or services that are not WSDOT owned or managed but have a statewide impact. These plans include the Active Transportation Plan, Aviation System Plan, Public Transportation Plan, Rail Plan, and Freight Systems Plan. These plans may include recommendations for WSDOT projects only. The Washington Transportation Plan, Phase 2 is a roll-up of the state owned and state interest plans and meets FHWA requirements for the long-range statewide transportation plan. This plan may include a financially constrained project list.

Chapter 200
For every transportation plan, follow:
• WSDOT’s Guidance for Considering Impacts of Climate Change in WSDOT Plans.
• WSDOT’s Community Engagement Plan and Environmental Justice (EJ) requirements, which include identifying EJ and Limited English Proficiency populations in the study area.
• Applicable state and federal laws, rules, and guidance. For plans that recommend one or more projects, use the GIS Workbench to conduct a planning-level environmental screening of the following environmental contextual factors that are associated with state highways and right of way:
• Fish passage barriers.
• Climate vulnerability.
• Stormwater facilities and retrofit priorities.
• Hazardous materials contamination sites.
• Wetland mitigation sites.
• Habitat connectivity priorities and areas with high risk of animal vehicle collisions.
• Chronic environmental deficiencies (streambank erosion risks).
• Noise walls.
• Historic bridges. Also, collect demographic data for the study area. This level of environmental screening should:
• Identify existing environmental assets that must be protected.
• Detect other key environmental factors that have the potential to influence the scope of future investments.
• Determine if additional environmental review is necessary prior to project development. The plan should describe how each of the environmental assets, public and agency involvement, and regulatory requirements influenced decision-making. However, this high-level screening does not examine the full range of environmental and social issues that may need in-depth review during site-specific project development. Additional environmental data will likely need to be collected and analyzed in more detail once potential project locations and solutions become clearer. Refer to the discipline chapters (Chapters 420 – 460) to learn more about the natural and human environmental project-level review requirements. If a planning effort is leading to a defined project, please work with your environmental staff to determine the likely environmental classification. There are two primary paths depending on the significance of anticipated future project impacts. The first path is for plans that are likely to lead to a project that will be classified as a NEPA Categorical Exclusion, SEPA Categorical Exemption, or require a SEPA checklist. Typically, these are less complex projects that do not require a formal process for defining Purpose and Need, alternatives screening, or public involvement. For these plans, conduct a planning-level environmental review that includes some or all of the relevant information in WSDOT’s Environmental Review Summary and Environmental Classification Summary database forms. The review should be right-sized for the project and include as much 
Chapter 200
Environmental considerations in transportation planning
environmental information as is useful for developing early strategies to avoid or minimize environmental impacts. The second path is for plans that are likely to recommend a large or complex transportation project that would typically require a NEPA Environmental Assessment (EA) or NEPA/SEPA Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). This includes projects that will consider alternatives and require public engagement. For these plans, we recommend following the federal Planning and Environmental Linkage (PEL) process described in Section 200.05.
200.04 Federal Planning and Environmental Linkages (PEL) WSDOT uses the phrase “federal PEL”, or simply “PEL”, to describe planning efforts that follow the requirements of one or more federal authorities for integrating planning and environmental review. These authorities are intended to increase the amount of useful and relevant information coming from the planning process. Compliance with the federal requirements described in the following sections can result in a planning product that the federal lead agency (FHWA or FTA) agrees may be adopted or used in NEPA. The definitions for “adopt” vs. “use” in NEPA are provided in Section 200.04(5). Federal PELs are generally recommended for plans or planning studies that are likely to lead to a major capital improvement or policy decision. PELs provide transportation and environmental context and can be used to make project or planning decisions. Examples of project decisions include developing a Purpose and Need statement, recommending alternatives to be evaluated in NEPA, establishing logical termini and independent utility, and identifying stakeholders. Examples of planning decisions include tolling and modal choice. WSDOT can also use PEL to recommend the NEPA classification of future projects, for example, EA or EIS. PELs are not recommended for funded projects that already have a clear solution. Instead, these projects should move directly into NEPA. The outcome of a federal PEL is incorporated into a NEPA EA or EIS. A similar process that achieves similar benefits can also be used to inform a SEPA EIS. The following sections describe the requirements and benefits of a federal PEL. See Chapter 460 for Environmental Justice requirements.
200.04(1)
Benefits of considering environmental context during planning
There are many benefits of considering the environmental context and human and natural resource trends early during transportation planning. The following is a list of some key benefits of linking planning and environment.
• Building relationships – Early consultation and collaboration with tribes, local agencies, and resource agencies improves communication and strengthens relationships.
• Improving the quality of environmental information – Early interagency and tribal coordination and data sharing helps to quickly identify environmental priorities and project constraints. It also helps ensure that the best available environmental information is used in planning decisions.
• Reducing duplication of effort – A planning-level environmental review can minimize duplication of effort by carrying forward planning decisions and analysis into the NEPA/SEPA process. This includes Purpose and Need, identification of preliminary alternatives, and the elimination of unreasonable alternatives.
Environmental considerations in transportation planning
Chapter 200
• Focusing the NEPA/SEPA review – Early identification of key environmental resources can help tailor the NEPA/SEPA environmental review (Chapter 400). These include environmentally sensitive areas and resources in the project area that have lengthy environmental clearance processes that can affect the project schedule and budget.
• Identifying potential mitigation strategies – Assessing potential impacts and coordinating with the appropriate resource agencies can help determine the types of mitigation needed. Early collaboration can also help identify mitigation partners and the types of mitigation that are available. At the planning-level, mitigation is typically discussed at a regional or watershed scale.
• Shortening permitting timelines – Building relationships with permitting agencies can help resolve differences on key issues early in the transportation planning process. This ultimately leads to streamlined permit decisions and project delivery.
• Delivering better on-the-ground outcomes – Early and continued coordinated involvement with stakeholders and the public, including historically disadvantaged populations, helps WSDOT create programs and projects that effectively serve the community’s transportation needs.
200.04(2)
PEL authorities
Federal regulations applicable to FHWA and FTA have included provisions on PEL (40 CFR 1500.4 & 1501.12) for State DOTs since 1978 when CEQ first published their NEPA regulations that encourage integrating planning and environmental processes. There are three other main authorities that support PEL:
• 23 CFR 450.318 & 450.212 – Metropolitan & statewide and nonmetropolitan transportation planning and programming. Note: The requirements in 23 CFR 450.212 (a)-(c) and 23 CFR 450.318 (a)-(d) are identical, but 23 CFR 450.318 refers to metropolitan planning and 23 CFR 450.212 refers to nonmetropolitan planning. Select and cite the appropriate authority used in the PEL or cite both authorities if applicable.
• 23 USC 168 – Integration of planning and environmental review.
• 23 USC 139 – Efficient environmental reviews for project decision-making and One Federal Decision. See PEL Authorities graphic for a visual summary of the authorities (PDF xxx). WSDOT planning and environmental staff and the federal lead (FHWA or FTA) should work together to decide which one or more PEL authorities should be used to support the planning effort. This decision is usually based on the desired outcomes for NEPA and the authority or authorities that the environmental staff believe would result in the most useful and relevant information. The PEL must clearly state which one or more authorities will be used throughout the planning effort, and the PEL must meet all requirements for the authority or authorities chosen. See Section 200.04(5) for information on adoption and use of planning products in NEPA, which can help determine which authority to use during the PEL effort.

Other offices may be involved as needed.
200.04(4)
PEL documentation
The federal requirements for PEL are written with larger, NEPA EA/EIS, projects in mind. A PEL should include enough information to show that it fulfills all of the requirements of one or more of the federal PEL authorities (see Section 200.05). The study should be right-sized, with the appropriate type and amount of analysis for use in future planning or NEPA. FHWA created a PEL questionnaire that helps with documentation and the transition from planning to NEPA. The questionnaire is consistent with the planning regulations for FHWA and FTA (23 CFR 450) and should be included in the final PEL document as an executive summary, chapter, or appendix. These questions should be used as a guide throughout the PEL process, not just completed near the end of the process. The final PEL must contain all substantive materials, for example, technical letters, memos, reports, and studies, that were used to make decisions during the PEL process. The PEL may include other content, such as:
• Purpose and Need.
• Project goals.
• Alternatives development and evaluation criteria.
• Recommended alternative(s).
• Logical termini and independent utility.
• Transportation analysis.
• Affected environment and mitigation strategies.
• Agency coordination and public involvement. The PEL objective and desired outcomes for NEPA should determine which content is relevant. 
Chapter 200
Environmental considerations in transportation planning
200.04(5)
Adoption and use of PEL planning products in NEPA
One of the main benefits of PEL is that it allows planning analyses and decisions to be carried forward into the environmental review process. This helps reduce duplication between the planning and environmental review processes which can lead to more efficient project delivery. However, it is important to remember that planning and NEPA are separate processes. The current federal authorizations for PEL define a statutory process for adopting or using PEL planning products in NEPA (23 CFR 450.212 & 450.318, 23 USC 168, 23 USC 139, and 40 CFR 1500.4 & 1501.12). The term “planning product” means a decision, analysis, study, or other documented information that is the result of an evaluation or decision-making process during transportation planning. Common examples of planning products include the establishment of a Purpose and Need Statement and the elimination of unreasonable alternatives. Refer to Chapter 400 for information on purpose and need and reasonable alternatives. To “adopt” a planning product means to take the planning product into the NEPA process where it will remain unchanged. An adopted planning product is still circulated and made available for comment with other environmental documents during NEPA, but generally the product was finalized during the PEL process and does not need to be re-evaluated. IMPORTANT: 23 USC 168 is the only PEL authority that allows planning products and decisions (for example, the Purpose and Need Statement or the elimination of unreasonable alternatives) to be adopted into the NEPA process. To “use” a planning product in NEPA means to introduce the planning product as useful and relevant information to be evaluated through the typical environmental review process. Unlike a planning product that is adopted under 23 USC 168, these products are considered ‘draft’. Examples of this include a draft Purpose and Need Statement or a recommendation to eliminate unreasonable alternatives – to use these planning products in NEPA, they would need to be circulated and subject to revision based on agency and public review. 23 CFR 450.212 & 450.318, 23 USC 139, and 40 CFR 1500.4 & 1501.12 allow planning products and decisions to be “used” in the NEPA process.
200.04(6)
Requirements for 23 USC 168
There are ten requirements that must be met for FHWA or FTA to adopt planning products into the environmental review process under PEL authority 23 USC 168. These requirements are provided in 23 USC 168(d), and listed below (paraphrased) by project phase. During planning, the federal lead agency should concur that the following are met:
• The planning product is developed through a planning process that was conducted in accordance with applicable federal law.
• The planning product is developed in consultation with the appropriate federal and state resource agencies and Native American tribes (See Section 200.04(13)).
• The planning product is the result of a planning process that included multidisciplinary consideration of systems-level or corridor-wide transportation needs and potential effects on the human and natural environment.
Environmental considerations in transportation planning
Chapter 200
• Public notice is provided that resulting planning products may be adopted during a subsequent environmental review process.
• The planning product has a rational basis centered on reliable and reasonably current data and scientific methods.
• The planning product is documented in sufficient detail to support the decision or results of the analysis and to meet requirements for use in the environmental review process. During project scoping and programming:
• The federal lead agency must agree that there is no significant new information or circumstance that has reasonable likelihood of affecting the continued validity or appropriateness of the planning product.
• The federal lead agency must agree that the planning product is appropriate for adoption and use in the environmental review process.
• The planning product must be approved no more than five years before the environmental review process is initiated. (If more than five years have passed, you must verify that the planning information is still valid, i.e., there are no significant changes, to use the information in the environmental review process). During environmental review:
• A notice of intent to incorporate a planning product must be provided. The planning product must also be provided for review and comment by the public, as well as interested federal, state, local, and tribal governments. Any resulting comments must be considered (See Sections 200.04(13) and 200.04(14)). If the planning product is necessary for a cooperating agency to issue a permit, review, or approval for the project, then there must also be concurrence with that agency (23 USC 168(d)). See Chapter 400.02(4) for more information on cooperating agencies. If the requirements under 23 USC 168(d) are met, then the planning product can be adopted into the NEPA document and any planning decisions that were made during the PEL process do not need to be re-evaluated during NEPA.
200.04(7)
Requirements for 23 CFR 450.318 & 450.212
There are six requirements that must be met for FHWA or FTA to use planning products in the environmental review process under PEL authorities 23 CFR 450.318 & 450.212. These requirements are provided in 23 CFR 450.318(a)-(d) & 23 CFR 450.212 (a)-(c) and are listed below (paraphrased) by project phase. During planning, the federal lead agency must concur that the following are met:
• The planning process involves interested state, local, tribal, and federal agencies.
• The planning products go through a public review process.
• There is a reasonable opportunity for anyone interested to comment.
• FHWA and FTA review the planning documents, as appropriate. During project scoping and programming:
• The federal lead agency must agree that decisions are documented in a form that is identifiable and available for review during the NEPA scoping process and can be appended to or referenced in the NEPA document. 
Chapter 200
Environmental considerations in transportation planning
During environmental review:
• The federal lead agency must agree that incorporating the planning products will help establish or evaluate the NEPA Purpose and Need, reasonable alternatives, impacts, or mitigation of impacts. If the requirements under 23 CFR 450.318(a)-(d) & 23 CFR 450.212 (a)-(c) are met, then the planning product can be used as relevant information to be evaluated through the typical environmental review process.
200.04(8)
Requirements for 23 USC 139
There are six requirements that must be met to eliminate unreasonable alternatives under PEL authority 23 USC 139. These requirements are provided in 23 USC 139(f)(4)(E)(ii) and are (paraphrased):
• The lead agency must independently review the alternative evaluation process.
• There is a reasonable opportunity for public review and comment.
• The eliminated alternative must be reasonably considered.
• The alternative is eliminated only after considering public comments.
• Participating and cooperating agencies must be consulted to ensure that the eliminated alternative is not necessary for compliance with NEPA.
• Agencies with jurisdiction must be consulted to ensure that the eliminated alternative is not necessary for a permit or approval. If the requirements under 23 USC 139(f)(4)(E)(ii) are met, then the planning product can be used as relevant information to be evaluated through the typical environmental review process. Note: FHWA recommends using PEL authority 23 USC 139 to eliminate alternatives because it is the most directly applicable authority for considering and eliminating unreasonable alternatives. However, if using 23 USC 139 to eliminate unreasonable alternatives, then you must also use one of the other authorities (23 CFR 450.318 & 450.212, 23 USC 168, or 40 CFR 1500.4 & 1501.12) to establish the Purpose and Need that is required for eliminating the alternatives. Ultimately, WSDOT may decide which PEL authority to use to eliminate alternatives.
200.04(9)
Requirements for 40 CFR 1500.4 and 1501.12
If you cannot meet the requirements listed in Section 200.04(7) or 200.04(8) to use the planning product in the NEPA process, then you can still introduce the planning product into the NEPA process as information that requires additional work or further action. For example, if there was no public review during the PEL process, then the planning products may still be referenced in the NEPA document and reviewed through the NEPA process in accordance with 40 CFR 1500.4(l) & 1501.12.
Environmental considerations in transportation planning
Chapter 200
To do this, WSDOT must:
• Cite the incorporated planning products within the NEPA document and briefly describe the content.
• Make the planning products reasonably available for inspection by potentially interested persons during the NEPA comment period. Proprietary data that is not available for review and comment cannot be incorporated into the NEPA document.
200.04(10)
Additional requirements applicable to all PEL Authorities
Decisions made during a PEL process must be documented in a format that can be included in the NEPA document as an appendix or by reference. A key consideration is how the PEL will meet standards established by NEPA regulations and guidance. One way to do this is to use NEPA-like language such as ‘Purpose and Need’, ‘affected environment’, and ‘environmental impacts’. Another example is to use the term ‘logical termini’ instead of ‘project area’ or ‘study area’. It is preferred to use the NEPA-like language in PEL, but if you choose to use planning terms, the PEL Questionnaire asks for the reason, definitions, and examples or a list of terms. You must also verify that the information in the planning product is still valid if using it in the environmental review process more than 5 years after the planning product’s approval. Any new information should be reviewed through the environmental review process, rather than through revisions to the approved planning product.
200.04(11)
PEL Purpose and Need
The Purpose and Need is the foundation of NEPA and the environmental decision-making process. It allows for alternative development, analysis, and selection. See Chapter 400 for more information about NEPA Purpose and Need. Federal statutes and regulations for developing a Purpose and Need Statement during transportation planning that can be applied to the NEPA process are provided 23 USC 168, 23 CFR 450.318 & 450.212, and 40 CFR 1500.4 & 1501.12. It is necessary to establish a clear Purpose and Need during PEL that is compatible with the NEPA process. In PEL, the Purpose and Need Statement can take various forms, depending on the desired outcomes of the planning study. Consult with the appropriate federal and state resource agencies and Native American tribes when developing a PEL Purpose and Need Statement. Note: The NEPA federal lead agency (FHWA or FTA) must concur on the final PEL Purpose and Need Statement for it to be adopted in NEPA. For large corridor studies, the Purpose and Need can be a general statement of the vision and goals for the corridor. This approach is recommended for PEL studies that recommend multiple projects or program-level policies or decisions. The Purpose and Need should be general enough to address the issues of each recommended project or decision, and you may need to establish a more specific Purpose and Need for each recommendation during NEPA. It is recommended to follow the requirements under 23 CFR 450.318 & 450.212 or 40 CFR 1500.4 & 1501.12 for establishing a Purpose and Need for a large corridor study that can be used and further evaluated during NEPA. Those requirements are listed in Section 200.04(7) and 200.04(9). 
Chapter 200
Environmental considerations in transportation planning
For planning studies that are leading directly to a defined project, the Purpose and Need should have the same amount of detail as one that is developed during the NEPA process. In this case, the goal is to establish a Purpose and Need that can be adopted into NEPA unchanged. To do this, follow the requirements under 23 USC 168. The requirements are listed in the Section 200.04(6). For any PEL effort, it is strongly recommended to use the NEPA term “Purpose and Need”, rather than using planning terms such as goals and objectives. 200.04(12)
Alternatives development, evaluation, and elimination of unreasonable alternatives
WSDOT may eliminate unreasonable alternatives through the PEL process by meeting the requirements in 23 CFR 450.318(a)-(d) & 450.212(a)-(c), 23 USC 168, or 23 USC 139(f)(4) (E)(ii). Unreasonable alternatives are alternatives that do not meet the Purpose and Need or are infeasible. Infeasible alternatives are alternatives with fatal flaws. Common examples of fatal flaws include alternatives that have unacceptable significant environmental impacts, excessively high costs, or are impractical from an engineering standpoint. However, there may be other types of fatal flaws identified through the PEL process. Eliminating unreasonable alternatives during PEL allows for a more efficient environmental review because those alternatives can be excluded from the detailed analysis and evaluation that occurs during NEPA. Alternatives only need to be developed to a ‘conceptual level’ for evaluation and elimination during the PEL process. This means that alternatives may be evaluated, scored, prioritized, and/or screened out without the need to advance engineering designs beyond a very conceptual project area. The requirements for eliminating unreasonable alternatives under 23 CFR 450.318 and 450.212, 23 USC 168, and 23 USC 139 are the same as those listed in Section 200.04(6), 200.04(7), and 200.04(8). REMEMBER - Use 23 USC 168 if the goal is to adopt the decision to eliminate alternatives and not re-evaluate that decision during NEPA. Note: it is strongly recommended to use the NEPA term “alternative”, rather than using planning terms such as concept, strategy, or option.
200.04(13)
Resource agency and tribal government coordination
WSDOT’s policy is to invite resource agencies and tribes with jurisdiction or permitting or approval authority to participate in the PEL process. The goal is to get concurrence with these agencies and tribes on key planning decisions, such as establishing the Purpose and Need Statement and eliminating unreasonable alternatives. However, concurrence is not required. One of the benefits of PEL is to make decisions during the planning process that do not need to be revisited during the NEPA process. This means that the PEL process is the best opportunity for stakeholders to shape future projects. Also, any resource agency and tribal government coordination that occurs during PEL counts toward NEPA/SEPA project-level scoping.

It’s especially important to engage any organization that will need to make a decision on a project resulting from a PEL effort. For example, a regulatory agency (such as the USFWS) may require a multi-year study before concluding consultation. Learning this information during the PEL process can allow WSDOT to complete the study and consultation prior to starting NEPA. This information is important for meeting the time limits in 40 CFR 1501.10 that require agencies to complete EAs within one year and EISs within two years. WSDOT may establish a resource agency or tribal committee, or a general technical advisory committee that includes any interested stakeholders with jurisdiction or expertise. However, federal PEL regulations do not require the establishment of a formal resource agency, tribal, or technical advisory group. WSDOT must consult with tribal governments on a government-to-government basis. This consultation is distinct from any invitations to participate as part of a general stakeholder advisory group. Continue requesting tribal participation until you receive a response. Tribes may accept or decline the invitation to participate or may just request to stay informed during the PEL process. WSDOT has liaisons at the USFWS, NMFS, Corps, and Ecology who can assist in the PEL consultation process as appropriate. Contact WSDOT’s ESA Liaison Program Manager to discuss the PEL effort with WSDOT’s Endangered Species Act (USFWS and NMFS) liaisons. Contact WSDOT’s Permit Liaison Program Manager to discuss the project with WSDOT’s permitting (Corps and Ecology) liaisons. WSDOT should make an extra effort to engage any agency that must make a future NEPA decision for a project resulting from the PEL effort. For example, if the PEL is leading to a project that will require a Section 404 of the Clean Water Act permit, then WSDOT should strongly encourage the Corps to be involved during the PEL process. If an invitation to participate in the PEL process is declined by a resource agency or tribe, the federal lead agency (FHWA or FTA) may still agree that the final planning products may be adopted or used in NEPA. In this case, document which agencies and tribes were invited and whether they responded to the invitation. If an agency responded to the invitation but didn’t actively participate in the PEL process, document any suggestions or comments they provided to WSDOT and how they were considered. WSDOT must document all resource agency and tribal comments, including how each comment was considered. This should be done at major concurrence points, such as establishing the Purpose and Need Statement and eliminating unreasonable alternatives. WSDOT must also provide draft and final planning products to any interested federal, state, local, and tribal governments for review and comment, even if they declined to participate in the PEL process. WSDOT must document comments on the draft and final planning products, including how each comment was considered. To use the final planning products in the NEPA process, the federal lead agency must determine that the resource agency and tribal consultation was adequate or that WSDOT provided a reasonable opportunity for resource agencies and tribes to comment.

Community Engagement
Including members of the affected community in the PEL process helps to identify issues, improve understanding of the study’s recommendations, and foster relationships with the public. WSDOT policy for community engagement is detailed in Design Manual Exhibits 210-1 through 210-4, 23 CFR 450.210, and in WSDOT’s Community Engagement Plan. Refer to Chapter 460 for Environmental Justice requirements for planning studies. The planning team determines the appropriate community engagement strategy based on the affected community’s needs and values. One recommended method for ensuring community engagement throughout the entire PEL process is to establish a community advisory group. This helps ensure public input at major concurrence points, such as establishing the Purpose and Need Statement and eliminating unreasonable alternatives. However, federal PEL regulations do not require the establishment of a formal community advisory group. If using PEL authority 23 USC 168, then WSDOT must provide public notice that resulting planning products may be adopted for use in NEPA (23 USC 168 (d)(4)). WSDOT should make planning materials available to the public throughout the PEL process. WSDOT should make additional effort to engage the public at key decision points in the process (for example, when establishing the Purpose and Need Statement and eliminating unreasonable alternatives). These are the best practices for making public comment most effective. However, at a minimum, WSDOT must provide the final PEL products to the public for review and comment. WSDOT must consider any public comments received during the PEL process. WSDOT should document each comment and how each comment was considered. Any public engagement that occurs during PEL counts toward NEPA/SEPA project-level scoping.

300.01 Introduction During the project scoping and programming phase, WSDOT develops a plan to identify and address transportation facility performance needs and creates a preliminary budget for consideration by the state legislature. The process is required by state law (RCW 47.05.010) and is limited to solving safety and operational performance needs identified in WSDOT’s modal plans, as well as addressing environmental factors. Scoping defines time and cost-of-work estimates for each proposed project. It is important that estimates be as realistic as possible and consider budget and schedule implications of environmental documentation, permitting and compliance monitoring, as well as engineering work. Programming refines and prioritizes the list of proposed projects. The process is based on the recommendations gathered during Planning from community engagement activities and the costs and schedules developed during Project Scoping. Scoping and programming fulfills the needs for WSDOT to:
• Create and submit to the legislature a ten-year investment program as defined in RCW 47.05.030. The legislature considers and approves this program along with a 2-year budget. The approved program and budget can include legislative modifications. For details, see WSDOT’s project delivery plan website.
• Create fiscally-constrained lists of projects to be submitted for inclusion on the Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) (that includes the Transportation Improvement Programs (TIP) developed by Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs)) as required by 23 CFR 450.218. Projects on the STIP are eligible for federal funding. For details on this process, see WSDOT’s STIP webpage.
Chapter 300
Project scoping and programming
Through this process:
• WSDOT creates a financially constrained list of projects for consideration by the legislature. The list is based on realistic schedules and cost estimates that include all phases of the work.
• The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) approve the STIP. A project must be included in the TIP and the STIP to be eligible for federal funding (Title 23 USC and the Federal Transit Act). For details on this process, see WSDOT’s Local Programs website.
•
The legislature considers and approves WSDOT’s 6- to 10-year Capital Improvement and Preservation Program (CIPP) along with a 2-year budget. The approved plan and budget can include legislative modifications.
300.02 Project scoping This section provides agency policies for project scoping. Chapter 400 explains the importance of public and agency outreach (public scoping) during pre-NEPA and scoping of our environmental documents. Practical Solutions is a two-part strategy that includes practical solutions planning and practical design, as defined in WSDOT Executive Order (EO) E 1090 and described in detail in Chapter 1100 of the Design Manual and the Practical Solutions planning webpage. This process defines the method WSDOT uses to scope and design projects. WSDOT’s practical design process consists of seven primary procedural steps listed below, providing the basis for modal choice, alternative development, and selection of design elements. Minimize re-work by documenting the Practical Design process in enough detail to help fulfill National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation requirements. WSDOT’s Practical Design Process Steps include: 1. Assemble an advisory team. The Project Engineer will usually invite Environmental staff to participate on the Advisory Team (see Design Manual Section 1100.04). 2. Clearly identify the baseline and contextual needs (see Design Manual Chapter 1101). 3. Identify the land use and transportation context for the project location (see Design Manual Chapter 1102), including the environmental, economic, and social demographic data that indicate livability and travel characteristics. 4. Select design controls compatible with the context (see Design Manual Chapter 1103). 5. Formulate and evaluate potential alternatives that resolve the baseline/contextual need and are bound by design controls (see Design Manual Chapter 1104). 6. Select design elements employed and/or changed by the selected alternative(s) (see Design Manual Chapter 1105). 7. Determine design element dimensions consistent with the alternatives’ performance needs, context, and design controls (see Design Manual Chapter 1106). The Basis of Design (BOD) is used to document the outcomes of applying these procedural steps. A BOD is required for all projects. The BOD should serve as the background and context for detailed environmental analysis and documentation.

Chapter 300
One of the major responsibilities of the advisory team environmental staff is to assist the team in establishing appropriate environmental measures, such as the number of square feet of impact to Category I and II wetlands. The environmental staff also ensure:
• The process, participants, and decisions made by the team comply with NEPA and State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) requirements.
• The team considers all appropriate environmental disciplines (such as Section 4(f), Section 106, ESA, noise, etc.). See the User Guide for Corridor Sketch Summaries for additional key WSDOT environmental assets to consider.
• Decisions are included in the project’s supporting documentation. During project scoping, all major costs of the project are used to prepare a realistic schedule and cost estimate. Scoping is described in the Design Manual Chapter 300. The process is documented in the Project Profile and identifies the transportation needs that have generated the project, the purpose or goal of the work, and the recommended solution. The Environmental Review Summary (ERS) is attached to the Project Profile as a part of the Project Summary package. It:
• Documents known baseline environmental conditions.
• Describes potential environmental impacts, mitigation options, and anticipated permits necessary for the project.
• Establishes project classification (see Section 300.03) and anticipated level of environmental documentation required (see Chapter 400) for the project. The Region Environmental Manager approves the ERS, which indicates concurrence with the anticipated project NEPA and/or SEPA Classification. For many projects, the WSDOT Geographic Information System (GIS) Workbench coupled with a site visit provides sufficient information to complete the ERS for projects classified as Categorical Exclusions (CEs). Additional detailed analysis may be required for projects that require an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The ERS database includes fully integrated help screens that provide detailed guidance for completing the ERS forms. Contact your Region Environmental Office or Program Management Office to get set up to work in the database. For CE level projects, the information in the ERS is exported to the Environmental Classification Summary (ECS9database and becomes the basis for NEPA/SEPA environmental documentation (see Chapter 400 for more information).
300.03 Project classification The project classification determines the anticipated level of environmental documentation required for a WSDOT project. It is based on the information contained in the ERS and can change as more information is discovered. State projects with a federal nexus are subject to NEPA and SEPA. Projects that have only state funding and no federal nexus follow SEPA guidelines. If future funding is undetermined, NEPA guidelines are usually followed so the project can qualify for federal funding in the future. See the NEPA & SEPA guidance webpage.
Chapter 300
Project scoping and programming
300.04 NEPA classifications Projects with federal dollars or approvals are subject to NEPA and fall into one of the three classifications described below. 1. NEPA Class I projects – These actions are likely to have significant impact on the environment because of their effects on land use, planned growth, development patterns, traffic volumes, travel patterns, transportation services, or natural resources. They require preparation of an EIS (see Chapter 400) because the action is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts. Projects that usually require an EIS, as defined in 23 CFR 771.115, are:
• New controlled-access freeways.
• Highway project of four or more lanes in a new location.
• New construction or extension of fixed rail transit facilities (e.g., rapid rail, light rail, commuter rail, automated guideway transit) not within the existing right of way.
• New construction or extension of a separate roadway for buses or high occupancy vehicles not located within an existing highway facility. Although examples are given, it is important to remember that the context and intensity of the potential impacts, and the level of controversy on environmental grounds, determine the need for an EIS, not the size of the project. 2. NEPA Class II projects – These actions are Categorical Exclusions (CEs). These actions are not likely to cause significant adverse environmental impacts, meet the definition contained in 40 CFR 1508.1, and are excluded from completing an EA or EIS. A completed ECS Form serves as the environmental documentation for these types of projects (see Chapter 400). Each federal agency is required to identify its own categories of actions that qualify as CEs, although all USDOT agencies agree that Class II projects typically:
• Do not induce significant impacts to planned growth or land use.
• Do not require the relocation of significant numbers of people.
• Do not have a significant impact on any natural, cultural, recreational, historic, or other resource.
• Do not involve significant air, noise, or water quality impacts.
• Do not have significant impacts on travel patterns.
• Do not otherwise, either individually or cumulatively, have significant environmental impacts. a. FHWA – CEs are described in 23 CFR 771.117. Under the 2020 CE Programmatic Agreement (PCE) with FHWA, WSDOT approves the NEPA documentation for all Class II (CE) Projects described in 23 CFR 771.117 (c) and (d). These actions normally do not require further approval or documentation by FHWA. Environmental documentation for CE projects is accomplished by completion of the ECS Form, which is approved by the Region Environmental Manager (see Chapter 400). The NEPA documentation process for Local Agencies is described in the WSDOT Local Programs NEPA Categorical Exclusions Guidebook. WSDOT may request FHWA review and signature for individual projects on a caseby-case basis (PCE - Section IV(B)(1)).

Chapter 300
b. FTA – CEs are described in 23 CFR 771.118. FTA has its own process and worksheets for documenting CEs. c. Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) – CEs are described in 23 CFR 771.116. FRA has its own process and worksheets for documenting CEs. Contact the WSDOT Rail Division Environmental Compliance Manager for assistance. d. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) – CEs are described in FAA Order 5050.4 Chapter 6. FAA has its own process for documenting CEs. 3. NEPA Class III projects – When the potential environmental impacts of a proposed project are not clearly understood, an EA is prepared. The EA determines the extent and level of environmental impact. The content and complexity of an EA will vary depending on the project. See Chapter 400 and the WSDOT Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)/Environmental Assessment (EA) Processes webpage for details on EA documentation and procedure.
300.05 SEPA classifications Chapter 400 explains WSDOT’s SEPA responsibilities and how NEPA documentation can satisfy SEPA requirements. Many of our actions are exempt from the SEPA process. If an action is not exempt, it is either found to have non-significant or significant impacts. WSDOT serves as the SEPA lead agency on actions undertaken by our agency. As such, we are required to determine the level of environmental review and documentation required for an action. The SEPA determinations fall into one of three broad categories: Determination of Significance (DS), Determination of Nonsignificance (DNS) and a Categorical Exemption (CE).
• Determination of Significance (DS) – May be issued for actions that are likely to result in a probable significant adverse environmental impact. A DS requires that an EIS be completed for the action. Note: if an action has a probable significant adverse impact, the project team may immediately begin the EIS process without issuing a DS.
• Determination of Nonsignificance (DNS) – Issued for actions that are not likely to have a significant adverse environmental impact but are not categorically exempt.
• Categorical Exemption (CE) – Covers actions identified by statute or rule that are unlikely to cause significant adverse environmental impacts. The types of projects that qualify as categorically exempt can be found in: – RCW 43.21C.035 – 43.21C.0260 – Statutory Exemptions – WAC 197-11-800 – Categorical exemptions listed in state SEPA rules. – WAC 197-11-860 – Nine categorical exemptions specific to WSDOT. – WAC 468-12-800 – WSDOT categorical exemptions based on WSDOT’s interpretation of the categorical exemptions listed in state SEPA rules.

300.06 Revision of project scope and classification See Section 400.06 for details on project re-evaluations and preparation of supplementary environmental documentation.
300.06(1)
NEPA Reclassification
A revised ECS must be processed for any major change in a project classification if the project involves federal funds or approvals (NEPA). The 2020 CE Programmatic Agreement with FHWA allows WSDOT to approve the NEPA classification. Minor changes may be handled informally.
300.06(2)
SEPA Reclassification
A significant change in the scope of a state funded project with no federal nexus (SEPA only) usually requires revision of the ERS. This may include reassessment of the environmental classification. The Region Environmental Office, in coordination with the Region Program Management Office, determines if the ERS needs to be revised and the environmental classification changed. Any changes in classification are documented by a note to the file or a follow-up memo.
300.07 Highways Over National Forest Lands WSDOT and the United States Forest Service (USFS) established procedures through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for coordination of transportation activities on national Forest lands in 1991 (updated in ). The MOU covers coordination, project programming and planning, pre-construction, rights of way, construction/reconstruction, maintenance, signs, access control, and third party occupancy. The agreement does not apply to local agency projects. Elements that pertain to environmental analysis and documentation include the stipulation that:
• WSDOT will coordinate with USFS at project inception for projects using or affecting National Forest Service lands or interests.
• WSDOT and USFS will agree on needed environmental documents and lead agency responsibilities. WSDOT will have the primary responsibility for highway related projects.
• WSDOT and USFS will cooperate in development of a single set of environmental documents for each project and jointly seek public involvement when necessary.
• Draft and final environmental documents will be circulated to each agency for review before distribution for public comment.
300.08 Project types with special requirements Fish passage and chronic environmental deficiencies (CED) projects follow a different planning and scoping process than standard transportation projects. These project types are constructed to improve fish habitat or access to fish habitat and have specific coordination and approval requirements with Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and the Tribes. Project scoping for Washington State Department of Transportation Ferries Division (WSF) projects is described in the Terminal Design Manual Chapters 200 and 205.

Fish passage projects - Fish Passage Delivery Planning
WSDOT created the fish passage program in 1991 to inventory, prioritize, and correct fish passage barriers along state highways. WSDOT corrects fish passage barriers mainly through stand-alone projects or as part of larger transportation projects. Sometimes highway barriers are corrected in partnerships with local agencies, Tribes, enhancement groups, and other project sponsors. Other barriers are corrected when culverts are replaced at the end of their useful life. WSDOT’s 2030 Fish Passage Delivery plans are available on WSDOT’s Fish Passage website. You can also find the latest Fish Passage Delivery Plan updates in the ‘Fish Passage Program Delivery’ tab (see ‘Fish Barrier Plan’ spreadsheet) in WSDOT’s Fish Passage Database. These lists include information on fish barrier corrections that are planned as stand-alone fish passage projects or through larger transportation projects.
300.08(2)
Stand-alone I-4 Funded Fish Passage Projects
These projects are part of the WSDOT Environmental Retrofit Subprogram (I-4). The sole purpose of these projects is to correct fish passage barriers. The Environmental Services Office (ESO) contracts with the WDFW’s Fish Passage Program for project support for I-4 funded, injunction barrier corrections. WDFW’s fish passage agreement does not include support for barriers corrected through larger transportation projects or barriers corrected outside of the culvert injunction case area. The Agreement is available on the ‘Fish Passage Program Delivery’ tab in WSDOT’s Fish Passage Database. The following tasks are covered by the WDFW Agreement managed by ESO’s Stream Restoration Program Manager:
• WDFW Fish Passage Biologists and engineers provide technical support
• Verify fish passage barrier status
• Verify fish species present and habitat information
• Attend interdisciplinary team site visits
• Review and comment on the preliminary hydraulic design (PHD)
• Identify fish work windows for permitting
• May provide input on design build Request for Proposals
• Biologists issue Hydraulic Project Approvals (HPAs)
• Biologists provide construction support WDFW project support biologist and engineer assignments are found in the ‘Fish Passage Program Delivery’ tab (see ‘WSDOT_Fish_Passage_WDFW_Work’ spreadsheet) of WSDOT’s Fish Passage Database. This spreadsheet also includes project assignments for WSDOT staff working on fish passage projects, including the Project Engineering Offices (PEOs), Headquarters Hydraulics engineers, and ESO Stream Restoration biologists.
Chapter 300
Project scoping and programming
Larger Transportation Projects WSDOT considers fish barrier correction for transportation projects that alter the roadway prism or add infrastructure within the existing right of way. Protect and maintain any previously corrected barriers. Use the ‘WSDOT Sites’ data layer in the GIS Workbench to locate fish passage barriers and corrected barriers within or adjacent to the planning study area. Contact WSDOT’s Stream Restoration Program Manager to verify information and determine if the fish passage inventory needs an update. Updating fish passage inventories during planning helps us identify future funding needs. Barriers corrected through larger transportation projects are permitted by WDFW Local Area Biologists, rather than WDFW Fish Passage Biologists. ESO Stream Restoration Program biologists are available to provide technical assistance and support on fish barriers corrected through larger transportation projects, including culvert injunction compliance.
300.08(3)
Chronic Environmental Deficiency (CED) Projects
A Chronic Environmental Deficiency (CED) is a site along a state highway that is adjacent to a waterbody, where recent, frequent repairs or maintenance (typically 3 times in 10 years) to WSDOT infrastructure cause adverse impacts to fish or fish habitat. These sites are often subject to frequent streambank erosion, sedimentation, flooding, washouts, or other environmental threats that if left unaddressed can require emergency repairs, result in road closures, and reduce the safety of the traveling public. In 2002 WSDOT signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with WDFW, in which WSDOT agreed to establish the CED Program. The purpose of the CED Program is to satisfy compensatory mitigation requirements under the HPA permitting process for highway maintenance activities identified in Section VIII of the MOA. The CED Program implements a specific process between WSDOT and WDFW to collaboratively develop and construct longterm solutions that reduce impacts to fish from repetitive repairs, maximize improvements to fish habitat, and meet WSDOT’s infrastructure preservation needs. To support this, WSDOT developed a funding category to provide an inventory, scoping, prioritization, and programming process for CED correction projects. The MOA was most recently updated in 2016.
Addressing Chronic Environmental Deficiencies The CED program is implemented from within the Headquarters Stream Restoration Program at WSDOT by the CED Coordinator, who oversees the inventory, assessment, scoping, and prioritization of CED projects through a collaborative process with WDFW. This process includes four general steps: 1. Nomination and analysis 2. Concept selection and stakeholder coordination 3. Project funding and implementation 4. Post-project monitoring
Project scoping and programming
Chapter 300
The CED Coordinator works closely with WSDOT Hydrology and regional staff to assess CEDs and develop project alternatives, and then facilitates a stakeholder concurrence process with WDFW to select a preferred solution for CED correction projects. When funds are designated for a CED project, WSDOT regional staff become responsible for overseeing its design and construction. Two project documents are produced by the CED program that document the proposed conceptual designs and agreement with WDFW on a proposed CED solution. These include:
• Site and Reach Assessment prepared by a geomorphologist or hydrologist, that evaluates the processes occurring in the watershed and identifies the mechanism for failure. It discusses alternative solutions and provides a recommendation. The site and reach assessment also identifies actions to maintain the highway infrastructure until a permanent solution is constructed.
• CED Concurrence form signed by WDFW and WSDOT headquarters and regional staff. This form summarizes the considered alternatives and documents agreement with the proposed conceptual design. WSDOT documents its progress addressing CEDs in the CED Annual Report, which is published early each calendar year and distributed to WDFW and other stakeholders. More information on the CED process and links to relevant documents are located on the CED website.
CED Roles and Responsibilities The CED process involves staff throughout WSDOT, including the following headquarters and regional staff:
• Environmental Services Office (ESO) – The CED Coordinator oversees the CED program and the CED process, including CED nomination, stakeholder outreach and concurrence, prioritization, and reporting. They provide biological technical assistance and coordinate with regional staff and WDFW regarding CED nominations, conceptual designs, concurrences, and prioritization.
• Hydraulics Office – Hydrology Staff work closely with the CED coordinator to approve CED nominations and prioritize CED sites. They prepare site and reach assessments and conceptual project designs and provide technical assistance to regional staff throughout project development and implementation.
• Regional Maintenance – The Regional Maintenance Environmental Coordinator (RMEC) and Maintenance Superintendents recommend potential new CED sites, provide updates on the status of active CEDs, and assist with prioritization of CED projects.
• Regional Environmental Manager – Serves as the regional point of contact for the CED process, concurrence, and CED project implementation. They assist with regional and stakeholder coordination, and early permit coordination.
• Project Engineer – Participates in CED project pre-scoping and scoping to ensure that CED proposals are constructable and feasible.
• Regional Program Management – Scopes and programs CED construction projects and provides preliminary cost estimates.
Chapter 300
Project scoping and programming
CED Project Scoping The CED Coordinator prioritizes the project relative to other CEDs based on potential benefits to fish and aquatic habitat, risk to infrastructure and safety, maintenance burden, and WDFW and stakeholder input or partnership opportunities. The prioritization is used by the Capital Program Development and Management (CPDM) to queue projects for funding approval. As described in the MOA, WSDOT is obligated to make a good-faith effort to fund and construct CED projects and can do so using any source. Most CED projects are funded through a stand-alone retrofit program in the Highway Construction Improvement (I-4) Program. CEDs are also repaired as part of fish passage improvement projects, highway safety and mobility projects, and occasionally using other funding sources, such as emergencies, highway preservation, or through partnerships with other entities. The scoping and design process for CED projects differs depending on the funds used for construction.
CEDs Corrected using Stand-alone CED I-4 Funds 1. CPDM issues scoping instructions to regional staff each fall for priority CED projects. 2. Regional program management contacts the CED coordinator for all project documentation, and then scopes and programs the CED project based on the agreed-on conceptual design. 3. Once funding is received, the project is assigned to a Project Office for design, permitting, and construction with oversight from CED program staff.
CEDs Corrected as part of Fish Passage Correction Projects 1. The CED Coordinator works closely with ESO Fish Passage Program staff to identify planned fish barrier removal projects that are also CEDs. 2. If a concurrence form has not yet been approved for an active CED, the CED Coordinator will lead a concept selection and concurrence with WDFW and regional staff to identify and agree on an appropriate CED solution. 3. The CED problem is addressed in the Preliminary Hydraulic Design (PHD) for the Fish Barrier Removal Project. 4. The project is scoped, designed, and constructed through WSDOT’s Fish Passage process, with input from CED Coordinator. See Section 300.08(2) for more information. 5. The completed project is monitored through WSDOT’s Fish Passage Monitoring program.
Project scoping and programming
Chapter 300
CEDs Corrected during Other Transportation Projects 1. The Region contacts the CED Coordinator early during the project scoping phase to screen for active CEDs in the vicinity of the project limits. 2. The CED Coordinator notifies the Region of CEDs located in the project vicinity and determines if a reach analysis was previously prepared, and a conceptual design agreedon by WDFW. 3. The Region determines which deficiencies would be corrected during the proposed transportation project. 4. If stakeholder concurrence on a CED concept has not been completed or is out of date, the CED Coordinator initiates a reach analysis and obtains WDFW agreement on a CED project concept. 5. The Region works with the CED coordinator and hydrologist to ensure the scope is compatible with the concept in CED reach assessment and concurrence. 6. The Project Office designs, permits, and constructs the CED project as part of the transportation project, with oversight from CED program staff.
CEDs Corrected during an Emergency Repair 1. During planning of an emergency construction project, the Project Engineer or the RMEC (depending on funding source of the emergency repair) contacts the CED Coordinator to determine if a reach assessment has been completed and if a concurrence form has been signed. If so, the CED Coordinator and Hydrologist may recommend incorporating the agreed-upon CED concept into the emergency repair. 2. The Project Office determines the feasibility of constructing the proposed CED concept during the emergency response. Construction of emergency projects often occurs during high flows and challenging conditions, and at times there are funding limitations associated with emergency funds. 3. The Region works with WDFW to design and permit the project under emergency conditions with input from the CED Coordinator.
300.09 Environmental database resources 300.09(1)
WSDOT’s GIS Workbench
WSDOT’s GIS Workbench is an internal data system available for use by WSDOT staff in preparing the “Env Context” portion of the ERS. The Workbench is a user-friendly interface covering a wide range of environmental resources gathered from a variety of public agency and WSDOT sources. The database has over 500 layers of environmental and natural resource management data, in the following major data categories:
• General Reference – Transportation routes, political and administrative boundaries, major public lands, geographic reference.
Chapter 300
Project scoping and programming
• Environmental Data – Air quality, fish and wildlife, priority species and habitats, geology and soils, groundwater and wells, hazardous materials, hydrography, plants, and water quality, Fish Passage and Chronic Environmental Deficiencies. Other environmental data are included on the WSDOT Geospatial Open Data Portal and the WSDOT Online Map Center. Data on WSDOT fish passage culverts is available to all WSDOT employees through WSDOT’s Fish Passage Database and is also contained in WDFW’s Fish Passage Web Map. WDFW’s fish passage inventory protocols are described in the Fish Passage Inventory, Assessment, and Prioritization Manual (WDFW 2019). The data provided to WSDOT staff through the GIS Workbench is usually sufficient for the Project Summary’s ERS form. However, some data require field verification. For example, wetland data available from the GIS Workbench are not always reliable and may show wetlands as absent when they are present or may show wetlands as present when they are not. Field work by a qualified wetland biologist is necessary to determine the presence or absence of wetlands.
300.09(2)
Expansion of GIS Workbench
GIS resources for environmental data are expanding rapidly. WSDOT staff work with federal, state, and local agencies to maintain a collection of the best available data for statewide environmental analysis. New data resources are continuously being incorporated into the WSDOT GIS Workbench. To facilitate getting the best data into the system, contact the ESO Environmental Information Program with information about newly identified data resources.
300.09(3)
Citing a GIS Database
The GIS Workbench itself should not be cited as a data source or referenced on paper or digitally. Data source or reference citation should be specific to the exact dataset viewed using the GIS Workbench. The proper citation format for digital data is evolving, but typically includes the name of the data system, the name of the agency that maintains/updates the data, and the date of the data retrieval. If the data comes from an Internet website, the title of the site should be included with the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The citation information can be found in the Metadata (Item Description) for each Workbench dataset.

300.12 Glossary Categorical Exclusion – A NEPA action defined by a specific agency through CFR or FR that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant environmental effect (see Section 300.04). Categorical Exemption – A SEPA action defined through WAC that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant environmental effect (see Section 300.05). Federal Nexus – A project has a federal nexus when a federal agency must take an action on a project. Before the federal agency takes an action, environmental impacts must be evaluated under NEPA. Common actions that create a Federal Nexus include:
• Federal land decision required within the project area.
• Federal money is used on the project.
• Federal permits or approvals are required.

400.01 Environmental review in project development WSDOT projects transition from Transportation Planning (Chapter 200) and Project Scoping and Programming (Chapter 300) phases of the WSDOT Transportation Decision Making Process to the Environmental Review phase when the project receives federal or state funding. The Environmental Review phase includes:
• Building upon previous planning and outreach efforts to involve the public, tribes, and federal and state resource agencies in the decision-making process.
• Establishing the type of environmental documentation.
• Developing and analyzing alternatives.
• Analyzing and documenting environmental impacts.
• Selecting an alternative and making environmental commitments (work on permits begins in this phase).
• Finalizing and approving the project. The Environmental Review phase is illustrated in Exhibit 400-1.

The Environmental Review phase ends with approval of environmental documentation including:
• NEPA/SEPA (Chapter 400)
• Endangered Species Act (Chapter 436)
• Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (Chapter 456)
• Section 4(f) of the United States Department of Transportation Act (Chapter 457)
• Section 6(f) Outdoor Recreation Resources (Chapter 457) For the traditional design-bid-build project delivery process, environmental documents are finalized, then environmental permits can be issued, and the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) phase can begin. Also, if applicable, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) can approve an Access Revision Report (formerly known as an Interchange Justification Report or IJR) – refer to Design Manual Chapter 550 for a description of the required procedures, analysis, and coordination with the environmental documentation process. Contact WSDOT’s NEPA/SEPA Program Manager for questions about the environmental review process for design-build projects. WSDOT projects are required to comply with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) when those projects involve a federal action. That federal action could be an approval (land use, access break, etc.), funding, or a permit. When WSDOT initially scopes a project, it determines whether a project will require NEPA, and the likely documentation path (Exhibit 400-2). This decision is routinely made between the federal lead, Program Management, and the region/modal office.

400.02 Roles and responsibilities 400.02(1)
The Council on Environmental Quality
Congress created the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) when NEPA was passed in 1969 and signed by President Nixon in . CEQ is part of the Executive Office of the President, and it ensures that Federal agencies meet their obligations under NEPA. CEQ oversees NEPA implementation, principally by issuing regulations and guidance. CEQ also reviews and approves Federal agency NEPA procedures, approves alternative arrangements for compliance with NEPA for emergencies, and helps to resolve disputes between Federal agencies and with other governmental entities and members of the public. Another of CEQ’s major responsibilities is to develop and recommend national policies to the President that promote the improvement of environmental quality.
Chapter 400
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
400.02(2)
Environmental Protection Agency
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a responsibility under Section 309 of the Clean Air Act to review Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) prepared by other federal agencies. EPA reviews Draft EISs to identify and recommend appropriate mitigation measures and to evaluate the adequacy of the information provided in the EIS. EPA also reviews Final EISs to ensure that the lead agency has taken EPA’s comments into account. Section 309 of the Clean Air Act also requires that EPA makes their reviews public. EPA does this by posting EPA comment letters on EISs in the EIS database. EPA also provides notices of availability of EISs in the Federal Register.
400.02(3)
Lead agencies
Federal and state laws require designation of an agency to lead the environmental review process. 40 CFR 1501.7 lists factors to consider in determining federal lead agency, as well as the process for resolving lead agency disputes. The primary role of the federal NEPA lead agency is decision making. They also provide guidance and independently evaluate the adequacy of the environmental document (see 42 USC 4332(D)(ii) and 23 CFR 771.109). Guidance for determining lead agency for State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) is found in WAC 197-11-922. Federal NEPA leads are determined by considering a project’s federal nexus. A federal nexus involves a federal action including federal funding, permitting, or approval of the proposed action. Most WSDOT projects involve FHWA as the NEPA lead. Agencies may co-lead the environmental review if the project is funded by more than one federal agency or if more than one federal agency has approval responsibilities. Potential NEPA co-leads include, but are not limited to:
• Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
• Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
• Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
• National Park Service (NPS)
• US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)
• United States Coast Guard (USCG)
• United States Forest Service (USFS) Each federal agency has its own unique regulations and processes to implement NEPA. WSDOT staff is advised to contact any federal lead or co-lead agency to understand their NEPA requirements and define the role of each co-lead before settling on a strategy to complete NEPA. If your project will require a US Coast Guard Section 9 permit, refer to the MOA between the US Coast Guard and FHWA for NEPA coordination requirements (Appendix B). For local agency projects funded by FHWA, the local government agency, WSDOT, and FHWA, share co-lead agency status under NEPA. Together, the co-lead agencies approve and sign the NEPA environmental document. However, the local agency is generally the lead agency responsible for SEPA.
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
Chapter 400
WSDOT is the SEPA lead agency (WAC 197-11-926) for transportation projects it proposes on the state system. In accordance with state law, WSDOT has adopted its own rules and procedures for implementing SEPA (WAC 468-12). WSDOT’s SEPA responsibilities are based on its authority to site, design, construct and operate state transportation facilities. WSDOT signs NEPA EAs and EISs as SEPA Lead and places the documents in the SEPA Register. Federal lead agencies are required to report projects in the Federal Infrastructure Projects Permitting Dashboard within 90 calendar days of initiating a project (for example, via an EIS Notice of Intent (NOI) or Environmental Assessment (EA) Initiation Letter). See the current Federal Permitting Dashboard Reporting Standard for additional reporting requirements. Within 21 calendar days of entering a project into the permitting dashboard, the federal lead agency must invite other agencies with financial, environmental review, authorization, or other project responsibilities to become cooperating or participating agencies in NEPA (42 USC 4370m-2). The roles and responsibilities for cooperating and participating agencies are described in Section 400.02(4) and Section 400.02(5).
400.02(4)
Cooperating agencies
Under NEPA, any federal agency with jurisdiction must be asked to become a cooperating agency (Section 400.02(3)). By serving as a cooperating agency, the agency can ensure that any NEPA document needed for the project will be crafted to also satisfy the NEPA requirements for its jurisdictional responsibility. WSDOT’s policy is to invite non-federal agencies and tribes to be cooperating agencies when they have jurisdiction or special expertise. See Exhibit 400-3 for examples of potential cooperating agencies. Cooperating agencies participate in EIS or EA scoping to identify potential environmental impacts, alternatives, mitigating measures, and required permits. They review and comment on EA/EIS level projects and may also prepare special studies or share in the cost of the environmental documentation. For EIS level projects, concurrence on key milestones is required from cooperating agencies whose authorization is required for the project. The terms and requirements of agency involvement under SEPA are like that of NEPA. For regulatory guidance, see CEQ 40 CFR 1501.8, 23 CFR 771.111, WAC 197-11-408(2)(d), WAC 197-11410(1)(d), WAC 197-11-724, and WAC 197-11-920. For NEPA EISs, the lead agency, in coordination with the project sponsor and the cooperating agencies, develop a permitting timetable, identify a project point of contact, and define and agree on roles and expectations at the beginning of the project. Project teams will define the roles and expectations in a Coordination Plan. 1. Requesting Cooperation – According to CEQ regulations, federal agencies with jurisdiction must accept cooperating agency status. The federal NEPA lead can accept an agency’s decision to decline cooperating agency status if the agency’s written response to the request states that its NEPA regulations do not require an EIS in response to the proposed action (40 CFR 1501.8(c)). 2. WSDOT as a Cooperating Agency – Other agencies may ask WSDOT to become a cooperating agency for actions where WSDOT is not the lead agency. This could occur on projects when a landholding agency, such as the USFS, Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Indian Affairs, or a tribal government, proposes a project that could impact WSDOT facilities. County and municipal transportation organizations could also involve WSDOT as a cooperating agency for SEPA compliance. 
Chapter 400
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
3. Local Agencies – Local jurisdictions that receive funds through WSDOT’s Local Programs Office can be cooperating agencies as well. More information regarding Local Agencies can be found in the Local Programs NEPA Categorical Exclusions Guidebook. Exhibit 400-3

Chapter 400
Participating agencies
Federal transportation law also allows “participating agency” status. This term is unique to United States Department of Transportation’s (USDOT’s) compliance with NEPA. The intent of the participating agency is to encourage governmental agencies with an interest in the proposed project to be active participants in the NEPA EIS evaluation. Designation as a participating agency does not indicate project support. However, it does give invited agencies opportunities to provide input at key decision points in the process and allows for involvement in a project’s environmental review, coordination plan, and concurrence on project schedule. Any federal, state, tribal, regional, and local governmental agencies that may have an interest in the project should be invited to serve as participating agencies (Section 400.02(3)). Nongovernmental organizations and private entities cannot serve as participating agencies. A participating agency differs from a cooperating agency in the level of involvement that agency has in a project. An agency with jurisdiction by law or special expertise in regard to environmental impacts should be more involved, and therefore invited to be a cooperating agency. An agency with limited interest, or a small action associated with the larger project should be invited to be a participating agency. Note: a cooperating agency is also a participating agency, but a participating agency is not a cooperating agency (See FHWA Environmental Review Toolkit FAQ). Care should be taken when evaluating your list of potential participating agencies. It is not necessary to invite agencies that have only a tangential, speculative, or remote interest in the project. The same agencies listed in Exhibit 400-3 may be asked to be participating agencies. The roles and responsibilities of participating agencies include but are not limited to:
• Identifying potential environmental or socioeconomic impacts that could substantially delay or prevent an agency from granting a permit or other approval that is needed for the project.
• Participating in the NEPA process, especially regarding the development of the Purpose and Need statement; range of alternatives; methodologies; and the level of detail for the analysis of alternatives.
• Providing meaningful and timely input on unresolved issues. Expectations and commitments about agency participation should be addressed in the Coordination Plan. It is appropriate to tailor an agency’s participation to its area of interest or jurisdiction.
400.02(6)
Tribal coordination
WSDOT recognizes the sovereign rights, interest, and expertise of Tribes in the environmental review process. There are several state and federal laws regarding consultation and coordination with Tribes during environmental review. Secretary’s Executive Order 1025.01 directs WSDOT to enter Tribal Consultation with tribes who have ancestral homelands within the state boundaries, including those having reservations located outside of the state, on all decisions that may affect tribal rights and interests. The executive order is based on the Centennial Accord between the Federally Recognized Indian Tribes in Washington State and the State of Washington. The Centennial Accord is available on the Governor’s Office of Indian Affairs website. 
Chapter 400
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
Tribes can be involved in four capacities under NEPA:
• As a cooperating agency (with expertise and/or jurisdiction).
• As a participating agency on EIS projects.
• As a consulted party.
• As an affected community. See Chapter 530 and the WSDOT Model Comprehensive Tribal Consultation Process for NEPA webpage for guidance on when and how to consult with tribes during the NEPA environmental review process on projects.
400.02(7)
400.02(7)
Public involvement/community engagement
Public involvement is at the heart of NEPA, along with a systematic interdisciplinary approach. WSDOT strives to engage affected communities before, during, and after projects. This includes under-represented and under-served communities. The goal is to ensure all voices are heard, with an emphasis on the fair and meaningful involvement all people. FHWA and FTA’s regulations reinforce the idea that public involvement is essential to the project development process (23 CFR 771.105(d)). For projects requiring an EA or EIS, NEPA and SEPA require notification and circulation of environmental documents to allow consideration of public input before decisions are made. Lack of public notice can justify an appeal of the procedural aspects of NEPA and SEPA processes and delay projects. For exempt projects (Categorical Exclusions (CEs)), there are no public notice requirements for NEPA or SEPA, but open houses, newsletters, and other virtual or in person public outreach are encouraged for any transportation projects. The project’s complexity and/or level of controversy should be used to judge the right amount of public involvement. WSDOT’s agency guidance on public involvement is detailed in Design Manual Exhibits 210-1 through 210-4 and in WSDOT’s Community Engagement Plan.
400.02(8)
WSDOT internal roles and responsibilities
See the NEPA/SEPA Documentation Roles and Responsibility Table for a summary of WSDOT and FHWA NEPA/SEPA agency and staff roles and responsibilities.
Projects with WSDOT as the Lead Agency When WSDOT is the lead agency, the region and modal offices lead the project, manage the process, and conduct the analysis. ESO supports the region and modal offices by developing policies, programs, and initiatives to implement the agency’s environmental policy and to assist with project delivery. The ESO Director is the Responsible Official for all NEPA EIS/EAs and SEPA EISs in draft, final, supplemental and adoption formats. This applies to all projects where WSDOT is the lead agency, including ferry and rail projects.
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
Chapter 400
Projects with a Local Public Agency as the Lead Agency Local Programs Office oversees the distribution of federal funds to cities and counties. The Local Programs office reviews NEPA environmental documents submitted by local governments for approval by FHWA. The Local Agency Guidelines M 36-63 provides more details on NEPA and SEPA procedures for local government projects.
400.03 Identifying the type of environmental document Projects are classified for environmental review during Project Scoping (See Chapter 300). This process is documented using WSDOT’s Environmental Review Summary (ERS) for WSDOT-led projects. Local agency scoping is handled differently, according to each local jurisdiction’s process. Chapter 300 contains a detailed description of the NEPA and SEPA classification systems. The NEPA or SEPA classification reflects the level of potential environmental impact or controversy and controls the type of environmental document as shown below.
• Class I projects require an EIS and result in a Record of Decision (ROD).
• Class II projects are Categorically Excluded from the NEPA process or Categorically Exempt from the SEPA process. For FHWA projects, NEPA Categorical Exclusions are documented with WSDOT’s Environmental Classification Summary (ECS) form. FTA and FRA use CE worksheets to document their decisions – WSDOT staff complete these worksheets for FTA/FRA review. For local agency projects see the Local Agency Guidelines M 36-63. If you need access to the appropriate form to document a NEPA CE contact the ESO NEPA/SEPA staff.
• Class III projects require a NEPA EA or a SEPA checklist to determine project impacts. Depending on level of impact indicated by these documents, an EA results in a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) or an NOI to develop an EIS (if project impacts are found to be significant). Similarly, under SEPA, a SEPA checklist leads to a Determination of NonSignificance (DNS), or a Determination of Significance (DS) and Scoping Notice to draft an EIS. (WAC 197-11-315). Over the years, WSDOT, Ecology, and the legislature have worked to align transportation project CEs under SEPA with FHWA’s NEPA CEs. However, some project development actions that are excluded from NEPA review may still require SEPA review. Likewise, some actions categorically exempt under SEPA may require additional documentation for the NEPA process.
400.04 NEPA/SEPA procedures and recent changes WSDOT’s procedures supporting these policies can be found on the NEPA & SEPA webpage. Project teams should follow the direction in this manual and follow the online procedures. The webpage allows the reader to follow a step-by-step process for completing NEPA and SEPA documentation. NEPA for transportation projects often changes with each reauthorization of federal surface transportation acts. Over the last 20 years, Congress has focused on streamlining environmental review to expedite transportation projects. USDOT agencies then update their implementing regulations, policies, and guidance. WSDOT’s NEPA/SEPA program updates our manual and websites to reflect the changes in federal law.
Chapter 400
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
In , CEQ comprehensively updated its NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1500-1508). In the proposed rulemaking (Federal Register Document 2019-28106), CEQ described the effort as intended to facilitate “more efficient, effective, and timely NEPA reviews by Federal agencies by simplifying regulatory requirements, codifying certain guidance and case law relevant to these proposed regulations, revising the regulations to reflect current technologies and agency practices, eliminating obsolete provisions, and improving the format and readability of the regulations”. The final rule became effective September 14, 2020, and applies to all new NEPA efforts starting after that date. The new rule does not apply to NEPA efforts that were already underway before September 14, 2020. Recent major changes to NEPA include creating a Coordinated Project Plan with all Participating Agencies, establishing a permitting timetable with a comprehensive schedule of completion dates, and tracking projects on a permitting dashboard. There are also several new limitations on judicial review, requiring that challenges be filed within two years of a ROD (compared to the default six-year limit), limiting litigants to only those that commented on the original NEPA, and requiring the courts to consider impacts of the court decision on jobs and the economy when issuing a project stay during litigation. In 2022, CEQ revised its NEPA regulations to restore some of the basic elements of its 1978 NEPA regulations. One of these was restoring the requirement for federal agencies to evaluate all relevant environmental impacts of projects and decisions, including cumulative effects. Note: WSDOT did not change its policies regarding cumulative effects after the 2020 rule went into effect. Instead, WSDOT continued to consider cumulative effects in NEPA documents (EAs and EISs). The 2022 rulemaking is considered ‘Phase 1’ of revisions to the 2020 CEQ NEPA regulations. CEQ anticipates a ‘Phase 2’ to begin in late 2022 to continue revisions to its 2020 regulations. Phase 2 is expected to include rule changes that further support the current Administration’s commitments to environmental justice and climate change.
400.05 Ensuring environmental document quality NEPA requires agencies to disclose environmental impacts of their decisions in a way that is understandable to the public and to decision-makers. Your project’s environmental document should be well written and technically accurate. Clear writing helps the public and agency reviewers understand the project and its impacts.
400.05(1)
Document standards and Plain Talk
WSDOT’s environmental documents follow the agency wide standards set in the Communications Manual M 3030. Documents prepared for external audiences, especially those that circulate to the public and agencies for review and comment, also must use the agency wide standards. EISs and EAs should be as concise as possible. 40 CFR 1502.7 states that the text of a final EIS shall be 150 pages or fewer. Proposals of unusual scope and complexity shall be 300 pages or fewer unless a senior agency official of the lead agency approves in writing a statement to exceed 300 pages and establishes a new page limit. 40 CFR 1501.5(f) states that the text of a NEPA EA shall be no more than 75 pages, not including appendices, unless a senior agency official approves in writing an assessment to exceed 75 pages and establishes
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
Chapter 400
a new page limit. Ecology’s SEPA handbook states that SEPA EISs should not exceed 75 pages unless the proposal is of unusual scope or complexity, in which case it may not exceed 150 pages. Page limits serve as useful reminders that the objective is to summarize the relevant information and not to include every detail. The main body of the document should focus on what is relevant to the decision and include enough information to support the decision without having to refer to additional supporting materials. Note: These page limits apply only to text. Graphics, figures, and tables do not count toward the page limit for EAs and EISs (see FHWA memorandum and 40 CFR 1502.7). Supporting materials for technical and legal reviewers, such as technical memos and discipline reports, correspondence, public and agency comments, etc., should be provided in the appendices, or incorporated by reference. Guidance for determining when, and procedures for how, to write discipline reports can be found on the NEPA & SEPA webpage. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials’ (AASHTO’s) Handbook on Preparing High-Quality NEPA Documents for Transportation Projects is an excellent resource. The handbook focuses on the preparation of EISs and EAs, but many of the tips in the handbook also apply to CEs. Discipline reports, intended for specific technical audiences, do not need to adhere to the standard reader friendly format. However, they should be clearly written following the plain language principles (EO 05-03). ESO’s NEPA Specialist has access to examples of reader friendly environmental documents and can provide those to others upon request. National examples of high-quality NEPA documents are posted on AASHTO’s Center for Environmental Excellence.
400.05(2)
Publication standard messages
Several standard messages must be included in all environmental documents to meet federal requirements. Standard messages include:
• Availability of environmental document
• Title VI information and policy
• Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) information and policy Consultant logos are not allowed in WSDOT environmental documents because those documents are owned by the agency.
400.05(3)
Document accessibility
Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC 794 d) requires state agencies that received federal funds to provide accessible websites and documents. There are currently no requirements to make graphics with NEPA documents Section 508 compliant. See Web Accessibility and Section 508 webpage for guidance on making webpages and pdfs accessible.
Chapter 400
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
400.06 Using existing environmental documents CEQ’s NEPA regulations and SEPA rules allow the use of existing documents to reduce duplication and unnecessary paperwork (RCW 43.21C.034 and WAC 197-11-600). If an analysis has already been done for the proposed project or a similar project, use it if it is still up to date. Existing documents can be used in any of the following ways:
• Adoption (40 CFR 1506.3 and WAC 197-11-630)
• Addendum (40 CFR 1502.9 and WAC 197-11-625)
• Incorporation by Reference (40 CFR 1501.12 and WAC 197-11-635)
• Supplemental EIS (40 CFR 1502.9 and WAC 197-11-620)
400.06(1)
Re-evaluations
1. NEPA – WSDOT conducts NEPA re-evaluations, in compliance with 23 CFR 771.129130 and 2019 Joint NEPA Re-evaluation Guidance for FHWA, FRA and FTA, when it is necessary to determine whether existing documents adequately address environmental impacts of a project. It is important to have conversations early with the federal NEPA lead agencies to determine if a formal re-evaluation is required. In practice, WSDOT and FHWA re-evaluate the NEPA documentation when:
• WSDOT re-evaluates NEPA documents if major steps to advance the action have not occurred within three years of the most recent Federal action. In other words, the three-year clock starts over every time FHWA takes an action. Following approval of the FHWA decision document (CE, ROD, or FONSI), WSDOT must consult with FHWA prior to further FHWA approvals (such as authority to undertake final design, acquisition of a significant portion of right of way, or approval of the PS&E) to determine if the NEPA document is still valid.
• There is a substantial change in regulations, existing conditions, project scope, or proposed action, and it is uncertain if a supplemental environmental document is required. These changes will need to be addressed regardless of the time since the last FHWA approval. Examples include added access likely to require a review of the traffic, air quality and noise impacts, or shifts in alignment. Likewise, changes in ESA-listed species that are impacted by the project may create the need to develop a supplemental environmental document.
• Major steps to advance the project (such as right of way or construction funding authorizations) have not occurred within three years of a ROD, FONSI, or issuance of the environmental document. Factors that may contribute to the need for a re-evaluation include an outdated traffic analysis (affecting the noise and air analysis) or wetland delineation. WSDOT or the federal NEPA lead can initiate a NEPA re-evaluation. FHWA will likely re-evaluate environmental documentation at key points of the project development: Final Design, Right of Way Acquisition, and Construction. The FHWA Area Engineer may make an informal note to the project file or request that the project office complete a formal re-evaluation.
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
Chapter 400
For CEs, project changes can typically be documented with a new categorical exclusion. There is no required format for a written re-evaluation. Check with the federal NEPA lead to ensure you are following their procedures. For FHWA, re-evaluations can be documented with a letter, memo, or in the ERS/ECS database within the Environmental Documentation tab (when printed, Part 2 of the ECS form will identify the document as a reevaluation). When determining which method to use, consider how much explanation is needed, how extensive the changes are, and whether action has already been taken on the project (e.g., acquisition). Answers to relevant questions in a NEPA re-evaluation should be brief and to the point. A two to three sentence explanation may be adequate. However, project teams should incorporate as much additional information as required to explain changes in environmental impacts and support conclusions. The re-evaluation needs to address all the environmental elements and how the impacts have or have not changed. If there are changes, the supporting updated analysis is attached to the re-evaluation showing that the new impacts are not adverse (or significant). One of the purposes of the re-evaluation is to demonstrate for the administrative record, if appropriate, that there is no need for a supplemental document and to ask the federal lead agency if they concur. Federal review and approval of the re-evaluation document is required. A re-evaluation is not a supplemental environmental document. If supplemental information is required by the FHWA Area Engineer, a re-evaluation cannot be used. 2. SEPA – (WAC 197-11, WAC 197-11-600(4), 197-11-620) SEPA requires a re-evaluation if changes occur to a project or its surroundings, or if potentially significant, new, or increased adverse environmental impacts are identified during other phases of project development. SEPA has no specific requirements for re-evaluation. The region or modal office determines if the approved environmental document or exemption designation is still valid:
• If the project changes and the analysis of new information does not change the significance of the project’s impacts, the changes are noted in an addendum to the original environmental documentation or determination.
• If project changes result in significant adverse environmental impacts, changes are documented with supplemental environmental information (i.e., through an EIS, or Supplemental EIS). The re-evaluation process is not used for CEs. Project changes are documented with a new categorical exemption or an addendum may be used if changes do not substantially change the analysis of significant impacts and alternatives and do not result in any new significant adverse impacts (WAC 197-11-600(4)(c) and 625).

Supplemental documents
Supplemental documents are drafted when existing environmental documents don’t cover the full breadth or scope of impacts of a project. Supplemental documents are generally required (23 CFR 771.130 and 40 CFR 1502.9):
• When there is a substantial change in the project scope.
• If the project’s selected alternative changes.
• When a new alternative outside the scope of the ones considered in the original analysis is being considered.
• When impacts or mitigation requirements have substantially changed since issuance of the environmental documents. The FHWA Area Engineer or other federal lead will determine when a NEPA supplemental document is required. NEPA supplemental documents include a Supplemental DEIS (SDEIS) or Supplemental FEIS (SFEIS). A new DEIS may be warranted if, for example, there has been a fundamental change in the Purpose and Need. EAs can also be supplemented by following the same rules. SEPA supplemental documents include a Supplemental EIS (SEIS), or an addendum to a DEIS or FEIS (WAC 197-11-620). Scoping is not required for a SEPA SEIS or supplementing and adopting an EA, but it is required for a new DEIS. There is no required format for a supplemental NEPA EIS. Because the process is like that of an EIS, there is a Draft and a Final SEIS. However, the FHWA Technical Advisory T 6640.8A on pages 49 and 50 directs that the following information be supplied:
• Sufficient information to briefly describe the proposed action.
• The reason why the SEIS is being prepared.
• Status of a previous DEIS or FEIS.
• Only address changes that required the SEIS to be written and new information that was not available.
• Reference and summarize previous EIS as appropriate.
• Update status of compliance with NEPA and the results of any re-evaluations. Supplemental environmental documents shall be reviewed and distributed in the same manner as the original DEIS. See the WSDOT NEPA & SEPA guidance webpage for guidance.
400.06(3)
Using NEPA documents for SEPA
All WSDOT projects with a federal nexus must consider NEPA and SEPA documentation requirements. WSDOT’s procedures align NEPA and SEPA so that WSDOT’s NEPA documentation meets the requirements of SEPA. If a project does not trigger NEPA, then WSDOT will still need to comply with SEPA requirements using the direction in this chapter. If a NEPA EIS is prepared, then a SEPA EIS is not required (RCW 43.21C.150 and WAC 197-11-610(3)). The NEPA EIS documentation satisfies all SEPA requirements and there is no need to formally adopt the NEPA EIS for SEPA. SEPA-only EISs for state transportation projects are very rare. Significant impacts are likely to involve federal permits or approvals, thus triggering NEPA.
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
Chapter 400
A NEPA EA is the functional equivalent of the SEPA checklist. For SEPA compliance, we recommend WSDOT projects issue a DNS concurrent with the EA, but no separate SEPA checklist is necessary (WAC 197-11-610(2)). Any major changes that occur with the issuance of the FONSI must be reflected in the project file – a memo will suffice. WSDOT uses the ECS form to document NEPA CEs. SEPA allows the lead agency to use NEPA documents instead of preparing a SEPA checklist (WAC 197-11-610(2)) - for WSDOT projects, the ECS is that document. If a project is a NEPA CE, complete the NEPA ECS form and no additional SEPA documentation is required. At the discretion of the project team, a SEPA checklist may be used to supplement the ECS form. The DNS, along with the ECS or a SEPA checklist, would then be sent out for public review as determined appropriate by the project team. See Section 400.08(2) for more information on SEPA checklists.
400.07 Documenting an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) An EIS is prepared for projects that are likely to significantly affect the environment or when there is substantial controversy on environmental grounds. The EIS process is similar for both NEPA and SEPA. See the NEPA & SEPA webpage for step-by-step guidance. If you are considering using a Programmatic or Tier 1 EA/EIS for a broad strategic program, plan, or policy level decision (not project site-specific) make sure you discuss this in the NEPA Strategy Meeting with ESO.
400.07(1)
Scoping process
To determine the scope of issues relating to a proposed action, a NEPA EIS must go through a scoping process (40 CFR 1501.9, 23 CFR 771, 23 CFR 771.123, WAC 197-11-408). Scoping is not required for a NEPA supplemental EIS; however, the co-lead agencies may decide to hold an open house early in the supplemental EIS process. Scoping may be helpful during the preparation of an EA, but it is not required. The purposes of scoping are:
• To present the project Purpose and Need and solicit comments.
• To present the range of alternatives that will be considered in the environmental document and solicit comments.
• To initiate the public involvement process, invite, and solicit comments from affected persons, businesses, organizations, agencies, and tribes.
• To identify potential environmental impacts and benefits of the proposed action.
• Begin documenting the rationale for subsequent decisions. It is important to keep in mind that USDOT funding or policy changes can change or add new requirements to NEPA. Guidance for how to design the scoping process and on new NEPA regulations is provided on the NEPA & SEPA guidance webpage. Essential elements of scoping 1. Notice of Intent (NOI) – NEPA CEQ regulations require that an NOI to prepare an EIS be published in the Federal Register prior to initiating EIS scoping. Project teams may include the scoping notice in the NOI. Once complete, the federal lead sends the NOI to be published in the Federal Register. 40 CFR 1501.10 states that agencies shall complete EISs within 2 years unless a senior agency official of the lead agency approves a longer 
Chapter 400
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
period in writing and establishes a new time limit. Two years is measured from the date of the issuance of the NOI to the date a ROD is signed. Include a notice statement in the DEIS that a combined FEIS/ROD might be prepared. 2. Coordination plan – 23 USC 139(g)(1)(A) requires the development of a coordination plan for public and agency participation in, and comment on, the environmental review process. The coordination plan is developed no more than 90 days after publication of the NOI. 23 USC 139(g)(1)(B)(i) requires that a schedule for the completion of the environmental review process be included as part of the coordination plan. Concurrence on the project schedule from each of the project’s participating agencies is required. 3. Purpose and need statement – The Purpose and Need Statement explains the importance of and reason for the project. It demonstrates problems that exist or will exist if a project is not implemented. The Purpose and Need Statement drives the process for alternative development, analysis, and selection. It should clearly demonstrate that a “need” exists and should define the “need” in terms understandable to the public such as mobility, safety, or economic development. WSDOT considers multimodal and environmental context and assets in a project’s need. The lead agency makes the final decision on the project’s Purpose and Need. However, they must provide opportunities for participating agencies and the public to comment on the Purpose and Need, and they must consider the input provided by these groups. The opportunity for involvement occurs during EIS scoping. FHWA guidance on developing a draft Purpose and Need statement is found on their Environmental Review Toolkit website. Also see AASHTO Practitioner’s Handbook 07 on defining the Purpose and Need. 4. Alternatives to the proposal – The environmental document includes a comparison of impacts for different alternatives to the proposal. An EIS must discuss the No-Build alternative and a reasonable range of build alternatives that are feasible and meet the Purpose and Need for the proposed action. Although the lead agencies make the final decision on the project’s range of alternatives, they must provide opportunities for involvement by participating and cooperating agencies and the public. The opportunity for involvement occurs during EIS scoping. Comments and responses are documented during the scoping process. The DEIS evaluates the alternatives to the action and discusses why other alternatives, that may have been initially considered, were eliminated from further study. a. NEPA criteria for alternatives – The No-Build alternative must be included and serves as the baseline condition for comparison of all other alternatives. The NoBuild alternative may include improvements that have not been constructed but are already funded in a separate project. Normal maintenance activities (such as safety improvements) that are part of routine operation of an existing roadway also may be included. Alternatives must have logical termini, independent utility, and must not restrict consideration of alternatives for other reasonably foreseeable transportation improvements (23 CFR 771.111(f)). Typical alternatives may include:
• Improvements to the existing facility.
• Multimodal transportation alternatives.
• Alternative routes and/or locations.
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
Chapter 400
• A combination of the above alternatives.
• For guidance on alternative development, see FHWA Technical Advisory T 6640.8A. b. SEPA criteria for alternatives – If a NEPA EIS is prepared, then a SEPA EIS is not required (RCW 43.21C.150 and WAC 197-11-610(3)). Still, it is useful to note that the SEPA Rules (WAC 197-11-440(5)) require an EIS to describe and present the proposal and other reasonable alternative courses of action. The use of the word reasonable is intended to limit the number and range of alternatives and the level of analysis required for each alternative. Reasonable alternatives include:
• Actions that could easily attain or approximate a proposal’s objectives at a lower environmental cost, or decreased level of environmental degradation.
• The “no action” alternative, which shall be evaluated and compared to other alternatives.
• Alternatives over which an agency has authority to control impacts, either directly or indirectly, through requirement of mitigation measures. 5. Evaluate scoping comments – All scoping comments received from the public and other agencies must be evaluated to determine the relevance of each comment. All relevant issues must be addressed in the environmental document. Lead agencies are not required to send a written response to every individual comment received. However, to maintain credibility during the environmental process, all scoping comments – whether relevant or not – need to be evaluated and addressed. Comments may be listed individually or grouped and summarized under general headings. Responses may be as simple as stating that the issue will be addressed in detail in the environmental document. If an issue raised during scoping will not be addressed in the environmental document, the response should explain the reason why it will not be included. Comments received during scoping and responses to those comments may be documented in a scoping report for the project file. Discuss the scoping process and the comments received in the section of the environmental document that describes public and agency participation and comments received. Comments and responses may also be summarized in handouts at public meetings and in newsletters. Scoping comments must be taken into consideration before developing the final Purpose and Need Statement and the range of alternatives that will be evaluated in the environmental document.
400.07(2)
Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS)
A DEIS identifies project alternatives, which are compared to each other to present an analysis of the alternatives’ relative impacts on the environment. It may identify a recommended course of action if one alternative is clearly preferred by the lead agency. The DEIS summarizes the early coordination and EIS scoping process, the alternatives considered and any analysis, identifies key issues, and presents pertinent information obtained through these efforts.
Chapter 400
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
1. Affected environment – NEPA regulations (40 CFR 1502.15) require environmental documents to succinctly describe the existing environment of the area(s) to be affected or created by the proposed action. Descriptions should be no longer than is necessary for the reader to understand the relative impacts of the alternatives. Data and analysis should be commensurate with the importance of the impact, with less important material summarized, consolidated, or simply referenced. It is recommended that the description of the affected environment and the discussion of impacts and mitigation measures be combined in the same chapter of the environmental document. 2. Analysis of impacts - Direct, Indirect, and Cumulative Effects – Under CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.16) the discussion of impacts forms the scientific and analytical basis for a comparison of alternatives. The severity of potential impacts and the type, size, and location of the facility will dictate the scope of the impact analysis. Project teams may elect to complete discipline reports if additional information or technical detail is needed to support the analysis presented in the EIS or EA. These reports should be “right-sized” to adequately address the issue without over analysis. Guidance for completing a discipline report can be found on the WSDOT NEPA & SEPA webpage and on individual discipline webpages. The draft EIS should define the issues and provide a clear basis for choice among the alternatives (40 CFR 1502.14). Agencies shall:
• Rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives.
• Briefly discuss alternatives that were eliminated from detailed study and explain why they were dropped.
• Devote substantial treatment to each alternative considered in detail, including the proposed action, so reviewers may evaluate their comparative merits.
• Include a discussion of the no action alternative.
• Identify the agency’s preferred alternative or alternatives.
• Include appropriate mitigation measures not already included in the proposed action or alternatives.
• Evaluate all alternatives to a comparable level of detail. The lead agency may choose to develop the preferred alternative to a higher level of detail (23 USC 139(D)) if the preferred alternative has been identified in the document with FHWA/lead federal agency approval. FHWA allows flexibility in the level of design detail that can be added to a DEIS or FEIS. More detailed design may be necessary in order to evaluate impacts, mitigation, or issues raised by agencies or the public (FHWA Technical Advisory T 6640.8A Section V, Part E-G). The environmental document must discuss impacts on both the natural (air, water, wildlife, etc.) and built (historic, cultural, social, etc.) environment for each alternative. Impacts may be temporary, such as the short-term impacts associated with the Construction phase of a project, or permanent, such as the long-term impact of increasing runoff and contamination from a widened highway. A summary of adverse impacts remaining after mitigation should follow the discussion of all impacts.
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
Chapter 400
NEPA and SEPA require analysis of direct, indirect, and cumulative effects. See Chapter 412 for guidance on analysis of indirect and cumulative effects. Climate change implications of the project should also be discussed, as appropriate. See the WSDOT cumulative effects & climate resiliency webpage for the most recent climate change guidance and contact information. It’s important to also document the project’s beneficial effects and efforts to minimize impacts. It is recommended that the project team keep a list of adverse effects that were avoided or minimized as part of project development. As the team develops the EIS, make sure to document benefits associated with the project and clearly present them in the EIS. 3. Mitigation of impacts – The environmental document must discuss the proposed means to mitigate the identified environmental impacts. Mitigation may include:
• Avoiding the impact altogether.
• Minimizing impacts by limiting the scale of the action.
• Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected environment.
• Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations.
• Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments. 4. Publish and circulate the DEIS – Circulation of a Draft EIS is required under federal and state regulations (23 CFR 771.123, WAC 197-11-455 and WAC 468-12-455). All copies sent out during the circulation of the DEIS are free of charge. After initial circulation, a fee may be charged which is not more than the cost of printing. The project office must distribute NEPA DEISs before the document is filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for publication in the Federal Register. To ensure the document is distributed before filing, the documents should be distributed to the EPA at the same time it is distributed to the public and agencies. FHWA will post EIS projects to the permitting dashboard, as described in the Preparing an EIS procedure located on the WSDOT EIS/EA Processes webpage. The date of issuance/filing/publication of the DEIS, is the date that the EPA publishes its Notice of Availability (NOA). The date of the NOA is the date used to track the 45-day comment period. 5. Public hearing – Under NEPA, public hearings are required for all NEPA EIS projects. Under SEPA, public hearings are held when (WAC 197-11-502, 197-11-535, 468-12-510):
• The lead agency determines that a public hearing would assist in meeting its responsibility to implement the purposes and policies of SEPA.
• When two or more agencies with jurisdiction over a proposal make written requests to the lead agency within 30 days of the issuance of the draft EIS.
• When 50 or more persons residing within a jurisdiction of the lead agency, or who would be adversely affected by the environmental impacts of the proposal, make written requests to the lead agency within 30 days of issuance of the draft EIS. Refer to Design Manual Chapter 210 for hearing requirements and procedures. 
Chapter 400
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
400.07(3)
Final EIS (FEIS)
The FEIS contains WSDOT’s final recommendation and preferred alternative(s), including analysis of alternatives; lists or summarizes (by group) the comments received on the DEIS, and WSDOT’s response to them; summarizes public involvement; and describes procedures required to ensure that mitigation measures are implemented. The FEIS needs to identify specific mitigation commitments, or it needs to describe the process that will be used to finalize the mitigation commitments, why those commitments can’t currently be finalized, and the time frame in which they will be finalized. The FEIS also documents compliance with environmental laws and Executive Orders. Chapter 590 provides guidance on how to incorporate environmental commitments into project contracts. This is important for NEPA/SEPA commitments as well as regulatory permit commitments. The estimated total cost of preparing both the DEIS and FEIS must be published inside the cover of the FEIS (40 CFR 1502.11). The estimate should include the costs of agency fulltime equivalent personnel hours, contractor costs, and other direct costs. If practicable, and noted where not practicable, the estimate should include costs incurred by cooperating and participating agencies, applicants, and contractors. The FEIS is prepared after the close of the 45-day public comment period for the DEIS. Public and agency comments on the DEIS are evaluated to determine if:
• The document sufficiently identifies and analyzes the impacts and mitigation of a proposed action or if additional studies are required.
• Impacts of the preferred alternative fall within an envelope of impacts for alternatives described in the DEIS (especially if a modified or hybrid alternative is selected as preferred). 1. Review and publication of the FEIS – The FEIS is reviewed for legal sufficiency (23 CFR 771.125(b)) prior to FHWA formal approval of the document. The review is conducted by FHWA legal staff. Legal counsel has 30 days to review the document, and additional time may be required to address their comments and determine if the revisions are acceptable. The document is reviewed for compliance with FHWA and CEQ NEPA laws and regulations to minimize opportunities for procedural challenges in court. Comments are incorporated into the text and the document is signed by WSDOT. 2. Notice of Availability (NOA) and distribution of the FEIS – After approval, the region or modal office distributes copies of the FEIS or a notice that it is available (40 CFR 1502.19(d), WAC 197-11-460).
• A NEPA FEIS must be distributed before the document is filed with EPA for publication of the FEIS NOA in the Federal Register.
• A SEPA FEIS is issued within 60 days of the end of the comment period of the DEIS unless the proposal is unusually large in scope, the environmental impact associated with the proposal is unusually complex, or extensive modifications are required to respond to public comments.
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
400.07(4)
Chapter 400
Record of Decision (ROD)
Under NEPA, the lead federal agency issues a ROD following the FEIS. The ROD explains the reasons for the project decision, summarizes any mitigation measures that will be incorporated in the project, and documents any required Section 4(f) approval (40 CFR 1505.2). The ROD must be made available to the public with appropriate public notice provided as required by 40 CFR 1506.6(b). However, there is no specific requirement for publication of the ROD itself, either in the Federal Register or elsewhere. It is WSDOT’s practice to publish an NOA for the ROD in the same newspapers previously used for other project notices. A draft ROD is generally created by WSDOT for FHWA and is written based on the FEIS. The draft ROD is submitted to FHWA along with the draft FEIS during the environmental review and approval process. See the NEPA & SEPA guidance webpage for procedures. After circulation of the DEIS and consideration of comments received, the ROD should be combined with the FEIS into a single document (23 CFR 771.124), eliminating the 30-day review public review period between the final EIS and ROD, unless: 1. The FEIS makes substantial changes to the proposed action relevant to the environmental or safety concerns that were documented in the DEIS or 2. There are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns that bear on the impact of the proposed action (as compared to the DEIS). In , the USDOT issued guidance on the use of a combined FEIS/ROD and errata sheets for NEPA review. This assists with implementation of the combined FEIS/ROD process and errata sheet provisions in 49 USC 340a and 23 USC 139(n)(2).
400.08 Documenting an Environmental Assessment (EA) 400.08(1)
NEPA Environmental Assessments (EA)
1. Prepare the EA – The purpose of the EA is to determine the extent and severity of environmental impacts. As described for an EIS, the EA should be succinct, describe impacts to both the natural and built environment, and account for direct, indirect, and cumulative effects. If the analysis identifies significant environmental impacts, an EIS must be prepared. Refer to the NEPA & SEPA webpage for additional guidance on preparing an EA. a. Scoping – Scoping is recommended, but not required for an EA (40 CFR 1501.9, 23 CFR 771.119). Because scoping is optional for an EA, an NOI is not required. Advertisement of the optional scoping meeting in a local newspaper or on the project website is sufficient. For more information on the project scoping process, see Chapter 300. b. Alternatives to the proposal – The environmental document includes a comparison of impacts for different alternatives to the proposal. An EA must discuss the No-Build alternative but may include only one build alternative.
Chapter 400
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
2. Issue Notice of Availability (NOA) – (30 day public review period) After approval of an EA, the region or modal office distributes copies of the EA or a notice that an EA is available to interested parties (40 CFR 1506.6(b), WAC 197-11-460). We recommend project teams also issue a SEPA DNS concurrent with the release of the EA, since the EA functions as a SEPA checklist. Note: the SEPA DNS only has a 14-day comment period, but project teams may elect to extend that to 30 days to match the NEPA EA comment period. For procedures see the WSDOT NEPA & SEPA guidance webpage or contact the Environmental Services NEPA/SEPA Program for assistance. a. The lead agency determines if a formal public hearing is required for an EA. Factors for consideration:
• There are identified environmental issues (e.g., heavy traffic volumes on local streets, visual quality), which should be discussed in a public forum.
• WSDOT has a substantial interest in holding a hearing to further public comment and involvement.
• An agency with jurisdiction over the proposal (permitting agency) requests a hearing. 3. Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) – The federal lead issues the FONSI. The FONSI describes why the action does not have a significant impact and that further environmental evaluation is not needed. It includes or references the EA and identifies any mitigation commitments on the project. The FONSI includes any decisions or agreements that led to the FONSI. The FONSI is issued by sending an NOA to affected resource agencies, tribes, and interested public. For procedures and timing considerations see the WSDOT NEPA & SEPA guidance webpage or contact the Environmental Services NEPA/SEPA Program for assistance. 4. Time Limits – 40 CFR 1501.10 states that agencies shall complete EAs within 1 year unless a senior agency official of the lead agency approves a longer period in writing and establishes a new time limit. One year is measured from the date of agency decision to prepare an EA to the publication of the EA or FONSI.
400.08(2)
SEPA Checklist
If your project is subject to NEPA, then NEPA documentation satisfies WSDOT’s SEPA obligations (see 400.06(3) Using NEPA documents for SEPA). If your project does not trigger NEPA, then you must determine the appropriate SEPA compliance path. WSDOT’s ECS form may be used as a SEPA checklist. If a project team decides to use the SEPA checklist, refer to Ecology’s guidance for completing the checklist on its website. At WSDOT, much of the information needed to complete the SEPA checklist can be found on the GIS – Environmental Workbench. Region and modal staff use GIS to answer the SEPA checklist questions. Region and modal Environmental Managers review the ECS or SEPA checklist and determine the significance of project impacts. If the project’s adverse impacts are minor, the region issues a DNS. If the project is likely to result in significant adverse environmental impacts, the agency issues a DS and begins scoping for an EIS (see Section 400.07). However, SEPA-only EISs are very rare. Projects with significant impacts are likely to involve federal permits or approvals, thus triggering NEPA.
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
Chapter 400
Agency procedures for completing SEPA are listed in WAC 468-12. Those procedures, along with WAC 197-11, and RCW 43.21C define the SEPA process.
400.09 Categorical Exclusions/Exemptions (CEs) CEs are defined as projects that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant environmental effect (see Chapter 300 for descriptions and detailed explanation). Some projects are Categorically Excluded from the NEPA process or Categorically Exempt from the SEPA process. NEPA and SEPA identify conditions that might elevate an action from its exempt status. FHWA NEPA environmental procedures (23 CFR 771.117) describe conditions when otherwise excluded activities require further documentation to justify the exclusion. Likewise, Ecology conditions each category of exemption to describe when the exemption does not apply (WAC 197-11-800). Also, SEPA rules do not allow the use of certain exemptions in designated critical areas (WAC 197-11-908). Within WSDOT, the authority to determine that a project meets the criteria/category of being a CE rests with the region or modal Environmental Manager, and the Local Program Environmental Engineer for Local Programs projects. A CE is documented in WSDOT’s ECS database for highway projects. FTA and FRA use CE worksheets to document their decisions – WSDOT staff complete these worksheets for FTA/FRA review. Whereas FHWA has delegated some decisions regarding CEs to WSDOT, FTA and FRA have not and must sign the CE as a NEPA document.
400.09(1)
NEPA CEs (Categorical Exclusions)
Categorical Exclusions are projects that, by definition (23 CFR 771.117(a)), do not have significant environmental impacts. WSDOT has a programmatic agreement with FHWA that allows WSDOT to approve NEPA Categorical Exclusions (23 CFR 771.117(c) or “c-list” projects and 23 CFR 771.117(d) or “d-list” projects). Projects with unusual circumstances as described in 23 CFR 771.117(b) require review and approval by FHWA. D-list projects require some additional documentation to verify that the CE designation is appropriate. Subject-specific analysis should be “right-sized” to reflect the level of environmental impact. This can usually be accomplished within WSDOT’s ECS form, or with a letter to the file with a very short summary of analysis to support the CE status. This analysis should be included in the project file and attached to the NEPA documentation. Environmental documentation for c-list and d-list CE-level projects is accomplished in the ERS/ECS. A signed copy of the ECS serves as the official NEPA documentation for the project file. Guidance for completion of the form and who can sign the document is provided in ERS/ ECS online “help”. Contact HQ environmental staff for assistance if you do not have access to the ERS/ECS database. Projects that include utility installations along or across a transportation facility are typically considered c-list projects covered by 23 CFR 771.117(c)(2), although FHWA requires verification of the CE for each installation. Within the interstate system these projects also require ESA and Section 106 documentation (Utilities Manual Section 120.12) that show no impacts to their respective resources will result from the project.

400.09(2)
SEPA CEs (Categorical Exemptions)
There is no requirement to document exemptions in SEPA, but it is WSDOT’s practice to document in the ECS form to ensure SEPA was considered. SEPA categorical exemptions are listed in SEPA law (RCW 43.21C) in the State SEPA Procedures (WAC 197-11-800), within the State SEPA Procedures under Agency Specific Procedures (WAC 197-11-860), and in WSDOT’s Agency SEPA Rules (WAC 468-12-800). The region or modal Environmental Manager determines if a project is exempt from SEPA.
400.09(3)
Emergencies
According to FHWA’s Environmental Review Toolkit, most emergency work can be documented under a CE. The Toolkit section entitled How is the NEPA Process different in an Emergency? provides information on documenting emergency projects and repairs, both as a CE and if the action requires a higher level of review. Many emergency repairs involve simple solutions that don’t require permitting and won’t impact sensitive resources. These may not even need a completed ECS form because they likely fall under various normal maintenance and repair programmatic agreements. Many emergency repairs involve simple solutions that don’t require permitting and won’t impact sensitive resources. These may not even need a completed ECS form because they likely fall under various normal maintenance and repair programmatic agreements. If there is an immediate threat to public health or safety, emergency repairs should begin as soon as it is safe to do so. Emergency repairs involving water resources (e.g., wetlands, creeks, rivers, and jurisdictional ditches) may require after-the-fact consultation and permitting once the imminent threat has subsided (e.g., landslide or undermined / lost roadway section). These activities can almost always be classified as CEs under 23 CFR 771.117(c)(9) or other applicable c-listed categories. This documentation often occurs after the event and after the repair is made. Most Emergency Relief projects and emergency repairs qualify as a categorical exclusion under 23 CFR 771.117(c)(9), which includes the repair, reconstruction, restoration, retrofitting, or replacement of eligible facilities if the work:
• Occurs within the existing right-of-way.
• Conforms to the pre-existing design, function, and location as the original.
• Is commenced within two years of the date of disaster. Emergencies may also prompt permanent repairs to restore the roadway to its pre-disaster condition (e.g., permanent restoration), which could involve other non-emergency actions like removing a fish barrier. This type of work may start after environmental documentation and permitting is complete. In either of the scenarios above, the project team will consult with applicable local, state, federal, or tribal agencies to determine the appropriate path forward. Although some repair actions qualify as NEPA CEs, the exclusion does not apply to other regulations such as the ESA, Section 106, the Clean Water Act, or Section 4(f). There are different criteria for each of these in emergency situations, where what constitutes an emergency varies based on the regulation. See the FHWA’s Environmental Review Toolkit for more information.

Statute of Limitations
1. NEPA Statute of Limitations (SOL) – 23 CFR 771.139 establishes a 150-day statute of limitations on claims against USDOT and other federal agencies for permits, licenses, or approval actions taken by a federal agency if:
• The action relates to a highway project funded or approved by FHWA.
• A statute of limitations notification was published in the Federal Register announcing the action.
• The action is final under the federal law. If no statute of limitations notice is published, the period for filing claims is determined by the applicable Federal law. If no statute of limitations is specified, then a 6-year claims period applies. It is WSDOT’s policy to publish a Statute of Limitations (SOL) notice in the Federal Register to expedite the resolution of issues affecting transportation projects. Typically, an SOL will be issued for all EISs and EAs. An SOL should also be issued for CEs that have known controversy. 2. SEPA Notice of Action Taken (NAT) – This is an optional process for the purpose of limiting potential court challenges of an environmental document. Publishing a NAT limits the appeal period to 21 days after the last newspaper publication of the NAT. WSDOT’s practice is to publish a NAT any time there is reason to believe challenges to the environmental document will be filed. Substantial controversy or known threats of challenges by project opponents are indicators that judicial review is likely. By limiting appeals to a certain time period, project schedules are less likely to be disrupted. The decision to publish a NAT is made by the project office. Normally the Environmental Manager of a region or modal office will write and sign the NAT. RCW 43.21C.080 describes the process for publishing the NAT.
400.10(2)
Administrative record
The administrative record is a formal catalogue documenting the agency’s decision-making process for a project and is required when a project challenge will be resolved in the courts. It reflects the project history, environmental evaluation, and prior decisions. A good administrative record shows the public and the courts that project decisions were not made in an arbitrary and capricious manner. It is important to include electronic and paper records that support why project decisions were made, as well as agency and public comments and responses to comments to document how opposing views were considered. Individuals (region, modal, and HQ environmental staff) who have participated in and supported decision-making should maintain electronic and paper files appropriately. You must maintain the records that support your administrative decision before, or at the same time as, the decision. It is not appropriate to reconstruct a record after a decision is made. This section identifies the appropriate content and structure of an administrative record. More procedures and helpful guidance on maintaining an Administrative Record can be found on the NEPA & SEPA webpage. 
Chapter 400
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
1. When to prepare a formal administrative record – All projects must be documented to support key decisions. A formal administrative record must be prepared for projects requiring an EIS where substantial controversy exists or in the likelihood of a legal challenge. Formal documentation is optional for other projects. Project files on all projects should be kept in an orderly manner throughout the life of the project, whether an administrative record is prepared. As decisions are made on the project, they should be recorded and filed. 2. Who prepares an administrative record – Preparing an administrative record is a collaborative effort between the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) and the WSDOT project team. In many cases the Federal Lead agency may also be named in a legal challenge, in which case the State’s AG will work with the Federal agency’s legal counsel to compile the administrative record. If the Federal agency is named as a defendant, the case will usually be defended by the US Attorney in Federal court. The AGs Office is ultimately responsible for defending our decisions in court. As such, project teams should give the AGO due deference in determining what should go into the record. Once documents are identified and organized by the project team, the AGO will determine the contents of the Administrative Record. 3. Administrative record contents – An administrative record should contain all federal, state, regional, or local actions. These include corridor approval, corridor adoption, design approval, and region-approved transportation master plans or programs. It may also contain other related material. Project teams can support the administrative record by:
• Documenting the decisions on how it approached environmental review and the information that supported those decisions.
• Including the name of the project in the subject line of emails related to the project.
• Keeping track of your individual emails and files that show a change in direction for a project – you do not need to save every email about a project if it doesn’t add substantive merit to the record (e.g., meeting logistics, side notes tacked onto an email string that aren’t relevant to the subject matter of the communication). Although you must keep relevant information, it is okay to clean your email folders of items that are not substantive.
• Retaining Substantive emails that contain direction on a course of action. These emails are public records – DO NOT DELETE THEM.
• Realizing the project team is the focal point for retaining project records. (Keep in mind that public record requests are different from the administrative record.) The administrative record of an EIS should contain the following elements, as applicable, in chronological order:
• Table of contents
• Project prospectus
• Environmental Classification Summary (ECS)
• Regional transportation plans or studies
• Route studies
• Notice of Intent (NOI)
• Minutes of EIS scoping meeting(s)
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
Chapter 400
• Discipline specific and Interdisciplinary Team meeting minutes and recommendations
• Agency meeting minutes and phone call summaries
• Comments from public open houses
• Public hearing transcript
• Correspondence from agencies or the public and responses to them (both letters and emails)
• Interoffice communications relating to project development
• Discipline reports
• Draft and final EIS
• Copy of all references cited in the DEIS and FEIS
• Official notices
• Record of Decision (ROD)
• Corridor, design, and access plan approvals
• Affidavit of publication of Notice of Action Taken (NAT)
• Other relevant evidence such as local zoning or planning reports, government studies, questionnaires, or university studies The administrative record need not include every item in the project file. Generally, items that do not relate to a major project decision should not be included. Project teams should consult with the Attorney General’s Office to determine if the project will need an administrative record. If the AG’s Office recommends that an administrative record be prepared, the project team should coordinate closely with an Assistant Attorney General when preparing the record.
400.10(3)
Reporting Requirements
23 USC 157 requires lead agencies to report the number of CEs (c-list and d-list, separately), EAs, and EISs issued each year, as well as the number of d-list CEs, EAs, and EISs that were pending at the time of reporting, and the length of time it took to complete each EA and EIS. For EAs and EISs that were pending at the time of reporting, the lead agency must also report the percentage of the proposed actions that have identified funding and all other required federal, state, and local activities that are completed (i.e., only remaining approval is the approval of NEPA itself).
400.11 Applicable statutes and regulations 400.11(1)
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)
President Nixon signed NEPA in  as the “national charter for protection of the environment” (PL 91 190, as amended). The intent of NEPA (40 CFR 1500 – 1508) is to help public officials make decisions that are based on an understanding of environmental consequences, and take actions that protect, restore, and enhance the environment. NEPA procedures also inform the public of the environmental information before federal actions or decisions are made. NEPA implementing regulations applicable to all federally aided projects were developed by the CEQ and are codified as 40 CFR 1500 – 1508. FHWA regulations applicable to federally aided highway projects are codified as 23 CFR 771 and 23 USC 139.

400.11(2)
Other Federal Environmental Statutes
In addition to NEPA, there are several other federal statutes that govern federal-aid highway projects. FHWA and other federal leads require documentation of compliance with the following laws prior to completing NEPA (i.e., approval of the ECS, or publishing a FONSI or FEIS) for a project. 1. Endangered Species Act – Section 7 of ESA requires federal agencies to confer with the US Fish and Wildlife Service or National Marine Fisheries Service (see Chapter 436 for details). 2. Section 106 – Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act applies to transportation projects affecting historic property listed on or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (see Chapter 456 for details). 3. Section 4(f) Evaluation – Projects requiring funding or approval from a USDOT agency must comply with Section 4(f) of the USDOT Act of 1966 which established the requirement for consideration of park and recreational lands, wildlife and waterfowl refuges, and historic sites when siting transportation facilities. The law, codified in 49 USC 303 and 23 USC 138, is implemented by the FHWA through 23 CFR 774 (see Chapter 457 for details). 4. Section 6(f) – Outdoor Recreation Resources – Section 6(f) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) Act of 1965 prohibits the conversion of property acquired or developed with LWCFA grant funds to a non-recreational purpose without the approval of the NPS (see Chapters 455 and 457 for details). 5. Title VI – Under 49 CFR 21.5 a recipient may not select a site or location of a facility if the purpose of that selection, or its effect when made, is to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program or activity to which this rule applies, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin.
400.11(3)
State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA)
SEPA (RCW 43.21C), adopted in 1971, directs state and local decision makers to consider the environmental consequences of their actions. State SEPA Rules are maintained by the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology). The SEPA Rules (WAC 197-11), and Ecology’s guidance, the SEPA Handbook, are posted on the Ecology SEPA webpage. The WSDOT’s Agency SEPA procedures (WAC 468-12, as amended) are located at the Office of the Code Reviser website.

Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
400.13 Glossary Categorical Exclusion/Exemption – An action that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant environmental effect, as defined in NEPA/SEPA regulations, and is classified as excluded (NEPA) or exempt (SEPA) from requirements to prepare an EA/SEPA checklist or EIS. See Sections 300.04 and 300.05. Cumulative Effect – Effects on the environment that result from the incremental effects of the action when added to other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions, regardless of what agency or person undertakes such other actions. Cumulative effects can result from individually minor but collectively significant actions taking place over a period of time (40 CFR 1508.8). See Chapter 412 for additional guidance on cumulative effects. Degree (of Significance) – In considering the degree of the effects, consider:
• Short- and long-term effects.
• Beneficial and adverse effects.
• Effects on public health and safety.
• Effects that would violate Federal, State, Tribal, or local law protecting the environment. Direct Effect – Direct effects are caused by the proposed action and occur at the same time and place. Direct effects may occur during construction or operation of the project. Effects may be ecological, aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health related. (40 CFR 1508.8). Discipline Report – A detailed WSDOT report or memo to document the environmental analysis in the rare cases where the environmental impacts are so substantial, the required analysis is so complex, or the pertinent dataset is so large, that the analysis cannot reasonably be included within the environmental document. A discipline report is typically included in the appendix of the environmental document. A discipline report may also be written if the subject specific analysis is needed to support some other permit or approval requirement independent of the NEPA/SEPA process. Effects (or Impacts) – Changes to the human environment that are from the proposed action or alternatives that are reasonably foreseeable, including direct effects, indirect effects, and cumulative effects. Effects include ecological (such as the effects on natural resources and on the components, structures, and functioning of affected ecosystems), aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, social, or health, whether direct, indirect, or cumulative. Effects may also include those resulting from actions which may have both beneficial and detrimental effects, even if on balance the agency believes that the effects will be beneficial. (40 CFR 1508.1). Environmental Document – Includes documents prepared in response to state and federal environmental requirements such as: Environmental Impact Statements (NEPA and SEPA), Environmental Assessments (NEPA), SEPA Threshold Determinations (DS, DNS, and MDNS) and associated SEPA checklists, Section 4(f) Evaluations, Section 106 Reports, Environmental Justice Reports, and other documents. Environmental Review – Is the consideration of environmental factors required by NEPA and SEPA. The “environmental review process” is the procedure used by agencies and others to consider the environment in decision making.
Environmental review (NEPA/SEPA) and transportation decision making
Chapter 400
Federal Nexus – A determination that a federal agency:
• Is a proponent of a specified proposal (usually by providing funding)
• Must issue a federal approval (for example a permit, license, or other entitlement such as a request to use federal funds or federal land) for the proposal to proceed. A federal nexus (even on an otherwise non-federal proposal) typically triggers the need for the federal agency or agencies to comply with various federal statutes. These include but are not limited to NEPA, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, Section 4(f) of the USDOT Act, Section 6(f) of the LWCF Act, and Section 7 of ESA. Indirect Effect (NEPA) – Indirect effects are caused by the proposed action or alternative and occur later in time or are farther removed in distance but are still reasonably foreseeable. Indirect effects may include effects related to changes in the pattern of land use, population density or growth rate, and related effects on air and water and other natural systems, including ecosystems (40 CFR 1508.8). See Chapter 412 for additional guidance on indirect effects. Logical termini – Logical termini for project development are defined as (1) rational end points for a transportation improvement, and (2) rational end points for a review of the environmental impacts. The environmental impact review frequently covers a broader geographic area than the strict limits of the transportation improvements. Mitigation – NEPA (40 CFR 1508.20) and SEPA (WAC 197-11-768) mitigation means avoiding, minimizing, rectifying, rehabilitating, restoring, reducing or eliminating the environmental impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action. Mitigation can also mean compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments for those impacted by the project. Planning and Environmental Linkages (PEL) – A collaborative and integrated approach to transportation decision-making that (1) considers environmental, community, and economic goals early in the planning process, and (2) uses the information, analysis,
