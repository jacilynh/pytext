d for revisions to the agreement. When these arise, the Railroad Company and the Region Utility Engineer should be contacted early and often. Railroad Flagging All dollar amounts actually incurred by the Railroad Company for railroad flagging, under the terms of the typical railroad agreement, will be paid by WSDOT. The Contractor will incur no costs for railroad flagging unless the flagging is for the Contractor’s benefit and convenience. In this case, the Project Engineer will deduct this cost on monthly progress estimates as a below the line item in the Contract Administration and Payment System.

Public Liability and Property Damage Insurance Projects which include work on railroad right of way generally require special insurance protection. Pay particular attention to the Contract Special Provisions for project requirements because they vary from project to project. It is the responsibility of the Project Engineer to enforce the provisions. The required insurance documents are to be furnished by the Contractor (usually through the Project Engineer) to the Accounting and Financial Services Division who will (a) review the documents and (b) obtain approval of the insuring documents from the railroad company. Written notification of approval by the railroad company will be furnished to the Project Engineer by the Accounting and Financial Services Division as soon as approval is obtained. No work shall be started on railroad property until the necessary approvals have been obtained. The railroad insurance must be maintained until the date of physical completion of the project unless otherwise stated. However, the Contractor may make a written request to be relieved of the responsibility to continue all or part of the railroad protective liability insurance before the completion date under certain conditions. The details and conditions for this relief are specifically set forth in the special provisions of the contract. If the Contractor should make a request for relief, the Project Engineer should contact the Region Construction Manager and Utilities Engineer for guidance and assistance in coordinating this effort with the railroad.

Construction Under Traffic
General Under the many special conditions encountered where traffic must be moved through or around construction operations, serious problems of traffic control can occur. Most conditions are temporary and are, therefore, dangerous and difficult to deal with because they are unexpected and not in accordance with the normal pattern of highway traffic. Standard Specifications Section 1-07.23(1) requires the Contractor to conduct all operations with the least possible obstruction and inconvenience to the public and to provide adequate safeguards, safety devices, protective equipment, and any other needed actions to protect the life, health, safety, and property of the public. The responsibility to comply with these requirements is the Contractor’s. It is the Project Engineer’s responsibility to ensure that the Contractor complies. Any deviation from these requirements shall only be allowed if the Contractor has requested the deviation in writing and the Engineer has provided written approval. The Region Traffic Office should be contacted to help evaluate the deviation and determine if the requested deviation is approvable. Speed Reductions If speed reductions are considered, the Project Engineer shall follow Executive Order E 1060 and the guidance found in Traffic Manual Appendix 5B.

Temporary Breaks in Limited Access for Construction The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) cannot delegate its approval authority to add access points to existing limited access controlled Interstate facilities through the WSDOT-FHWA Stewardship Agreement. The FHWA has granted approval to break limited access in order to gain access to the worksite from adjacent properties. This approval was granted through the FHWA approval of Standard Specifications Section 1-07.16. This approval does not extend to allowing the contractor to use this access to merge construction vehicles and equipment with public traffic in the traveled way, auxiliary lanes, or shoulders. It is therefore necessary to seek approval from the FHWA when proposing to break limited access and merge construction vehicles with public traffic in the traveled way, auxiliary lanes, or shoulders. Standard Specifications Section 1-07.16 allows the contractor to access the worksite from adjacent properties but does not allow the contractor to merge construction vehicles or equipment (including contractor workforce vehicles of any type) from that access with public traffic. Standard Specifications Section 1-07.23 allows the Interstate highway system to be accessed through existing facilities or through access points allowed within the contract only. These access points allowed in the contract will either be in the form of site-specific traffic control plans or by contract provisions included in the contract documents. If the contractor proposes to merge construction vehicles with public traffic in the traveled way, auxiliary lanes or shoulders and the contract contains the General Special Provision (GSP) that allows this access, then the contractor shall submit a site-specific plan for traffic control in accordance with the MUTCD Part VI. The Region Traffic Engineer should review this plan and it should be submitted to FHWA. During construction on Interstate projects the Project Engineer will notify the appropriate Assistant State Construction Engineer (ASCE) who will forward the information to the FHWA Area Engineer and the WSDOT Access Manager by sending them a copy of the approved vicinity map showing the location of the access break and site-specific traffic control plan. FHWA approval of a PS&E containing this GSP constitutes approval of access from adjacent properties to the traveled way, auxiliary lanes or shoulders. Consultation with Region and Headquarters Design offices and approval by FHWA must occur prior to deciding to include this GSP in a contract on Interstate facilities. While some contracts may not contain provisions for breaking limited access for construction and for merging of construction vehicles with mainline and/or interchange ramp traffic, the contractor may request one. If the Region agrees and the project is on limited access-controlled Interstate, the Project Engineer shall contact the appropriate ASCE who will forward the request to the FHWA Area Engineer for approval. The ASCE will cc the Access Manager when forwarding the request to FHWA. The contractor shall submit a vicinity map showing the location of the access break, a site-specific plan for traffic control in accordance with the MUTCD Part VI, and the duration for which the accesses will be in operation. On non-interstate limited access-controlled facilities, approval will be required by the Region. If approval is granted and the facility is a limited access facility, the GSP will be added to the contract by change order. On managed access roadways the Project Engineer, with Region concurrence, has approval authority to grant the contractor temporary access, in accordance with the Standard Specifications.

Public Information and Customer Focus Most drivers still have the expectation of proceeding to their destination with little or no delay even though traffic conditions on many of our highways are deteriorating, primarily due to increased traffic volume. This increased volume may create congestion, delays, accidents, and aggressive driving during normal daily operation. Highway construction will usually require a more restricted roadway to accommodate work zones and can further reduce traffic mobility and safety. Even some of our lower volume rural highways can present a challenge due to factors such as drivers not expecting construction work and seasonal/recreational traffic increases. Construction and user delays present significant costs in addition to costs associated with crashes and worker safety. These delays and costs can be minimized by implementing a traffic control strategy based on traffic conditions and construction requirements, and which includes public information and customer focus considerations. Our goal on every highway construction project should be to provide the best overall balance of work zone safety and traffic mobility while constructing quality highway projects. Much of our effort is directed at engineering responses to safety and mobility issues and is generally included in the contract requirements. Recent customer focused highway construction studies have shown that accurate and timely project information is a valuable element in an overall traffic control strategy. Advance planning and coordination between the project engineer and contractor is necessary to ensure that there is an opportunity to provide public information for all phases of the project that impact traffic. Proper use of public information and customer focused techniques will provide safety and mobility benefits that would not otherwise be gained, as listed below:
• Alert drivers to potential delays by advance notice through project signing and the news media that would allow drivers to take alternate routes, adjust scheduled trips and have better awareness of traffic impacts and how to avoid them.
• Provide benefits to the Contractor from reduced traffic volume and better driver awareness through fewer crashes, less material delivery delay, better worker safety, fewer complaints, and overall public acceptance of the project.
• Achieve better driver acceptance, reduced aggressive driving and improved work zone credibility by minimizing delays and providing accurate and timely information.
• Consider innovative construction techniques and shorter-term intense work stages with more severe traffic restrictions, such as weekend closures, if possible.
• Closely monitor traffic conditions when traffic is restricted to determine the need for any traffic control or work hour adjustments that would improve traffic flow. Specified working hours and the accompanying traffic restrictions are critical elements of the project traffic control strategy and should not be adjusted without proper traffic analysis.
• Maintain ongoing communication during the life of the project with local law enforcement, emergency services, local agencies, transit groups, affected local businesses, etc.
• Continue use of innovative devices such as portable, changeable message signs, project information signs with information phone number and highway advisory radio systems. The Regional Construction Manager, Traffic Engineer, and Public Information Officer should be involved in the project traffic control strategy and may be able to offer assistance.

Road/Ramp Closures and Use Restrictions When it is necessary to close a road, street, or ramp, the Project Engineer shall submit a request that includes the appropriate closure/detour plan to the Region Traffic Engineer in advance of the need. Per RCW 47.48.010, the Regional Administrator may close a road, street, or ramp. With proper planning and implementation, road/ramp closures can be an effective and safe method of traffic control. As required by RCW, notice of the closure shall be published in one issue of a newspaper in the area in which the closure is to take place. Signs indicating dates and times of the closure shall be placed at each end of the Section to be closed on or before publishing the notice in the newspaper. Publishing the notice and placing of the signs shall be a minimum of three days in advance of the closure. Advance notice using local radio, portable changeable message signs or HAR may be effective in diverting traffic from the closed or impacted locations. Coordinate with the Region Public Information Officer for assistance with public notification. In cases of emergency, or closures of 8 hours or less, the road, street, or ramp may be closed without prior notice to the public. If possible, a notice should be posted one working day in advance of the closure. When planning to close or restrict use for more than 8 hours on one or both directions of mainline on Interstate systems, system to system ramps or Federal-aid Primary Routes, FHWA must be notified as shown in the table below. Use restrictions are defined as any limitation on the vehicle type, load or function of the facility. These notification requirements apply even to projects with onsite or offsite detours in place. Federal-aid Primary Routes are US routes 2, 12, 97, 101, 395 and State Routes 16, 18, 99, 167, 520, 522. FHWA notification shall be made to the following email address: washington.fhwa@dot.gov WORK Activity Interstate closures or use restrictions of 7 or more consecutive days Federal-aid Primary Routes closures or use restrictions of 7 or more consecutive days Interstate closures or use restrictions between 48 hours and 7 consecutive days Interstate closures or use restrictions between 8 hours and 48 consecutive hours

Chapter 1
Pedestrian Safety When the work area encroaches upon a sidewalk, crosswalk, or other areas that are near an area utilized by pedestrians or bicyclists, special consideration should be given to their accommodation and safety. Pedestrians are more susceptible to personal injury in work areas than are motorists. Visibility and recognition of hazards is an important requirement for the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists. Protective barricades, fencing, handrails, and bridges, together with warning and guidance devices, should be used so that pathways for pedestrians, bicyclists, equestrians, and other non-motorists are safe and well defined. Where walks are closed by construction or maintenance, an alternate walkway should be provided where feasible. Where it is necessary to divert pedestrians into the parking lane of a street, barricades and delineation should be provided to separate the pedestrian walkway from the adjacent traffic lane. Pedestrians should not be diverted into a portion of the street used by vehicular traffic. At locations where adjacent alternate walkways cannot be provided, pedestrians can be diverted across the street by placing appropriate signs at the construction limits and at the nearest crosswalk or intersection. When hazardous work conditions exist overhead, it may be necessary to install a fixed pedestrian walkway of the fence or canopy type to protect and control pedestrians. In such cases, wood and chain link fencing can be used with warning lights and illumination to warn and guide both pedestrians and motorists. These accommodations for pedestrians and bicycles should be included in Traffic Control Plans. Fences around a construction area are often necessary and may be a requirement of the local jurisdiction building code. They are often constructed in conjunction with a special pedestrian walkway or when there are deep excavations or when pedestrian access to the job site is not desirable. Installation of such fencing must consider relocation of existing control devices and facilities such as traffic signals, pedestrian signals, traffic signs, and parking meters. The use of chain link fencing which can be seen through may be needed at intersections to provide adequate sight distance. Relocating a walkway without unreasonable inconvenience to pedestrians, residents, or commercial interest, is the safest practice of all. Remember, however, that pedestrians like to “see what’s going on.” Simply denying them access does not, of itself, prevent their encroachment onto the worksite. Sometimes it is advisable to design and construct a pedestrian observation area for this purpose. SS 1-07.23(2)
Construction and Maintenance of Detours
Construction zone detours will normally be detailed in the plans. When detours not shown in the plans are required, the design will likely be done by the Project Office under the direction of the Project Engineer and requirements of the MUTCD. If the detour is a full-fledged roadway, design and traffic reviewers should check the design. Short-term minor detours may be installed and operated without formal review, but the Project Engineer must be satisfied that the facility is suitable and safe for traffic use. Existing pavement markings on asphalt pavement shall never be merely blacked out with oil or paint; this is not allowed by the MUTCD. Rather, the striped and adjacent areas should be hydroblasted, or ground in a pattern different from the original marking until the marking is no longer visible. This change in pattern minimizes the possibility that the
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-121
Chapter 1
Administration
original marking will still be visible to drivers, especially at night or in rainy weather when covered-over stripes tend to shine in contrast to the pavement. Temporary pavement marking tape, either for temporary lane marking or masking of existing markings may offer another option and approved removable tapes are listed on the Qualified Products List (QPL). Existing conflicting markings should never be allowed to remain in place. When markings remain from an alignment shift or the marking goes under a device (like barrier), the existing marking must be removed to eliminate confusion to the motorist. Temporary concrete barrier should be part of the plan design for positive protection of the work area. Barrier is not to be used as primary delineation to guide traffic. A combination of pavement markings and temporary channelization devices are to be used along with the barrier. Temporary barrier delineators must be maintained and kept clean. When delineators become covered with grime or are damaged, they become ineffective. The condition and positioning of these devices should be checked daily. SS 1-07.23(3)
Work Zone Clear Zones
When a project requires traffic control, a Work Zone Clear Zone (WZCZ) shall be established and will apply during both working and non-working hours. During nonworking hours no equipment or materials shall be within the WZCZ, unless it is protected by permanent guardrail or temporary concrete barrier (location and installation to be approved by the Project Engineer). During working hours, unless protected as stated for non-working hours, only materials or equipment absolutely necessary to construction shall be allowed in the WZCZ or allowed to park on the shoulder of the roadway. The minimum clear zone distance, measured from the edge of traveled way, shall be based on the posted speed as follows: Posted Speed 35 mph or less 40 mph 45 to 50 mph 55 to 60 mph 65 mph or greater

Subcontracting Requests by the Contractor to sublet Work are submitted on a Request to Sublet Work (RTS) DOT Form 421-012 for approval by the Project Engineer or designee. The request will not be approved if the Contractor is debarred from bidding on or performing work on a public works Contract (search Debarred Contractors on the Labor & Industries webpage). The request must be reviewed in order to ensure that the proposed Subcontractor meets the requirements of WAC 296.127.10. The request must be approved prior to the performance of any work on the Contract by either the Subcontractor or a lower-tier Subcontractor. If more than one Subcontractor on a project wants to utilize the same firm as a lower-tier subcontractor, a separate RTS is required.

Chapter 1
A copy of the Statement of Intent to Pay Prevailing Wages (SOI), approved by the Washington State Department of Labor &Industries (LNI), must be provided to the Project Engineer by the Contractor prior to payment for any work performed by that subcontractor or lower-tier sub. An SOI will be required for each subcontract, even if the subcontractor has already submitted an SOI for work under another subcontract. A SOI is required for every Subcontractor or lower-tier sub unless documentation is provided from LNI stating that their work is not covered by prevailing wage laws. In addition, for Federal-aid projects, a Certification for Federal-Aid Projects DOT Form 420-004 must be submitted with the Request to Sublet (RTS) prior to any subcontractor or lower tier subcontractor beginning work. Non-submittal of the Certification for Federal-Aid Projects will result in rejection of the RTS. Standard Specifications Section 1-08.1 defines what is not considered to be subcontracting. By default, any entity performing bid item work on the project is a Subcontractor, unless: (1) they are the Prime Contractor, (2) an Owner furnished resource (such as WSP, utility owner or its Contractor or consultant), or (3) they are specifically excluded from consideration as a Subcontractor in Standard Specifications Section 1-08.1. Do not be confused by the distinction between Professional Services and Subcontractors in the markups for force account work described in Standard Specifications Section 1-09.6. Those provisions apply only to how the markup for overhead and profit is applied to force account work, and they have no relationship to the requirement for a RTS. If a Contractor is performing bid item work on the Contract, and they do not qualify for one of the two exceptions listed in Standard Specification 1-08.1, a RTS is required. Standard Specifications Section 1-08.1 outlines the requirements to approve the RTS and also sets limitations on the amount of work a Subcontractor or lower-tier Subcontractor may perform. The dollar value to be used for determining the amount of work that must be performed by the Prime Contractor is the total original Contract amount less the amount of any specialty items which have been subcontracted. In order to ensure proper tracking and reporting of sublet information, the Project Office will enter data from each RTS into CCIS. When the Project Office is in a situation where CCIS is not utilized during the administration of a project (i.e., Emergency Contracts, State Aid Contracts), and requires the “hand calculation” of the percentage of amount sublet, the percentage will be calculated for all items except specialty items, using the amount shown on the RTS or the bid amount whichever is smaller. Every Contractor is required to report payments as described in Section 1-08.1. A Contractor withholding payment from a Subcontractor must notify the Subcontractor and the Contracting Agency identifying the reason for the withholding and providing remedy for the release of payment. If the Contractor fails to make the proper notifications, and the Project Office becomes aware of a withheld Subcontractor payment, the Project Engineer shall notify the Prime Contractor in writing. If the issue is not resolved prior to the next progress estimate, the Project Engineer will withhold same amounts that were withheld from the Subcontractor. On Federal-aid projects, the request may indicate that the Subcontractor is a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) or a Federal Small Business (FSBE). When Condition of Award (COA) items are sublet, compare the RTS and the Utilization Plan with the information entered into DMCS to ensure accuracy. The RTS could include WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-123
Chapter 1
Administration
additional bid items and could have a sublet amount greater that the COA amount. The RTS cannot be approved if the sublet amount is less than the COA amounts shown in DMCS. On projects funded wholly by the State, the request may indicate that the Subcontractor is a Minority Business Enterprise (MBE), Small Business Enterprise (SBE), Veteran Business Enterprise (VBE) or a Women Business Enterprise (WBE). Upon receipt of the request, the Project Office should verify that the Subcontractor is certified by using the links at: https://wsdot.diversitycompliance.com. Once the request has been verified and approved, enter the information into CCIS and verify the Subcontractor has been added to DMCS to enable tracking and reporting. DOT Form 421-012 allows the Contractor to indicate more than one type of certification for Subcontractors, however only one type may be entered into CCIS. Use the following order of precedence when determining the certification for CCIS: Federal Funded DBE FSBE MBE WBE VBE SBE
State Funded MBE WBE VBE SBE DBE FSBE
SS 1-08.1(1) Prompt Payment, Subcontract Completion and Return of Retainage Withheld The Project Engineer will ensure that the Contractor and all subcontractors make payment to all subcontractors of whatever tier in accordance with the requirements of RCW 39.04.250. The Project Engineer shall also ensure that if a contractor or subcontractor withholds payment from a subcontractor they follow the procedures as described in Standard Specifications Section 1-08.1(1). If the withholding is not resolved prior to the next progress estimate payment to the Contractor, the Project Engineer will withhold an amount equal to the amount withheld from the subcontractor from the next progress estimate payment to the Contractor. If the withholding is not justifiable or the Contractor fails to comply with the prompt pay requirements, the Project Engineer shall consult with the State Construction Office to determine the appropriate use of the remedies described in Section 1-08.1(1), No. 7. Within 15 calendar days after the Prime Contractor receives their monthly progress payment, a current copy of the Monthly Retainage Report (WSDOT Form 272-065) shall be emailed by the Prime Contractor to the appropriate Region email address as listed in the General Special Provision. The Monthly Retainage Report shall be submitted each month until every subcontractor and lower tier subcontractor’s retainage has been released. The form shall be made available to the Prime Contractor at the PreConstruction Conference. No further action is needed by the Project Office, unless the Region OEO Compliance Specialist requests that the Project Engineer contacts the Prime Contractor due to non-submittal. A letter of non-compliance will be issued, and payment may be withheld in the event of habitual non-compliance. Page 1-124

Progress Schedules
SS 1-08.3(1) General Requirements The requirements for progress schedules are specified in Standard Specifications Section 1-08.3. A copy of the specified reference, Construction Planning and Scheduling, Second Edition, published by the Associated General Contractors of America, was sent to each Project Office and each Region Construction Office. Regions and Project Offices may order additional copies from: http://store.agc.org/ePubs/ePubs/3502EB. One of three progress schedules will be specified in the Contract. Two types of progress schedules are identified in the Standard Specifications, Type A and Type B. A third type may be inserted in the contract as a General Special Provision specifying a Type C Progress Schedule. The three types of progress schedules represent levels of job complexity. Type A being the simplest and easiest to produce and Type C being the most complex. Application is such that the complexity of the project (whether it be timing, coordination, or the work itself) will be reflected in the complexity of the schedule. In addition, a preliminary schedule is required on contracts requiring Type B or C Progress Schedules. Preliminary progress schedules show the work to be accomplished within the first 60 working days. As always, the Contract Provisions may contain requirements that add to, or supersede, all or parts of Standard Specifications Section 1-08.3 to allow for special circumstances. There are four basic reasons that we ask for a schedule:
• To better understand the Contractor’s plan to deliver the project within the time allowed
• To plan our work force and other resource requirements
• To advise the public and executive staff of major milestones
• And to enable us to actively manage impacts to the contract Progress schedules should have sufficient detail such that the progress of the work can be evaluated accurately at any time during the performance of the contract. The owner is obligated by contract to return the schedule for correction or approve it within 15 calendar days of receipt. Approval requires that the schedule complies not only with Standard Specifications Section 1-08.3 but it demonstrates compliance with other contract requirements such as interim completions, staged work, order of work, etc. Periodically, as warranted by progress, delays, or changes, the Project Engineer should review the schedule for accuracy and progress of work. If it is determined that the current schedule does not provide the required information or is no longer accurate, a schedule update may be requested from the Contractor. Monthly updates are required when Type C progress schedules are specified, and the cost of the updates is included in the Lump Sum price of the Bid item. The cost of Type B schedule updates is not included in the Lump Sum price of the bid item. When work is added to the project or the work method is changed at the request of the contracting agency, the respective cost to update the Type B progress schedule should be included in the change order. Type B schedule updates driven by the Contractor’s actions shall be provided to the Contracting Agency and are considered incidental to other work. No payment is made for Type A Progress Schedules or Type A schedule updates. Type B and C Progress Schedules are paid as a lump sum. Eighty WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-125
Chapter 1
Administration
percent of the lump sum payment is paid upon approval of the initial schedule. The remaining portion is paid when eighty percent of the original work is completed, provided updates have been provided as requested. Weekly look-ahead schedules are considered incidental to other items of work in the contract and therefore are not paid for separately. When the Contractor has failed to provide a required schedule, the Engineer may:
• Withhold payment for the Type B or Type C schedule if it is not received (but not for other conforming work).
• Withhold all progress payments for failure to comply with the terms of the contract as specified in Standard Specifications Section 1-09.9 (this should be a rare event).
• Suspend work and continue to charge each day as workable (this should only be implemented when the Agency is harmed by lack of knowledge of the contractor’s intended approach to the work). In extreme cases, the Agency may determine that the Contractor is in breach of contract according to Standard Specifications Section 1-08.10 (usually accompanied by other serious breaches). When lacking a progress schedule, the Engineer must base progress on the information available and their best judgment. According to Standard Specifications Section 1-08.5, the Contractor may protest working day charges, but must support the protest in sufficient detail to enable the Engineer to ascertain the basis and amount of time disputed by following the protest procedures in Section 1-04.5. Review and Approval of Progress Schedules It is the responsibility of the Project Engineer to ensure that the Contractor submits a correct and complete progress schedule in the time specified. Progress schedules must meet the general as well as type-specific criteria. Once it is determined that the progress schedule submitted is of the type specified by the contract, the Project Engineer should evaluate the schedule to determine if it meets the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 1-08, the Special Provisions and the Contract.
• The progress schedule must include all activities necessary to physically complete the project. By definition, activities consume time and usually consume resources. Activities like concrete curing time and slope staking earthwork may be rolled-up into the overall duration of the activity.
• The progress schedule must show the planned order of work in logical sequence, and in compliance with any requirements of the contract. The reviewer should remember that some work is sequenced by factors inherent in the work, but the Contractor may sequence the work by their preference as long as the project is completed within the authorized time and in conformance to the contract.
• The progress schedule must show durations of work activities in working days. Except for defining nonworking days, the calendar has no relationship to administering contract time. An activity may be stalled by unsuitable weather for days or weeks and remain “on schedule.”
Page 1-126
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
• The progress schedule must show activities in durations that are reasonable for the intended work. Since durations of work are a function of resource allocation, the Project Engineer may be required to estimate production rates using estimating manuals, experience or other resources, or to ask the Contractor to explain their planned resource allocation to support the duration.
• The progress schedule must define activities in sufficient detail that progress of individual activities may be evaluated daily. The reviewer should keep in mind that the level of detail required in a progress schedule is driven by the amount of precision required to perform and monitor the work. For example, a single activity that represents several miles of grading may not provide adequate detail and may need to be subdivided into smaller activities described by station limits.
• The progress schedule must show the physical completion of all contract work within the authorized contract time. WSDOT may accept a Progress Schedule indicating an early physical completion date but cannot guarantee that WSDOT’s resources will be available to meet an accelerated schedule. If the progress schedule does not provide the required information, it should be returned to the Contractor for correction and resubmittal. Because the Standard Specifications do not specify timelines for resubmittal, the Engineer should provide a reasonable amount of time for the Contractor to revise and resubmit the schedule, and advise the Contractor of the expected date of resubmittal. SS 1-08.3(2) Progress Schedule Types Type C Progress Schedule Type C Progress Schedules are required for all projects that include the bid item for Type C Progress Schedule. The Contractor is to submit a preliminary Type C Progress Schedule to the Engineer no later than the first working day (as defined in Standard Specifications Section 1-08.5). The preliminary schedule must meet all requirements of a Type C Progress Schedule and of Standard Specifications Section 1-08.3(1) except that it may be limited to activities occurring within the first 60 working days. The Contractor is required to submit a Type C Progress Schedule no later than 60 calendar days after the contract is executed. Each time that a preliminary schedule, Progress Schedule, or Schedule Update is submitted, the Contractor is required to provide the Engineer with an electronic copy of that schedule, in Primavera Project Manager Enterprise Version, P6. Type C Progress Schedules must contain all of the information required of a Type B schedule, and the following additional information:
• A timed scale logic diagram.
• Activities for traffic detours and closures.
• Milestones for required delivery of State furnished materials (if any)
• Activities for State furnished traffic control resources (if any).
• Activities for fabrication of materials with longer than 90 calendar days lead time.
• Fixed constraints shall be identified on the activity listing and be supplemented with a written narrative describing why the constraint exists. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-127
Chapter 1
Administration
• Milestones for interim or stage completion dates.
• Activities for scheduled outages on illumination systems, ITS systems, traffic signal systems and other electrical service outages.
• Nighttime activities shall be so coded.
• Activities for all submittals requiring State review, including the allowable review duration. If requested by the Engineer, the Contractor shall provide a written narrative describing assumed production rates and planned resource allocation to support activity durations. SS 1-08.3(2)A Type A Progress Schedule Type A Progress Schedules are required for any projects that do not include the bid item for Type B Progress Schedule or Type C Progress Schedule. The Contractor is required to submit the Type A Progress Schedules to the Engineer no later than 10 days after the date the contract is executed, or some other mutually agreed upon submittal time. This may be a critical path method (CPM) schedule, a bar chart, or other standard schedule format, such as fenced bar charts, linear schedules, PERT networks and others. These scheduling methods are described in detail in the benchmark document “Construction Planning and Scheduling, Second Edition,”. The Contractor is required to identify the critical path of the project, because a bar chart schedule does not rely on network calculations to determine the critical path. The Engineer will evaluate this schedule and approve or return it for correction within 15 calendar days of receiving the submittal. SS 1-08.3(2)B
Type B Progress Schedule
Type B Progress Schedules are required for all projects containing the bid item for Type B Progress Schedule. The Contractor is required to submit a preliminary schedule to the Engineer no later than five calendar days after the date the contract is executed. Preliminary schedules must meet all requirements of a Type B Progress Schedule except that they may be limited to activities occurring in the first 60 days of the project. The Contractor is required to submit a copy of the Type B Progress Schedule to the Engineer no later than 30 calendar days from the date that the Contract is executed. This schedule must be a critical path method (CPM) schedule developed by the Precedence Diagramming Method and may employ restrains provided the restraints do not alter the network logic or critical path. As a minimum the Type B Progress Schedule must show:
• The Contract Number and Title
• Construction Start Date
• Critical Path
• Activity Description
• Milestone Description
• Activity Duration
• Predecessor Activities
• Successors Activities

Chapter 1
The reviewer should watch for fixed date constraints that override network logic and force activities to become critical. Specific work windows or “open to traffic” milestones may legitimately influence sequence and duration of related activities. Fixed completion milestones for work that is susceptible to unsuitable weather are inappropriate because completion may be extended by the determination of unworkable days. It is not unusual to see dual critical paths on a CPM schedule, nor is it prohibited. Multiple critical paths are generally very short in duration. Lengthy occurrences of parallel critical activities should be cause for scrutiny of activity durations and sequencing. The Engineer will evaluate this schedule to ensure that all required information is included in the schedule, check the network calculations, and approve or return it for correction within 15 calendar days of receiving the submittal. SS 1-08.3(2)D
Weekly Look-Ahead Schedule
Weekly Look-Ahead Schedules are required for all projects. The Contractor is required to submit a Weekly Look-Ahead Schedule, for each week that work is to be performed on the project, showing Contractor and all subcontractor activities for the next two weeks. The Weekly Look-Ahead Schedule must show:
• Description of the work.
• Duration of the work.
• Sequence of the work.
• Planned hours of work. The specification requires that Look-Ahead Schedules show the contractor’s planned hours of work. This information is necessary to evaluate the results of unsuitable weather on the critical path and to assess working days charges correctly. This schedule is to be submitted by mid-week of the week preceding the scheduled work, or other mutually agreed upon submittal time. SS 1-08.3(3) Schedule Updates Schedule Updates are required for all projects. The Engineer may request schedule updates when any of the following events occur:
• A change that affects the critical path.
• The sequence of work is changed from that in the approved schedule.
• The project is significantly delayed (10 days or 10 percent of the original contract time, whichever is greater).
• An extension of contract time is requested. It is important to note that schedule updates are only required when they are requested by the Project Engineer, when a contractor submits a request for a time extension, or monthly in the case of a Type C Progress Schedule. The Project Engineer may request an update when any of the triggers occurs but may choose to forego the update if the impacts to the schedule are readily evident. The Contractor is required to submit a copy of the Schedule Update for approval within 15 calendar days of a written request, or when an update is required by Contract Provisions. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-129
Chapter 1
Administration
In addition to all other requirements, a Schedule Update must show:
• Actual duration and sequence of as-constructed work activities, including changed work.
• Approved time extensions.
• Construction delays or other conditions that affect the progress of work.
• Modifications to sequence or duration of remaining work.
• Physical completion of all remaining work within the remaining time authorized. It is important to know the difference between an as-planned schedule and an asconstructed schedule. All updates must show the as-constructed sequence and actual durations of all activities prior to the status date. When the need for a schedule update is triggered by an event that is the contractor’s doing, they are responsible for the cost. When WSDOT causes an event or requests an update for their need, payment will be made as part of an equitable adjustment. When WSDOT is adding work or time by means of a change order, the price of the schedule update can be included as part of the work. Any unresolved request for time extension must be shown by assuming that no time extension will be granted, and by showing the effects to follow-on activities necessary to physically complete the project within the currently authorized time for completion.
SS 1-08.4
Prosecution of Work The Work will start as established in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-08.4 or such other date as prescribed by the contract provisions. Standard Specifications Section 1-08.4 indicates that Work may start at a time different from that specified if “otherwise approved in writing.” Such other approval is intended only for very unusual circumstances, usually associated with mishandling of contract documents. It will only be granted in consultation with the State Construction Office.
SS 1-08.5
Time for Completion Time associated with each phase of work established in the contract is to be shown on the Weekly Statement of Working Days. The Project Engineer is to furnish a weekly statement advising the Contractor of the current status of working day charges against the contract. Weekly Statements are generated by the CCIS computer system. This statement is to be issued in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-08.5. The weekly statement must be provided to the Contractor by 5:00 PM the following Thursday. The purpose of this statement is to advise the Contractor about the Project Engineer’s decision for each passing day. The questions to be answered when determining if a day is chargeable are:
• Is it a nonworking day (holiday or a day the contract does not allow critical work to advance)?
• Was it a chargeable working day (critical work progressed uninhibited)? or
• Was it an unworkable day (critical work delayed by weather or conditions caused by the weather)?
Page 1-130
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
When evaluating each day, the Project Engineer should take into consideration the following conditions: 1. The effect of inclement weather on critical activities. 2. The effect of conditions caused by inclement weather on critical activities. 3. Critical work restrictions imposed by the contract or the Project Engineer. If any of the above conditions prevent work or reduce the Contractor’s efficiency on critical activities on the project, working day charges shall be adjusted accordingly. If the Contractor can continue Work on critical activities but the efficiency is significantly reduced, a half day may be charged. When determining unworkable days the Project Engineer shall take into consideration the prolonged effects of weather events. If the Contractor is required to divert resources from working on critical path activities due to the lasting effects of a weather event the Project Engineer may determine a half day, the whole day or several days as unworkable. If the contract does not specifically define a working day, a working day will be considered a 24 hour period. The contractor establishes the hours of work in the Weekly-Look Ahead Schedule and the start of the day should be by mutual agreement. The contractor shall be charged for one day during the defined 24 hour period regardless of how many shifts are worked. The Project Engineer will complete Weekly Statements of Working Days throughout the course of the project, showing workable, nonworking and unworkable days as they occur. Statements will continue to be completed until the project has reached Substantial Completion and the Working Days assigned to the Contract have been exhausted. Following are the three possible scenarios:
• The working days are exhausted prior to reaching Substantial Completion. Weekly Statements of Working Days continue until Substantial Completion.
• The working days are exhausted on the day Substantial Completion is achieved. Weekly Statements of Working Days cease upon Substantial Completion.
• The working days are not exhausted upon reaching Substantial Completion. Weekly Statements of Working Days continue until the working days are exhausted or until physical completion. Weekly Statements of Working Days are considered Written Determinations by the Engineer. If the Contractor does not agree with the Weekly Statements of Working Days, they are required to follow the procedures identified in Standard Specification 1-04.5. Upon Substantial Completion the Project Engineer will ensure that the date is entered into CCIS and is noted in the remaining Weekly Statements of Working Days. After Weekly Statements have stopped, comments concerning weather and other events beyond the Contractor’s control should be entered into the project diary using DOT Form 422-017. The effect of these conditions on remaining work and on the scheduled completion should also be noted.

Chapter 1
Administration
The contract duration specified for physically completing the contract is stated in the contract provisions under the general special provision “Time For Completion.” Although there are exceptions, the guidance in this chapter pertains to contracts in which time is accounted for in terms of working days. The Contractor may begin work as soon as the contract is executed and shall prosecute the work diligently until physical completion has been reached. Between the execution of the contract and the acceptance by the State Construction Engineer, the Project Engineer will likely encounter time-related issues. These will be documented through Weekly Statements of Working Days (Standard Specifications Section 1-08.5), Suspensions of Work (Standard Specifications Section 1-08.6), Protested Work (Standard Specifications Section 1-04.5), and Time Extensions (Standard Specifications Section 1-08.8). Contract Completion Milestones – There are two milestones that establish the end of contract time. They are defined Standard Specifications Section 1-01.3 as Substantial Completion Date and Physical Completion Date. These two milestones are discussed in greater detail later in this chapter. Substantial Completion Substantial Completion may be granted when only minor, incidental items of work, replacement of temporary facilities or correction remain in order to physically complete the contract. In determining Substantial Completion, the Project Engineer should consider whether:
• The public has full use and benefit of the facility.
• Major safety features are installed and functional, including guardrail, striping, and delineation.
• Illumination, if required, is installed or a temporary system with equal functional capabilities is operating.
• Signals, if required, are installed or a temporary system with equal functional capabilities is operating.
• The need for temporary traffic control on a regular basis has ceased. Only minor traffic restrictions will be needed for the remaining work.
• The traffic is operating in its permanent configuration. The Project Engineer is responsible for determining the Substantial Completion date. When this has been done, the Contractor will be notified by letter, specifically noting the date on which Substantial Completion was achieved. Per Standard Specifications Section 1-07.18, Substantial Completion is tied to the contract insurance requirements and the Contract Administration and Payment System (CAPS) Unit of Accountability and Financial Service (AFS) must also be notified of the substantial completion date (email to caps@wsdot.wa.gov). In order to be in concurrence, the project engineer will also provide notification of Substantial Completion to the State Materials Laboratory Materials Quality Assurance Section (email to mlrom@wsdot.wa.gov) and to the State Construction Office (email to DOTconstruction@wsdot.wa.gov).
Page 1-132
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
Physical Completion The date on which the Project Engineer determines that all physical work has been completed is noted and then established as the date of Physical Completion. The Project Engineer will immediately notify the Contractor by letter of the date determined for Physical Completion. The letter will include a statement asking the Contractor to complete and return the Contractor’s Construction Process Evaluation (DOT Form 410-029), and will provide a copy of the form as an attachment. Copies of the letter will be sent to:
• The Railroad companies, if applicable.
• The Contract Administration and Payment System (CAPS) Unit of Accountability and Financial Services (AFS) by means of a copy of the letter sent by email to caps@wsdot.wa.gov.
• The Regional Local Programs Engineer on all city and county projects.
• The GIS and Roadway Data Office (GRDO) Roadway Geometrics Office (email to roadway@wsdot.wa.gov).
• The State Construction Office, (email to DOTconstruction@wsdot.wa.gov).
• State Materials Laboratory, (email to mlrom@wsdot.wa.gov)
• Any other distribution that the Region deems appropriate. Actions the Project Engineer should consider taking once Physical Completion has occurred include:
• Identify any unresolved disputes and initiate discussions.
• Initiate a full review of item quantities, seeking contractor concurrence.
• Initiate a final review of materials documentation.
• On Federal-aid projects, initiate a Stewardship Final Inspection and Acceptance.
• Compile a list of all approved subcontractors performing work on the project and transmit to Contractor, who will review the list for completeness and return the list annotated with each subcontractor Universal Business Identifier (UBI). Assembly of Delinquent Records Immediately after the Physical Completion date has been established, the Project Engineer is to notify the Contractor of all outstanding documents that are required to establish a project Completion Date. Once all the obligations of the Contract have been performed by the Contractor, the Project Engineer will provide the Contractor written notice of project completion, identifying the Completion Date established for the contract. For the project Completion Date to be established, all the physical work on the project must be completed, and the Contractor must have furnished all documentation required by the contract. This includes all approved Affidavits of Wages Paid, and the signed Final Contract Voucher Certification. (Note: Establish the Completion Date as soon as the last item of paperwork is received.) The notice to the Contractor should be prepared and mailed on the same day that is designated as the completion date. A copy of the completion letter, with attached completed Contractor UBI and AWP Identification Number List (LIST) must be emailed to caps@wsdot.wa.gov (CAPS) on the day the letter is written and sent. The LIST must include the UBI number and the Affidavit of Wages Paid (AWP) identification number for the Prime Contractor, subcontractors, applicable WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-133
Chapter 1
Administration
suppliers and manufacturers, delivery firms, and other firms that have filed an AWP with the Department of Labor and Industries (LNI). The LIST must be accurate and legible as errors will cause delays when requesting the release from LNI. To assure accuracy, it is recommended that offices compare their LIST against LNIs Prevailing Wage Intents and Affidavits system before issuing Contract Completion. If the Contractor refuses, or is unable to return, a signed FCVC or any of the required documents, the Project Engineer, the Region and the State Construction Office can work together to move the project towards closure by establishing a unilateral completion date allowing WSDOT Acceptance of the contract. See Section SS 1-09.9 for Unilateral Acceptance procedures.
SS 1-08.6
Suspension of Work The Project Engineer may order suspension of all or part of the Work if: 1. Inclement weather, or conditions caused by inclement weather, make it impracticable to achieve satisfactory results on a critical item of work, 2. The Contractor does not comply with the Contract, or 3. When, in the judgment of the Project Engineer, it is in the best interest of the public If possible, suspensions for weather should be made with the concurrence of the Contractor. If the Contractor does not agree to a weather suspension, the Project Engineer should consult with the Region Construction Manager before issuing a unilateral suspension. During suspensions of long duration, for example a winter shutdown, the publication of Weekly Statements may be suspended. Notices to suspend or resume work should be written. DOT Forms 421-006 and 421-007 have been developed for this purpose. A letter may accomplish the same purpose. If it is determined that some items of noncritical work on the project could be continued unaffected by weather conditions, those items may be excluded from the order to suspend work. The prime consideration for unworkable days or suspensions is always the ability to work on critical items. The Project Engineer must decide if the Contractor made sufficient efforts to pursue Work before the suspension of work. If it is determined that the Contractor worked diligently before the suspension, WSDOT will maintain the temporary roadway, which includes: 1. The Traveled Way, Auxiliary Lanes, Shoulders, and detour surface 2. Roadway drainage along and under the traveled Roadway or detour 3. All barricades, signs, and lights needed for directing traffic through the temporary Roadway or detour in the construction area All costs of roadway maintenance in this instance will be the responsibility of the Contracting Agency. The Project Engineer should coordinate these efforts with the area maintenance superintendent before any maintenance work takes place. If the Project Engineer deems the Contractor did not make sufficient efforts prior to the suspension of work, the maintenance described above will be the responsibility of the Contractor, along with the expense.
Page 1-134
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
In either scenario, the Contractor is responsible for protection and maintenance of all other work areas not used by traffic during the suspension. The suspensions described above as related to weather apply only to critical work items and, therefore, always result in a determination of an unworkable day. If the Engineer and the Contractor agree to stop working on a noncritical item for one of these causes but to continue critical work, then the agreement should be noted in the records and weekly statements should be issued in the normal fashion. The contract also gives the Engineer the right to suspend work on any part of the project when the Contractor is not complying with the contract’s terms or the orders of the Engineer. This would be a significant action and, except in an emergency situation, should not be undertaken without the full and informed consent of the Region Construction Manager and the State Construction Office. If work is suspended under this contract provision, then weekly statements and the charging of workable days will continue in the normal fashion. Suspending the Work because it is in the public interest is a serious action and should be taken with great care. Unless there is imminent danger, the Project Engineer should consult with the Region Construction Manager and State Construction Office before suspending for public interest. Reasons for suspending for public interest may include natural disaster or emergency that necessitates the Work being halted. Suspension of the Work may increase the cost or time necessary to perform the Work and gives the Contractor the right to protest when they believe the Work has been suspended, interrupted, or delayed by the Contracting Agency for an unreasonable amount of time. If the Contractor believes this has happened, they must submit their protest within 14 calendar days of the start of the suspension or delay. The Contractor is not entitled to an adjustment for any costs incurred more than 14 calendar days prior to the notice they provide. Additionally, the Contractor is not entitled to an adjustment if performance would have been delayed by any other cause including the fault of the Contractor or if an adjustment is excluded under another provision of the Contract.
SS 1-08.8
Extensions of Time In general time extensions are appropriate whenever the critical work is delayed due to an action or inaction of the Contracting Agency, or by a cause that is not the responsibility of the Contractor. Standard Specifications Section 1-08.8 includes a list of reasons that entitle the Contractor to a time extension, and a list of reasons for which no time extension will be granted. In all cases, the change or delay must delay critical work or an extension is not appropriate. The Contract requires the Contractor to identify a delay within 14 days of recognizing that one exists. If a delay is readily identifiable, the Project Engineer should enforce this provision. If the delay is not immediately apparent the time extension discussion should take place as soon as the delay is recognized. Before discussing a potential delay for which adequate notice was not given, the Project Engineer should discuss the situation with the Region Construction Manager to seek guidance. The Contractor should be encouraged to identify delays and bring them to the State’s attention at the earliest opportunity. This allows the Contracting Agency to mitigate the delay by adding time, modifying the work or recovering the schedule. In the interest of actively managing a delay the project engineer may act unilaterally to address time if the contractor avoids the discussion.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-135
Chapter 1
Administration
In any case, the Contractor is not entitled to a time extension for any Contract time that was incurred more than 14 days prior to the date the Project Engineer receives their request of time extension. All time associated with Work added by change order should be addressed as part of the change order. If the Project Engineer is unable to come to agreement on the number of working days to add, the Region Construction Manager should be consulted concerning the need to unilaterally add time to the Contract. Deferring the discussion of time in a change order to a later date should be a last resort, and should be by mutual agreement between the parties, with a specific time when the discussion will resume. This mutual agreement must be documented in the Change Order. If the Contractor is not granted time for Work added by a change order, they are still required to complete the Contract in the number of working days that remain. This situation may cause the Contractor to accelerate their efforts, by adding additional crews, equipment or working longer hours or extra days. If these actions are taken as a result of the Contracting Agency not granting a time extension for which the Contractor is entitled, the Contracting Agency may be responsible for the additional cost of these efforts. This is known as constructive acceleration. If the Project Engineer determines that the Contractor is entitled to time, but an agreement cannot be reached, the Project Engineer should consider unilaterally executing a change order to add the justified amount of time to the Contract. The Contractor can then pursue the matter under the procedure for protest as outlined in Section 1-04.5. The State has a responsibility to inform the Contractor’s surety whenever increased time is being considered and the current extension, combined with previous extensions, would exceed 20 percent of the original allotted time in the contract. This information could be represented by the Surety’s signature on the change order that adds time, by a separate letter from the Surety, or by a notice letter direct to the Surety office. Such notice and surety consent is a legal requirement and will help maintain the State’s rights to be protected by the performance bond. Standard Specifications Section 1-08.6 provides under what circumstances the Contractor may be entitled to compensation. Anytime a project is delayed for any cause, the Project Engineer and the Contractor must consider methods of mitigating the delay damage. A common approach is to pursue schedule recovery by allocating additional resources to the work to get the project back on schedule. When the Project Engineer suspects that the State may be responsible for the delay, then compensation for the mitigation efforts may be proposed as necessary. The Project Engineer must respond to the Contractor with a Written Determination within 21 calendar days of receiving the time extension request or supplemental information. Any time extension will be documented in a change order with approval levels defined in Section SS 1-04.4.
SS 1-08.9
Liquidated Damages Liquidated Damages and Direct Engineering, or other related charges, are to be addressed as described in the contract specifications, Standard Specifications Section 1-08.9. Direct Engineering charges are a form of Liquidated Damages and must be listed on the monthly progress estimates on the line for Liquidated Damages. Traffic related damages
Page 1-136
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
as described in Section SS 1-08.9 are to be listed under Miscellaneous Deductions. The Project Engineer must evaluate potential Liquidated Damages that have accrued as a result of the expiration of contract time before the damages are withheld from moneys due the Contractor. The work and circumstances that have occurred over the course of the project should be reviewed to determine if there is potential entitlement for granting additional contract time. Liquidated Damages that have accrued should be adjusted for this evaluation. Liquidated Damages deemed chargeable should then be withheld from moneys due the Contractor each monthly progress estimate as Liquidated Damages accrue. While the Project Engineer takes the action to withhold damages as the work progresses, only the State Construction Office may actually assess those damages. Liquidated Damages must be resolved before the final estimate can be completed and processed. Guidance for assessing Liquidated Damages can be found in Standard Specifications Section 1-08, and in some cases in the contract provisions. Any withholding or assessment made against the Contractor’s payments, is to be preceded by a fair notice written communication to the contractor. For those issues that could be remedied with actions taken or initiated by the Contractor, this notice should also include a reasonable period of time that will allow the contractor to take action to mitigate or completely avoid the withholding or assessment. The term “withhold” refers to a temporary deduction shown on a progress estimate. The term “assess” refers to a permanent deduction that could be shown on a progress estimate, but will be shown on the final estimate. Liquidated damages fall into two categories – one deals with contract time and the other deals with miscellaneous provisions such as ramp or lane closures. These two categories are described below. Contract Time Liquidated Damages Standard Specifications Section 1-08.9 establishes the amount of Liquidated Damages to be assessed if the Contractor overruns contract time. These assessments are either: (1) included in the Contract Provisions or (2) or in the form of direct engineering and related costs. The State Construction Engineer has not subdelegated to the Region the authority to assess time related damages on progress estimates or the final estimate. However, the authority to withhold below the line “Liquidated Damages” on progress estimates has been subdelegated to the Regions, and may be further subdelegated to the Project Engineer. Liquidated Damages should be addressed whenever it is apparent that the number of working days provided in the contract will be used before Substantial Completion. It is emphasized once again that fair notice and communication is necessary as a legal requirement. In some cases, there are legitimate reasons for time extensions which would preclude with-holding liquidated damages on progress estimates. If the Project Engineer is aware of or anticipates a possible time extension that would preclude withholding liquidated damages on progress estimates, the Region and/or the State Construction Office should be consulted for guidance. If the Project Engineer determines that withholding of liquidated damages on progress estimates would not be appropriate, the reasons for not withholding are to be documented by a memorandum to the files. The following describes the procedures for addressing contract time related liquidated damages in the various stages or phases of the project: WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-137
Chapter 1
Administration
• Phases (Interim Physical Completion Dates) – Liquidated damages for phases will be shown in the special provisions. When the contract includes additional phases, and the time for physical completion of a phase has overrun, the overrun should be resolved as it occurs. This involves the Contractor either being granted an extension of time or being assessed liquidated damages by the State Construction Office.
• After Substantial Completion Date of the Contract – If substantial completion is granted after the expiration of contract time the amount in the Contract Provision for liquidated damages will be assessed for that period of time between the expiration of contract time and the substantial completion date. Liquidated damages assessed after the date of substantial completion will be only those costs identified as Direct Engineering and related costs that have been incurred by WSDOT. The direct engineering and related costs are defined as field engineering and inspection time charges plus any vehicle, travel pay, per diem, or other charges connected with the delayed contract physical completion. Engineering costs such as computing grades, quantities, etc. which would have been incurred by WSDOT under normal conditions should not be included in the determination of direct engineering and related costs. If substantial completion is granted on or prior to the expiration of contract time, direct engineering costs will only be assessed for that period of time between the date contract time expired and the physical completion date.
• Before Physical Completion – If Substantial Completion has not been established, the amount in the Contract Provisions for Liquidated Damages, will be assessed for that period of time between the expiration of contract time and the Physical Completion date. Working days added to the contract by time extensions when time has overrun shall only apply to the days on which Liquidated Damages or Direct Engineering have been charged, such as:
• If Substantial Completion has been granted prior to all of the authorized working days being used, then the number of days in the time extension will eliminate an equal number of days on which Direct Engineering charges have accrued.
• If the Substantial completion date is established after all of the authorized working days have been used, then the number of days in the time extension will eliminate an equal number of days on which Liquidated Damages or Direct Engineering charges have accrued. Miscellaneous Liquidated Damages The contract provisions may provide for assessment of other liquidated damages not connected to contract working days. These liquidated damages are recorded in CAPS as miscellaneous deductions. Miscellaneous liquidated damages may include, but are not limited to, failure to open traffic lanes or ramps within the prescribed time, fabrication inspection costs, or the cost of challenge tests that do not show a passing result. The State Construction Office has subdelegated the authority to the Regions to withhold and assess these types of liquidated damages on progress estimates and the final estimate. The Project Engineer shall notify the Contractor in writing when these types of liquidated damages are to be assessed. The Project Engineer shall include an explanation of miscellaneous liquidated damages with the Final Estimate package when it is submitted to the State Construction Office.

Chapter 1
Processing Liquidated Damages Both categories of liquidated damages affect project expenditures differently and must be entered correctly in CAPS.
• Liquidated Damages – Amounts withheld due to contract time overruns and direct engineering costs. All temporary withholding or final assessment of these damages are to be shown as a below the line “Liquidated Damages” deduction on progress estimates and the final estimate. Withholding liquidated damages reduces the contract construction engineering (CE) expenditures; and releasing them will increase the contract CE for the same amount. The Project Engineer should be aware of the potential charges to the project CE cost prior to over spending or releasing the surplus CE expenditure prior to the Contract Completion.
• Miscellaneous Liquidated Damages – Amounts withheld for activities not connected to contract working days, such as failure to open traffic, fabrication costs or challenging test results. All temporary withholding or final assessment for these liquidated damages shall be shown as a below the line “miscellaneous” deduction on progress estimates and final estimate. Miscellaneous liquidated damages do not affect work order expenditures and are released back to the funding source when the contract is complete.
SS 1-08.10
Termination of Contract Contract termination is divided into two major categories, termination for default and termination for public convenience. Standard Specifications Section 1-08.10(1) defines the situations when a contract may be terminated for default (doesn’t happen very often.) Standard Specifications Section 1-08.10(2) defines the situations when a contract may be terminated for public convenience. Keep in mind that the conditions of the termination may be negotiated in the event that the termination is in the best interest of both parties. An example would be if a major change is beyond the abilities of the contractor. Negotiations with regard to conditions of the termination may include pricing partially completed items, mobilization payment, or the State taking possession of fabricated/purchased materials. In both categories, if federal funds are involved, FHWA needs to be notified and informed of the situation early in the process. Specifically, Federal participation eligibility should be discussed prior to making a decision on termination. Formal notification and discussion should use normal channels through the Region to the State Construction Office. Authority to terminate a contract rests with the same position that had authority to execute the contract.
SS 1-08.10(2)
Termination for Public Convenience
A. Authority to Terminate – As provided in Standard Specifications Section 1-08.10(2), WSDOT may cancel all or portions of the Work included in a contract. If the project is to be terminated in whole and contains Federal funds, FHWA must be notified and a discussion of Federal participation eligibility should take place prior to the decision to terminate is finalized. The authority to terminate a contract resides in the same position that is authorized to execute the project. Change order approvals, per the Change Order Checklist, are required for termination change orders.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-139
Chapter 1
Administration
B. Cost Associated With Deleted Work – The Contractor must submit a request for payment of costs associated with termination of the contract no later than 90-calendar days from the effective date of the termination. There are some limitations to payment that should be noted under Standard Specifications Section 1-09.5. When Work is deleted by the termination of a contract by the contracting agency, payment will only be for the costs actually associated with the termination. No profit will be allowed for Work that was not completed. Consequential damages are also not allowed. Consequential damages may include such things as loss of credit, loss of bonding capacity, loss of other jobs, loss of business reputation, loss of job opportunities, etc. C. Payment for Materials – When Work is deleted from the project by termination and the contractor has already ordered acceptable materials for such Work, payment for these materials may be negotiated in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-09.5. D. Deletion of Contract Items – Since a termination change order is deleting work from the contract, uncompleted and unused contract items, if they are to remain uncompleted, must be deleted from the contract by the change order. “Zeroing out” these items assists in releasing funding from the project. When terminating a contract that contains work that is condition of award (COA), be sure to delete that work from the COA requirements by completing the condition of award portion of the change order in CCIS. Due to limited character space in CCIS, it may be necessary to create more than one change order to complete the termination change order. Be sure these multiple change orders are concurrent. E. Physical Completion – If the Contractor is not required to complete any contract Work after execution of the change order, the execution date of the change order should be established by the Project Engineer, and entered into CCIS, as the Physical Completion date for the contract. If the Contractor must complete some items of the Work, Physical Completion will be granted by the Project Engineer upon satisfactory completion of the Work (Standard Specifications Division 1-03). This date assists the CAPS unit of AFS to know if insurance must be maintained on the project. F. Time – The change order should contain a time statement, just like any other change order. G. Waiver – The change order should contain waiver language similar to that found in Section SS 1-04.4.
1-09
Measurement and Payment
SS 1-09.4
Equitable Adjustment
Pricing Standard Specifications Section 1-04.4 specifies that an equitable adjustment (EA) in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-09.4 will be made when changes cause an increase or decrease in the cost of performing work on the contract. The basic theory of an EA is to leave the parties to the contract in the same position cost wise and profit wise as they would have been without the change, preserving to each as nearly as possible the advantages and disadvantages of their agreement. Although the contractor is Page 1-140
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
entitled to profit on the changed work, the profit (or loss) on the unchanged work should remain unaffected by the equitable adjustment.
• This is an important point, for unchanged work, the contractor is entitled to the profit bid or a windfall, if the work turns out to be easier than expected.
• On the other hand, for unchanged work, the contracting agency is not obligated to make the contractor well for an under bid item. Consequential damages are never allowed as part of a negotiated equitable adjustment. Consequential damages may include such things as: loss of credit, loss of bonding capacity, loss of other jobs, loss of business reputation, loss of job opportunities, impacts to another project, etc. A. Unit Prices – An appropriate price may be established using average unit bid prices, citing similar unit bid prices, a determination of market value, by estimating the cost to perform the work, or a combination of these methods. Unit bid price is one indication of an equitable price; however the contracting agency should be prepared to support the price by other means. B. Force Account – When added work is paid by force account, a change order shall be prepared detailing the added work to be performed and the estimated cost. Standard Item Number 7715 is to be used for all force account items that do not have an assigned standard item number. Force account should be a last resort used only if the work can’t be clearly defined. C. Overhead – There are two basic types of overhead as follows:
• Distributed Fixed Costs – Offsite “home office overhead” is the cost of running a company. These costs are assumed to be distributed among all the projects performed by the company. Onsite overhead is incurred as a function of time needed to accomplish the project. Onsite costs are assumed to be evenly distributed among contract items. This category of overhead is eligible under an equitable adjustment if working days are added to the contract as part of the adjustment.
• Variable Fixed Costs – these costs are directly associated with performing an item of work on the project and therefore vary with the quantity, the contractor is entitled to recover these costs as a part of an equitable adjustment. Forward Pricing and Risk The first and best option for an equitable adjustment is agreement in advance between the contractor and WSDOT on the increased or decreased cost and time for performance of the changed work. The Project Engineer should expend every effort possible to obtain a satisfactory negotiated equitable adjustment prior to submitting the change order to the contractor for endorsement. The Project Engineer must remember that the contractor is a full participant in the contract and retains all the rights and privileges during a negotiation. When bidding a job, the contractor must be optimistic and take appropriate risks. When negotiating, it is understandable and acceptable for the contractor to be pessimistic and avoid risk, unless compensated. Some key points to remember are:
• A negotiated price will likely be higher than a competitive bid price.
• A proposal which assigns extensive risk to the contractor will likely be more costly yet.
• The contractor may be willing to take on this risk if the price is a bit higher WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-141
Chapter 1

• The significant advantage of reaching a price agreement before the work is started (forward pricing) is that the contractor assumes the risk of the accuracy of the pricing assumptions and predicted duration for performing the work.
• (when forward pricing) the Project Engineer may utilize the high end of the estimating range in justification.
• (when forward pricing) an audited overhead rate may be substituted for the markups described in Standard Specifications Section 1-09.6. Contractors can usually provide an estimated home office overhead rate which may be checked by an annual audit, if warranted. Pricing After Fact When establishing prices after the work has been performed, actual costs should be used to the extent they are available. The following are key points to keep in mind:
• Costs for equipment cannot exceed the rates established by the AGC/WSDOT Equipment Rental Agreement for an equitable adjustment.
• When pricing after the fact, the markups described in Standard Specifications Section 1-09.6 are appropriate for measuring time and materials because there is no risk involved in after the fact pricing. Unilateral Pricing In the interest of being timely, the change order should be a tool to document agreement and not a negotiation tool back and forth. Ideally we will have agreement with the contractor when pricing the work. On occasion, however, due to time constraints and difference of opinion, we can’t always come to agreement. The difference of opinion may be for only a small portion of the work. Standard Specifications Section 1-09.4(2) provides, “If the parties cannot agree, the price will be determined by the Engineer using unit prices, or other means to establish costs.” This is not to say that the contractor is obligated to honor unit bid prices for work that qualifies for an equitable adjustment. This allows us to proceed with changed work prior to reaching an agreement on the price. In the interest of being timely, and provided the Project Engineer is comfortable that the included price can be supported, there’s nothing wrong with issuing a change order to the contractor unilaterally. This orders the work to proceed, establishes the State’s position on cost, and puts the decision to continue negotiations in the contractor’s hands as detailed under Standard Specifications Section 1-04.5. The contractor is obligated to endorse, write a separate acceptance, or protest as described in the specification and a timeline is provided for these actions. Time The completed equitable adjustment should include provisions for any increases or decreases in contract time based on impacts to overall contract duration. The decision on time should be supported by an analysis of the project schedule. Analyzing time in advance encourages communication between the parties allowing the contracting agency to make an informed decision on the true costs. It also enables the contracting agency to mitigate time impacts if that is in the agency’s best interest.

Chapter 1
Force Account
General When it is difficult to provide adequate measurement or to estimate the cost for certain items of work, force account may be used in order to pay the Contractor for performing the work. Some contract items may be set up to be paid by force account. Some change orders may require payment by force account. Standard Specifications Section 1-09.6 describes the boundaries for payment of work performed by the force account method. In any case, the purpose of force account is to fully reimburse the Contractor for costs incurred on the work. These costs may also include indirect segments, such as travel, per diem, safety training, industrial safety measures, overhead, profit and other hidden costs. The objective is to minimize the inclusion of any “contingencies” included in the contract bid in anticipation of costs that may be incurred during force account work and not reimbursed. When work is added to the contract and is to be paid by force account, a change order will have been prepared describing the added work to be performed. The change order package will also contain an independent estimate of the cost to perform the added work. All non-standard force account items are assigned the Standard Item Number 7715. Force account payments are typically not authorized for employees engaged in management or general supervisory work. The cost for this type of activity is presumed to be included in the Contractor’s markups for overhead and profit. However a foreman or, in some cases, a dedicated superintendent devoting full time to the force account work is eligible for payment on the force account. On projects that require the Contractor to employ trainees, these employees may be utilized in force account work. In the case of some Emergency Contracts (see the WSDOT Emergency Funding Manual M 3014) which will be measured and paid by Force Account, it is appropriate for the Engineer to consider payment for mobilization of equipment to the site of the emergency, including all staff time employed to procure and coordinate the mobilization. It may also be appropriate to include the labor payment for a dedicated superintendent and foremen employed solely to oversee the emergency work. On emergency contracts the mark ups may not be enough to cover the cost of performance bonds; the Project Engineer may consider payment for performance bond costs when making payment under emergency force account contracts. The Project Engineer should consider a decision to direct force account work with the same degree of caution that would be applied to directing any other work on the contract. The Contractor should have the expertise to schedule the work and determine what equipment is required. In most cases, it is best that we allow the Contractor to propose the method and approach to the work. Our most effective role would be to concur or approve of the Contractor’s proposal or suggest modifications to it. Before any work is performed by the Contractor on a force account basis, the Project Office should review and agree with the Contractor upon: 1. Labor – The classification and approximate number of workers to be used, the wage rate to be paid those workers, whether or not travel allowance and subsistence is applicable to those workers, and what foreman, if any, will be paid for by force account. This agreement will be closely tied to the development of the Labor List. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-143
Chapter 1
Administration
2. Materials – The material to be used, including the cost and any freight charges whether the material is purchased specifically for the project or comes from the Contractor’s own supply. For materials representing a significant cost, or where the industry experiences fluctuations in price, the contract allows for shopping and the Contractor may be directed to obtain quotations. 3. Equipment – The equipment to be used including the size, rating, capacity, or any other information requested by the Engineer. Whether the equipment to be used is owned by the Contractor or is to be rented. The cost per hour for the equipment to be used. In the case of rented equipment, the Engineer may ask for competitive quotations, provided the request is made in advance and there is time to obtain them. Payment for force account work should be made on the same timely basis as any other item of work. When money is being withheld from a progress estimate, the criteria for withholding should apply equally to all items of work, not just to force account work, because of its method of payment. The procedure for record keeping and payment of force account work on change orders shall be the same as for contract items to be paid by force account. Separate records are to be kept for each force account whether it is an item in the original contract or established as a result of a change order. Payment Procedures for Force Account Work 1. Labor – The specifications require the Contractor to prepare and submit a “Labor List” in advance of force account work. Once approved by the Project Engineer, this list provides the hourly rate for force account calculations until a new list is approved. New lists will not be approved retroactively and calculations previously made from an approved list will not be changed when a new list is approved. If the Contractor fails to submit a list before the first force account calculations are made, then the Project Engineer will determine the rates from the best data available (payrolls on this job, payrolls on other jobs, prevailing wage requirements, union information, etc). Labor list rates will include all the pieces of wage expense – base rates, benefits, assessments, travel, with allocations shown where necessary. Examples of Labor List entries might be: Generic Laborer (Straight Time) Basic Wage/hr $21.36 FICA (7.65%) FICA (7.65%) FUTA (0.80%) FUTA (0.80%) SUTA (5.42%) Total = 2.96 Indust Ins $1.01/hr 1.01 Benefits/Hr 5.45 Subtotal $30.78/hr Travel Expense Travel Expense $250/40 hrs 6.25/hr Total $37.03/hr Use $37per hr
John Doe, Teamster (Overtime) Basic OT Wage/hr $32.81
SUTA (5.42%) Total = Indust Ins $1.01/hr Benefits/Hr Subtotal
4.55 1.01 8.00 $46.37/hr
$250/40 hrs Total Use
$6.25/hr $52.62/hr $53per hr
These examples show the rate rounded to the nearest dollar, which is permissible. If either party would prefer to use the unrounded amount, that is also acceptable. When deciding how many hours require compensation, the specification allows all hours Page 1-144
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
that are a contractual obligation or are customary payments made to all employees. This means that, if a labor contract calls for 4 hours of pay for any call out, then that is a contractual obligation and the 4 hours would be eligible for reimbursement. (As always, the Contractor is expected to reassign the employees, if possible, to avoid the penalty.) In the same vein, a non-Union contractor, who has made call out payments to all employees for years, would be eligible for reimbursement for similar payments in a force account. Per Diem and Subsistence – This item must be agreed to in advance of the work. A daily allowance for expense generally prescribed by a labor contract or a company policy. When requested, a copy of the labor contract/company policy which describes how the Contractor is paying Per Diem must be obtained. Per Diem costs will be paid on an actual cost (invoiced and receipted) basis incurred as the direct result of the Force Account work, if the Per Diem is paid to workers for similar pay item work. 2. Materials – Materials also work from a list, but the list is generated in a different fashion. The Project Engineer provides the basic list of materials observed by the inspector. This is done in a timely manner (daily, unless the Contractor agrees otherwise). The Contractor adds prices to the list and attaches invoices or affidavits to support the prices. Once the list is returned and checked, payment can be made. If a shipment of material is only partially consumed during the force account reporting period, the inspector may choose to include the entire amount in the first report or to estimate the amount consumed during each reporting period. The decision should be based upon the amount of the shipment, the nature and cost of the shipment and the security of the stockpile. A case of empty sandbags to be utilized throughout the winter for pollution control would adapt well to a single report, while a stockpile of galvanized conduit should probably be reported piecemeal as it is used in the work. The Contractor may use copies of the original invoice when the material is reported incrementally. If the Contractor has to restock unused material, restock charges can be reimbursed if the original order was reasonable for the work planned. Along with supplying prices and invoices, the Contractor may suggest additions or corrections to the Materials List. These suggestions will be reviewed by the Project Engineer and, if appropriate, added before payment is made. If the Contractor does not have an invoice, as in the case of stockpiles or some warehouse stock, then an affidavit will suffice. The Engineer may review the affidavit and, if it is an unreasonable price that cannot be supported, the Engineer may substitute another price, utilizing the best data available. The reasonableness of the price must consider the circumstances of the purchase and all costs associated with obtaining material from another source. The specifications allow the Engineer to require competitive quotations, if this is done before the work is started and sufficient time is available. If the Contractor has to divert an employee to obtain the quotations, then that employee may be included in the labor reimbursement for the force account. 3. Equipment – The Project Engineer should review and comply with the rules governing payment for equipment as outlined in the most current AGC/WSDOT Equipment Rental Agreement. This agreement was developed as a supplement of the specifications and is relatively self explanatory. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-145
Chapter 1
Administration
There are three methods of acquiring equipment for use on a force account. “Owned” means that the Contractor controls and operates the equipment. A long term lease arrangement would be the same as ownership. Owned equipment is priced according to the Blue Book. For equipment not listed by Equipment Watch, a rental rate may be requested from the Engineer by completing and submitting the Force Account Equipment Rental Rate Request (WSDOT Form 422-010). “Rented to Operate” means that the Contractor has obtained a piece of equipment through a short-term rental and will operate that equipment with its own employees. Rented to Operate equipment is priced according to the invoice from the rental agency. “Rented Operated” means that the Contractor has obtained a service from an individual or a company to provide a piece of equipment with an operator. An operated rental is not paid as equipment, but rather as a Service. In some cases, the Service will be reclassified as an entity performing in the manner of a subcontractor (see below). Damage waivers are compensable. The Engineer has the discretion to reimburse for a damage waiver when it makes good business sense. Upon request, the Contractor should be able to demonstrate that the purchase of the damage waiver is consistent with their standard business practice. Consideration should be given to the potential risk of damage to the equipment versus the cost of paying for the damage waiver. In most cases, the cost of the waiver is minimal. The damage waiver does not cover damage caused by operator negligence, nor should the Department reimburse the Contractor for repair of any damage caused by operator negligence. Normal wear and tear on equipment is included in the Blue Book rental rates. The ownership rates include major overhaul of the equipment. The Blue Book defines major overhaul as the periodic rebuilding of the engine, transmission, undercarriage, and other major equipment components. The operating rates include the cost of daily servicing of the equipment, including the replacement of small components such as pumps, carburetors, injectors, filters, belts, gaskets and worn lines. The operating rates also include the cost of expendables such as fuel, lubricants, filters, tires, and ground engaging components, such as pads, blades bucket teeth, etc. The costs of extraordinary operating expendables are not covered in the operating rates due to their highly variable wear patterns. These extraordinary operating expendables may include certain ground engaging components, such as hammer and drill bits, drill steel, augers, saw blades, and tooth-bits. The cost for these items will normally be recovered separately, based upon invoices for their cost. Repair of damage is considered a risk of providing equipment. The cost of this risk is assumed to be in the markup for overhead and profit. Costs for repair of damage should not be included in the force account direct charges. A common event is the offer of a Damage Claim Waiver by a renting agency. If such a charge appears on an invoice, it will be considered for inclusion when payment is calculated. As with Materials, the Engineer may require competitive bids for equipment rentals. Normally, this requirement must be made in advance before the work is started. However, if the rental is not made in an “arm’s length” transaction, for example when the contractor rents the equipment to himself through some sort of business structure, then after the fact quotations may be obtained from independent rental agencies and the lowest such quotation may be used in place of the rental invoice.

Chapter 1
Any contractor-owned equipment, not considered part of equipment already being paid for, listed in the Blue Book with a monthly rate of less than $100 and any other equipment with a purchase price of between $100 and $500 are considered Small Tools (except for rentals). Small tools may include specialty safety equipment required for the force account work, like respirators, entry/retrieval gear for confined space and hand tools. Safety equipment that is used day in and day out and/or consumable is not included. The Contractor needs to provide supporting invoices or affidavit of purchase costs. The negotiations should consider discussions of shared use with other work and residual value. Small tools should be paid for by a lump sum agreement, or other means as agreed to by the parties, that may be paid monthly or after the force account work is completed. Finally, as a special insertion into this manual, there is a separate method of paying for Pavement Routers for Crack Sealing. WSDOT has agreed to set aside the Blue Book rate for this equipment and to pay $20 per hour for the operated router. 4. Services – Services billed by invoice will be compensated according to the invoice if that is the typical method in standard industry practice. Typical industry practice might include specialized technical services, such as Testing Labs and Environmental Cleanup firms. Also included might be unit price invoices, such as Sweeping per mile or Concrete Pumping per cubic yard, or lump sum quotation invoices, such as Remove Danger Tree or Pump Septic Tanks. The markup for services depends on the nature of the firm’s activities on the project. If the firm is clearly an uninvolved supplier, then the Service markup will apply. If the firm is acting as a subcontractor, then the markup will be made under the subcontractor provisions described below, with the underlying (subcontractor’s) overhead and profit assumed to be embedded in the invoice. It should be noted that payment of force account work through an invoice does not excuse the Contractor from other requirements of the contract. Wage rate rules, subcontractor approvals and other provisions are still contract requirements and must be enforced. Such enforcement, however, is independent of the administration of force accounts and force account payment will not ordinarily be withheld to aid in the enforcement. Note that the statutes associated with some provision requirements do involve the withholding of payment for associated work. As with materials and equipment rentals, the Engineer may require competitive bids for invoiced services. Normally, this requirement must be made in advance, before the work is started. However, if the service is not obtained in an “arm’s length” transaction, for example when the invoice comes from a subcontractor without sufficient effort to find competitive prices, then after the fact quotations may be obtained from independent service providers and the lowest such quotation may be used in place of the service invoice. 5. Mobilization – Mobilization and demobilization are reimbursable expenses for assembling equipment, materials, supplies and tools for any force account item and then returning those items to the previous location when the work is finished. Demobilization can include restocking costs for materials not utilized. Force account mobilization applies to original bid item force accounts as well as force accounts added through change orders. The standard bid item “Mobilization” is assumed to not include mobilization activities for force account work. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-147
Chapter 1
Administration
Mobilization may occur within the project limits if special efforts are required to assemble needed items to the force account location. For example, if a lowboy is required to move a bulldozer from one end of a project to the other, then that mobilization effort would be reimbursed. If off site preparation work is needed, the Contractor must notify the Engineer in a timely enough manner that the work can be observed, if that is desired. Without such notice, that preparation work will not be reimbursed. The AGC Agreement allows for pro-rating mobilization costs for equipment that will be used in both force account and bid item work. This will be done by negotiation and agreement. For example, if the Project Engineer and Superintendent agree that a mobilized backhoe will be used three hours on regular work for each hour on force account, then 25 percent of the mobilization costs would be paid on the force account. All mobilization activities can be categorized as Labor, Equipment, Materials, or Services and will be listed under those categories for payment. 6. Other Payments
• Permits or Fees – When a force account requires the Contractor to pay for permits or fees (hazardous waste dumping, etc.) that would fall outside the scope of overhead, these costs are reimbursable and may be included in the “Services” Section of the force account payment.
• Retail Sales and Use Tax – How retail sales tax and use tax is handled on the overall project depends on the ownership of the property upon which it rests. The retail sales tax consequences related to construction projects and land owned by the state of Washington or privately is addressed by WAC 458-20-170 (“Rule 170”), while the retail sales tax consequences related to construction projects and land owned by a municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state of Washington, or by the United States is addressed by WAC 458-20-171 (“Rule 171”). With respect to Rule 171, ownership refers to ownership for the street, place, road, highway, easement, right of way, etc. being constructed and not the underlying real property. See RCW 82.04.050(10); Rule 170; and Rule 171. Thus, for instance if WSDOT has an easement with respect to a road subject to a construction project, then Rule 171 treatment will not apply even if the underlying real property were owned by the United States, Indian tribe, or municipal entity. The Contractor’s books may be audited by the Department of Revenue upon completion of each project to ensure compliance. – State and Local Tax: WAC 458-20-170 – Retail Sales and Use Tax – Item quantities listed in the summary of quantities under Standard Specifications Section 1-07.2(2) require retail sales tax on the item to be paid by the Contracting Agency; therefore; Contractor would not include the tax in their bids. The Contracting Agency provides this tax payment to the Contractor on the total cost summation of the bid items listed under Section 1-07.2(2). Contractor remits this retail sales tax through to Department of Revenue. Under state tax law project Work requires remittance of retail sales tax on the full contract price.

Chapter 1
• Resale Items – Materials purchased for incorporation into the permanent project.
• Use of Reseller Permits – Generally, purchases of tangible personal property by persons without a valid reseller permit are subject to retail sales tax. See WAC 458-20-102. For example, a Contractor’s purchases of materials incorporated permanently into the structure being built or improved as part of the project Work (including but not limited to cement concrete, lumber, finished hardware, asphalt concrete pavement) are treated as a retail sale at the point of purchase unless the contractor has a valid reseller permit. If the contractor has a valid reseller permit, the Contractor can provide it to their vendors to purchase these materials permanently incorporated into a structure being built or improved under a project without paying retail sales tax. These materials if purchased with a reseller permit are considered to be purchased for “resale”.
• Tax Paid at Sourced Deduction – If the contractor does not have a valid reseller permit when purchasing materials permanently incorporated into a structure being built or improved as a part of the project Work, the contractor must pay retail sales tax at point of purchase and then may take the appropriate deduction (tax paid at source) when filing its Washington state excise tax return. The Contracting Agency pays retail sales tax to the Contractor when the material is incorporated into the permanent work of the project.
• Consumables Items – There may be items that the contractor is required to pay retail sales tax on at the point of purchase because they are consumed by the Contractor rather than resold (“consumables”). For example, tools, machinery and equipment, and supplies consumed (including but not limited to concrete forms, fuel or tools, equipment purchased or rented) during the performance of the project work are “consumables”, which are a part of the overall cost of doing business for the Contractor. The Contractor is required to pay retail sales tax at the point of purchase/rental for these items or use tax if retail sales tax is not paid. These costs are bid as a part of the associated bid items. The contractor is considered the “consumer” when renting equipment for use in Washington State and must pay sales tax on the total charge. This is no different than purchasing a tool the contractor must have in order to perform its services and passing the cost on to the customer. The sales tax paid by the contractor to the rental company is a cost of doing business and, if it is passed on to the customer, it is considered to be part of the gross contract price that is subject to sales tax. When calculating or estimating the cost of force account or change order work, retail sales tax will always be applied and paid by the Contracting Agency on the whole summation of daily force account cost including labor, equipment and material costs, which can in the case of “consumable” items include paying retail tax on a tax. – State and Local Tax: WAC 458-20-171 – Retail Sales and Use Tax – For item quantities listed in the summary of quantities under Standard Specifications Section 1-07.2(1) retail sales tax is not required on the item. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-149
Chapter 1
Administration
However, the Contractor is required to pay retail sales tax on all of its own retail sales taxable purchases regardless of use (“consumable” or not) or use tax if retail sales tax is not paid. For contract work, this expense is incidental and therefore included in the individual contract items as a part of the bid amount.
• Ownership By Covered Persons – Rule 171 applies where the operative public road construction is owned by a municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state of Washington, the United States, or an Indian or Indian tribe in Indian country. RCW 82.04.050(10); Rule 171, and WAC 458-20-192.
• WSDOT Not A Covered Person – WSDOT is not a municipal corporation, political subdivision of the state of Washington, the United States, or an Indian or Indian tribe. Therefore, where the operative public road construction is owned by WSDOT, the construction is subject to retail sales tax consistent with Rule 170 above.
• WSDOT Easements – Washington Excise Tax Advisory (ETA) 3068.2009 explains that where “title to the land upon which the highway, street, place, or road is being constructed vests in the state of Washington, the construction contract is a retail sale.” ETA 3068.2009 further makes clear that this vesting provision refers to the street, place, road, highway, easement, right of way, etc. being constructed and not the underlying real property. Thus, for instance if WSDOT has an easement with respect to a road subject to a construction project, then Rule 171 treatment will not apply regardless of whether the underlying real property is owned by another party. When calculating or estimating the cost of force account or change order work, sales tax should be included on all invoices. As stated previously, the fact that taxes are shown or not shown on invoices is not a reliable indication of what the contractor is obligated to pay. The contractor may receive reimbursement later or be required to pay additional taxes when the contract is complete.
• Exceptions – Consistent with Rule 171, construction of the following facilities has been specifically exempted. Work on these facilities falls under Rule 170 even if they are on non state owned land: – Water mains. – Telephone, telegraph, electrical power, or other conduits or lines in or above streets and roads, unless such power lines become a part of a street or road lighting system. – Construction of sewage disposal facilities. – The installing of sewer pipes for sanitation, unless the installation thereof is within, and a part of, a street or road drainage system.
• Conclusion – Most of the time, retail sales tax on invoices is required. In turn, we need to reimburse the contractor for the tax (paid or deferred) on force account invoices and include the costs when estimating the value of change order work. The one exception is “resale” items if the contract falls under Department of Revenue rule 170 where retail tax sales need not be paid at the point of purchase. These rules should be adhered to regardless of whether retail sales tax is shown on the invoice. Page 1-150

Chapter 1
• Contractor Markup on Subcontractor’s Work – If work is being performed by a Subcontractor (or by a service supplier acting in the manner of a Subcontractor), a supplemental markup will be added. This supplement will be added one time for each payment, even if a lower-tier subcontractor is doing the work. No additional markups will be applied to force account work done by a Subcontractor’s lower tier subcontractors. If more than one Subcontractor performs work on the same force account item, the supplemental markup is applied separately to each Subcontractors computed cost for their work. Additional markups are not applied to force account work done by a Subcontractor’s lower tier subcontractors. Section 1-09.6 of the Standard Specifications states the additional markup is applied to each Subcontractor doing force account work. Section 1-01.3 of the Standard Specifications defines Subcontractor as an individual, partnership, firm, corporation or joint venture that is sublet part of the contract by the Contractor. A lower tier subcontractor does not have a sublet with the Contractor. Their sublet is with the Subcontractor; therefore the additional markup is only applied to Subcontractor per the Standard Specifications. The supplemental markup is a graduated step down rate, which gets smaller as the amount of payment to a given Subcontractor for that force account item increases. The supplemental markup rate is determined by the accumulated value of work that a specific Subcontractor has performed on each specific force account item. For example, if Subcontractor × performed force account work on bid item A in the amount of $150,000 for the first estimate, the markup would be calculated at 12% for the first $25,000, 10% the next $75,000, and 7% on the remaining $50,000 and all subsequent payments for this bid item work (($25,000 × 0.12) + ($75,000 × 0.10) + ($50,000 × 0.07) = $14,000 markup). The amounts on which the rate is determined will be tracked separately for each Subcontractor on each force account item included in the original contract or added by change order. If two Subcontractors work on the same force account item, then the accumulated total will be tracked for each, and markup for work done by each will be according to the respective total. If a single Subcontractor works on two force account items, then there will be a running total of work done by that Subcontractor on each force account item and the markup rate for the same sub on different force account items could be different. Records and Source Documents Accurate daily time records should always be kept when performing force account work. A Daily Report of Force Account Worked DOT Form 422-008A is provided for the Project Engineer’s use to help facilitate timely, accurate, and complete records of the daily force account activities. Whatever method of record keeping is used, it is recommended that the document be signed by both the Inspector and a representative of the Contractor agreeing on the materials used and the hours noted for labor and equipment. A copy of the daily report must be provided to the Contractor. When the work is performed by a subcontractor, a copy should also be provided to the subcontractor.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

Chapter 1
Administration
The costs for force account work should be determined and entered into the CAPS system in as timely a manner as possible. All calculations for determining force account costs should be checked, initialed, and dated. After the cost of the work has been computed in the office, a copy of calculations shall be furnished to the Contractor. Summary To summarize, the purpose of force account is to fully reimburse the Contractor for costs incurred on the work. The objective of force account administration is to minimize the inclusion of any “contingencies” included in the contract bid in anticipation of costs that may be incurred during force account work and not reimbursed. Items which are bid or negotiated with a unit price or a lump sum agreement will not be converted to force account unless a change (as defined in Standard Specifications Section 1-04.4) has occurred. On the other hand, any work to be done or the remaining portion of work underway on a force account basis may be converted to unit prices or a lump sum at any time the parties can reach an agreement. Such a conversion is highly desirable and should always be a goal of the Project Engineer.
SS 1-09.8
Payment for Material on Hand Payment for material on hand (MOH) may be considered for materials intended to be incorporated into the permanent work. The requirements for payment of MOH are noted in Standard Specifications Section 1-09.8. Payments for MOH are made under the 900 series of item numbers as ledger entries and need to be backed out as items are utilized such that 900 series entries are zeroed at close out of the contract. Therefore logically payment for MOH shall not exceed the value of the corresponding bid item. It is the responsibility of the project engineer to devise procedures that assure this is done correctly. Payments may be made provided the contractor submits documentation verifying the amounts requested, the materials meet the requirements of the contract and the materials are delivered to a specified storage site or stored at the suppliers/fabricators as approved by the project engineer. Materials shall be segregated, identified and reserved for use on a specific contract or project. Payments commensurate with the percentage of completion may be paid for partially fabricated items. All materials paid for as MOH must be readily available for inspection by the owner. Steel materials must be available for inspection but this availability need not be immediate. Reasonable notice should be given to allow the contractor to locate and make the material available for inspection. The project engineer may accept a higher level of risk that steel material may not be reserved for our use. The contractor’s obligation to perform the work and the surety’s guarantee of this obligation serve to offset the risk that reserved materials are diverted to other projects. When materials paid for as MOH are stored in areas outside the general area the region shall make arrangements for inspection as deemed necessary prior to making payment. The region may utilize other regions or the State Materials Laboratory in doing so.

When contracts are estimated to cost more than $2 million and require more than 120 working days to complete, a General Special Provision (GSP) will be included in the contract provisions, requiring documentation from the contractor as the basis for MOH payments and deductions. When this GSP is included in the contract provisions, the following procedure is used to determine how much of the MOH payment should be deducted from an estimate:
• Each month, no later than the estimate due date, the contractor will submit a document and the necessary backup to the Project Engineer that clearly states: – The dollar amount previously paid for MOH, – The dollar amount of the previously paid MOH incorporated into the various work items during the month, and – The dollar amount that should continue to be retained in MOH items. If work is performed on the items and the contractor does not submit a document, all previous associated MOH payments may be deducted on the next progress estimate.
SS 1-09.9
Payments
General Payment for work performed by the Contractor and for materials on hand must be made in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-09. To facilitate payments to the Contractor and ensure proper documentation, WSDOT utilizes an automated computer system to record project progress in terms of bid item quantity accomplishment. This is then used to pay the Contractor for actual work performed during each designated pay period or for materials on hand. The automated system that completes this task is called the Contract Administration and Payment System (CAPS). CAPS utilizes an electronic tie between each Project Office’s computer system and the mainframe computer. This system provides access to a large volume of corporate data and facilitates the maintenance of this data by different groups in different locations. Some of these different activities include:
• Contract Initiation – A Headquarters action whereby new contracts are created and stored in a computer file. The information consists of the names of the Contractor and the Project Engineer, project descriptive data, accounting identifier numbers, preliminary estimate, proposal date, bid opening date, award date, execution date, accounting groups and distributions, and an electronic ledger.
• Project Ledger – An updating process by the Project Office which keeps track of work performed on the contract as it is completed.
• Estimate Payments – A Project Office action whereby progress estimates and Regional final estimates are processed directly from the Project Office. The Headquarters Final Estimate process activates the Region Final when all the required paperwork is in place. Supplemental final estimates are processed by Headquarters only. Complete instructions for use of the CAPS computer system are included in WSDOT Contract Administration and Payment System M 13-01.

Progress Estimates Progress estimates are normally processed on the 5th of the month for odd numbered contracts and on the 20th of the month for even numbered contracts. Where the Project Engineer deems it appropriate, estimates may also be run on other dates. Estimates may also be run on other dates if the progress estimate or parts of the progress estimate were withheld to encourage compliance with some provision of the contract and the Contractor resolves the issue that caused the withholding. These estimates should be paid immediately upon resolution by the Contractor. Within the CAPS system, the basis for making any estimate payment is information from the project ledger. Every entry in the ledger is marked by the computer as paid, deferred, or eligible for payment. Before an estimate can be paid, a Ledger Pre-Estimate Report (RAKD300C-PE) must be produced. In constructing this report, the CAPS system gathers all the ledger entries that are identified as eligible for payment, prints them on the report summarized by item, and shows the total amount completed to date for that item but not yet paid for by progress estimate. The report also shows any deferred entries or exceptions if they exist and includes a signature block for the Project Engineer’s approval. If there are errors or omissions in this report, the ledger must be changed to reflect the correct data. After corrections are made, the Ledger Pre-Estimate Report must be run again in order to get the corrections into the report and made available for payment by progress estimate. Once the Ledger Pre-Estimate Report is correct, an actual estimate can be paid. The report containing the Project Engineer’s signature should be retained in the project files. The estimate process is then accomplished with a few keystrokes in option 2, estimate payments, in the CAPS main menu. At this point, the CAPS system will automatically calculate mobilization, retainage (on projects containing no Federal funds), and the sales tax. The warrant will be produced, signed, and sent to the Contractor along with the Contract Estimate Payment Advice Report and two different sales tax summary reports. Copies of these reports will also be sent to the Project Office. When the Project Office receives their copy of the Contract Estimate Payment Advice Report, the total amount paid for contract items should be checked against the Pre-Estimate Report. This helps to verify that the amount paid was what the Project Engineer intended to pay. In addition, the ledger records that produced the estimate will now be marked by the CAPS system as being paid. Once the estimate is paid, the Project Engineer should ensure that estimate payment information is available to all subcontractors and any other interested parties who request the information. This may be accomplished by posting to a project specific webpage, a Region Construction webpage, email, or other means as determined by the Project Engineer and the Region Construction Office. Up to the point of actually producing the warrant, the entire process for making a progress estimate payment is initiated and controlled by the Project Office. Particular attention should be given to the comparison of the plan quantities and the estimate quantities for the various groups on the project as shown on the Ledger PreEstimate Report. Overpayments on intermediate progress estimates are sometimes difficult to resolve with the Contractor at the conclusion of the project. Page 1-154

Chapter 1
New groups which do not change the termini of the original contract or changes in groups should be accomplished by memorandum from the Region to the Accounting and Financial Services Division. An additional estimate may be prepared if considerable work has been done between the date of the last progress estimate and the date of physical completion when the Engineer anticipates delays in preparing the final estimate. Should this circumstance occur, the additional estimate should show the work done to date no later than the day before the date of physical completion. Payment for Lump Sum Items The Contractor is required to submit a detailed Lump Sum price breakdown for those items specified as Lump Sum for which there is no specified payment described in the payment clause of the applicable specification. Estimate payments for items specified as Lump Sum will be a percentage of the price in the Proposal, based on the Project Engineer’s determination of the amount of work performed. Consideration will be given to, but payment will not be based solely on, the Contractor’s Lump Sum breakdown. The Project Engineer should verify that the price breakdown is based upon a reasonable proportioning of the work, and detailed enough to allow a determination of the work performed on a monthly basis. Payment of the first 80 percent of the Lump Sum price for Type B Progress Schedules will be made on the next progress estimate following the submittal and approval of the Type B Progress Schedule. The payment will be increased to 100 percent of the Lump Sum price when the Contractor has attained 80 percent of the Original Contract Award amount, as shown on the CAPS Pre-Estimate Report (inclusive of payments made for Material on Hand). On WSDOT contracts for which payment is made through CAPS (Contract Administration and Payment System), payment for mobilization is calculated and paid automatically by the system. On contracts that do not use CAPS, the Project Office must calculate, and make payment for, the Contract item “Mobilization.” Payment will be made in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-09.7. Based on the lump sum Contract price for “Mobilization,” partial payment will be made as follows: 1. When 5 percent of the original Contract amount has been earned from other Contract items, excluding any amounts paid for materials on hand, the Contractor is also entitled to a partial payment of the Bid item “Mobilization.” This payment, which is in addition to payment for contract work performed, will be calculated as 50-percent of the amount bid for “Mobilization” or 5 percent of the original Contract amount, whichever is the least. 2. When 10 percent of the original Contract amount has been earned from other Contract items, excluding any amounts paid for materials on hand, the Contractor will be paid 100 percent of the amount bid for “Mobilization” or 10 percent of the original Contract amount, whichever is the least. This payment is in addition to payment for contract work performed. 3. When the Substantial Completion date has been established for the project, payment of any remaining portion of the lump sum item “Mobilization” will be made.

Payment for Falsework On those projects which include a lump sum item for bridge superstructure, payment may be made on request by the Contractor for falsework as a prorated percentage of the lump sum item as the work is accomplished. The Project Engineer may require the Contractor to furnish a breakdown of the costs to substantiate falsework costs. For any given payment request, the Contractor may be required to furnish invoices for materials used and substantiation for equipment and labor costs. Payment for Shoring or Extra Excavation When Shoring or Extra Excavation Class A is included as a bid item, payment must be made as the work under the bid item is accomplished, the same as for any other lump sum bid item. When Shoring or Extra Excavation Class B is included as a bid item, measurement and payment shall be made in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-09.4 and 2-09.5. RCW 39.04 provides that the costs of trench safety systems shall not be considered as incidental to any other contract item, and any attempt to include the trench safety systems as an incidental cost is prohibited. Accordingly, when no bid item is provided for either Shoring or Extra Excavation Class A or Shoring or Extra Excavation Class B and the Engineer deems that work to be necessary, payment will be made in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-04.4. Payment for Asphalt, CRS-2P, Steel, and Fuel Cost Adjustment Some projects may include the specifications for Asphalt Cost Adjustment, CRS-2P Cost Adjustment, Steel Cost Adjustment, or Fuel Cost Adjustment (one or more) as a General Special Provision. Not all projects will contain these provisions, since their use depends on the type of work, the duration of the contract, and Region preference. For those contracts containing one or more of the cost adjustment bid items, an adjustment (payment or credit) will be calculated monthly for qualifying changes in the index price of the commodity. No adjustment (payment or credit) shall be made if the ‘Current Reference Cost’ is within the percentage of the ‘Base Cost’ specified in the contract, and only those items that are included in the provision are eligible for adjustment. Worksheets are available, in the “Shared Documents” folder of the State Construction Office Sharepoint site at: http://sharedot/eng/cn/hqconstr/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx, to assist the Project Office in computing these price adjustments, and on the State Construction Office web page (Construction - Escalation Clauses | WSDOT (wa.gov) to assist the Contractor and local agencies. It is important to understand that the adjustments provided by these provisions are not a guarantee of full compensation for changes in the contractors cost, and that they are intended only to absorb some of the risk of severe cost escalation during contract performance. Because of this, the method of computing the adjustment has been simplified to eliminate tedious considerations that would otherwise be required to provide precise reimbursement of actual costs. The Reference Cost is posted twice each month on the external website at: http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Business/Construction/EscalationClauses.htm Payment for “Asphalt Cost Price Adjustment”, “CRS-2P Cost Adjustment” and “Fuel Cost Adjustment” is based on quantities of the eligible material(s) incorporated during the period covered, as demonstrated by pay notes for those items. Regardless of the Contract estimate cutoff date – the 5th or 20th of the month – adjustments will be calculated once Page 1-156

Chapter 1
per month using the Current Reference Cost, as defined in the Contract, for the total quantity of each eligible item for which we have tickets. If an unusual number of late tickets are received, work with your ASCE to determine the appropriate calculation. The Current Reference Cost will be selected from the website using the “Date Effective” that immediately precedes the current month’s progress estimate end date. Payment for “Steel Cost Adjustment” is based on the quantity of eligible steel items incorporated or paid as Materials on Hand for the period covered. The Contractor is required to provide documentation of the quantities and the date shipped from the producing mill to the manufacturer. If the Contractor fails to provide the required documentation, any adjustment credit will be unilaterally computed by the Project Office using a shipment date determined by the Engineer. If the Contractor wishes to protest this adjustment, it must be done in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-04.5. When a portion of the payment for an eligible item is deferred, a similar portion of the price adjustment for that item should be deferred. The provisions for these cost adjustments are silent regarding changed work because there are other Contract clauses that address how the Department will pay for changed work. Should changes occur in bid items that are eligible for adjustment, equitable adjustments should adhere to the guidance provided in Section SS 1-04.4. Under no circumstances should eligible items that were not included in the specifications at the time of bid be added by change order after award and execution of the contract. Likewise, these provisions should not be added by change order. FHWA will not participate in the cost of retroactive price adjustments. Credits Dollar amounts may be deducted as a “Below the Line Miscellaneous Deduction” from progress or final estimates when WSDOT is due a credit from the Contractor. Routine credits from the Contractor to WSDOT include, but are not limited to, the following items:
• Engineering labor costs when due to Contractor error or negligence, additional engineering time is required to correct a problem. This includes the costs of any necessary replacement of stakes and marks which are carelessly or willfully destroyed or damaged by the Contractor’s operation.
• Lost and/or damaged construction signs furnished to the Contractor by WSDOT. The Contractor should be given the opportunity to return the signs or replace them in kind prior to making the deductions.
• Assessment to WSDOT from a third party that is the result of the Contractor’s operations causing damage to a third party, for example, damage to a city fire plug. Actual costs will be deducted from the estimate.
• Other work by WSDOT forces or WSDOT materials when the Contractor cannot or will not repair damages that are the responsibility of the Contractor under the contract.
• Liquidated damages not associated with contract time, i.e., ramp closures, lane closures (see Section SS 1-10).
• As provided for in the specifications, specific costs or credits owed WSDOT for unsuccessful contractor challenged samples and testing. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-157
Chapter 1
Administration
The authority to withhold and assess routine “Below the Line Miscellaneous Deduction” on progress and final estimates has been delegated to the Regional Construction Manager, and may be further subdelegated to the Project Engineer. The Project Engineer must give written documentation to the Contractor describing the deduction and provide sufficient notice of the impending assessment. Credit items which are specifically provided for by the Standard Specifications or contract provisions, such as non-specification density, non-specification materials, etc. may be taken through the contract items established for those purposes. A change order is required for credit items which are not specifically provided for by the contract provisions. Occasionally a Contractor will send a check directly to a Project Office for payment of money due WSDOT. (The Project Office should not request payment.) Whenever a Project Office or WSDOT employee receives a check or cash directly from a Contractor, it is very important that the guidance found in the WSDOT Accounting Policy Manual M 13-82, Section 2-1, Control of Cash Receipts, be followed. Withholding of Payments Withholding payments for work the Contractor has performed and completed in accordance with the contract should not be done casually. There must be clear contract language supporting the action. The authority to withhold progress payments is subdelegated to the Regions. Further delegation to the Project Engineers is at the discretion of each Region. There are very few occasions when it would be appropriate to withhold the total amount of a payment for completed work. If a minor amount of cleanup remains, if a portion of the associated paperwork has not been submitted, or if minor corrective measures are needed, then the correct action is to pay for the work and defer an amount commensurate with the needed remaining effort. The concept of “allowing the Contractor to proceed at his own risk” and then withholding payment is not often supported by the contract. There is a contractual obligation to finish the work correctly, there would certainly be a “moral obligation” on the part of the Contractor to live up to the bargain, but there is no contract language that allows such an action. Specific exceptions to this rule are listed below. Once a decision to withhold any part of the monthly payment has been reached, then it is imperative that the Contractor receive fair notice of this action. The method of this notice can be negotiated with the Contractor and could be a listing at the time of estimate cutoff, a copy of the pre-estimate report or other mechanism. Once notice has been provided, then it is also necessary to allow a reasonable time for corrections to be made. No Payment for the Work – Standard Specifications Section 1-06.3 is unique in that this is a situation, specified as part of the contract, where the contractor may request permission to assume the risk for no certificate and end up never being paid for the related work.

Chapter 1
Progress Payment Deferral – In the following situations, the contract specifies that the contracting agency has the authority to defer the entire progress payment:
• The contracting agency may not make any payments for work performed by a Prime/ Subcontractor until the contractor performing the work has submitted a Statement of Intent to Pay Prevailing Wages approved by Labor and Industries (RCW 39.12.040).
• Failure to submit the “required reports” by their due dates (Standard Specifications Section 1-07.11(10)B). Wage Administration in General – The administration of wages and payment for the work are separate issues. Holding a force account payment for certified payrolls is not appropriate. Withholding payments on the contract is suggested as a method to achieve compliance under Standard Specifications Section 1-07.9(1) pertaining to wages. This remedy should not be used without approval of the State Construction Office. Routine enforcement of wage requirements should be done on their own merits utilizing the sanctions specified as follows: State Wage Administration – Labor and Industries is the enforcement agency for state prevailing wage administration. The State (WSDOT) is protected under the contract from wage claims by reserving 5 percent of the moneys earned as retained percentage. This 5 percent is made available for unpaid or underpaid wages liens among other claims. Contract payments should not be deferred due to a contractor’s failure to pay the State minimum prevailing wage. Federal Wage Administration – FHWA-1273 specifies that the State Highway Administration (SHA) is in the enforcement role for federal prevailing wage administration. Under Section IV “Payment of Predetermined Minimum Wage” subsection 6., “Withholding,” the State Highway Administration (contracting agency) is authorized to withhold an amount deemed necessary to make up any shortfalls in meeting Davis Bacon prevailing wage requirements. It goes on to authorize the deferral of all payments, under certain conditions, until such violations have ceased. This is only for federal wage requirements and the amount “deemed necessary” must be based on the amount of the underpayment. Application of the Standard Specifications – Standard Specifications Section 1-05.1 reads in part as follows: “If the Contractor fails to respond promptly to the requirements of the contract or orders from the Engineer: …. 2. The Contracting Agency will not be obligated to pay the Contractor, and ….” Standard Specifications Section 1-09.9 reads in part as follows: “Failure to perform any of the obligations under the contract by the Contractor may be decreed by the Contracting Agency to be adequate reason for withholding any payments until compliance is achieved.” Sounds good and we can do so, but withholding of payments owed the contractor must not be done on an arbitrary basis. Other than the previously noted exceptions, money is normally withheld because work/work methods are not in accordance with contract specifications. Also, the amount withheld must have a logical basis. We cannot penalize the contractor by withholding more than the out of compliance work is worth.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-159
Chapter 1
Administration
Withholding payments should not be used routinely as a tool for forcing compliance on general contract administration requirements. The State is protected against nonperformance by requiring a performance bond. In the event that lack of contract compliance puts the State at substantial risk monetarily or safety wise, it may be appropriate to inform the contractor of the compliance problem and suspend work under Standard Specifications Section 1-05.1 until corrections are made. When withholding money, remember that delaying the contractor’s cash flow may damage the contractor’s ability to perform work. Before doing so, the State should be able to demonstrate:
• Specifically what was not in accordance with the contract and where the requirement is specified in the documents.
• That the amount withheld is commensurate with the amount of the unauthorized, uncompleted or defective work.
• That the contractor was notified in a timely manner (within eight days per prompt pay laws) and given a chance to make corrections.
• That the State has worked with the contractor to mitigate corrections to nonspecification work in order to minimize the cost. The State is required to pay the contractor in a prompt manner within 30 days after receipt of the work or after recognition of entitlement to additional compensation. The Project Engineer must keep an eye on the calendar when scheduling monthly estimate payments. Regions are not authorized to withhold amounts that are greater than the estimated cost of the missing or incorrect portion of the work. Any such excess withholding must be approved by the State Construction Office. Delinquent Contractor Submittals Missing submittals is a principal source of delays in closing out the project and processing the final estimate. As the project proceeds toward completion, the Project Engineer and the Contractor should attempt to obtain all submittals as the need arises. These might include such things as materials certificates, certified payrolls, extension of time requests, or any other item or document that might delay processing the final estimate. Attention is needed to assure the receipt of these items from subcontractors as they complete their work. Final Estimates The final estimate for a Contract is processed in CAPS by selecting the “Final” option when running the estimate. The final estimate is a two part process that begins with the Region running the Region Final and is completed when the Accounting and Financial Services (AFS) Division runs the Headquarters Final. Running the Region Final in CAPS will not generate a warrant for the Contractor, but instead will generate the following reports:
• Final Comparison of Quantities
• Contract Estimate Payment Advice
• Contract Estimate Payment Total and
• Sales Tax Summary Page 1-160
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
The Work Done to Date entry on a final estimate is the Physical Completion Date. CAPS cannot process estimates if the Work Done to Date entered is after the Physical Completion Date. Review the reports generated for accuracy, verifying quantities posted and costs accumulated during the life of the Contract. Corrections can be made to the project ledger in CAPS and the Region Final can be rerun as needed to ensure it is correct. Region Finals showing an overpayment to the Contractor will be processed in the same manner. If this occurs, the Contract Estimate Payment Totals report will show a negative amount due to the Contractor. When AFS receives the accepted final estimate package, they will request reimbursement from the Contractor for the amount owed. The Project Engineer should not request reimbursement from the Contractor. Once the Project Engineer has validated the amounts, forward the following documentation to the Contractor using the approved electronic software:
• Contract Estimate Payment Totals Report - CAPS report RAKC300F-EA – Informational only, Contractor signature not required
• Final Contract Voucher Certification (FCVC) DOT Form 134-146 - Requires Contractor signature The person signing the Final Contact Voucher Certification must be authorized to do so. Authorized signatures are submitted by the Contractor at the beginning of each Contract. Submit the documentation noted above to the Contractor for electronic signature as soon as reasonably possible, but within six months of Physical Completion. Once the Contractor and PE signatures are obtained, the FCVC will automatically be sent to Region by the electronic signature software. Region cannot proceed with signatures and approvals until all outstanding documentation has been received and the Project Office sends the final estimate package for review. After Contract Completion has been granted and the Region has reviewed and approved the FCVC, submit the final estimate package to the State Construction Office. Project Offices must submit documentation to the region for region executed contracts. Include recommendations for assessment of liquidated damages associated with Contract time if not submitted previously. The State Construction Office must resolve all issues of liquidated damages before the final estimate package can be accepted and submitted to the AFS and Financial Services Division. Final Estimate Package The final estimate package consists of the following:
• Project Status Report will include: – Contract time and recommendations for liquidated damages related to contract time. – Amount of railroad flagging used if any. – Identify Miscellaneous Deductions by including backup documentation equal to the amount deducted – Explanation of any Monies Due WSDOT as indicated in the Contract Estimate Payment Totals. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-161
Chapter 1
Administration
– Identification of overruns/underruns in Contract quantities and a brief explanation of resolution. – In addition, indicate whether or not all Affidavits of Wages Paid have been received for the Contractor, and all Subcontractors, agents or lower-tier subcontractors. List all Contractors, subcontractors, etc. for whom an Affidavit has not been received.
• Final Contract Voucher Certification – DOT Form 134-146, original only.
• If an assessment of liquidated damages has been made previously, include a copy of the letter from the State Construction Engineer to the Contractor assessing these.
• If an assessment of miscellaneous damages or liquidated damages resulting from causes other than time, include copies of letters from the Region to the Contractor to document assessments.
• Contract Estimate Payment Totals – RAKC300F-EA. The final estimate package for contracts executed by the Region will be reviewed by Region Construction and the Final Contract Voucher Certificate will be signed by the Region Administrator (as Designee) accepting the Contract. The date on which the Region Administrator signs the Final Contract Voucher Certificate becomes the final acceptance date for the Contract. The final estimate package is retained with the permanent final records. When the final estimate package is reviewed by the State Construction Office for acceptance of the Contract, the date the State Construction Engineer signs the Final Contract Voucher Certification becomes the final acceptance date for the Contract. The final estimate package is then submitted to AFS. Final Estimate Claim Reservations Should the Contractor indicate a claim reservation on the Final Contract Voucher Certification, it must be accompanied by all the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 1-09.11(2) (provided these have not been met in a previous claim submittal). The Project Engineer must assure that the requirements have been met prior to submitting the final estimate package to the State Construction Office. If the claim package is incomplete, return the FCVC to the Contractor with notice of the missing parts. Unilateral Acceptance The Project Engineer cannot establish Contract Completion if the Contractor is unwilling or unable to submit one or more of the required documents noted in Standard Specifications Section 1-08.5. However, the Region can request that the State Construction Engineer accept the Contract by signing the Final Contract Voucher Certification (FCVC) in spite of the missing documents. If the Contractor has not signed the FCVC, the Region can request that the State Construction Engineer accept the Contract without the Contractor’s signature. The Region is responsible for notifying the Contractor before such a request is made. The State Construction Office will send the email and delivery confirmation required in Standard Specifications Section 1-09.9. The date the State Construction Engineers signs the FCVC becomes both the final acceptance date and the Contract Completion date for the Contract, both established unilaterally.

Chapter 1
Formal Claim Settlements After Acceptance Formal claim settlements are negotiated and approved by the Assistant State Construction Engineer, and may require payment adjustments after the Final Contract Voucher Certification (FCVC) is signed. To process a payment or take a credit after a project is accepted by the State Construction Engineer, the Project Engineer should complete, assemble and route the following items. 1. Send the formal claim settlement (which has been approved by the Assistant State Construction Engineer) and a letter to the Contractor that includes the following information:
• A claim decision has been determined
• The formal claim settlement documentation
• The amount of the claim settlement
• Who made the decision and what process was utilized
• Timeframe for paying the settlement
• Request the Contractor sign and return the attached formal claim settlement
• Include the statement: “This Claim Settlement Statement is issued in connection with the settlement of a claim, as evidenced by the attached settlement agreement. The execution of this Statement does not change the established Completion Date and Final Acceptance Date of the contract or cause the need for a new final contract voucher.” 2. Contact region program management to determine if work order needs to be reopened in TRAINS. If a separate group will be used to track settlement payments, request the new group and provide a copy of the letter. 3. Send the original, contractor signed, settlement agreement, a copy of the letter and payment information (group/control Section to be used) to the State Construction Office. The State Construction Engineer or the Deputy State Construction Engineer will sign the settlement agreement, and forward received documentation to CAPS. A copy of the agreement will be returned to the Project Office for inclusion in the contract Permanent Final Records. CAPS will inform the Project Office of the new item number created in CAPS. 4. Prepare a Field Note Record to document the payment, and post as an entry for the new item number using the appropriate group(s). Taxes will be assigned based on the group(s). Once complete, the Project Engineer runs a Supplemental Final Estimate and contacts HQ CAPS for further instructions. Supplemental Final Estimates A Supplemental Final Estimate is a payment adjustment made to a contract after the Final Estimate has been processed and the project has been accepted by the State Construction Engineer. A Supplemental Final Estimate may be necessary to correct an inadvertent under payment or where a claim settlement may require additional payment be made to the Contractor. In order to complete a Supplemental Final Estimate, the Project Engineer should complete and assemble the following items, routing them through the Region to the State Construction Office for review and further processing: WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-163
Chapter 1
Administration
1. Complete any corrections or additional postings necessary in CAPS, including any postings to change order items added to CAPS for the settlement of a claim. (Please note, where additional CAPS postings are necessary after the Physical Completion date has been established, the “Work Done To” date in CAPS must be entered as the Physical Completion date or prior.) 2. Complete a Pre-Estimate report including the Project Engineer’s recommendation for payment. 3. Assemble the backup information supporting the necessity and substantiating the cost of the changes to be made. 4. Send 2 and 3 above via email or campus mail to the State Construction Office. After review, the Pre-Estimate report will be signed by the State Construction Engineer authorizing payment to proceed. While postings and corrections to CAPS may continue, once the Completion date has been established for a contract, CAPS will no longer allow the Project Engineer or the Region to process further payments to the Contractor. As a result, payment of the Supplemental Final Estimate will need to be completed for the Project Engineer by the Accounting and Financial Services Division. If this process requires a more timely response, the above documentation may be scanned and emailed to the State Construction Office and CAPS; and the contract payments Section can be requested to print out the pre-estimate report to be taken to the State Construction Engineer for signature prior to processing the supplemental final estimate. Once the supplemental payment is completed, the signed and executed Pre-Estimate report will be returned to the Project Engineer where it can be maintained as a part of the project payment files and made a part of the Region Temporary Final Records. The above process will also be used when there has been an inadvertent over payment to the Contractor, the Final Estimate has been processed, and the project has been accepted by the State Construction Engineer. In this case, the Project Engineer must work with the Region, the Contract Payments section of the Accounting and Financial Services Division and the State Construction Office to make the correction. If the Accounting and Financial Services Division requires a supplemental Final Contract Voucher to reflect the new cost of the contract due to the supplemental estimate, the new voucher will not be signed by the Project Engineer as that would reestablish the final acceptance date and restart the 30 day period to file claims against the bond (RCW 39.08.030) and restart the 180 day period for Contractor to file suit (Section 1-09.3(11)). The original acceptance dates will not change from the dates the Construction Engineer signed the original Final Contract Voucher Certificate. SS 1-09.9(1) Retainage Retained percentage withholding is based upon RCW 60.28, which provides that:
• A sum not to exceed 5 percent of the money earned by the Contractor on estimates for projects containing no Federal funds is to be retained by the Contracting Agency.
• The Contractor may submit a bond for all or any portion of the amount of funds retained by WSDOT. Page 1-164

Chapter 1
When a Contract is awarded, the Division of Accountability and Financial Services (AFS)/Contract Administration and Payments System (CAPS) unit or the Region Plans Office sends a package of contract documents to the Contractor. This package of Contract documents also includes the necessary instructions for the Contractor to make application for a bond to replace all or any portion of the retainage. The bond form will be processed by AFS/CAPS without involvement from Project Engineer’s Office, although the payment system will not allow them to process a payment until some form of retainage is in place. The Contractor, at any time during the life of the contract, may make a request to the Project Engineer for the release of all or any portion of the amount of funds retained. This request does not need consent of surety since the retainage bond form, for this purpose, requires their consent. The Region must forward this request by transmittal letter to AFS/CAPS, which will furnish the appropriate bond form to the Contractor for execution. The Contractor may return the executed bond form directly to AFS/ CAPS for final approval and signature by WSDOT.
• Effective July 27, 2011, for projects containing no Federal funds that include landscaping work the Contractor may request that, 30 days after completion of all contract work other than landscaping work, WSDOT release and pay in full the amount of funds retained during the life of the contract for all work except landscaping. In order to initiate this release of funds, DOT Form 421-009 should be completed by the Contractor and submitted to the Project Engineer. In signing the request, the Project Engineer will confirm that all work, except landscaping work, is in fact physically completed. For any landscaping work that may have been completed, the Project Engineer will designate the amount of landscaping moneys, if any, that have been earned to date by the contractor. In the space designated for remarks the Project Engineer will identify the landscaping or plant establishment work that remains to be completed and its approximate value. Except for landscaping work, the Project Engineer will determine if all Statements of Intent and Affidavit of Wages Paid have been received for the work that has been physically completed. The Project Engineer will transmit to the Contractor a list of all subcontractors, including UBI numbers, believed to have performed work on the project. The Contractor will verify which subcontractors did work on the project and that the UBI number listed is correct for each subcontractor. DOT Form 421-009 will not be transmitted to AFS/CAPS until the Contractor has verified the subcontractors and UBI numbers. WSDOT will continue to withhold a 5 percent retainage of any moneys earned for landscaping work that may have been completed to date and will continue to retain 5 percent of the moneys that are to be earned for landscaping that is yet to be completed. A bond is not required. The completed request along with the Project Engineer’s cover memo confirming receipt of Statement of Intent and Affidavit of Wages Paid for the Contractor, subcontractor, and any lower-tier subcontractors, who were involved in the completed work, is then forwarded to the State Construction Office, through the Region Construction Office, for approval. Once approved, the Construction office will submit the request to AFS/CAPS for further processing. If there are no claims against the retainage still in place and releases have been received from Revenue and Employment Security within the designated 60 day period, AFS/CAPS will release the appropriate portion of retainage to the Contractor.

Payment for Surplus Processed Materials When excess aggregate is produced by the Contractor from a WSDOT furnished source, the Contractor will be reimbursed actual production costs if the excess materials meet the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 1-09.10. If more than one type of aggregate is involved, the provisions of Standard Specifications Section 1-09.10 apply to each type. When excess aggregate for HMA is produced, adjust the planned and actual HMA quantity by deducting the quantity of Asphalt and RAP or other materials used in the mix. If WSDOT has a need for the excess aggregate for either maintenance or future construction contracts, the material may be purchased into the appropriate inventory account. The Project Engineer should contact Region Maintenance and the Accounting and Financial Services Division for guidance. If aggregates are to be disposed of as surplus, the Project Engineer should contact the State Administrative Services Office, Purchasing and Inventory Section, for additional assistance.
SS 1-09.11(2) Claims Claims by the Contractor The Standard Specifications contains specific requirements in Section 1-04.5 which, if not followed, may result in a waiver of the Contractor’s rights to submit a Certified Claim. The Project Engineer should monitor whether the Contractor has met these requirements. If all the requirements have been met, the Project Engineer must evaluate the merits of the Certified Claim. If the Contractor has pursued and exhausted all the means provided in Standard Specifications Section 1-04.5 to resolve a dispute, the Contractor may file a Certified Claim. A Certified Claim, filed in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-09.11(2), is a much more structured device and demands a high level of conformance with the contract requirements. The objective is to utilize the rights that WSDOT has under the contract to identify the issues, obtain a sufficient level of information from the Contractor and limit the discussion to a defined subject matter. To accomplish this, and to maintain the Department’s rights in a situation that may lead to court action and expensive lawsuits, the Project Engineer must insist on rigid conformance with the requirements of the provision. In fact, the first evaluation must not be of the claim’s merit, but rather of the claim’s structure and content. If the package fails the specification requirements in any way, it should be returned to the Contractor immediately with a written explanation. Conversely, if the package meets the contract requirements, then the Project Engineer must comply with the demands for WSDOT actions that are included in the same specification. The notarized statement that is required to accompany the Certified Claim states that it is a “true statement of the actual costs incurred and time sought and is fully documented and supported under the Contract between the parties.” The Contractor is acknowledging that they have expended the cost and time that they are seeking. Therefore, a Certified Claim may only be submitted after the costs have been realized. If the Project Engineer receives a Certified Claim for costs that have not been realized by the Contractor they should contact the State Construction Office.

Chapter 1
The existence of a Certified Claim does not diminish the responsibility of the Project Engineer to pursue resolution. The only difference is that State Construction Office final approval of a proposed settlement is required. The change order settling a formal claim must include waiver language similar to the following: “The Contractor, (company name), by the signing of this change order agrees and certifies that: Upon payment of this change order in the amount of $___________, any and all claims set forth in the letter(s) to the Department of Transportation, dated ___________ and signed by ___________ of (company name) in the approximate amount of $___________, have been satisfied in full and the State of Washington is released and discharged from any such claims or extra compensation.” If the settlement is intended to close out all dispute discussions for the contract, use language similar to: “The Contractor, (company name), by the signing of this change order agrees and certifies that: Upon payment of this change order in the amount of $___________, any and all claims in any manner arising out of, or pertaining to, Contract No. ____________, (including but not limited to those certain claims set forth in the letter(s) to the Department of Transportation, dated ____________and signed by ____________ of (company name) in the approximate amount of $____________, have been satisfied in full and the State of Washington is released and discharged from any such claims or extra compensation in any manner arising out of Contract No. ____________.” Legal Filing Once the Contractor has submitted a Certified Claim in acceptable form and the State has either denied the claim or failed to respond in the time allowed, the Contractor is free to seek judicial action by filing a lawsuit or, in some cases, demanding binding arbitration. Note that the Contractor must fully comply with the provisions of Standard Specifications Section 1-09.11 before it can seek judicial relief. Once any legal action has been started, the Project Engineer may only continue with settlement efforts if the Attorney General’s office has given specific permission to do so. Such permission may be sought through the State Construction Office. Settlements of claims which have resulted in a judicial filing need review and approval by the Attorney General’s office and different waiver language similar to the following: “The Contractor, (company name), by the signing of this change order agrees and certifies that: Upon payment of this change order in the amount of $____________, any and all claims in any manner arising out of, or pertaining to, Contract No. ____________, (including but not limited to those certain claims set forth in the complaint filed under Thurston County Cause No.____________ (Contractor’s name) vs. State of Washington), have been satisfied in full and the State of Washington is released and discharged from any such claims or extra compensation in any manner arising out of Contract No. ____________.” Any documents pertaining to a settled claim which has resulted in a judicial finding must be kept for a period of six (6) years following the date of the court order dismissing the lawsuit.

Final Contract Voucher Certification The Final Contract Voucher Certification requires the Contractor to acknowledge and certify that the final estimate is a correct statement showing all monies due from the State. It releases the State from any claims arising from performance of the Contract. The Contractor must submit any Certified Claims with, or prior to, signing the FCVC and must note any Certified Claims as exceptions on the FCVC. If there is no exception above the Contractor’s signature on the FCVC, the Contractor’s right to submit a Certified Claim has been waived. Once the project is physically complete, the Project Office should assemble the final estimate and send it to the Contractor with the FCVC for signature. If the Contractor does not sign and return the FCVC in a reasonable time, WSDOT may unilaterally set the completion date and process the final estimate without the Contractor’s signature. The Project Engineer should send at least one reminder to the Contractor prior to pursuing unilateral final acceptance. Proposals to unilaterally accept a contract should be discussed with Region managers before contacting the State Construction Office to request unilateral final acceptance. Requests to the State Construction Office for unilateral final acceptance should include evidence of the initial transmittal of the FCVC and any reminders sent to the Contractor. The Contractor must submit any Certified Claims prior to unilateral final acceptance or their rights to said claims shall have been waived. Note: Contracts executed by the Region do not require acceptance by the State Construction Engineer. The final signature will be the Region Administrator, Area Administrator, or designee.
SS 1-09.12 Audits The Project Engineer is responsible for preparing all necessary records to document the work performed on the Contract. Detailed instructions on the records required and methods of preparing them are covered in Chapter 10. Construction Quality Audits Construction Quality Audits will be performed by the Construction Division - State Materials Laboratory to document conformance of project records to DBE compliance, construction administration and materials certification standards. The Construction Quality Audit consists of documentation review and may include a field review. The documentation review will normally be conducted at the Project Office unless arrangements are made for it to be conducted elsewhere. The goal is to perform a Construction Quality Audit on at least one project per Project Office every three years. Construction Quality Audits may be conducted more frequently at the discretion of the Construction Division. Projects will be selected with consideration given to project size and complexity. Audits are typically performed during the active life of the project; generally, 20 percent to 80 percent complete, but also may occur after substantial completion has occurred. Construction Quality Audits are performed to validate that construction inspection, contract administration, materials testing and documentation are completed in accordance with established requirements and standards.

Chapter 1
Records reviewed will include those maintained and developed by the Project Engineer for DBE compliance, inspection requirements, approval, testing, acceptance and field verification of materials placed and paid for on the Contract. In addition to general audit deficiencies found, the following are audit performance measures:
• Record of Materials: Accuracy maintained with less than 10 percent errors
• Materials Approval: Accuracy maintained with less than 10 percent errors
• Materials Acceptance: Accuracy maintained with less than 10 percent errors
• Field Verification: Accuracy maintained with less than 10 percent errors
• Materials Testing Frequencies: Within 10 percent of minimum required frequencies Audit areas with less than 10 percent deficiency are exit items, while audit areas that exceed 10 percent are audit findings. Upon completion of the audit, the findings will be discussed with the Project Engineer and/or their representative. Audit exit items are areas for the Project Engineer to make improvements to processes and can require corrective action be taken to resolve the issue. General audit deficiencies and audit findings are more serious and require a corrective action plan to document the Project Office process improvements. The final audit report will be sent to the Project Engineer with copies sent to the Region Documentation Engineer, Region Construction Engineer, State Construction Office, Construction Materials Office, and the FHWA Division Office. The Project Engineer will address any general audit deficiencies, exit items and audit findings found by the audit, documenting the correction, deviation or change that resolved the deficiency. Deficiencies not rectified or meeting the requirements of Section 9-1.2F shall be noted during the Materials Certification. The Project Engineer is responsible for developing and implementing a corrective action plan to ensure audit deficiencies and audit findings are avoided on future audits and to review the corrective action plan with the Region Construction Engineer for their concurrence. All contract documentation shall be available for review by the Audit Team. The following items of documentation may be requested by the Audit Team: 1. Request to Sublet Work Form 421-012 2. DOT Form 420-004 3. DBE On-Site Review Form 272-052 4. Record of Materials, as revised and amended by the Project Office (see Section 9-1.2C) 5. Approval Documents a.

Temporary Traffic Control
SS 1-10.1
General
Work Zone Traffic Control The primary function of work zone traffic control is to move vehicles and pedestrians safely through or around work zones while protecting on-site workers and accommodating the Contractor’s construction operations. All work is to be performed by the Contractor under the Contractor’s control and supervision. All resources are to be provided by the Contractor unless the Special Provisions of the Contract specifically states that the Department will provide some Page 1-170
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
resource(s), what those resources will be and how they are to be utilized. Such provided resources will be placed in the Contractor’s control to be used in the Contractor’s operation. Any additional resources provided to the Contractor during the project should be accompanied by a change order to the Contract and, where appropriate, a price reduction. The “General” requirements for traffic control (Standard Specifications Section 1-10.1) address the responsibility to provide adequate traffic control measures at work zones as follows:
• No Work shall be done until all necessary signs and traffic control devices are in place and conflicting or confusing signs are covered.
• If the Contractor does not provide necessary traffic control, WSDOT may do it and deduct the cost from the Contractor’s payments.
• The Contractor is responsible regardless of whether or not WSDOT orders, furnishes, or pays for necessary traffic control. It is important for the Project Engineer to ensure that the Contractor has an accepted traffic control plan in place and implemented providing all necessary signs and other traffic control devices so that the traveling public is aware of all deviations from the normal traffic conditions and is furnished adequate direction and guidance to permit safe travel through the construction area. Law Enforcement Traffic Control Assistance Law Enforcement traffic control assistance is considered an enhancement to the required work zone traffic control and should be reserved for those work zones that have unusual hazards or a high degree of worker exposure to traffic, which cannot be addressed by traditional traffic control means. The use of Law Enforcement Officers in work zones follows two scenarios. Each scenario differs in the duties, management, administration, and payment for the officers. Uniformed Police Officer (UPO) In the first case, a Contractor provided UPO may be included in the plans to participate in a Contractor’s traffic control activity, perhaps for intersection flagging. The UPO is provided by the Contractor and their use will be defined in the Contract Provisions and traffic control plans. The Contractor shall direct the activities of the UPO and payment will be made in accordance with the Contract Provisions. It is important to note that Washington State Patrol (WSP) Troopers may be used in the roll of a UPO. Washington State Patrol (WSP) The second case, WSP Troopers are dispatched for active enforcement for speed control or roadway/ramp closures around an active work zone. In this case, WSP does not participate in the Contractor’s traffic control work with the possible exception of a rolling slowdown on the interstate. The Contract Provisions will identify the number of hours and tasks that will be provided at no cost to the Contractor. Costs for hours beyond what is noted in the provisions will be split between the Department and the Contractor if the Project Engineer approves the need for additional hours. There shall be no entitlement to their services and no entitlement for any impacts for any reason as a result of WSP personnel. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-171
Chapter 1
Administration
It is important to establish and maintain communication through all phases of Work that include WSP, beginning at the pre-construction conference. Topics of discussion might include: WSP tasks, Trooper scheduling coordination, and communication strategies. Daily communication is necessary between the Project Inspector and WSP Trooper(s) assigned to the project at the beginning their shifts so they understand their roles and ensure that the appropriate traffic control strategy is applied. On each shift of WSP traffic control assistance, DOT Form 421-045, WSP Field Check List, shall be filled out. WSDOT will fill out the top portion of the form and give it to the WSP Trooper on the project to complete. At the end of the Trooper’s shift, the completed form shall be returned to WSDOT. WSDOT has agreement GC 5080 to reimburse the WSP for Trooper assistance on construction projects. Instructions for WSP assistance including contact information for the Districts and detachments are in the Traffic Manual M 51-02 Chapter 5. A mid-project decision to provide troopers would be a change order. To be fair to unsuccessful bidders, adding the WSP specifications to a Contract should have the initial number of hours set at zero if nothing else has changed so that all costs are shared between the Contractor and WSDOT. Routine enforcement by WSP in our work zones is always welcome. Records of Construction Signing, Collisions, and Surveillance It is important that detailed documentation of temporary traffic control installations be maintained. The following are recommended procedures and methods of documentation:
• Use photos and video records.
• The Contractor’s installation must adhere to the traffic control plan (TCP), and the records must confirm that the installation is checked against that plan. Involve the Regional Traffic Engineer for significant changes to the TCPs.
• Documentation of the Contractor’s activity for traffic control, including signing, should be completed by the Contractor’s Traffic Control Supervisor (TCS). In accordance with the Standard Specifications, the TCS must maintain a daily project traffic control diary. DOT Form 421-040A Contractor’s Daily Report of Traffic Control – Summary, and 421-040B Contractor’s Daily Report of Traffic Control – Traffic Control Log, are provided to the Contractor for this purpose. The Summary report will typically contain a brief description of the daily activities of the TCS with expanded details of any important event such as traffic collisions, meetings, decisions, or rapidly deteriorating conditions of traffic or weather. The Summary report is usually sufficient to verify the location and status of Class A signs once they are installed.
• The Traffic Control Log report is used to specifically identify all details of each Class B work zone setup. This includes identification of specific signs used, location of the signs, location of Flaggers, location of the work zone, the time it was set up, and the time it was removed. Additional information includes cone layout, if used, comments about piloted traffic, and comments about the setup of an accepted TCP. The Project Inspector must work with the Contractor to ensure the Project Office is informed when collisions occur. It is important that the Project Office be aware of all traffic collisions within the project area. Thorough records must be maintained about the Page 1-172
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
collision, including site conditions, status of signing, other traffic control measures, and anything else that may have contributed to the incident. When an incident is investigated by the WSP, do not move signs until released to do so by the Trooper. Attempt to make contact with the Trooper to obtain a copy of the incident report or a case number. When inspections are made of the work zone, either by project or region personnel, document the inspection and maintain the reports in the project files along with responses to any action items that resulted from the inspection. Work Zone Safety and Mobility In keeping with the above recommendations, the Project Engineer should utilize the information obtained from traffic control reports, collision reports, and other field observation in order to better manage Work Zone impacts. This will allow the Project Engineer to implement any necessary changes to traffic control in order to increase safety and to enhance mobility through the work zone. At the completion of each project, the Project Engineer should review the traffic control used on the project in order to identify trends, etc. that may be used to improve Work Zone practices or strategies. This information should be summarized and provided to the Region Traffic Office for inclusion in annual reports.
SS 1-10.2
Traffic Control Management Standard Specifications Section 1-10.2 addresses the requirements and duties of the Contractor’s management personnel responsible for traffic and the Traffic Control Supervisor (TCS). The Contractor has the responsibility for managing traffic control and providing safe traffic control measures that are appropriate for the type of work and consistent with the requirements of the contract plans and specifications. The Contractor’s traffic control work is a contract activity. Just like other contract activities, it is associated with pay items. The activity must be inspected for adequacy and conformance with the contract. Once it is performed and inspected, associated contract items must be measured and paid. Traffic management actions affect not only the Contractor’s work operations, but also those of subcontractors. The process for coordinating and approving those actions must be well defined and consistent with the contract requirements. Contractor management and the TCS work together with the Project Engineer and WSDOT’s traffic control contact person to address traffic control issues as the work progresses. Planning and coordination of the Contractor’s work efforts with appropriate traffic control measures are the primary responsibilities of contractor management. It is also the responsibility of management to ensure that any adopted State-provided or accepted Contractor-proposed Traffic Control Plans (TCPs) needed to implement the contract work operations are provided to the TCS and that any necessary resources to implement the TCP are available.

SS 1-10.2(1) General SS 1-10.2(1)B
Traffic Control Supervisor
The Traffic Control Supervisor (TCS) ensures that the traffic control measures shown on the accepted traffic control plans (TCPs) are properly implemented, operating, and documented on the project. The Contractor’s TCS may not be required full time on the project, but is required to perform all the duties required by the Specifications. When the Contractor is working multiple shifts, it may be necessary to have more than one person assigned to the role. In addition to the Contractor’s responsibility to designate a Traffic Control Supervisor, WSDOT may designate a DOT employee who is qualified, but not necessarily certified, to serve as the State’s traffic control contact. It is intended to have qualified, trained representatives from both the Contractor and WSDOT work together to achieve safe traffic control operations on the project. Among the duties of the Project Engineer in the area of Traffic Control are the following:
• Communication – About the planned work, traffic control needed and adjustments to the accepted Traffic Control Plan. During the work, to stay aware of changes, events and issues.
• Monitoring – The activities of the Contractor TCS and traffic control workers. The status of signs and control devices. Conformance with specifications and requirements.
• Documentation – Obtaining and reviewing daily reports. Handling Traffic Control Plans and their approvals.
• Coordination – With adjacent projects, with DOT Traffic offices, notices to the media. The Project Engineer may assign these duties in any manner. It would make sense to include the State’s traffic representative in these activities. When reference is made to the Traffic Control Supervisor (TCS) in these provisions or in the Standard Specifications, it shall mean the Contractor’s Traffic Control Supervisor unless stated otherwise. SS 1-10.2(2) Traffic Control Plans Standard Specifications Section 1-10.2(2) addresses the requirements of Traffic Control Plans (TCPs). The Contractor must either adopt the TCPs appearing in the contract or propose modified TCPs to be used for the project. The Contractor must submit proposed modifications to plan TCPs or alternate plans at least ten calendar days in advance of the time the traffic control will be required. Approval of these plans must be obtained before the work can begin. The possibility of alternate plans is covered by the contract. No change order will be needed because of that reason. However, if a price adjustment is needed then a change order will be necessary to accomplish that. We would allow additional payment, either through added units or revised lump sums, only if the original contract TCP was shown to be inadequate or in the case of traffic control needed for another change in the work. If the proposal is only for contractor convenience or preference, then a discussion of no pay for added traffic control or a credit for less traffic control would be appropriate. If the contractor should balk at this, the response could be “build according to plan.” Page 1-174
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
Minor modifications to the TCP may be made by the Traffic Control Supervisor to accommodate site conditions. Modifications or adjustments to the plan must maintain the original intent of the plan. When there is a change in the intent and/or substantial revisions are needed, a revised TCP shall be submitted for approval through the TCM to the Project Engineer. The Regional Traffic Office should be consulted when this situation occurs. Again, changes may call for a formal change order. Traffic Control Plans should not only address all work zones and standard devices and signs but should also address issues such as:
• Conflicting or temporary pavement markings.
• Maintaining existing operational signs and covering conflicting signs.
• Staging requirements.
• Temporary vertical or lateral clearance restrictions.
• Temporary work zone illumination.
• Consistency with any existing work hour restrictions.
• Position of positive barriers for traffic hazards or worker protection.
• Vertical drop-offs.
• Work zone access.
• Intersections or access control (traffic signals, road approaches).
• Pedestrians and bicycles.
• Work zone capacity and related mobility impacts. If the Contractor’s method of operation or the work area conditions require other than minor modification of the specific TCP appearing in the contract or any of the TCP’s previously designated and adopted by the Contractor, the Contractor shall submit a proposed modification of the TCP for approval. If the Contractor’s proposed modifications comply with the MUTCD requirements and are consistent with contract requirements as well as State and Region policy, the Project Engineer may approve these proposed modifications (perhaps utilizing a change order, if appropriate.) If the Contractor’s proposed modifications do not comply with the MUTCD requirements, the Project Engineer should consult with the Region Traffic Engineer. Any Contractor proposed TCP or modifications to an existing TCP should be evaluated for their effects on work zone safety and mobility. The Project Engineer should refer to the guidance in the Design Manual M 22-01 Chapter 1010 when evaluating how the new TCP works within the projects overall Transportation Management Plan (TMP). On heavily used freight routes (I-5, I-205, I-405, I-90, I-82, I-182, SR 18, SR 167, and US 395-Tri-cities to Spokane), the contract may require that the Contractor provide the Engineer 30 calendar days of notice before implementing a TCP that reduces the travelled way to a single lane with a clear width of less than 16 feet for more than 4 calendar days. The request from the Contractor will include a schedule showing the dates of the width reduction, details of the limits and amount of the width reduction, description of available detour routes and a plan to provide unrestricted travel windows through the work zone when possible. The Engineer must provide 21 days of advance notice to Commercial Vehicle Services (CVS) at CVSPermits@wsdot.wa.gov. The Engineer should provide details of the width reduction to CVS and provide updates if there are any changes or adjustments in the schedule for the width reduction.

Administration
If there is any doubt that the proposed TCP complies with the MUTCD or provides for the safe movement of traffic, the Project Engineer shall consult with the Region Traffic Engineer or the Region Construction Manager. SS 1-10.2(3) Conformance to Established Standards Must meet standards of the MUTCD, and MASH 16 for devices made after 12/31/19 EXCEPT: If a device is not available with a manufacture date of 12/31/19 or later, then the Contractor may use a device that is compliant with either NCHRP 350 or MASH 09 with approval from the engineer. If the device was made prior to 12/31/19 and it was tested by NCHRP report 350 or MASH 09 it can be used through normal service life. Small devices – channelizing and delineating including cones, tubular markers, flexible delineator posts, plastic drums can meet either NCHRP 350, MASH 09, or MASH 16 as determined by device. Determination of crashworthiness is not required for trailer mounted devices like arrow displays, temporary traffic signals, area lighting supports and PCMSs. Standard Specifications Section 1-10.2(3) addresses the requirements for standards and condition of signs and all other traffic control devices. In addition to standards established in the latest adopted edition of the MUTCD and/or as specified in the contract plans, all traffic control devices shall meet the crashworthiness standards of the “National Cooperative Highway Research Project, 350 (NCHRP 350) or the AASHTO Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH). There are four categories of traffic control devices. Category 1 devices consist of small lightweight devices that generally do not present a hazard. Typical Category 1 devices are cones, tubular markers, and plastic drums with no attachments. The Contractor is required to keep the manufacturer’s certification document on file and available for inspection if needed. Inspection of certification documents by WSDOT is not routinely required but should be considered if operational or safety issues are observed. Category 2 contains devices that are more hazardous due to their rigid construction, such as barricades, portable sign stands, and drums with lights. The collision test certification rules apply to all Category 2 devices. The Inspector should verify, and document, that all portable sign stands have an identifying label affixed. The label will display the FHWA approval letter designation and will appear similar to the image below. Category 3 devices are fixed or substantial in mass and could cause significant damage to a vehicle or its occupants. Devices such as barriers, fixed sign supports, and TMAs are included in this category. WSDOT maintains a list of approved devices in this category on the QPL. Barrier is to be included in the contract plans to ensure that it meets WSDOT design standards. Category 4 devices are typically trailer or truck mounted devices such as arrow boards, PCMS, portable signals, and portable lighting units. Crash testing is not required for these devices but care must be given to their placement to ensure that they do not pose an undue hazard to drivers, and that they meet the requirements of Section SS 1-10.3(3).

Traffic Control Labor, Procedures, and Devices
SS 1-10.3(1) Traffic Control Labor All traffic control labor must be trained to ensure safety in the work zone. Flaggers have additional requirements concerning flagging cards and apparel. All flaggers working on WSDOT construction projects must have a valid State of Washington flagging card or a flagging card issued by the states of Oregon, Montana, or Idaho. Flaggers and all other personnel performing the Work described in Standard Specifications Section 1-10, are required to wear high visibility apparel as specified in Standard Specifications Section 1-07.8. Other workers may certainly use this type of clothing, but doing so is not a contract requirement, unless they are performing work on foot within the work zone of a Federal-Aid highway. SS 1-10.3(1)A Flaggers Typically, flaggers have the highest exposure to traffic hazards than other workers, so flaggers should only be used when all other forms of traffic control are inadequate. When flaggers are used, flagging stations must be shown on the TCP along with warning signs and other devices. Flagger stations shall be illuminated at night and should be protected with a positive barrier, if possible. The flagger must also have in mind an “escape plan” to avoid errant vehicles. Flaggers are not allowed on freeways and the use of flaggers to exclusively display the “SLOW” message is also not allowed. The provisions call for a flagger with intermittent responsibilities to direct traffic to step back from the flagging station between tasks. Additional guidance on the use of flaggers is located in Part 6 of the MUTCD and WAC 296-155-305.

Other Traffic Control Labor
For some projects, labor in addition to the assigned Flaggers is needed for a variety of traffic-related tasks. Some of these tasks are listed in the provisions. Hours for this item are measured only for work on certain defined tasks (see Standard Specifications Section 1-10.4(2)). SS 1-10.3(2) Traffic Control Procedures SS 1-10.3(2)A One-Way Traffic Control The major points to note in Standard Specifications Section 1-10.3(2)A are:
• The provision does not limit one-way traffic control to treated bases, surface treatments, and pavements. This type of configuration can be used in other operations, such as grading, when appropriate.
• Line of sight is important in coordination of side roads and approaches with the limits of the one-way operation.
• When the contract does not stipulate a pilot car operation, it may be established by change order if the Engineer deems that method of traffic control to be most appropriate; and – Contractor vehicles and equipment may utilize the closed lane in any manner. The one-way controlled open lane is for public traffic and, should the contractor use that lane, all rules and procedures applicable to public traffic will apply to the contractor. There will be no “wrong-way” travel in the open lane, no heavy equipment will join the public traffic and any additional traffic control will be performed according to accepted plans only. – The contractor is required to plan and conduct operations so that the roadway can be reopened to two-way traffic at the end of the shift. If the nature of the work prevents this or if the work area is left in a condition unsafe for public two-way traffic, then the contractor must continue the one-way operation throughout the off-shift hours. SS 1-10.3(2)B
Rolling Slowdown
This can be a useful method of creating gaps in traffic for specific, very short-term nonrepetitive activities such as sign bridge removal or utility wire crossing. Rolling slowdown traffic control operations are not to be used for routine work that can be addressed by standard lane or shoulder closure traffic control. The Contractor may implement a rolling slowdown on a multilane roadway, as part of an accepted traffic control plan per Standard Specifications Section 1-10.3(2)B. The key is planning and communication so the work can be completed without stopping traffic. If the work is not completed the contractor must undertake the most expeditious method of opening the roadway. If demobilizing and pulling off is faster than finishing the task, then it shall be done without regard to cost, efficiency, or schedule.

SS 1-10.3(2)C
Lane Closure Setup/Takedown
The use of truck-mounted attenuators (TMA) with arrow boards is required by the provisions. This combination is to be used during the transition from open lane to closed lane. Once a lane is closed, the TMA may be removed, leaving the arrow board alone. SS 1-10.3(2)D
Mobile Operations
The key to this operation is to keep the traffic control equipment effectively close to the work and moving to match the work operation. Two traffic protection devices are used. One is a TMA/Arrow Board combination upstream of the work. The primary purpose of this device is to protect the errant vehicle from fixed object collisions. The second device (preferably a TMA) is immediately adjacent to the work area. Its purpose is to protect the workers from the errant vehicle. SS 1-10.3(2)E Patrol and Maintain Traffic Control Measures This activity is to observe, repair and maintain traffic control devices and layout. The provisions require an hourly visit to each device and layout. Depending on the extent of the control measures, more than one patroller may be required. SS 1-10.3(3) Traffic Control Devices SS 1-10.3(3)A Construction Signs The standard of these provisions is that the contractor provides all signs, posts and supports. If the special provisions do not promise that some or all of these will be furnished by the State, then the contract requires the contractor to do it all. All signs shall be constructed from either aluminum or aluminum composite materials. “Do Not Pass” and “Pass With Care” signs are the responsibility of the Contractor. The provisions explain how to determine the number of these and that determination is to be made by the Contractor as well. Construction Signs (Standard Specifications Section 1-10.3(3)) divides construction signs into two categories, Class A and Class B, and lists the work required for the Contractor. At no time should signs be left in traffic control position during periods when they are not necessary to traffic safety. Indiscriminate use of traffic control signs soon destroys public confidence and respect for the signs. Unnecessary traffic restriction and inconvenience tends to reduce the effectiveness of all signing and causes difficulty in enforcement by authorities. The Project Engineer should ensure that signs are removed or completely covered per Standard Specifications Section 8-21.3(3) during the hours they are not needed, either before or after working hours and on nonworking holidays or nonworking weekends. Tripod-mounted signs in place more than 3-days in any one location, unless approved by the Project Engineer, shall be required to be post mounted to improve visibility, and to keep useable shoulders clear. Signing for nighttime traffic is more difficult than that required for daylight hours. A review of the project signing should be made and recorded during the hours of darkness.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 1-179
Chapter 1
Administration
Signs and other traffic control devices should be shown on the traffic control plan (either State-provided or contractor-submitted), approved and in use, and should be installed with adjustments for work zone and traffic conditions. The Contractor and WSDOT should ensure proper use and placement of signs and devices. For situations not addressed by the TCPs, the Project Engineer will determine who is responsible for preparing a revised TCP. Refer to the Work Zone Traffic Control Guidelines Book, MUTCD, or seek assistance from the Region Traffic Engineer for appropriate TCP revisions. A modified or new TCP may be needed if adjustments to signs and devices do not adequately address existing hazards or resolve observed traffic problems or accidents. Judgment will be required when a traffic control plan is changed. The project engineer must determine if the change has arisen because of a flaw in the original plans or because of the contractor’s activities or preferences. In the first case, a change order, perhaps with compensation, may well be needed. The remaining devices listed in the provisions are the following:
• Sequential Arrow Signs
• Tubular Markers
• Portable Changeable Message Sign
• Warning Lights and Flashers
• Barricades
• Tall Channelization Devices
• Traffic Safety Drums
• Traffic Cones
• Truck-Mounted Attenuator
• Portable Temporary Traffic Control Signal
The specifications for these devices should be sufficient to explain their use and requirements.
SS 1-10.4
Measurement Measurement is the key element of the new provisions, which now contain lump sum bid items. The provisions will define one of several pay item strategies, which will determine the measurements to be made. First, the “normal” project with these provisions will contain items. The items are different from previous contracts and are non-standard, although several have very similar item names. Each of these is described below. Instead of items, the project may be designated as a “Total Project Lump Sum.” This will be the case if the item “Project Temporary Traffic Control, Lump Sum” is included in the proposal. If this is the strategy of the project, then all measurement and payment provisions for all other pay items are deleted from the contract. When this occurs, then all temporary traffic control costs of whatever nature (everything defined in Section 1-10) are included in the lump sum. The project may be a lump sum hybrid. In this case, the Total Project Lump Sum item will be present, but the provisions will reinstate one or more of the deleted standard items. If that happens, the measurement and payment of the reinstated item(s) will be separate from and not included in the lump sum. These are the items and a discussion of the features of the measurement spec for each:
• Traffic Control Supervisor (Lump Sum) – Previously paid by the hour, this item is now a fixed cost. Overtime is not considered, a second TCS for a night shift makes
Page 1-180
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Administration
Chapter 1
no difference. This lump sum status will likely cause TCS to become a part of change order negotiations. If the change does, in fact, require additional TCS work, then there would be entitlement. This will also apply to extended contract duration, as the TCS can be considered part of on-site over-head.
• Flaggers (Per Hour) – This contract activity is separated from other kinds of traffic control labor. It is measured according to the hours that an approved flagging station is manned. We will not count minutes and seconds; time will be rounded up to the half hour as specified in Standard Specifications Section 1-09.1. If a station is manned, but full-time presence of the flagger is not necessary (trucks entering roadway, equipment crossing) then the flagger is expected to step back out of harm’s way until the next event. No deduction will be made for this stepping back, provided the flagger cannot be assigned to other duties while waiting. In measuring flagging, disregard overtime, split shifts, union rules for show-up time, the trade classification of the flagger and any other payroll issues. The flagging is a service that is provided and paid by the hour. It is only peripherally related to the flagger’s paycheck.
• Other Traffic Control Labor (Per Hour) – There are other duties for traffic control labor besides flagging. Some of them are included in this item for separate measurement. If one of the activities listed in the provision is provided, then measurement of that activity is appropriate. Only the hours that the activity is performed will be measured. Again, this is not a payroll measurement. Note the limit under patrolling and maintaining. No matter how many people are involved in this activity, measure only one hour for each hour that each approved route is operated. Another little feature shows up under the last bullet (Installing and removing devices). Time spent ahead of the setup marking layout points on the shoulder or getting signs ready in the yard will be measured under this item. Do not succumb to pressures to add other hours to this item. As the payment spec for “Other Temporary Traffic Control” states, all costs not compensated by other items are covered there. Construction Signs, Class A (per sq ft) to qualify for payment under this item, the sign must be designated as Class A on an accepted TCP or be directed installed by the Engineer and designated as Class A at the time of direction. After-the-fact re-designations of signs that have been originally thought to be Class B should not be considered.
• Other Unit Price Items – The traffic control provisions limit unit items to major devices. These include Sequential Arrows, Changeable Message Signs, Portable Signal and Transportable Attenuators. The measurement and payment requirements for these are similar or identical to those which have been in use for some time and are relatively straightforward. One point to make is with the force account item for Repair Transportable Attenuator. Because this is a temporary installation and not a part of the permanent work, the Third Party Damage item does not apply and that is why a separate force account is established. If the damage was caused by a third party, the department may well be able to recover the costs paid to the Contractor under this item. The Project Engineer should take steps to protect the department’s interest and involve the Maintenance, the Accounting and Financial Services Division, and Risk Management offices to initiate the efforts to recover costs.

SS 1-10.5
Administration
Payment The payment provisions of the new specifications are intended to provide a mechanism that accounts for all of the Contractor’s costs for temporary traffic control. The total project lump sum item is self-explanatory. There is no additional payment unless there is a change order. If the job contains items, the pay definition for each describes the limited portion of the Contractor’s costs that are covered by each item. The summary lump sum item (Other Temporary Traffic Control) is written to be a catchall cleanup that lets nothing escape for “additional compensation” discussions. Watch out for change orders. A principal concern over lump sum items is that work will be added that is not required by the original contract and no mechanism exists to increase traffic control payment. This can be straightforward in identified changes, merely becoming an additional aspect of the negotiation. More troubling are constructive changes, which are not written, but which do end up in negotiation. An “overrun” of asphalt pavement to add a few driveways may be a convenient way to do field decisions, but may also create a dispute over the related traffic control costs (not to mention the dispute about the changed nature of the paving).

Clearing, Grubbing, and Roadside Cleanup
SS 2-01.3
Construction Requirements
SS 2-01.3(1) Clearing Before starting grading operations, it is necessary to prepare the work area by removing all trees, brush, buildings, and other objectionable material and obstructions that may interfere with the construction of the roadway. From the standpoint of roadside appearance and control of erosion on the right of way, it is advantageous to preserve natural growth where possible. When shown in the Plans, the first order of work will be the installation of high visibility fencing (HVF) to delineate all areas for protection or restoration. The Project Engineer should double check the placement of the HVF and ensure it matches the locations indicated on the Joint Aquatic Resource Permit Application. In addition, the Project Engineer should discuss with the Landscape Architect the preservation of natural growth which will not interfere with roadway and drainage construction before starting clearing operations. If vegetation outside the clearing limits is damaged during the clearing or grubbing operations, or if pruning is required, the Landscape Architect or State Horticulturist may be contacted for assistance. Areas to be omitted from clearing or extra areas to be cleared should be determined before starting work and an accurate record made during staking operations. Staking Clearing stakes at least 4 feet long and marked “Clearing” should be set at the proper offset marking the limits of the area to be cleared. These stakes should be set at 100 foot intervals on tangents and at shorter intervals on curves, depending on the sharpness of the curve. Where slope treatment is provided, clearing should be staked to a distance of 10 feet beyond the limits of the slope treatment with a distance of 5 feet being considered the absolute minimum distance required. Grading stakes should not be set until clearing and grubbing work in a given area is completed. The method of measurement used at interchange areas should be such as to preclude the possibility of duplication or overlapping of measured areas. SS 2-01.3(2) Grubbing Grubbing provides for additional preparation of the work area by removal of remaining stumps, roots, and other obstructions which exist on or in the ground in all areas designated for grubbing. It should be noted that complete grubbing is not required under embankments where the fill height above natural ground, as measured to subgrade or embankment slope elevation, exceeds 5 feet. This exception does not apply to any area where a structure must be built, subdrainage trenches are to be excavated, unsuitable material is to be removed, or where hillsides or existing embankments are to be terraced. Grubbing is important to the structural quality of the roadway and every effort should be made to obtain a thorough job. Grubbing should be completed at least 1,000 feet in advance of grading operations.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 2-1
Chapter 2
Earthwork
The Contractor may accomplish clearing and grubbing in one operation. Complete grubbing under fill heights in excess of 5 feet is not required unless the Contract Provisions specifically modify Standard Specification Section 2-01.3(2). Staking Grubbing stakes must be set at the limits of the slopes as specified. Where slope treatment is required, grubbing must be extended to the limits of the slope treatment. Accurate records of grubbed areas need to be kept in the form of sketches and measurements. SS 2-01.3(4) Roadside Cleanup This work consists of cleaning up, dressing, and shaping the roadside area outside the limits of construction. In advance of completion of other work on the project, the Project Engineer and the Contractor need to determine the work to be done, the equipment and labor necessary, and estimate of the cost of the work. Do not use this item for any work to be paid under “Trimming and Cleanup,” or any other item. Any trees or snags outside the limits of areas to be cleared which may endanger traffic on the roadway itself should be removed under this work. Before removing danger trees outside of the right of way, the matter should be referred to the Regional Office for negotiations with the property owners. If, however, an emergency arises, which endangers traffic, the danger trees may be removed immediately and the Project Engineer should notify the Region as soon as possible. The work required in shaping the ends of cuts and fills so they appear natural with the adjacent terrain will be greatly reduced if proper warping of the cut and fill slopes has been accomplished during the grading operations.
SS 2-01.4
Measurement When the Contract provides for measuring clearing and grubbing by the acre, it is the intent of the Specifications to measure all areas actually cleared and grubbed. Minor uncleared areas within the clearing limits may be included in the quantity if they are less than 50 feet long, measured parallel to the centerline and contain an area less than 2,500 square feet. Small, isolated areas to be cleared, located between areas excluded from measurement and which contain less than 2,500 square feet, shall be measured as containing 2,500 square feet. Where isolated areas occur intermittently, the sum of the areas allowed by this method of measurement shall not exceed the total area (containing the several isolated areas) when measured as continuous clearing. This condition can occur when clearing narrow strips less than 25 feet in width.

Removal of Structures and Obstructions
GEN 2-02.3
General Instructions When water wells, resource protection wells, or septic tanks are encountered, the Project Office needs to ensure they are meeting all the requirements in WAC 173-160 Minimum Standards for Construction and Maintenance of Wells, WAC 246-227A On-site Sewage Systems, and all environmental considerations for leaving in place, decommissioning, or abandonment. Contacting the Regional Environmental Office for guidance is suggested. Resource protection wells include piezometers, slope inclinometers, and other instruments installed in boreholes. Resource protection wells and water wells must not be disturbed during construction. Before they can be disturbed, they must be decommissioned by a Driller licensed in Washington State and reported to the Department of Ecology. Only decommissioned water wells and decommissioned resource protection wells can be destroyed or buried during construction. If well construction records are not available, the well may need to be removed by drilling to remove the well in its entirety as part of the decommissioning process. All wells having artesian characteristics will require special consideration. The Geotechnical Office can assist with well decommissioning. If the Contractor or agents acting for the Contractor decommission wells on WSDOT property, it is imperative that the Project Engineer obtain copies of all paperwork for the well decommissioning and that the Project Engineer forward copies to the Field Exploration Manager within WSDOT’s Geotechnical Office. If a Contractor destroys, damages, buries, paves over, or obscures a well which has not been properly decommissioned, the Project Engineer must report the incident to the Department of Ecology, the Assistant State Construction Engineer, and the Field Exploration Manager of the Geotechnical Office.
SS 2-02.3
Construction Requirements Buildings, foundations, structures, fences, and other obstructions which are on the right of way and are not designated to remain, shall be removed and disposed of in accordance with the Standard Specifications. All salvageable materials designated to remain the property of the WSDOT shall be removed carefully and stored in accordance with the Special Provisions. Foundations shall be removed to the designated depth and basement floors shall be broken to provide drainage of water. Basements or cavities left by their removal shall be backfilled as specified, and if the areas are within the roadway prism, care shall be taken to see that the backfill is properly compacted. Care shall be taken to see that pavements or other objects which are to remain are not damaged during this operation.

Roadway Excavation and Embankment
GEN 2-03.1(1) GEN 2-03.1(1)A General Instructions Present day earth-moving equipment and practices have accelerated grading operations to the point where the Project Engineer must make every effort to plan ahead and foresee conditions which may require changes in plans, special construction procedures, or specific coordination with Subcontractors or other Contractors. Delays in work progress are costly both to the Department and to the Contractor, and must be avoided whenever possible. The Project Engineer needs to become familiar with the subsurface soil, rock, and groundwater conditions in the Contract and the available reference information. The Project Engineer should compare the Contract subsurface information with the actual conditions in the field. This will allow for adjustments in the Work, such as changes in haul to make best usage of better materials, changes in surfacing depth, variations in drainage, or a determination of same or changed conditions from what was expected. The Project Office should examine each newly exposed cut as soon as possible after it is opened in order that necessary changes may be made before excavating equipment has been moved away. This will necessitate an inspection of the cut slopes and the ditch cuts to locate any objectionable materials or faulty drainage conditions which should be corrected. Objectionable materials are those having characteristics which may cause an unstable subgrade or lead to instability in the cut. Among the conditions the Project Engineer must watch for are soil moisture contents which are so high as to render the subgrade unstable under the designed surfacing, high water tables and seeps, and soils where frost heaving may be serious, such as silts and very fine sands having high capillary attraction, and unstable rock structure. In the event such conditions are discovered, the Project Engineer needs to contact the Regional Materials Engineer for assistance in determining corrective action to ensure a stable subgrade and cut slope is achieved. Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(10) provides for selecting excavation material for special uses as directed by the Project Engineer. Judicious application of this provision should be made whenever the project will be benefited.
SS 2-03.1
Description Roadway excavation is specified in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-03.1 and shall include all materials within the roadway prism, side borrow areas, and side ditches. Borrow, unsuitable excavation, ditches and channels outside the roadway section, and structure excavation are separately designated. Area designations shall not be construed to imply classification based on the type of material involved.

Contaminated Media
Discovery of contaminated media (i.e., soil and water) is usually identified during preconstruction investigations and Special Provisions are subsequently developed for its handling and disposal. Occasionally, contamination is discovered where it was not expected during excavation and/or dewatering activities. Indicators of contamination often include soil staining, oily sheens in water, and chemical, fuel, foul, or sweet odors. When physical evidence indicates discovery of contamination, a series of response activities must begin to ensure that appropriate actions are initiated to minimize project delays, additional project costs, and WSDOT liability. Upon proper notification, WSDOT can direct characterization, removal, and disposal of the contaminated media through one of its On-Call Environmental Consultants or, if preferred, through the Contractor if they have the necessary equipment and certifications. Regardless of who performs the work, the WSDOT Hazardous Materials Program should be notified in order to provide guidance for proper management of the contaminated media. Discovery of unanticipated contaminated media will be considered a change as outlined in Standard Specifications Section 1-04.4 and work associated with removal and disposal of discovered contaminated media will be compensable. GEN 2-03.1(1)D
Temporary Water Pollution/Erosion Control
Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control (TESC) and Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) plans must be developed and implemented for all projects. Requirements for managing erosion and water pollution on the project are covered in Chapter 8 of this manual and in Standard Specification Sections 1-07.15, 8-01, and 9-14.

Construction Requirements
SS 2-03.3(1) Widening Of Cuts Normally, excavation will be made to the neat lines of the roadway section as indicated on the plans. When material shortages occur, additional quantities may be obtained either from borrow sources or from an enlargement of the Contract cuts as designated by the Project Engineer. Early determination of additional needs is desirable so that necessary enlargement can be made during the original excavation. The Project Engineer should ensure that enlargement of cuts is not in opposition to environmental commitments, does not impact protected areas, does not extend outside right of way, and remains in compliance with Contract Permits. Should it be necessary to return to a completed cut for additional material, effort should be made to cause no change in the Contractor’s normal method of excavation. If the original excavation was dressed to proper slopes, it will be necessary to pay for sloping the second time in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(1).
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 2-5
Chapter 2
Earthwork
SS 2-03.3(2) Rock Cuts Most projects involving rock cuts will provide for controlled blasting of the faces of the rock slopes to minimize blast damage of the face and overbreak. The Project Engineer may require controlled blasting for other slopes, even if the Contract does not require it. Usually this determination is made at the design stage, but formations may be encountered during the construction which were not anticipated during the design. The Project Engineer should advise the Geotechnical Office when rock excavation is in progress so that the Geotechnical Office may monitor the progress of the Work and check to see that the slopes are suitable for the rock as revealed. The Project Engineer should also contact the Regional Operations/Construction Engineer and Materials Engineer when it appears desirable to change the method proposed for any operational reason. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to determine the method of controlled blasting to use. The Contractor is required to drill and shoot short test sections to see that the method used is producing a satisfactory face and to develop the best methods for the particular rock formation encountered. The Project Engineer should review the results being obtained in the test section in coordination with the Geotechnical Office to see that they are satisfactory, and if they are not, discuss with the Contractor necessary changes in procedures to produce satisfactory results. Coordination, collaboration, and agreement between the Project Engineer, Geotechnical Office, and the Contractor is essential prior to proceeding with production blasting. Most rock faces will be formed by the preshear method consisting of drilling and blasting a line of holes on the face of the cut ahead of any other blasting. The cushion blasting method consists of blasting and removing the main part of the cut prior to blasting the line of holes on the face of the cut. It is important that the blasting for the main part of the rock does not shatter the rock behind the face of the cut. With either method, proper hole alignment is very important. Rock cuts are often made using a series of cuts or lifts. The lift height or depth of rock excavation is often dependent upon the depth that the holes can be drilled while maintaining proper hole alignment. For each lift, a setback of about 1 foot minimum is required since it is often impossible to position the drill flush to the rock face of the previous lift. The results obtained are dependent not only on the properties of the rock but upon the hole size, spacing, amount and type of explosive, spacing of the explosive in the hole, stemming and the timing of the blast. It is desirable that the Project Engineer keep a record of these procedures used by the Contractor, especially in the early phases of the work while the best methods are being sought. After excavating the rock cuts, the slopes shall be scaled and dressed to a safe, stable condition by removing all loose spalls and rocks not firmly keyed to the rock slope. Mechanical scaling using dozers, front end loader, etc., as the face is developed, is desirable. Any rock exposures which are felt to be a potential hazard to project personnel should be called to the attention of the Contractor. Loose spalls and rocks lying outside the slope stakes which constitute a hazard to the roadway shall be removed and payment made for their removal in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(2). Controlled blasting of rock faces may be measured by running a true profile over the top of the rock at each drill hole and quantities computed using cutoff elevations established for the bottom of the drill hole.

SS 2-03.3(3) Excavation Below Subgrade Where excavation is in solid rock, the excavation shall be completed full width of the roadway to a depth of 0.5 feet below subgrade. Particular attention is directed to the Provisions of the Specifications regarding drainage of pockets below subgrade in solid rock cuts. Pockets formed by blasting operations must be drained by ditching to the side ditches, and then backfilled with fragmentary rock, gravel, or other suitable material. Silty or clayey soils should not be used. Should soft areas exist in the subgrade of a completed earth cut, excavation below grade and replacement shall be accomplished in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(3). Particular attention should be given to areas of transition between cut and fill. Top soil and other organic or unsuitable material should be removed from these areas and replaced with material suitable for subgrade in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14). The subgrade of cut sections must be checked for density as it is required and necessary that the entire roadway subgrade meet the compaction requirements specified for the project and set forth in Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14)C, Method B. Density tests shall be taken for each 500 feet or fraction for each roadway. If the density of the subgrade is less than the required density, the subgrade material shall be improved in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(3). SS 2-03.3(5) Slope Treatment Earth cuts, soft or decomposed rock cuts, and overburden in all rock cuts shall have the tops of the slope rounded in accordance with Standard Plans for Slope Treatment to produce an aesthetic and pleasing appearance. The slope treatment shall be constructed at the time of excavation so the material resulting from the rounding of the slopes may be used elsewhere on the job or disposed of along with the excavation from the cut. The Project Engineer should go over the slope treatment procedure with the Contractor at the beginning of the excavation operation to ascertain that proper rounding is being constructed and reduce extensive reworking. SS 2-03.3(7) Disposal Of Surplus Material When there is a surplus of material which cannot be handled by changing grade or alignment, it shall be disposed of in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(7). If the surplus is wasted by widening the embankments, care must be taken to avoid creating a condition conducive to embankment erosion. If possible, the widening should be made in conjunction with the original embankment and placed in accordance with Method B embankment compaction specifications unless the Special Provisions require another method. If this is not possible, it is preferable to waste along low embankments where Method A compaction can be accomplished. Dumping of loose material on high embankment slopes must be avoided.

When the Geotechnical report indicates settlement is anticipated in embankments at bridge ends, surplus material shall not be wasted by widening embankments or by building up the adjacent ground line near the structure. Wasting material in this manner adjacent to a structure can result in increased, unanticipated, and adverse settlement of the embankment or structure even if the structure is founded on deep foundations. In areas where a preload or surcharge is required, any required contour grading must be done at the time the preload or surcharge is constructed. When the preload or surcharge is removed, the material must be removed entirely from the area and not placed on slopes or wasted in the adjacent area. Wasting excavation material and borrowing may be necessary, however, such operations must be kept to an absolute minimum. Carelessness in this respect is expensive and leads to an unsightly job. Careful planning of work and proper selection and mixing of available materials often will eliminate the need to waste and borrow. SS 2-03.3(11) Slides The Project Engineer’s attention is directed to Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(11), providing for the removal of slides in cut slopes and in embankment slopes. The Project Engineer is cautioned that before allowing the Contractor to perform this work the Geotechnical Office should be contacted to evaluate the potential cause of the slide and if removal and repair in accordance with Section 2-03.3(11) is in the Agency’s best interest. Large slides may require additional stabilization or design changes to ensure long term performance. Generally, slides and slumps involving less than 20 yards of material can be repaired with minimal risk and little geotechnical consultation. Any slides coming into the roadway after the slopes have been finished by the Contractor shall be removed by the Contractor at the unit contract price per cubic yard for the excavation involved. If the Project Engineer orders the slope to be refinished, payment for refinishing would be eligible for an equitable adjustment as defined in Standard Specifications Section 1-09.4. In case of slides in embankment slopes, the Contractor shall replace the embankment material from sources designated by the Project Engineer at the unit Contract prices. In the event the slide repair is such that quantities cannot be measured accurately, or if the Contractor must use a different type of equipment for removal than that available on the project, payment may be made as provided in Standard Specifications Section 1-09.4. The Project Engineer’s attention is directed to Standard Specifications Section 1-07.14, providing for the Contractor’s responsibility for sloughing and erosion of cut and embankment slopes. The ordinary sloughing and erosion of cut and embankment slopes shall not be considered as slides, and the Contractor is responsible for providing temporary control facilities to prevent this.

The following guidelines are provided to assist in determining responsibility for repairs to eroded areas: a. Slides – Slide repair costs will be borne by WSDOT, where there is no evidence of neglect by the Contractor. b. Erosion of Slopes i.
In places where water has run over the edge of the roadway and where the Contractor has neglected to provide adequate protection, the Contractor must assume the costs of repair.
ii. Where rain on cut and embankment slopes cause rills and wash, the Contractor must assume the cost of repairs except as noted hereinafter. iii. Where erosion of cut or embankment slopes occur from ground water seepage, WSDOT will assume the cost of repairs except when identified in the Plans and Provisions. The Geotechnical Office often recommends including a detail in the Plans when this has a high risk of occurring. If the Contract contains a repair detail, this is Work that should be included as part of the Contract and paid for under Contract items. c. Repairs i.
In b.ii., the Contractor must, at no expense to WSDOT, remove eroded material from the toe of slope, ditches, and culverts and restore the eroded areas with this material where practicable. If additional top and/or embankment material is needed or different materials are ordered by the Project Engineer, it will be furnished and placed by the Contractor at unit Contract prices.
ii. In b.i. and b.ii. where erosion has occurred and repairs are the Contractor’s responsibility, the Contractor must restore the area at no expense to WSDOT, including the seeding, mulching and fertilizing. iii. In a. and b.iii. where seeding, mulching, and fertilizing have been damaged, payment will be made for restoring same at the unit Contract price for seeding, mulching and fertilizing. SS 2-03.3(12)
Overbreak
Overbreak should not be paid for in any manner except when the planned roadway excavation is not sufficient to complete the embankment and borrow excavation has not been included in the Proposal. With the approval of the Project Engineer, overbreak material may be used to complete the embankment and payment made at the unit Contract prices for Roadway Excavation and Haul. When approved by the Project Engineer, available overbreak material may be used in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(12). In the event that conditions causing the overbreak justify reestablishing the slopes to include part or all of the overbreak section, the material reverts to roadway excavation material and shall be so paid for. Justifiable reason for reestablishing the slopes may be uncontrollable overbreak resulting from the existence of natural cleavage or faults in rock formations, planned slopes resulting in an unsafe and unstable condition, or other such reason. Overbreak may be expected on unstable slope projects involving rock cuts WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 2-9
Chapter 2
Earthwork
if the reason for the project is the rock cut is unstable. When a question occurs as to justification for reestablishing slopes because of overbreak, the Project Engineer must consult with the Regional Construction Engineer. When overbreak is surplus material and reestablishment of slopes is not justified, the materials shall be removed and wasted as provided for “Surplus Materials” under Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(7) except that the work shall be at the Contractor’s expense, including the cost of hauling and wasting. Where pay quantities of material are wasted and overbreak is used in lieu thereof, no allowance will be made for such overbreak. Haul in this case will be paid upon the basis of the pay quantities of excavation. SS 2-03.3(13)
Borrow
Borrow must be satisfactory for the use it is intended. Depending on the Borrow use and type, sampling and testing may be required to verify the quality and the quantity of suitable material available before use. Specific material requirements and acceptance criteria are detailed in Section 9-03.14 of the Standard Specifications. The Contract may designate a material source for borrow, but more recent practice is to not include a material source in the Contract documents and have the Contractor provide a material source. For Contractor supplied sources, the Project Engineer should contact the Regional Materials Engineer early to see if the proposed source has a history of material acceptance issues. This detail could save considerable time, expense, and future problems if it is determined that a pit is unsatisfactory before extensive work is performed in opening the pit and then discovering that the material is not acceptable. Standard Specifications Section 9-03.14 provides for the use of borrow. There are four types of borrow; gravel, select, common, and borrow for use specifically in structural and earth walls. Gravel borrow is intended for use where embankments need strength and compaction to perform well. With a lower fines content than other borrows, gravel borrow is also considered to be more workable in wet weather, but in dry summer months, it may require more watering to maintain moisture for optimum compaction. In recent years, natural deposits meeting gravel borrow requirements are becoming fewer. Gravel borrow is often a processed material requiring screening or crushing to meet gradation requirements. The gradation for select borrow is more open than that of gravel borrow. Accordingly, there tends to be more naturally occurring materials available. Select borrow has more fines than gravel borrow and is often considered to be a slightly weaker material and more difficult to work and compact in wet weather. However, select borrow is still a preferred material for embankment construction.
Page 2-10
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Earthwork
Chapter 2
Of the three borrows used for embankment construction, common borrow, has the fewest restrictions for material acceptance, meaning most materials in Washington State meet the material requirements for common borrow. However, plasticity and fines content are major concerns when using common borrow. Common borrow embankments with plasticity have historically resulted in higher maintenance costs, instability, and poor performance. Accordingly, plastic materials should be used with caution. The Specification allows for the use of more plastic (clayey) common borrow when approved by the Project Engineer. The use of more plastic (clayey) material may require approval of the Regional Materials Engineer or the State Materials Lab. The 3 percent maximum organic material requirement for common borrow may be determined visually, or, as necessary, by one of the following test methods: AASHTO T 194 (Determination of Organic Matter in Soils by Wet Combustion) or AASHTO T 267 (Determination of Organic Content by Loss on Ignition). The correct test method is determined based on the type of organic material present in the soil sample. The Regional Materials Engineer should be consulted as to the appropriate test method. The sample may be field determined to be nonplastic if the fraction of the material which passes the U.S. No. 40 sieve cannot be rolled into a thread at any moisture content using that portion of AASHTO Test Method T 90 (Determining the Plastic Limit and Plasticity Index of Soils) which describes rolling the thread. Gravel borrow for structural earth walls, is essentially the same as gravel borrow with a few notable exceptions. The coarse materials are limited in size to minimize installation damage to geosynthetic materials during placement and compaction, and the material has addition requirements to prevent corrosion and degradation of wall reinforcing. The requirements of Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(13) must be observed in the operation and cleanup of borrow pits. With the requirement for reclamation of all pits, a plan must be developed to meet the requirements of the Specifications and Special Provisions and approved before the start of pit operations. See Standard Specifications Section 3-03 for additional requirements. SS 2-03.3(14)
Embankment Construction
It is expected that the Contractor will construct roadway embankments in accordance with the Plans and Specifications using construction methods and equipment considered suitable for the type of work involved. All operations must be directed toward constructing a uniform, well-compacted embankment true to grade and cross-section. It is sometimes necessary to construct an embankment across wet and soft grounds which will not support the weight of heavy construction equipment. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to select a method of construction and type of equipment which will least disturb the soft foundation. The Project Engineer may have to use judgement and experience to decide if the Contractor’s methods will impair or make an embankment unstable. If the natural ground or base is considered unstable by the Project Engineer, it will not be possible to construct a uniform well compacted embankment and the unstable base materials will need to be removed or stabilized in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14)E.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 2-11
Chapter 2
Earthwork
It is permissible to start the embankment by dumping and spreading the first layer to a thickness capable of supporting construction equipment across the soft ground, however, this initial lift should be held to the minimum thickness required for equipment selected in conformance with the above. The remainder of the embankment shall be constructed in layers and compacted as specified. Compaction will be required on initial embankment lifts wherever conditions will permit placement and compaction as specified. Where embankments are built on hillsides or existing embankment slopes, the existing surface soil may form a plane of weakness, unless the slope is terraced or stepped by plowing deeply to key the new embankment to the slope. Hillside Terraces are a standard requirement for embankment construction as specified in Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14). Settlement indicating devices are occasionally called for on the Contract Plans and Special Provisions when it becomes necessary to determine the extent and rate of embankment settlement. Settlement data is necessary for establishing construction schedules for adjoining or adjacent structures where the downward movement of the embankment and its foundation will influence the stability of the structure. There are several types of settlement indicating devices in current use. The principals of each type and the instructions for installation and monitoring must be understood by all involved project personnel. The Regional Materials Engineer or the Geotechnical Office should be consulted in these cases. SS 2-03.3(14)A Rock Embankment Construction As established compaction tests cannot be applied to coarse granular material with any degree of accuracy, embankment construction has been divided into two classes: rock embankments and earth embankments, as defined in Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14). It should be noted that this designation is made for the fundamental purpose of determining the method of embankment construction and compaction control to be used, and that it depends only upon the gradation of the excavation material. It is not necessary that an embankment be built entirely of rock material to be designated as rock embankment. Rock embankment is defined as “all, or any part, of an embankment in which the material contains 25 percent or more by volume of gravel or stone 4 in or greater in diameter.” The Inspector must make visual inspection of the embankment material to ascertain whether it contains 25 percent or more of material 4 inches or greater in diameter. For rock embankment, in lieu of controlling compaction by performing tests, a given amount of compactive effort is specified in Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14)A. Where the stability of a rock embankment is in question, moisture and density control as specified in Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14)B and C shall pertain. It is considered that uniform compaction to the full width of the embankment normally will not be achieved by routing hauling equipment over the roadway. Rolling equipment shall be required as specified whenever it is possible to operate such equipment on the material being placed. The decision to require or delete the use of rollers as specified shall be based on feasibility of operation rather than on an arbitrary estimate of benefits achieved, as this factor is very difficult to evaluate without conducting extensive and expensive tests.

Earth Embankment Construction
Procedures for constructing earth embankments are described in Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14)B. Compaction in accordance with one of three methods designated as Method A, Method B, or Method C as specified in Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14)C shall be utilized. Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, Method B will apply. The basic requirements of all three methods are the same in that each requires lift construction, uniform compaction throughout the embankment width and depth, control of moisture content to not more than 3 percent above optimum, and the addition of moisture should it be necessary for proper compaction. The difference between the three methods lies in the thickness of lifts specified, the degree and control of compaction required, and the degree of control of moisture below optimum. The use of suitable compaction units is required for Method B and Method C, although routing of hauling units may be used to obtain partial compaction. Method A normally will not be specified for state highway work, but may be applied on county or city projects or on certain secondary state highway projects. Embankment lifts up to 2 feet in thickness may be placed, and compaction is achieved by routing the hauling equipment over the entire width of the embankment. Inspection should determine that the routing schedule is such that all parts of the fill receive the same amount of compaction, including the outer edges of the fill. Drying of soil or addition of moisture may be required, if necessary. Method B will be used on all state highway projects except where other methods are specified. This method requires that the embankment be constructed in lifts not exceeding 8 inches in loose thickness except that lifts in the upper 2 feet shall not exceed 4 inches in loose thickness. 90 percent of maximum density is required throughout the embankment except that 95 percent of maximum density is required in the upper 2 feet. Control density tests must be performed to verify compliance with Specifications. The Contractor shall be required to dry soil or add moisture as necessary to ensure proper, uniform compaction. The selection of compaction equipment or methods is the responsibility of the Contractor; however, the use of any method or equipment that does not achieve the required density within a reasonable time may be ordered discontinued. The entire embankment, including the side slopes, shall be compacted to specification requirements. Method C will be required when it is considered essential to the structural quality of the embankment that the entire fill be compacted to a high density. This method differs from Method B in that the entire embankment must be compacted to 95 percent of maximum density. Also, a limit is specified for minimum moisture content in addition to the maximum to ensure moisture content uniformity. In all other respects, the two methods are the same, and each requires a high standard of compaction control.

Compacting Earth Embankments
Proper compaction of roadway embankments and embankment slopes is of vital importance to the structural quality of the final roadway and strict adherence to specification requirements is essential. The type and thickness of the final surfacing and pavement is designed on the basis of the strength of the underlying materials, and the strength of these materials is affected greatly by their state of compaction, therefore, it is essential that the specified density be obtained. To enable the Project Engineer to determine that embankments are being compacted properly, control test procedures and density standards have been developed for use during construction. It is expected that these aids will be utilized to the fullest extent necessary to determine that all embankments are constructed in accordance with specifications. Complete instructions for making maximum density and optimum moisture content determinations for soils and for making field density control tests are furnished with the appropriate testing equipment and in Chapter 9. The Project Engineer and the Inspector should understand thoroughly the elements of the compaction process and compaction control procedures. The following brief resume should be supplemented by study of appropriate publications on this subject and by consultation with the Regional Materials Engineer. In general, it can be stated that each soil has a maximum density to which it can be compacted with a given compactive effort. For this compactive effort, the maximum density will be obtained only at one moisture content. Increases or decreases in moisture cause a reduction in the density obtainable with the given compactive effort. When the moisture content is lower than optimum, additional compactive effort is necessary to achieve the specified density. When the moisture content is above optimum, low densities will result, and a soft, spongy condition may develop during the compaction process. In most cases, the moisture content of the material should be less than optimum when the material is covered, due to the fact that frequently materials are over-compacted by the heavy construction equipment now in use. Once the material is covered with another layer of material, it is very unlikely that the moisture content of the material will decrease. Certain soils, primarily fine grained soils having high silt content, may become unstable by virtue of being over compacted even at moisture contents at or slightly above optimum but within specification limits. When working with these soils, the moisture content should be reduced below the maximum allowed if at all feasible, this may require aeration. Specifications provide for payment for this work. Also the Contractor should be requested to compact only to the minimum requirements; however, this is difficult to control. With modern heavy hauling and compacting units, over-compaction occurs with increasing frequency. When high fills are involved, not only may the subgrade be unstable, but the overall stability of the fill may be reduced to the point that slump failure will occur. When such soil and moisture conditions are encountered, the Project Engineer should recognize the potential danger and notify the Regional Operations/Construction Engineer. Should corrective measures be necessary, one or more of several procedures may be used. When low fills are involved, increasing the surfacing depth, mixing with granular materials available, or allowing the fill to set undisturbed for a period of time may prove satisfactory. When a high fill is to be built, sandwiching layers of free-draining material, incorporating a system of trench drains, or mixing with other materials may prove satisfactory. In all cases, the correction must be aimed at neutralizing the excess pore-

water pressure or changing the character of the material. Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14)J provides for the use of gravel borrow material for this type of work. The gravel borrow may be mixed with the embankment material by placing a layer of the embankment material on a layer of gravel borrow and mixing the two materials using aeration equipment. The materials shall be mixed and the moisture content reduced to a satisfactory level. During drying weather, the gravel borrow material will tend to speed the reduction in moisture of the embankment material. After the moisture has been reduced to a satisfactory level, the layer of material must be compacted to the required density before another layer of material is placed. It is quite important that the moisture be reduced to a satisfactory level or the advantage of mixing with the gravel borrow will be lost. An alternate method is to intersperse layers of gravel borrow throughout the embankment to reduce the pumping action of the soil and provide drainage for excess moisture. This method is preferred over mixing. The embankment material must be uniformly graded and sloped to the outside of the embankment so any excess moisture will have a chance to drain off. Care must be taken in placing the layer of gravel borrow so ruts or pockets are not formed in the embankment material which will trap moisture and prevent its draining off. The depth of the layers of embankment materials that will maintain the desired embankment stability shall be determined by field tests. Drainage problems occur quite frequently when an existing embankment is widened, if there is moisture present in the existing embankment, through capillary action, subterranean drainage, or otherwise. If the new embankment traps the water in the existing embankment, usually the moisture saturates the embankment to a point that slump failure occurs. Whenever an existing embankment that could receive moisture is to be widened, drainage must be provided through the new embankment area. If the new embankment material is not free draining, one method of providing drainage is to layer the new embankment with gravel borrow layers at approximately 10 foot intervals vertically. Where seepage is noted, the Regional Materials Engineer should be consulted so that an adequate drainage system is provided. When it is anticipated that certain cuts or borrow areas will contain considerable amounts of material with moisture content in excess of the optimum for proper compaction of embankments, aeration equipment may be included in the proposal for the project. The inclusion of aeration equipment in the proposal will not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility of employing sound and workmanlike procedures in the prosecution of the work which are effective in constructing embankments with wet materials. Ditches to remove surface or subterranean drainage should be constructed whenever they can be effective and preferably in advance of excavation, thus permitting time for drainage. The function of aeration equipment is to provide thin, loose layers of material from which moisture can evaporate. Most soils tend to form a crust which retards the evaporation of moisture. Unless this material is worked to break up this crust, evaporation is quite slow. During good drying weather, a sheepsfoot roller is quite effective in certain soils in breaking up the surface of the soil and, in thin lifts of material, leaves large surface areas of soil exposed to the air. However, no separate payment for a sheepsfoot roller will be made and the costs of same are incidental to embankment compaction.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 2-15
Chapter 2
Earthwork
If the material has a considerable amount of moisture above the optimum for proper compaction of embankments, it may be necessary to operate aeration equipment in the excavation areas as well as the embankment areas to increase the amount of material exposed for evaporation. The amount of moisture that will evaporate from the material is dependent on the prevailing weather conditions, the surface area of material exposed and the length of time the material is exposed to the air. It must be kept in mind that thin, loose layers of material will also soak up large amounts of moisture if it rains, so the surface of the materials must be sealed and sloped to drain off moisture whenever rain is imminent. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to seal the material against rain and in many cases this will have to be done at the end of work each day to protect against sudden, unexpected storms. SS 2-03.3(14)D
Compaction and Moisture Control Tests
The maximum density and optimum moisture content for a soil are determined by testing the soil in accordance with once of three test methods: AASHTO T 99 Method A AASHTO T 180 Method D WSDOT Test Method No. 606 Determination of which test to perform is based upon the gradation of the material. Section 2-03.3(14)D discusses the gradations and which tests are applicable. Materials with 30 percent or more by weight retained on the No. 4 sieve and less than 30 percent retained on the ¾ inch sieve can use either WSDOT T 606 or AASHTO T 180. For those materials, the Agency decides which test to use. The Project Engineer should consult with the Regional Materials Engineer when deciding which test to use. Each different soil may, and probably will, have a different maximum density and optimum moisture content, and it is necessary that tests be performed in the field for each different soil encountered. As each of the materials is being tested, a representative sample should be taken and placed in a sealed sample jar to serve as a future reference for identifying the materials on the grade during construction. It is the responsibility of the Project Engineer to arrange for all field testing necessary to supplement data furnished with the soils report. Noncohesive sandy and gravelly soils and surfacing aggregate cannot be tested by the above-noted test method. Samples of these materials must be sent to the Regional Materials Engineer with a request for maximum density determination. This test method is described in Chapter 9. A gradation vs. density curve will be established for use by the Inspector during construction. To determine if the embankments are being compacted properly, in-place density tests must be taken at frequent intervals. Results of these tests are compared to the density standard established for the soil (noncohesive granular material) being compacted, and are used as the basis for accepting or rejecting the work of the Contractor. Each lift of embankment should be tested before subsequent lifts are placed. When loose free draining sandy material is used for embankment construction, the Inspector should dig down 1 foot and run a density test on the undisturbed material. In selecting an area to be tested, the Inspector should choose sites where the least compactive effort has been Page 2-16

Chapter 2
applied. A continuous record of the Contractor’s method of compaction should be kept and compared to test results to assist in selecting a routine procedure which will yield required results. Compaction is required to the neat lines of the embankment, which include the shoulders and slopes. Proper compaction of embankment slopes will tend to minimize slope surface erosion which occurs often on newly constructed embankments. Care must be taken to see that uniform density is obtained throughout each fill rather than to have some areas compacted greatly in excess of the density requirements, while other areas are below requirements. In order to achieve uniform density, it is essential that the water content be uniform since the density obtainable with a given soil is a function of the water content for any one compactive effort. In most cases, the required density can be obtained with the least effort if the water content is very close to, but less than, the optimum established by standard moisture-density test. Noncohesive granular soils usually compact most easily when wetted to near saturation. The Contractor should be encouraged to establish a definite routine for compaction that will result in uniform compactive effort. When a considerable amount of grading equipment is concentrated in a small embankment area, it is difficult to maintain uniform compaction methods on each lift and the Inspector must be especially alert. When the size of the embankment area can be increased, uniform compaction methods can be more readily established, thinner lifts of material can be placed and moisture content can be better controlled. The Speedy Moisture Tester is a good tool for the Inspector to use to check the moisture content of the material while it is being worked in the embankment. This will quickly tell the Inspector whether moisture must be removed or added before the layer is covered with additional material. The Inspector must be cautioned that due to the small amount of material used in the Speedy Moisture Tester, it is essential that the sample used is actually representative of the material being worked. If the moisture content of the material being worked is quite uniform, this does not present too much of a problem. When embankment construction is first started, the Inspector should give particular attention to the compaction methods and take more than the minimum number of density tests to determine the most advantageous compaction pattern that will give the desired compaction results. After a satisfactory compaction pattern has been established for the type of material being placed, the density testing may be reduced to the minimum rate specified. Where it is necessary to add water for compacting, this may be done either in the cut (or borrow pit) or on the fill. Water must not be added to material obtained from a borrow pit before weighing when payment is by weight. Addition of water in the cut allows the scrapers and hauling equipment to mix the water into the soil so that rolling can proceed immediately after spreading. Sprinkling should be done on a rough loose surface rather than on one which is smooth and tight because the water will not be so apt to run off or form ponds. Daily compaction reports must be submitted on DOT Form 351-015. If there are questions concerning operational procedure on moisture-density tests, in-place tests, and reporting of results on the above form, consult the Regional Materials Engineer for advice and assistance.

Earthwork
Special attention must be given to compaction around structures and bridge ends, where rollers cannot operate. Mechanical tampers or other approved compactors are to be used in these areas. Sufficient density tests shall be taken to ensure that compaction is continued on each lift until the specified density is attained. Failure to do so can result in settlement near the structure. SS 2-03.3(14)E
Unsuitable Foundation Excavation
The natural ground upon which an embankment is to be constructed may be such that it will impair the stability of the completed roadway. Such conditions must be corrected prior to starting embankment construction. Unsuitable ground such as peat, soft organic clay, and silts must be removed or otherwise stabilized to prevent unequal or excessive roadway settlement or embankment failure. Areas requiring special foundation treatment will be shown in the plans and/or specified in the Special Provisions with the exception that possible detrimental soil at the transition between cut and fill and under shallow embankments may not be indicated. Particular attention should be given to these areas and in the event that highly compressible or unstable top soil or other undesirable material exists, it should be removed in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14). Where specified in the Contract Plans and/or the Special Provisions, unsuitable foundation materials shall be removed or otherwise stabilized as required. When removal is required, inspection should determine that the removal is complete to solid foundation. Where backfilling must be done under water, granular material should be used, and special care must be taken to avoid segregation of the material, and the trapping of unsuitable material in the backfilled area. SS 2-03.3(14)F Displacement of Unsuitable Foundation Materials Removal of unsuitable foundation material by displacement with or without the use of explosives is not a preferred method of dealing with these materials. Often this method has unintended consequences and environmental impacts and should only be attempted where specified and permitted, or where recommended by the State Geotechnical Engineer and approved by the State Construction Office. In the event that other unsuitable foundation material exists and is not indicated in the Contract and is beyond the limits as described in Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14), the State Construction Office should be contacted through the Region for assistance in reaching a resolution. SS 2-03.3(14)G Backfilling Where water exists in the excavation areas, it should be drained, if possible, by ditching so that excavation and backfilling can be accomplished in the dry. SS 2-03.3(14)H
Prefabricated Vertical Drains
Embankment settlement can be accelerated by the use of overloads, vertical sand drains, or by vacuum pumping to lower the water table. These treatments should not be attempted unless specified by the contract provisions or recommended by the State Geotechnical Engineer and approved by the State Construction Office. Page 2-18

Haul
SS 2-04.4
Measurement The measurement of haul is expressed as a unit of one hundred cubic yards hauled 100 feet. Haul shall be calculated and included in the section from which the material is hauled. Haul on roadway quantities, including borrow obtained by the widening of cuts and including waste deposited along roadway embankment slopes, will be computed on the basis of transporting material along the centerline or base line of the highway.
Haul on Borrow or Waste Quantities of material hauled from a borrow site to the roadway or from the roadway to a waste site are computed normal to the long axis of the borrow or waste site. When computing the amount of haul, determination of the direction of movement of the mass and the distance it is transported requires good, practical judgment by the Project Engineer. The size and shape of a borrow pit and egress from the pit to the highway improvement must be considered in the proper determination of the amount of haul. The same conditions are true in the case of waste sites. Instructions herein for computing haul from borrow pits shall be applicable to computing haul to waste sites. The long axis of the borrow pit should be used for the base line of the cross-section which, theoretically, would pass through the centers of gravity of the sections; however, the base line may approximate the centers of gravity of the sections. Borrow pits which are provided by widening of the roadway cuts would be an exception to this since the Standard Specifications define them as “Roadway Excavation” and not “Borrow.” The measurement of the distance from the pit to the center line of the roadway should originate at the center of mass as measured in the pit and be computed via the most direct and feasible route to the nearest practical point on the center line of the roadway. The route of haul will be indicated on the plans, and, where possible, will be via existing roads. If no road exists, provision will be made in the plans for constructing a haul road and for rights therefor. If the Contractor chooses to haul over a route shorter than the computed or designated route, payment for haul will be based on the length of the actual haul route. If the Contractor chooses to haul over a longer route than the computed or designated route, payment for haul will be based on the length of the computed or designated route.

Subgrade Preparation
SS 2-06.3
Construction Requirements The subgrade shall be constructed in accordance with the lines, grades, and typical sections shown on the plans or as established by the Project Engineer and the Standard Specifications. The entire subgrade should be uniformly compacted to the density specified. The subgrade shall meet the tolerance in Section 1-06. On some separate grading projects where the surfacing Contractor will be required to or elects to trim the subgrade with an automatically controlled mechanical trimmer, the tolerances for the subgrade must be changed to provide material for the subgrade trimmer to trim, but the trimmed subgrade must meet the tolerance stated above. After the subgrade is prepared, the Contractor shall maintain it in the required condition until the next course of work is performed.

Watering
SS 2-7.3
Construction Requirements Water shall be applied as ordered by the Project Engineer, in accordance with the Specifications, uniformly to the material so that all of the material will have approximately the same moisture content. It is more economical and effective to apply water at night or in the early morning hours when loss from evaporation is lower. In many instances, this is the only time that it is possible to increase the moisture content to that required. The Inspector should be alert to see that the subgrade is not damaged from too much water being applied or that more water is being applied than is necessary. Usually light applications applied more frequently are more advantageous than heavy applications. The water should not be applied on surfacing materials with such force that it will wash the fine particles off the coarser ones causing segregation. If water is a pay item, the Project Engineer shall verify the size of the water truck by measuring or weighing and if gauges are used and should also verify the accuracy of the gauge. A record of measurements or weights, and calculations must be made for future references. A Water Delivery Record (DOT Form 422-024) showing the time of each load and where it was placed should be maintained on the project. The Inspector will issue a ticket for the amount of water used.

Structure Excavation
SS 2-09.3
Construction Requirements
SS 2-09.3(1) General Requirements SS 2-09.3(1)A Staking, Cross-Sectioning, and Inspecting Before starting structure excavation, stakes should be set to locate the structure and crosssections should be taken to determine the quantities of material involved. SS 2-09.3(1)B
Depth of Excavation
Excavations shall be carried to the elevation shown on the plans or as established by the Project Engineer. The Project Engineer should take into consideration the fact that when a clamshell bucket is used, it is very difficult to clean the hole to an exact given elevation. For direct-bearing footings, the corners and sides of the excavation should be cleaned out as well as possible and there should not be an excess of loose material left in the bottom. If the character of the material found at plan elevation is questionable, consult the Regional Materials Engineer. When the excavation for the footing has been completed, elevations to establish the footing elevation shall be taken in the corners of any footing and recorded in the project records. SS 2-09.3(1)C
Removal of Unstable Base Material
During the progress of excavation, the character of material being removed and exposed should be examined to determine if it is suitable for use as backfill and to ensure that acceptable foundation conditions exist. This should be done especially on streams subject to high velocity flood water and which carry drift. Open pit excavation or “glory holes” are not allowed without permission. This Specification is of special importance in application to the construction of foundations in or adjacent to running streams, where the approval of the State Construction Office must be secured. SS 2-09.3(1)D
Disposal of Excavated Material
Material obtained from structure excavation may be used for backfilling over and around the structures, for building embankments, or it may be wasted. When this material is stockpiled for backfilling, the Contractor is required to protect it from contamination and the elements. If not properly protected, the Contractor must replace the lost material with acceptable backfill material at no expense to WSDOT.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 2-21
Chapter 2
Earthwork
SS 2-09.3(1)E Backfilling The backfilling of openings made for structures must be made with acceptable material from the excavation, other acceptable backfill materials indicated in the plans and Special Provisions, or as specified in Standard Specifications Section 2-09.3(1)E. When specified in the Contract or approved by the Project Engineer, acceptable material may include Controlled Density Fill (CDF) – also known as Controlled Low-Strength Material (CLSM). Before the CDF is placed, the Contractor is required to develop a mix design in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-09.3(1)E and to submit the CDF mix design in writing to the Project Engineer on DOT Form 350-040. Standard Specifications Section 2-09.3(1)E requires the Contractor to utilize ACI 229 and testing methods ASTM D 4832, ASTM D 6023, and WSDOT FOP for AASHTO T 119 in developing the CDF mix design. The ASTM and AASHTO tests required in Standard Specifications Section 2-09.3(1)E are for use by the Contractor in developing the CDF mix design, and with the exception of providing the 28-day compressive strength test results on DOT Form 350-040, the test results are not required as part of the CDF mix design submittal. The Project Engineer must review the mix design before placement of the CDF will be allowed. The Inspector must verify and document that each truckload of CDF is accompanied by the producer supplied Certificate of Compliance, meeting the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(5)B. The Inspector must also verify that the components, as listed on the Certificate of Compliance, conform to the mix design per Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(5)C. Acceptance of the CDF will be based upon an acceptable Certificate of Compliance. In accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-05.2, the Inspector may reject any load of CDF that does not conform to the mix design. When water is encountered in the excavation area, it must be removed before backfilling. Cost for accomplishing this is considered incidental and is done at the Contractor’s expense unless otherwise provided for in the Contract. SS 2-09.3(2) Classification of Structure Excavation Structure excavation is classified into two classes. The excavation necessary for the construction of bridge footings, pile caps, seals, wing walls, and retaining walls is classified as Structure Excavation Class A. All other Structure Excavation is classified as Structure Excavation Class B. See Standard Specifications Sections 2-09.3(2), 2-09.3(3), and 2-09.3(4).

Shoring and Cofferdams
All excavations 4 feet or more in depth shall be shored, protected by cofferdams, or shall meet the open-pit requirements of Standard Specifications Section 2-09.3(3)B. The Contractor must submit their shoring plans in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-09.3(3)D. The shoring design shall be in compliance with the Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03, and be designed for site specific conditions, which must be shown and described in the working drawings. These drawings must be approved before construction begins. WSDOT’s approval, however, does not relieve the Contractor of responsibility of satisfactory results. For excavations using open pits - extra excavation, the Contractor shall submit Working Drawings and in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-09.3(3)B. WAC 296-155 part N addresses temporary excavations. If the Contractor follows the WAC, Type 2 Working Drawings are required. Within the WAC requirements, it may be necessary for the Contractor to do engineering. Should this occur, the Contractor will need to submit Type 2E Working Drawings. This can occur if the soil types are not consistent with those of the WAC, if there are surcharge loads or sensitive structures near the slope, or if the slope height exceeds the WAC max height of 20 feet. The excavation stability design shall be conducted in accordance with the Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03 and must be designed for site specific conditions, which must be shown and described in the Working Drawings. These drawings must be approved before construction begins. The Contractor shall submit detailed plans of cofferdams for approval per Standard Specifications Section 2-09.3(3)D when their use is required. This requirement shall be strictly followed. When a cofferdam is required on a railroad right of way, excavation must not be commenced before the Plans have been approved by the railroad company. The Contractor should be notified of this requirement well in advance of starting such Work, as it usually takes several weeks to get plans approved by the railroads. See Section 6-1.5 for the number of copies to submit and distribution of approved plans. Cofferdams, in general, must be removed to the bed of the stream, or to below the low water mark. In some cases, it may be advisable to leave the cofferdam in place. The Cofferdam is, however, the property of the Contractor. Sheet piling, designed in accordance with the USS Steel Sheet Piling Design Manual, may be used for shoring walls that do not support other structures and that are 15 feet in height or less. When sheet piles are used for cofferdams, the Project Engineer shall see that the sheets are held tightly together during driving and placing, so that no cracks or holes are left, through which water can flow. If timbers are used in the cofferdam, the use of wood preservatives needs to be monitored to be sure that all environmental constraints are met. Cofferdams should be built slightly larger than the neat size shown on the plans. This is to allow for inaccuracy of driving sheet piles.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 2-23
Chapter 2
Earthwork
Where bearing piles are to be driven, the excavation should be carried deeper to allow for upheaval of soil due to pile driving. This extra depth will depend on the character of the material. Usually in sand and gravel from 6 inches to 1 foot and in a river or tide mud from 1 foot to 1.5 feet is sufficient. Such over-excavation is the Contractor’s responsibility. Over-excavation shall be backfilled with gravel backfill to the footing elevation if the upheaval is less than anticipated. In soft mud, when the driving of piles tends to liquefy the foundation material, it is sometimes necessary to excavate below plan grade and backfill with gravel before concrete is placed. When the Engineer considers this to be necessary and approval of the State Construction Office has been secured, the additional excavation shall be paid for at the unit Contract price for structure excavation and the gravel backfill shall be paid for on force account basis or at an agreed price. The material on which spread footings are to be constructed must be adequate to support the design soil pressure per square foot shown in the plans. The Regional Materials Engineer should be consulted to review the foundation conditions if the bottom of the footing is materially different than what is identified in the Contract plans. If a change of design or the lowering of a footing appears to be advisable, the State Construction Office must be advised. Occasionally, foundations adjacent to large piers are founded at a higher elevation than the large pier foundation. In these cases, the Contractor must carry on operations so that the foundation at the higher elevation will not be disturbed when excavation is made for the lower pier. Backfilling holes made for piers and column bents up to the surface of the surrounding ground may be done at any time after the forms are removed, providing the backfilling is brought up evenly on all sides of the pier or column. Backfilling around piers and bents in streams shall be done carefully with material suitable to resist scour, and be brought up to a height not less than the original bed of the stream. Embankment backfill against abutments, piers, walls, culverts, or other structures shall not be placed until the concrete has attained 90 percent of its design strength and has cured for at least 14 days or as otherwise specified in the Contract. It is very important that drainage be provided in back of retaining walls, tunnels, and structures having wing walls or abutments to eliminate excessive soil pressure. Weep holes shall be placed as shown on the plans and as low as possible. Gravel backfill for walls or other suitable materials shall be placed directly behind the structure. If drainage is a major problem, it may be necessary to also construct perforated drain pipe or French drains behind the structure. The construction of embankments and backfill around bridge ends shall be in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14)I. The fill around bridge ends shall be brought up equally on all sides of the bracing, columns, and bulkheads to avoid distortion and displacement of these members. In addition, Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14)I requires that the superstructure be in place before the backfill behind an abutment can be placed. It further states that this requirement can be waived by the Engineer provided the Contractor submits abutment stability calculations to back up their proposal. When designing the bridge, the designers Page 2-24
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Earthwork
Chapter 2
check the abutment stability using the final condition which includes the dead load of the superstructure. This superstructure dead load increases the resistance to sliding and reduces the overturning moment of the abutment. Since placement of the backfill prior to placement of the superstructure is a condition not analyzed by our designers, we require that stability calculations be submitted for each bridge by the Contractor to reflect this unchecked condition. These stability calculations need to include a surcharge load of at least 2 feet to account for the live loading due to the backfill equipment weight. Around structures and bridge ends, where rollers cannot operate, compaction shall be obtained by the use of mechanical tampers. Density tests shall be taken frequently enough to ensure that compaction is continued on each lift until the specified density is attained.

Construction Requirements Areas where open ditches are to be constructed shall be cleared and grubbed the same as areas for roadway excavation. The excavated material may be used for the construction of dikes, berms, or otherwise disposed of as shown on the plans or as directed by the Project Engineer. The materials should not be placed in embankments unless it is suitable for embankment construction.

Trimming and Cleanup
SS 2-11.3
Construction Requirements This work shall consist of dressing and trimming the entire roadway or roadways improved under the Contract. The shoulders, ditches, and back slopes shall be trimmed to the specified cross-section to produce a neat and pleasing appearance. All channels, ditches, and gutters shall be opened up and cleaned to ensure designed drainage. This includes existing drainage within the project limits specified in the Contract.

Construction Geotextile
SS 2-12.3
Construction Requirements Construction geotextile fabric needs to be fully covered at all times until placement. It should be stored in a protected area off the ground and away from items that can cause damage such as sunlight, heat, precipitation, chemicals flames including welding sparks and any other environmental condition that may damage the physical properties of the fabric. The area to be covered should be graded to a smooth, uniform condition free from ruts, holes, and protruding objects such as rocks and sticks. The fabric needs to be placed immediately ahead of the covering operation with as few wrinkles as possible. The material should not be dragged through the mud nor over sharp or protruding objects which could damage the material.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 2-25
Chapter 2
Earthwork
The cover material is to be placed in front of the placing equipment. This equipment should be sized to minimize the rutting that may occur during the placement. Turning of vehicles on the first lift of material may cause damage to the fabric and should not be allowed. Sewing of seams is described in Standard Specifications Section 2-12.3. Fabric damaged during placement needs to be repaired as soon as possible. The backfill material needs to be removed and the fabric repaired either as recommended by the manufacture or as listed in the contract. Visible evidence of damaged material may include subgrade pumping, intrusion of subgrade, or roadbed distortion. Placement Standard Specifications Section 2-12.3 lists the required placing and lapping requirements for each type of use of construction geotextile. Following is a short explanation for the placement types.
• Underground Drainage – The fabric is used as a wrap around the drain rock and the pipe to not only separate the backfill material from the drainage material but also to act as a filter of fine sands and silts. This prevents the fines from flowing into the drain rock and clogging the drainage system.
• Separation – The fabric is placed directly on a subgrade that contains a large amount of fine sand and silts. Normally the subgrade can be constructed during fair weather, however, almost any amount of moisture can make working on the grade impossible.
• Soil Stabilization – Soft subgrade that cannot support the weight of equipment constructing the roadbed, is usually removed, a fabric placed and covered with backfill. This allows a stable enough surface to continue construction. Here the fabric not only separates the two materials but also adds strength to the roadbed.
• Permanent Erosion Control and Ditch Lining – The fabric is utilized to reduce or minimize the ground surface’s exposure to erosion. The material is placed directly on the surface to be protected and then backfill is placed over the fabric. Rock surfacing should not be placed in a lined ditch under the fabric as this would allow the water to erode the ground under the fabric thus eliminating its effectiveness.
• Temporary Silt Fences – As the title states, the fabric is used to trap silt and other fine particles from continuing from the project site to open water.

Aggregate Production and Acceptance
Production From Quarry and Pit Sites
GEN 3-01.1
General Instructions In the production of crushed and screened materials, continuous and effective inspection throughout all phases of the work is essential in order for the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) to obtain the best possible product from the available material. The Project Engineer is responsible for the enforcement of all specifications governing pit operations, crushing and screening procedures, and handling and placing of the product, as well as the various specifications governing gradation and quality. The Project Engineer and Region Materials Office provides the Inspectors with the proper tools to test and inspect the production of materials. They also ensure that facilities are available at the plant site to enable the Inspector to carry out the work in the proper manner and obtain test results which are accurate and complete. The Project Engineer makes certain that the Inspector understands the nature of the work to be performed and is acquainted thoroughly with the applicable specifications and that the Inspector is proficient in the various testing techniques. The Inspector needs to be familiar with the methods and procedures involved in crushing and screening operations so that the Inspector can appraise the causes of troubles when they occur. The Project Engineer or Inspector must never attempt to tell the Contractor how to conduct their operations (except where required by the specifications), but a good working relationship with the Contractor, based on a mutual respect for each other’s knowledge and ability, will do much to ensure an efficient operation and a good product.
GEN 3-01.2
Outline of Inspector's Duties Some of the most important duties of inspection are listed below:
• Check special provisions for special requirements in pit operation (area to be excavated, depth of excavation, etc.).
• See that overburden is stripped from pit in proper manner.
• Watch for radical changes in the character of material in pit.
• When required, see that washing and/or scalping are conducted in a proper manner.
• See that the plant, belts and loaders operate at a constant rhythm.
• Watch for evidence of segregation of the material. Advise the Contractor to take steps to correct any segregation.
• All sampling and testing of the product(s) is to be performed by a Qualified Tester.
• Keep complete records of field tests.
• See that the prime Contractor is informed of test results.
• When required, submit samples for mix design. Be sure to allow ample time for testing.
• Submit samples for determination of standard density.

Material Sources, General Requirements
SS 3-01.2(2) Preparation of Site The portion of the pit or quarry site to be used is prepared in accordance with the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 3-01. The strippings from the pit are stockpiled or disposed of in accordance with the reclamation plan as covered in Section 3-03. Care is taken in this operation so that usable material is not fouled or lost. In most cases, the manner in which the site is worked will determine how much work will be required to dress it up in accordance with the reclamation plan. SS 3-01.2(4) Production Requirements Prior to sampling and testing the material produced by the Contractor, the Inspector is required to satisfactorily complete the Method Qualified Tester Program in Chapter 9 for the tests to be performed. It is imperative that the Project Engineer keep the Contractor informed of test results at all times. If the material being produced does not meet the requirements of the specifications, the Contractor must be informed immediately that the material is unacceptable so that corrections may be made. The Inspector's Record of Field Tests is used to record the test results completed by the Inspector. The Contractor Foreman’s copy of the test results should be delivered as soon as practical after completion of each test to the foreman in charge of producing the material. When the test results show the material fails to meet specification requirements, the Inspector shall explain in the remarks section on the test form what action was taken to correct the deficiency. This form has the twofold purpose of providing a record of the test results and of keeping the Contractor informed of the quality and gradation of the material being produced. Several field control tests may be required by the specifications for the type of material involved. These tests must be performed by a Qualified Tester and may include:
• Screen analysis for gradation.
• Sand equivalent test for detrimental fines.
• Examination of the material to determine percentage of fractured pieces.
• Moisture determination test.
• Organic matter content test. The Inspector shall conduct these tests as often as necessary following the instructions for sampling and test methods described in Chapter 9. When production is first started, and until the production has resulted in a uniform product well within specification requirements, tests need to be taken more frequently than the minimum specified. Special care must be exercised to ensure that the sample taken for testing is representative of the material being produced. Samples are taken and forwarded to the Region Materials Laboratory or State Materials Laboratory in the amounts and at the intervals specified in Chapter 9. Job site samples shall be obtained, tested, and recorded in accordance with the Standard Specifications, the contract special provisions, and Sections 9-5 and 10-3.

Aggregate Production and Acceptance
Chapter 3
Samples of aggregate for bituminous mixtures are submitted to the State Materials Laboratory for determination of a mix design. These samples must be representative of the average grading of separate materials produced and information concerning the proportions of coarse and fine aggregates produced shall be included in the letter of transmittal. If blending sand may be required, a sample of this material shall be included in the shipment. Ample time for testing of the materials must be allowed. A minimum time of one to two weeks is required by the laboratory to complete the tests and advise the Project Engineer of the recommended mix design. The Standard Specifications require allowance of 25 calendar days for mix design work after receipt of material and data in Tumwater. Pit Operations The Inspector must be alert to detect changes in test results, and look for evidence of changes in the character of the pit, or changes in crushing or screening procedures, as possible causes of variations. The use of production control charts provides an excellent visual means of detecting changes in the material being produced. Use of these charts is recommended for any significant production operation. Some quarries and pits contain pockets or areas of unsuitable material. The Inspector should keep familiar with the condition of the site so if areas of unsuitable material do appear, steps can be taken to bypass these materials. The Inspector should also be aware of the tempo of the plant operations. A steady operation in all phases is desired. In particular, the plant should not run faster after a sample has been taken than it was prior to sampling. Many quarries and pits require scalping to remove a portion of the fine material. When scalping is required, it is necessary for the Inspector to check to be sure the scalping screen does not become coated or plugged and allow the fine material to be incorporated into the finished product. When a scalping screen of a certain size is required in the special provisions, the Inspector shall check to see that it is of sufficient size and capacity that most of the material finer than the specified size is removed. The Inspector must watch for evidence of segregation of the material on conveyor belts, in bunkers, or in discharging material into trucks. If any evidence of segregation is found at any stage of manufacture or handling, corrective devices, such as baffles, mixing chutes, rock ladders, etc., must be required. SS 3-01.2(5) Final Cleanup When the Contractor has completed work in a WSDOT furnished material source, the Project Engineer shall prepare a pit evaluation report on WSDOT Form 350-023. The information contained in these reports is needed to determine the future use of the pit. Also the information is very helpful in preparing plans for future projects in estimating stripping or special requirements that may be necessary to produce satisfactory products.

Aggregate Production and Acceptance
State Furnished Material Sources WSDOT furnished material sources normally are to be used on future projects as well as the present one so it is necessary that the material be removed in such a manner that the future usefulness of the pit is not impaired. Standard Specifications Section 3-01.3(1) requires the Contractor to submit a work plan for approval of the proposed operations in the pit before starting work in the pit so that it can be ascertained that the Contractor will not impair the future usefulness of the site. In addition to the source containing sufficient material for the project, there should also be adequate area for the plant setup. If the project includes treated materials, consideration should also be given to provide sufficient area for the temporary stockpiling of the aggregates for the treated material and the mixing plant. Disposal of strippings and scalpings in the site is of utmost importance if satisfactory reclamation of the site is to be accomplished with the minimum amount of work. This material should be placed where it will not interfere with future development of the site. Surplus material accumulated during the production of specified materials will remain the property of WSDOT and must be stockpiled in the pit area where directed by the Project Engineer in accordance with the specifications for stockpiling material. The Contractor may be eligible for reimbursement of the production costs of the surplus material up to 110 percent of plan quantity or as specified by the Project Engineer. If more than one source is provided in the special provisions, the Contractor may obtain the material from any of the sources. If the Contractor sets up in a site, and it is found that the quantity of raw materials from that site, when the site is exhausted, is less than that specified by WSDOT, then WSDOT may pay for moving the crushing plant in accordance with the provisions of Standard Specifications Section 3-01.3(5). If the new source of material necessitates a longer haul of the materials, WSDOT may also pay for the additional haul as specified.
SS 3-01.4
Contractor Furnished Material Sources If the Contractor is required to furnish a source of materials or elects to use materials from a source different from those provided by WSDOT, the Contractor shall make arrangements for obtaining the materials and testing the source at no expense to WSDOT. The Contractor shall submit Request for Approval of Material, WSDOT Form 350-071, identifying the source. If sampling is required, the contractor is responsible for providing the preliminary samples which are taken at locations designated and witnessed by the Region Materials Engineer or a designated representative. Use of the materials from the Contractor’s source will not be permitted until after the materials have been tested, the source approved, and authority granted for the use of it. Acceptance of the materials will be based on their meeting the requirements of the specifications at the point of acceptance in Section 9-3.4. If the Contractor has elected to use a source listed in the Aggregate Source Approval (ASA) Data Base, and the material has been approved for the intended use, the Project Engineer can approve the Contractor’s request. If the Contractor has selected a source not in the ASA Data Base, WSDOT may sample and test the material for a specified use on a project. All cost associated with this sampling and testing will be the responsibility

General Requirements
SS 3-02.2(6) Construction of Stockpiles Stockpiles shall be constructed in conformity with the provisions of the Standard Specifications. The area upon which the material is to be stockpiled is prepared carefully by removing all vegetation and constructing a uniform, flat ground surface. Preparation of a good base for the stockpile will minimize wastage of material, and will prevent contamination of the material when removing it from the stockpile. The Project Engineer indicates to the Contractor the location of each proposed stockpile by placing marked stakes at each corner of the area to be used. If the material is to be stockpiled for later use by the Contractor, as in the case of aggregates for bituminous mixtures, the Project Engineer must consult with the Contractor and locate these stockpiles to conform with Contractor’s plans for erecting the mixing plant, etc. Stockpiles shall be located to ensure easy access by trucks and loading equipment and care must be exercised to see that a sufficient distance is maintained between the various stockpiles so there will be no possibility of mixing the various classes of materials. For all stockpiles, the maximum height is 24 feet. For stockpiles in excess of 200 cubic yards, the material shall be placed in the stockpile in layers not to exceed 4 feet in height, and in such a manner that segregation of the fine and coarse portions of the material does not occur. The Inspector must be watchful to see that segregation is held to a minimum. End dumping, dozing material over the side of the stockpile, or allowing material to roll down the slope is not permitted as severe segregation will occur as a result of such procedures. After completion of each lift of material during the construction of a stockpile, it is common practice to use a pneumatic dozer to level the top of the lift before placing the next layer. This practice may be permitted but the Inspector must see that the operation of the dozer is limited to the minimum amount of work required to level the top of the layer, as excessive operation of the dozer on the pile can result in serious degradation of the material. If it is known that the stone is rather soft and subject to severe degradation under abrasion, the use of dozers on the pile must be prohibited and the pile leveled by hand or other methods which will eliminate the possibility of excessive degradation of product. It is important to protect stockpiles from becoming contaminated with mud or other material tracked onto the stockpile. If the surrounding ground is wet and soft, or for any reason contaminates are carried onto the stockpile, the Contractor shall provide a means of preventing the contaminates from contaminating the stockpile. This may be by the placement of granular material on the haul routes to keep the equipment tires clean. When the Contractor is stockpiling two or more classes of materials at the same time, the Inspector must be alert to see that the materials are placed in the proper stockpiles. A few loads of fine screenings inadvertently placed in a stockpile of coarse screenings can destroy or greatly reduce the quality of a large amount of material.

The Inspector is cautioned to be especially alert when stockpiling is being done during hours of darkness to see that all phases of the work are carried out in accordance with the specifications. In many instances, when difficulties are encountered in the use of stockpile material, it is found that the trouble occurred during the night shift when inspection and testing work are very difficult to accomplish in the proper manner. If the Contractor elects to stockpile aggregates prior to use in the immediate work, the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 3-02.2(4) must be complied with. The Project Engineer’s attention is directed to Standard Specifications Section 3-02.3 for additional requirements for stockpiling certain aggregates. Some of the important duties of the Inspector are listed below:
• See that stockpile area is prepared properly.
• Stake each corner of proposed area for piles.
• Watch to see that material is placed in the stockpile in an approved manner.
• Watch for evidence of degradation or segregation of the material in the pile.
• See that piles are kept separate and are neatly finished.

Site Reclamation
GEN 3-03.1
General All surface mines are to be reclaimed in accordance with RCW 78.44 Surface mining and the Contract Reclamation Plan. Standard Specifications Section 3-03 covers the requirements for site reclamation. The intent of site reclamation is to develop an area that remains useful and aesthetically pleasing in appearance after the materials are removed from the site. Costs involved in complying with the requirements and restrictions imposed by WSDOT, the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), or other agencies in order to comply with the Surface Mining Act do not constitute a basis for additional compensation. Any request for an extension of time resulting from plan approval delays will be considered only if complete and adequate plans were submitted in a timely manner. To permit positive identification of the pit sites when the various surface mining forms are filled out, the pit site number should be included in the description box in the upper right hand corner of the forms.

General Requirements
SS 3-03.2(1) Contracting Agency-Provided Sources Contract reclamation plans for sources furnished by WSDOT will normally be included in the Contract Plans. When this is not done, or when a change to another state source is required, a new plan shall be prepared by the Project Engineer and submitted to the Region Materials Office for review. The Region Materials Office will review the contract reclamation plan to verify that it is in compliance with the DNR Reclamation Permit. The Project Engineer prepares the plan and related papers in accordance with the instructions issued by the Environmental and Engineering Programs Division. These instructions are located in Section 400.06(6) of the Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31. SS 3-03.2(2) Contractor Provided Sources Sites operating under a valid reclamation permit issued by DNR will not require a plan to be submitted to the Project Engineer, nor the DNR form, since the Contractor will be corresponding directly with DNR. Evidence of the permit and the conditions contained therein shall be furnished by the Contractor to the Project Engineer. DNR shall perform the inspection and administration of these sites. Sites with less than 3 acres of newly disturbed land or with walls less than 30 ft in height and one to one or flatter slopes, waste sites, and stockpile sites are not surface mines and do not come under the provisions of the Surface Mining Act but must be reclaimed in accordance with the Contract Plans.
SS 3-03.3
Reclamation Plans Reclamation plans are not required for stockpile or waste sites. However, all stockpile and waste sites are to be graded to the extent necessary to control erosion and provide satisfactory appearance consistent with anticipated future use. Compliance with the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) is required for sites on WSDOT right of way involving more than 100 cubic yards of excavation or landfill throughout the lifetime of the site. For waste sites not on WSDOT right of way, the Contractor must comply with the SEPA regulation adopted by the local jurisdiction. Sites involving more than 500 cubic yards of excavation or landfill throughout the lifetime of the site always require compliance with SEPA. As an assurance of compliance, it is recommended that a site plan for reclaiming stockpile and waste sites be agreed upon by the Region and the Contractor. In areas where local City or County ordinances exercise control of stockpile or waste sites, the Contractor shall submit copies of the governing agency’s permit and evidence of approval by the property owner to the Project Engineer. In all cases, the Region will be expected to inspect the sites, devoting special attention to aesthetics and ensuring that any diversion of drainage waters due to the wasting or stockpiling operations will not produce any adverse conditions.

Gravel Base
GEN 4-02.1
General Instructions Gravel Base is typically used in the construction of the roadway section and provides support for the pavement. For the pavement to provide a long life, it is important the gravel base be placed uniformly and compacted properly.
SS 4-02.2
Construction Requirements When gravel base is specified in the contract, the Contractor may request, in writing, that gravel borrow be used in lieu of gravel base. When gravel borrow is substituted for gravel base, the top 0.10 feet of gravel borrow shall be replaced with 0.10 feet of crushed surfacing top course (CSTC). Testing and sampling frequencies will be as required for the material actually placed. The CSTC and gravel borrow used in lieu of the gravel base is measured and paid for as gravel base and not as CSTC or gravel borrow. The inspector should note on the item quantity ticket that the CSTC or gravel borrow is being used in lieu of gravel base. The as‑built plans will identify sections where gravel borrow and CSTC were substituted for gravel base.

Ballast and Crushed Surfacing
GEN 4-04.1
General Instructions Ballast and crushed surfacing is used in the construction of the roadway section and provides support for the pavement. Ballast may be naturally occurring or manufactured, crushed surfacing is a manufactured material. Careful inspection during the manufacturing process is required to verify that the material meets the contract specifications. This is important so the material will have the properties needed to provide support to the pavement and drain water from beneath it. For the pavement to provide a long life, it is important that ballast or crushed surfacing be placed uniformly to the line, grade, and cross section specified in the plans and compacted properly.
Staking See Section 1-05 for listed tolerance and the Highway Surveying Manual M 22-97 for additional instruction concerning staking.

Inspector’s Checklist Inspection duties include but are not limited to: 1. Watch for segregation of material on roadway. Make sure each course of surfacing is properly prepared and meets density specifications before allowing the next course to be placed. 2. When applying water to a surfacing course, see that it is distributed evenly over the entire course. Avoid over-watering which may cause soft spots in subgrade. 3. Make frequent checks of yield to see that the specified quantity of material is placed. 4. See that surfacing courses are completed and compacted true to profile and section. See that humps and sags in the profile are removed. 5. See that surfacing is maintained properly. Should irregularities develop in any surfacing the Contractor shall repair the defects prior to placement of the next course. 6. Make depth checks to ensure conformance with the roadway section. 7. Make daily moisture checks on material paid for by the ton when excess moisture is present. 8. Make sure that adequate survey hubs are used in order to verify that the grade will be smooth and uniform.
SS 4-04.3
Construction Requirements
SS 4-04.3(2) Subgrade Subgrade for ballast or crushed surfacing is prepared in accordance with the appropriate specifications. Any soft or spongy areas shall be removed or stabilized before the ballast or surfacing material is placed over it. SS 4-04.3(3) Mixing The Standard Specifications require the material to be mixed by the Central Plant Mix Method, the Road Mix Method, or a combination of the two methods. On some projects, the Central Plant Mix Method is the required method. SS 4-04.3(4) Placing and Spreading Ballast and crushed surfacing materials shall be hauled and placed on the roadway with the equipment and in accordance with the Standard Specifications. It is imperative that the Inspector watch for segregation of materials during all stages of hauling and placement. The design of the roadway section is based on all materials meeting all requirements of the specifications, including gradation requirements. If crushed surfacing materials are deposited on the roadway in a segregated condition, the only corrective measure available is processing of the material on the roadway, using motor graders or other mixing equipment. Excessive processing of material on the roadway is a poor substitute for placement of material in the proper condition in the first

Chapter 4
place. Therefore, it is very important that every effort be made to ensure correct handling of the materials at all stages of surfacing operations. Various types of equipment have been developed in order to facilitate placing the required amount of material with a minimum of segregation to the correct cross-section. When the material is mixed with water in a central plant before placing on the roadway with a spreading machine, it can be compacted and shaped to the proper grade and cross-section with a minimum of handling and shaping on the roadway. Some equipment operates from grade control wires to ensure the material is placed at the proper elevation and transverse slope. If this type of operation is proposed to be used by the Contractor, the Inspector should become familiar with the operation and intricacies of the equipment. Before each course of surfacing is placed, the Inspector should verify that the underlying course is uniformly graded and compacted properly. The Inspector should also see that each course is finished to a true, smooth profile with no humps or hollows. A good way to locate irregularities in the roadway profile or crown is by careful visual inspection. Viewing the grade from a prone position or using stringlines between hubs may be helpful. In this way, additional material can be spot-placed to eliminate low and irregular areas, and the material graded and compacted to a true, smooth surface. It is important the Contractor place the courses of surfacing material in such a manner as to minimize any deleterious effect on the quality of the material already placed. One of the best ways to minimize damage to the previously placed materials is to reduce the amount of hauling equipment traveling over each course. The placement of the surfacing should begin at the extreme end of the haul and proceed toward the point of loading. In this way, the least amount of hauling over completed courses will be required. SS 4-04.3(5) Shaping and Compaction Prior to placing any surfacing material, the Project Engineer submits representative samples of each surfacing material to be used on the project to the Regional Materials Engineer sufficiently in advance of the time of its intended use to permit completion of the compaction control test. For each surfacing material, the Project Engineer will receive a Maximum Density Curve worksheet from either the Regional Materials Laboratory or State Materials Laboratory. This worksheet shows the standard density for all gradations of the tested material as related to the percent passing the U.S. No. 4 sieve. Each layer of surfacing material placed, including gravel base, is to be compacted with approved compaction equipment and checked for compliance with density specifications before the next layer of material is placed. When individual layers are placed to a depth of less than 1 inch, testing of two layers at one time is permissible. Field in-place density tests are performed in accordance with the test procedures and testing frequencies outlined in Chapter 9. A minimum of 95 percent of the standard density as determined by the compaction control test for granular materials is typically required before the next layer of material is placed. During processing and compaction, the moisture content of the material should be maintained at the optimum water content. The optimum water content is determined by the State Materials Laboratory and is listed on the Maximum Density Curve worksheet. Frequent light applications of water rather than periodic heavy applications are preferable as light applications tend to avoid saturation of the surfacing material below the surface.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

Bases
Some projects, typically ones with a large quantity of crushed surfacing, will require the water be added to the surfacing by the central mix plant method. With this method, the amount of water added can be closely controlled and mixed thoroughly with the aggregate. This will result in a material that is uniform both in gradation and water content which will be easier to compact. If the special provisions require that the surfacing courses be trimmed with an automatically controlled trimming machine, the top of each course of different surfacing courses shall be trimmed to grade and cross-section. The cutting of the surfacing by the trimming machine is controlled by wire lines setup along each side of the roadway. It is therefore important that frequent checks of the wire be made both at the initial setup of the wire and during the trimming operation. This is necessary to verify that the wire has not been disturbed and that the grade will be trimmed correctly. The Project Engineer should be aware that the trimming machines now in use only trim the top surface and do not move material longitudinally from high spots to low areas. The Project Engineer shall see that the materials are placed in reasonably correct amounts and slightly higher than the finished elevations. After completion of the trimming and compaction of the surfacing the finished grade should be checked. Most of the existing trimming machines do a good job of trimming if they are cutting a nominal amount and they tend to chatter and leave an unacceptable washboard surface when operating over a surface that is at or below the finished grade elevation or very hard. On some projects subsequent operations such as concrete paving will also require wire lines and the Contractor will typically use the same wire for both operations. The wires for these cases will need to be set far enough out to allow for the operation of the paving equipment. An alternative to requiring trimming machines for some projects is to use motor graders with automatic controls. Maintenance of Surfacing Upon completion of the surfacing courses, the Contractor is required to maintain and water the surface if any traffic is allowed to travel upon the roadway. When traffic is heavy, considerable damage can result if maintenance is not performed daily. It is much better to perform frequent light maintenance on a surfacing course than to wait until considerable rutting, potholing and segregation occur in which event heavy processing and blading will be required. Testing for density in the top surfacing course shall be deferred until just prior to commencing paving operations. The specifications provide that WSDOT may perform routine maintenance of a traveled roadway only in the event of a suspension of work for an extended period, as in the case of a shutdown for the winter.

SS 4-04.3(6) Keystone Keystone may be used as needed to provide a tight surface for ballast, gravel base, crushed surfacing base course, or any other surfacing. If the Contractor’s operation are such that a considerable amount of coarse rock accumulates on the surface of the completed course that will not compact tightly, keystone may be constructed in accordance with the requirements specified in Standard Specifications Section 4-04.3(6). If the Contract includes crushed surfacing top course, the Project Engineer may order the construction of keystone and include the quantity in the measurement and payment of crushed surfacing top course. If the Contract does not include the item crushed surfacing top course, approval for adding the item to the Contract is required before it may be used. Keystone placed for the convenience of the Contractor, with approval of the Project Engineer, is paid for at the lower unit Contract price for either the base material being keyed or the crushed surfacing top course. The Specifications require that when keystone is necessary that it be placed at the end of each day on the course prepared that day. This requirement is especially important when traffic is being carried through the project to protect the course just completed and also to maintain a satisfactory roadway for the traffic. In areas where the pavement is subject to freeze thaw conditions, the use of crushed surfacing top course may not be appropriate if the crushed surfacing top course is frost susceptible. The Regional Materials Engineer should be contacted prior to using crushed surfacing top course in freeze thaw locations.

Cement Concrete Pavement Rehabilitation
SS 5-01.1
Description Rehabilitation of Cement Concrete Pavement is used to repair damage to the roadway, extend the life of the pavement, prevent further damage to the pavement, and to provide a smoother ride to the traveling public. The various types of rehabilitation each have specific methods and requirements for performing the work. The Project Engineer and the inspection team must be familiar with the specifications, Contract requirements, and techniques to be employed to accomplish the Work. In addition, all personnel must be familiar with and adhere to the traffic control plans. Prior to beginning work, the Project Engineer must ensure that the Project Inspectors and Testers are properly qualified in the test procedures, are familiar with the testing requirements, and that the testing equipment is calibrated and available. When saw cutting or diamond grinding is required, pay special attention to environmental requirements for the removal and disposal of concrete slurry.

Concrete Patching Materials
Materials – Concrete patching materials will meet the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 9-20. The Project Inspector needs to inspect and document all prepackaged cementitious materials to ensure that they are properly labeled and that the Contractor mixes them to the correct proportions, as specified by the manufacturer. SS 5-01.3(1)A2
Cement Concrete for Panel Replacement
Concrete – Cement Concrete mixes used in concrete panel replacement have to meet the requirements of Section 5-05.3(1) and 5-05.3(2). The Project Inspector will:
• ensure the mix design has been accepted prior to use and
• visually verify that the concrete delivery ticket has all required information and that the concrete is in compliance with the mix design. Acceptance of the mix is verified on the grade by testing the air content and taking 28 day compressive strength cylinders for testing. Acceptance testing for air content and compressive strength is required to be performed once per shift. The rapid compressive strength gain of some proprietary concrete mixes makes taking air content tests difficult and the field test may be waived at the Project Engineer’s discretion.

Concrete for panel replacement may come from a ready mix plant or mobile mixer. The Contractor is required to calibrate mobile mixers in the presence of the Project Engineer prior to use on the project. SS 5-01.3(1)B
Equipment
The Project Inspector will verify that all equipment used by the Contractor is in good working order and can produce a panel to the correct grade and in compliance with the Contract Specifications. SS 5-01.3(4) Replace Portland Cement Concrete Pavement (PCCP) Panel When a PCCP panel is damaged too severely, the only repair possible is replacement of all or a portion of the panel. This is accomplished by saw cutting and removing the PCCP panel and placing new PCCP, dowel bars and tie bars. The Project Inspector must ensure that panels to be removed are laid out according to the Plans or as designated by the Project Engineer. All perimeter saw cuts must be full depth. To prevent damage to adjacent slabs that are to remain, a second full depth relief cut is required 6 to 18 inches inside the panel in both the transverse and longitudinal directions. If these full depth relief cuts are not made the energy imparted lifting out and/or breaking up the panel may be transmitted to the adjacent panels that are to remain and cause damage. Overcutting of panels in adjacent lanes that are to remain is not allowed for relief cuts and should be minimized for the perimeter sawcuts. Once the panel has been removed, inspect the Subgrade material and the adjacent panels for any damage. Ensure that Subgrade is compacted to grade prior to placement of new concrete. Crushed surfacing base course or hot mix asphalt may be needed to provide a level and firm surface. This is already included in the standard bid price of the Work. If the material is not compactable, remove it, place geotextile and crushed surfacing base course as detailed in Standard Specifications Section 5-01.3(4)D at the Project Engineer’s direction. Should the material need to be removed, this Work, as detailed in items 1 through 5 of the Standard Specifications, is to be paid by force account. Ensure dowel bars and tie bars are placed in accordance with the plan and meet the requirements of Standard Specifications Sections 9-07.5 and 9-07.6. Collect Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance documentation (and Certificates of Materials Origin on federally funded projects) for all dowel bars and tie bars prior to use on the project. If new concrete pavement is to be placed against existing concrete pavement, epoxycoated dowel bars shall be drilled and grouted into the existing concrete pavement. Tie bars are required whenever four or more concrete pavement panels in a row are placed next to existing pavement. Corrosion Resistant Dowel bars may be used in place of epoxy-coated dowel bars in panel replacements described in Standard Specifications Section 5-01. Verify that placement and tolerances of dowel bars and tie bars are in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 5-01.3(4). Ensure that bond breaking material is properly installed so there are no folds or tenting that will result in voids under the concrete panel.

The position of dowel bars may be adjusted in order to avoid unsound concrete or an existing dowel bar. It may be necessary to cut back the face of the adjacent panel to reach sound concrete to install dowel bars. Panels replaced should be the full width of the existing panel and at least 6 feet in length. The lift-out method of removing panels is less likely to damage adjacent panels than a breakup and clean-out method. The Project Engineer should consider allowing alternative relief saw cuts patterns if the Contractor is using the lift-out method provided the alternative method does not damage adjacent panels. A relief saw cut is not necessary along edges of the panel that are not adjacent to cement concrete pavement such as when the concrete panel abuts an HMA shoulder. A smooth uniform foundation is one of the most important factors affecting PCCP performance. Ensure that the panel foundation does not have excessive variation in elevation or soft spots. SS 5-01.3(5) Partial Depth Spall Repair This work consists of removing and replacing a small portion of a concrete panel. The Project Inspector must ensure that removal of existing pavement does not cause damage to any pavement that is to remain. The saw cut must be a minimum depth of 2 inches around the area to be removed. The saw cut area should be rectangular or circular and a minimum of 3 inches outside the area of spalled concrete. The pavement shall be removed to a minimum depth of 2 inches or to sound concrete as determined by the Project Engineer. Materials – The concrete patching material needs to meet the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 9-20. Inspect and document all prepackaged cementitious materials to ensure that they are properly labeled and that the Contractor mixes them to the correct proportions, as specified by the manufacturer. Equipment – Verify that all equipment used by the Contractor is in good working order, and meets the requirements of the Contract. Verify that jackhammers weigh no more than 30 pounds and chipping hammers weigh no more than 15 pounds. Spall Repair Checklist 1. Ensure that quick setting concrete is placed and finished within the time limit set by the manufacturer. 2. Small repair areas that are less than 6 inches on a side and shallow spalls that will be removed by grinding are done at the Project Engineer’s discresion. 3. Spall repairs that abut working joints or cracks require a compressible insert to reestablish the joint or crack. If the crack is not reestablished the patch material may delaminate or spall. 4. Check the area around the spall for delamination. If delaminated areas are found they should be included in the spall repair. 5. Limit spall repairs to 1/2 the thickness of the panel. Deeper repairs require a partial or full panel replacement. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

SS 5-01.3(6) Dowel Bar Retrofits Dowel bar retrofitting is used to ensure transfer of loads between adjacent roadway panels and is combined with pavement grinding to extend the service life of the pavement. This increases the stability of the roadway by restricting differential movement of the panels and reducing vertical movement. Dowel bar retrofits are accomplished by cutting slots in the pavement, placing dowel bars, and filling with concrete patching material. The Project Inspector will verify that the slots are:
• located in accordance with the plan
• cut parallel to the centerline of the roadway and to each other
• centered over the transverse joint All exposed surfaces and cracks in the slot must be sand blasted to a clean concrete surface. All grout residue and debris must be removed from the slot, using either an air compressor or, if allowed, a high-pressure water blast. Ensure that dowel bars meet Contract requirements and are placed in accordance with the Plans. Foam core inserts shall be placed at the middle of the dowel, in line with the transverse joint, must fit tightly to the sides and bottom of the slot, and extend to the top of the existing pavement. It is important that the foam core inserts line up with the transverse joints. The top of the foam core insert will be removed when the joint is saw cut through the section. Transverse joints open 1/4 inch or more must be caulked to prevent patching material from entering the joint. Concrete patching material shall be placed in the slots in a manner that does not disturb the dowel bar and to a level slightly above the level of the surrounding roadway. Diamond grinding of the roadway surface is required within 10 working days of placement of the concrete patching material to provide a smooth surface. Materials – The Contractor shall use concrete patching materials meeting the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 9-20. Inspect and document all prepackaged cementitious materials to ensure that they are properly labeled and that the Contractor mixes them to the correct proportions, and follows any placement restrictions, listed on the packages. Ensure that dowel bars are placed in accordance with the Plans, and meet the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 9-07.5(1) or 9-07.5(2). Collect Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance documentation (and Certificates of Materials Origin on federally funded projects) for all dowel bars prior to use on the project. Equipment – Verify that all equipment used by the Contractor is in good working order, and meets the requirements of the Contract. Ensure that air compressors are of sufficient size and capacity to perform the work. SS 5-01.3(9) Portland Cement Concrete Pavement Grinding Diamond grinding of PCCP panels increases ride smoothness, reduces bumps following dowel bar retrofitting and increases the PCCP pavements life.

The Project Inspector will ensure that grinding begins within 10 working days of dowel bar placement and once begun, is a continuous operation until completed. Pavement shall be ground in a longitudinal direction removing a minimum of ⅛ inch from 95 percent of the surface to be ground. If new cement concrete pavement is to be placed adjacent to rehabilitated cement concrete pavement, one pass must be ground along the edge of the rehabilitated pavement adjacent to where the new pavement will be placed. This will assure a smooth surface for the paving screed. Equipment – Verify that all equipment used by the Contractor is in good working order, and meets the requirements of the Contract. Ensure the diamond grinder is of sufficient size and capacity to perform the work. SS 5-01.3(10)
Pavement Smoothness
Longitudinal surface smoothness of Cement Concrete Pavement grinding is accepted by the percentage of improvement when using the Mean Roughness Index (MRI). The Contractor is responsible for providing the inertial profiler and operator used for smoothness testing. To ensure the profiler is accurate and the measured profile is repeatable, the inertial profiler must have been certified within the last 12 months and the operator must have been certified within the last three years. Inertial profilers will either be certified by a certification facility or by another state. Profilers certified by a certification facility are required to display a decal or other approved marking as evidence of certification and the certification expiration date. If the inertial profiler is certified by another state, the Contractor is required to submit documentation verifying the profiler certification. Contact the State Pavement Office to verify that the certification meets the requirements of AASHTO R 56. The Contractor is required to collect a control profile of the existing pavement before any pavement rehabilitation work has started. Work such as panel replacement or spall repair will alter the MRI and make accurate determinations of the pre-existing MRI impossible. After completion of Work in the travel lanes the Contractor is required to collect an acceptance profile. Acceptance is based on the percentage improvement between the control profile and acceptance profile. There is no incentive or disincentive for MRI of cement concrete pavement grinding. The Contractor is required to perform corrective action if the MRI does not meet requirements. If the Project Engineer determines that corrective action does not or will not produce a satisfactory result the pavement may be accepted with a credit in accordance with Section 5-01.5. The Contractor is not responsible for cracks in the existing roadway and dips that are too deep to remove by grinding and 0.01-mile sections with these deficiencies are excluded from the MRI analysis. Tenth mile sections should also be excluded if they contain more than three 0.01-mile sections with these types of deficiencies. However; individual 0.01-mile sections that did not have deficiencies must still meet the 160 inches/mile requirement for 0.01-mile sections even though they are in the excluded 0.10 section.

Bituminous Surface Treatment
GEN 5-02.1
General Instructions Bituminous Surface Treatment (BST) construction proceeds very rapidly and it is very important that the Project Inspector be entirely familiar with the specifications and methods applicable to the Work. If the Work begins without proper preparation and planning, it is entirely possible that a major portion of the job will be completed before correction of any improper methods or procedures can be made. Project Inspectors should thoroughly review Standard Specifications Section 5-02, the Plans and the Contract Special Provisions well in advance of BST construction. Carefully review Standard Specifications Section 5-02.3(10) concerning unfavorable weather and calendar cutoff dates well in advance of any bituminous paving work. In no case should bituminous surface treatments be placed before May 1 or after August 31 of any year except upon written order of the Project Engineer. To correct the volume of the material to 60°F, the Project Inspector may use 240 gallon per ton at 60°F for all grades of emulsified asphalt. When payment for asphaltic materials is by the ton, they should be measured by weighing. When it is impractical to weigh the materials, the quantity of asphaltic material used may be measured by the gallon and the number of gallons converted to tons with the appropriate temperature volume correction.
GEN 5-02.3
Inspection and Sampling of Materials Emulsified Asphalt – Each shipment of emulsified asphalt arriving on the job by tank truck shall be inspected and must have a Certification of Shipment. The tank must be inspected after it is unloaded to see that no emulsified asphalt remains in the tank. The Project Inspector must check and record the temperature of each load of emulsified asphalt as it is delivered to the roadway for spreading. Samples of the emulsified asphalt shall be taken as required in Section 9-4.2, and shall be submitted to the State Materials Laboratory for Testing. Aggregates – No aggregate shall be used without the acceptance of the State Materials Laboratory. If any question arises concerning quality of the material, a sample shall be sent to the State Materials Laboratory for testing before use and preferably during plan preparation.
GEN 5-02.4
Miscellaneous Inspection Duties Control of Traffic – Make frequent checks of traffic control operations to see that traffic is being conducted through the job in a safe, orderly manner. When spreading emulsified asphalt, traffic should not be allowed to travel past the distributor. Control of the speed of traffic is very important, especially during the early curing stage of the asphalt, to ensure the aggregate covering the asphalt is disturbed as little as possible. Control of traffic must be maintained as long as required to prevent excessive loss of the aggregate. The Project Inspector must ensure that all warning signs are properly in place throughout construction.

Maintenance and Finishing Roadway – The Project Inspector shall see that the newly completed roadway is properly maintained until brooming is completed. The Contractor shall be required to keep sufficient equipment on the job to adequately handle any situation that may develop, including application of a fog seal or additional emulsified asphalt or aggregates if deemed necessary by the Project Engineer per SS 5-02.3(6). Before the Work is accepted, the Contractor is required to finish the roadway and clean up any debris resulting from their operations, as required in the Standard Specifications. Measurement of Stockpiles – Before construction begins, measure and compute quantities from stockpiles that will be utilized for materials. Upon completion of the Work, the Contractor shall be required to leave the remaining materials in neat, presentable stockpiles. The stockpiles shall again be measured and quantities determined. The difference in quantities obtained by this procedure will aid in checking pay quantities determined by truck volumes. It will also serve as an accurate basis for reporting quantities withdrawn from stockpiles. Measurement of stockpiles will not be necessary on projects where the aggregate is furnished by the contractor. Notice to Maintenance Superintendent – The Project Engineer should keep the area Maintenance Superintendent informed of the Contractor’s proposed progress schedule so that maintenance operations can be coordinated to accommodate the construction work. The Project Engineer must also notify the Maintenance Superintendent of the date when the Contractor’s maintenance period will expire so that maintenance of the roadway may be taken over by WSDOT and maintained without interruption. These notices should be given sufficiently in advance to enable the Maintenance Superintendent to provide equipment and organize the work.
