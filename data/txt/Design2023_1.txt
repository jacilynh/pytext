Foreword The Design Manual is for use by Washington State Department of Transportation personnel, consultants and contractors engaged in transportation design. It provides policies, procedures, and methods for developing and documenting the design of improvements to the transportation network in Washington. It has been developed for state facilities and may not be appropriate for all county roads or city streets that are not state highways. The Federal Highway Administration has agreed to approve designs that follow the guidance in the Design Manual; therefore, following the guidance is mandatory for state highway projects. When proposed designs meet the requirements contained in the Design Manual, little additional documentation is required. The Design Manual supplements the engineering analyses and judgment inherent with practical design and provides uniform procedures for documenting and implementing design decisions. The Design Manual emphasizes practical design as a means to produce environmentally conscious, sustainable, context-based designs that achieve the purpose and need for the lowest cost. Practical design considers the needs of all users, fostering livable communities and modally integrated transportation system. The Design Manual also embraces Complete Streets as an approach to planning, designing, building, operating, and maintaining the transportation system that enables safe and convenient access to destinations for all people, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders. The complexity of transportation design requires designers to make fundamental trade-off decisions and sometimes incremental approaches to balance competing spatial considerations with available resources. Although this adds to the complexity of design, it acknowledges the unique needs of specific projects and the relative priorities of various projects and programs. Updating the Design Manual is an ongoing process and revisions are issued regularly. The addition of new or modified design criteria to the Design Manual through the revision process does not imply that existing features are deficient in any way, nor does it suggest or mandate immediate engineering review or initiation of new projects. Comments, questions, and improvement ideas are welcomed. Use the WSDOT Design Manual – Comments and Revision Suggestions form or simply email the Manual Manager.

100.01 Overview The Design Manual sets the policy, procedures, and criteria to develop projects on state highways. The Design Manual facilitates the development of a highway system consistent with the needs of the multimodal traveling public. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has found the procedures and guidance in the Design Manual to be acceptable for use on federal aid projects. Deviations from the Design Manual must be approved following the procedures outlined herein. The information, guidance, and references contained herein are not intended as a substitute for sound engineering judgment. The Design Manual is not a comprehensive textbook on highway engineering, nor does it attempt to cover all the possible scenarios Washington’s highways present. It is recognized that some situations encountered are beyond the scope of this presentation. The Headquarters (HQ) Design Office occasionally issues Project Delivery Memorandums (PDM), which represent interim updates that supersede policy in this manual. The HQ Design Office also issues Design Bulletins (DB), which do not change policy, but are intended to provide clarifications about the interpretation of existing policy and guidance for manual users. Check for active PDMs and DBs on a regular basis – they are posted at https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/all-manuals-and-standards/manuals/design-manual. Note that both PDM’s and DB’s are eventually retired, once their content is incorporated in the Design Manual, or they become no longer relevant. If you have design questions not answered by the Design Manual, contact the Headquarters (HQ) Design Office.
100.02 Presentation and Revisions The Design Manual is available on the Internet. It can be accessed through the:

100.03 Practical Solutions WSDOT deploys Practical Solutions to enable incremental, flexible and sustainable transportation investment decisions as outlined in Executive Order (EO) E 1090.01, Advancing Practical Solutions. This data-driven approach uses tools, data analytics, performance measures, and stakeholder input to (1) seek lower-cost approaches and efficiencies in expanding and operating the multimodal transportation system to reduce travel demand and the need for building costly new infrastructure, (2) identify, evaluate, analyze, and manage risk to WSDOT’s strategic objectives, and (3) identify and implement agency efficiencies. The goal is to identify and solve needs as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. WSDOT uses practical solutions throughout the project development process, from planning through operation and maintenance. Examples of Practical Solutions strategies used in design include Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO), off-system solutions, transportation demand management, and incremental strategic capital solutions. (See Chapter 1100 for more information.)
100.04 Manual Applications The Design Manual incorporates and interprets the FHWA adopted design requirements found in 23 CFR 625 and 49 CFR 37.9 that apply to projects on the NHS and provides guidance for uniform application of design details under normal conditions. It also guides users through the project development process used by WSDOT. The Design Manual is used by the department to:
•
•
•
•
Interpret current design principles, including American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and other appropriate policy sources, findings, and federal and state laws. Develop projects that address modal and community performance needs. Balance the competing performance needs of highway construction projects. Design for low-cost solutions.
The Design Manual allows for flexibility in design for specific and unusual situations. For unusual circumstances, the manual provides mechanisms for documenting the reasons for the choices made. The Design Manual is developed for use on Interstate and state highways and may not be suitable for projects on county roads or city streets.
100.05 Manual Use The WSDOT Design Manual is intended to be used for design of department-owned facilities, especially the transportation facilities associated with state highways as designated by RCW 47.17. For state highway routes, projects are designed using the Design Manual practical design approach (see Chapter 1100 and Division 11). If WSDOT guidance is not used on a project, appropriate documentation and approvals are required (see Chapter 300 and Chapter 1100). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Manual Description
When WSDOT designs facilities that will be turned over to local jurisdictions, those facilities are to be designed using appropriate local geometric design criteria. When local jurisdictions design any element of state highway facilities, the Design Manual must be used. Local jurisdictions are free to adopt this manual for their local criteria or to develop their own specialized guidance for facilities not on state highway routes.

Design-Build Projects Exhibit 110-1 Design Documentation Sequence for a Typical Design-Build Project
110.01 General This chapter emphasizes that the Design Manual applies to the delivery methods of all Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) capital projects, including design-build projects. Certain terms are defined to coincide with WSDOT design-build project delivery; however, it is beyond the scope of this manual to extensively define design-build projects. Design-build projects are based on their own contractual documents (such as a Request for Proposal), which present directive language intended to legally define the project and identify requirements and controls, roles and responsibilities, and procedures and outcomes. See WSDOT Design-Build Manual M3126.06 for processes and procedures for procuring design-build contracts. www.wsdot.wa.gov/projects/delivery/designbuild/ Design-build is a method of project delivery in which WSDOT executes a single contract with one entity (the design-builder) for design and construction services to provide a finished product. In a traditional WSDOT design-bid-build contract, the design process is completed independent of the construction contract. Under WSDOT policy, the Basis of Design (see Chapter 1100 and Chapter 300) is approved prior to issuing an RFP. Delivering a project using design-build contracting eliminates very few steps when compared to the typical WSDOT design-bid-build process. The same project work tasks and products are normally required whether performed by WSDOT or the design-builder. The timing, order, and level of task detail performed are what make design-build contracting different than design-bid-build. The design-build process may shift many tasks and responsibilities from WSDOT to the design-builder depending on the project’s scope/risk analysis. The shift changes the order and development detail of the tasks and thus must be reflected in the process through contractual documents. According to state law, preservation projects with an overall project cost of $10 million and over, and all other projects with an overall project cost of $2 million and over, are required to go through the Project Delivery Method Selection process (see Section 300.02(1) Project Delivery Method).
110.02 Terminology and Language Used 110.02(1) Application of Terminology Several terms are encountered throughout the Design Manual that are not normally applicable to design-build project delivery. They are expanded in this chapter to provide appropriate meaning for design-build projects and design-build personnel. It is intended that design-build personnel acknowledge these expanded meanings and apply them throughout the manual, which will eliminate the need to restate them each time they are encountered. design-builder The firm, partnership, joint venture, or organization that contracts with WSDOT to perform the work. designer This term applies to WSDOT design personnel. Wherever “designer” appears in this manual, designbuild personnel shall deem it to mean: Engineer of Record, Design Quality Assurance Manager, design-builder, WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 110-1
Chapter 110
Design-Build Projects
or any other term used in the design-build contract to indicate design-build personnel responsible for the design elements of a design-build project, depending on the context of information being conveyed. Project Engineer This term applies to WSDOT personnel. Wherever “Project Engineer” appears in this manual, the design-builder shall deem it to mean “Engineer of Record.” Request for Proposal (RFP) The document package issued by WSDOT requesting submittal of proposals for the project and providing information relevant to the preparation and submittal of proposals, including the instructions to proposers, contract documents, bidding procedures, and reference documents. Additional terms are presented in the Design Manual Glossary of Terms.
110.02(2) Language Used for Design Flexibility The Design Manual is primarily written for WSDOT engineering personnel; however, design-builders, local agencies, and developers also use it for state and local agency projects. Under WSDOT practical design, flexibility is encouraged to develop independent designs tailored to context and identified performance need. (See chapters in the 1100 series for more information about practical design policy and guidance.) With the exclusion of this chapter, the Design Manual is intentionally written to avoid or minimize the use of directive words like “shall” and “should” in order to retain this important flexibility for the larger set of users. In the case of design-build projects, design flexibility applies to the extent allowed by the contract. The designbuilder shall refer to the project-specific RFP for design guidance. The RFP will identify design decisions and provide technical specifications relating to the project’s design.
110.03 Design and Documentation Responsibility In the traditional design-bid-build format, WSDOT bears the entire responsibility and risk for any design-related issues. As the owner, all responsibility for design decisions and conformance to standards rests with WSDOT. For design-build projects, many design responsibilities shift to the design-builder once the Notice to Proceed is issued. WSDOT is still responsible for establishing the scope, performance measurements, and existing conditions of the site as part of preliminary design. Any preliminary design done by WSDOT would be filed and documented in the Design Documentation Package (DDP) and/or the Project File (PF), which are provided to the selected design-builder to maintain throughout the design-build project design phase and then returned to WSDOT for retention. It is important to note that the design content presented in this manual has valid application based not on delivery method, but on practical design procedures and specified needs such as roadway and land use context, traffic volumes, and identified performance needs, as presented in Chapter 1100 (and other chapters). It is also important to specify that design documentation is a requirement for WSDOT projects, regardless of delivery method. WSDOT still holds the valid requirement to have an organized design documentation file and as-constructed plans for future reference after the project is built. Plan accuracy, conformance with established design guidelines, and constructability of the project rests with the design-builder.

Chapter 110
Design-Build Projects
The DDP and the PF include all the elements identified in the project RFP. The RFP specifies various DDP and PF submittals to WSDOT, identifying how each item will be submitted (report, plan sheet element, Basis of Design and design parameter element, and so on) and who is responsible for the development status (such as complete, in progress, or not started) of each item. The RFP also indicates that some of the DDP and PF items have components that were started by WSDOT and that the design-builder shall complete or update those item(s). It is the design-builder’s responsibility to obtain copies of the information from WSDOT for use in completing the DDP and PF items. The DDP and the PF require retention of original, signed documents—not copies. The RFP typically specifies that the design-builder shall provide WSDOT with updates to the DDP and PF items throughout construction of the project. For further guidance on design documentation and WSDOT acceptance thereof, see Chapter 300, the project RFP, and the Design Documentation Checklist.

Notes: The Design Documentation Package (DDP) is started by WSDOT during scoping/pre-RFP design. The designbuilder completes the DDP as the project proceeds. The design-builder shall refer to the RFP for specific review and approval processes. The RFP will specify procedures for design submittals, including notifications to WSDOT and the time allowed for reviews. WSDOT will review design submittals for conformance with requirements of the contract. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

210.01 General The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) strives to keep the public informed about transportation issues, understand the needs of all impacted communities, involve all affected communities in the transportation decision making process, and make transportation and possible mitigation decisions based on the public’s best interests. This includes identifying and engaging with overburdened communities and vulnerable populations to ensure fair treatment and access to meaningful involvement in the transportation decision-making process. One of the best ways to achieve WSDOT’s goals is to collaborate with the public, community groups, and various agencies. These participants often have differing, and sometimes conflicting, perspectives and interests. In addition, many participants and organizations are not able to spend the time and effort required to fully engage in transportation decision making. Despite these challenges, active collaboration:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Gives WSDOT access to important information and new ideas. Helps WSDOT understand the historic and generational impacts of past transportation decisions on communities. Puts us in a position to help solve problems and resolve conflicts. Creates a sense of community. Helps the public and affected communities understand how their input shape and inform decisions. Fosters greater acceptance of projects. Helps us build and sustain a credible and trusting relationship with the public. Ultimately leads to transportation improvements that better meet the public’s needs and desires.
When collaborating with the public about transportation projects or issues, WSDOT uses more formal techniques like public hearings, direct mail, and presentations to city councils and legislators; as well as less formal but equally important techniques, such as discussions via telephone, e-mail, virtual and in-person meetings with community groups, media relations, and project Internet pages. Law requires that many types of capital transportation projects go through a formal public hearing process; thus, the legal procedures necessary for public hearings is the primary focus of this chapter. Community engagement plans are briefly discussed, and referrals to WSDOT’s communications resources are included to further guide their development and implementation.

(See Section 210.06 and the Environmental Manual.)
210.04 Community Engagement Developing and implementing an effective plan for collaboration with the public:
•
•
Is critical to the success of WSDOT’s project delivery effort. Provides an opportunity to understand and achieve diverse community and transportation goals.
Effective community engagement must begin with clearly defined, project-related goals that focus on specific issues, specific kinds of input needed, and specific people, communities or groups that need to be involved. The more detailed a community engagement plan, the greater its chances of providing all, including overburdened communities and vulnerable populations, fair treatment and access to equitable and meaningful involvement, and for the project to obtain information WSDOT can use in decision making. Transportation projects with high visibility, community issues and/or effects often attract the attention of a broad range of interested people. These types of projects will best benefit from early community engagement, which can influence the project’s success and community acceptance. Developing a profile (through demographic analysis) of the affected community is critical to achieving successful community engagement and should be the first order of business when developing a community engagement plan. The profile will enable the department to tailor its outreach efforts toward the abilities and needs of the community. Overburdened communities and vulnerable populations, who are traditionally underserved by the transportation system and have historically experienced disproportionate environmental and health impacts resulting from past transportation actions, often find access to meaningful participation difficult. While these groups form a growing portion of the population, particularly in urban areas, historically they have experienced barriers to participation in the public decision-making process and are therefore underrepresented. These barriers arise from both the historical nature of the community engagement process and from cultural, linguistic, and economic differences. For example, a community made up of largely senior citizens (with limited mobility/automobile usage) may mean:
•
•
Meetings/open houses are planned in locations easily accessible to them, such as senior centers and neighborhood community centers. Meetings are scheduled in the mornings or midday to accommodate individuals who prefer not to leave home after dark.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 210-5
Chapter 210
•
Community Engagement and Hearings
Community engagement events are scheduled in the evenings to accommodate persons who work during the day.
A project’s affected area might consist of a population with limited English proficiency. This may entail:
•
•
Developing/disseminating materials in other languages, as appropriate. Having a certified translator on hand at the meetings.
Extra effort may be needed to elicit involvement from people unaccustomed to participating in the community engagement process. Their community may have been subject to historic discrimination or negatively impacted by transportation decisions. They often have different needs and perspectives than those who traditionally participate in transportation decision making, and they may have important, unspoken issues that should be heard. They not only may have greater difficulty getting to jobs, schools, recreation, and shopping than the population at large, but also they are often unaware of transportation proposals that could dramatically change their lives. A Project may negatively impact, or benefit overburdened communities and vulnerable populations. Meaningful engagement may require:
•
Prioritization of continuous engagement with communities who face environmental injustices and continue to be underinvested and underserved.
•
Recognition that people and communities hold identities that have been subject to systemic oppression, including but not limited to gender, ethnicity, and disability status.
•
Focus on engagement that builds long-term, trust-based relationships with cultural humility.
•
Adequately funding opportunities for meaningful community engagement by supporting and providing opportunities for civic voice and community capacity building that builds on existing community priorities.
NEPA and SEPA environmental policies and procedures are intended to provide relevant environmental information to public officials, agencies, and citizens, and allow public input to be considered before decisions are made. There are also various other laws, regulations, and policies that emphasize community engagement, including 23 CFR, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Washington State HEAL Act per RCW 70A.02, and Executive Orders 12898 and 13166. Some projects are required to conduct an Environmental Justice Assessment for decisions or activities that may have the potential to negatively impact, or benefit overburdened communities and vulnerable populations (contact the Region Environmental Services Office for more information). WSDOT’s collaborative process with the public should be open, honest, strategic, consistent, inclusive, and continual. Initiating a project in an atmosphere of collaboration and partnership can go a long way toward providing equal opportunities for all parties (local, state, tribal, private, nonprofit, or federal) to participate in a project vision. This collaboration requires an intensive communications effort that is initiated during project visioning and extends through construction and eventual operation of the facility. Department specialists in public communications, environmental procedures, traffic engineering, real estate services, and limited access control are routinely involved with public outreach efforts and project hearings. Depending on the scale and complexity of a project, the region is encouraged to engage the participation of interdisciplinary experts when developing a community engagement plan and communicating project details.

Community Engagement and Hearings
210.04(1) Community Engagement Plan The region develops a regional community engagement plan and/or project-specific community engagement plan(s) for its own use and guidance. For additional information, see the agency-wide Community Engagement Plan. To engage the public, share the decision-making process, identify issues, and resolve concerns, the region communicates with potentially affected community through group presentations, open house meetings, newspaper articles, fliers, and other methods. The agency-wide Community Engagement Plan includes methods that will elicit the best participation from the community, including traditionally underrepresented groups. Developing an effective community engagement plan is a strategic effort. WSDOT must identify audiences, messages, strategies, and techniques that will meet the unique needs of a proposed transportation project, as well as the needs of the public. The community engagement plan promotes participation and decision-making processes that are equitable, accessible, and relevant to the public while being culturally and linguistically grounded. The community engagement plan establishes the process that will allow all members of the public equitable opportunities throughout the project development and delivery process to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Learn about the transportation needs WSDOT has identified. Share the needs/experiences of their community. Receive information and options (e.g., design alternatives, possible mitigation strategies, etc.) from WSDOT. Collaborate. Provide input intended to inform and influence WSDOT decisions. Understand how their input shaped and informed decisions.
The plan will outline ways to identify and involve the communities potentially affected by the project; provide them with accessible information through culturally and linguistically appropriate, reader-friendly documents, graphics, plans, and summaries; and involve them in decision making. An effective community engagement plan:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
is tailored to the project and impacted community; encourages interactive communication; demonstrates to residents that their input is valued and utilized; includes all potentially affected communities; identifies and resolves community and transportation issues early in the needs identification and project development process; is conducted often throughout the project development and delivery process (i.e., planning, scoping, design and construction); ensures meaningful public access to relevant, comprehensible, and culturally grounded information; informs the public of the purpose, need for, potential impacts and benefits of the proposed action; informs the public about the process that will be used to make decisions; gains public support; and provides equitable opportunity, regardless of disability, race, national origin, color, gender, or income.
The region Communications and Environmental offices can provide expertise in developing a community engagement plan tailored to a specific project. The HQ Access and Hearings Section specializes in procedures for public hearings.

Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
Real Estate Services personnel can provide expertise regarding acquisition, relocation assistance, and other related programs. Enlisting the support of these groups is essential to the success of WSDOT projects. WSDOT recognizes local, state, federal, and tribal staff and elected officials as active stakeholders of proposed projects. Those officials might help develop and implement the community engagement plan. Early and continued contact with these resources is key to the success of a project. The community engagement plan might include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Objectives Strategies Tactics (or a list of proposed activities) Proposed time schedule to accomplish each project Methods to track public comments Methods used to consider comments during the decision-making process, including follow-up procedures Personnel, time, and funds needed to carry out the plan Identification of the project partners and stakeholders
Early use of demographics can help identify the public to be involved. After identification, a variety of methods can be chosen to encourage the most effective community engagement. This might include (directly or indirectly) any or all of the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Adjacent property owners and tenants Indian tribes Overburdened Communities Vulnerable populations Low-income groups Minority groups Cooperating and participating agencies Local, state, and federal government staff and elected officials
•
•
•
•
•
•
Community groups such as clubs, civic groups, business groups, environmental groups, labor unions, disability advocacy groups, and churches Commuters and the traveling public Emergency and utility service providers Adjacent billboard owners and clients The general public and others known to be affected Others expressing interest
The following are examples of common outreach methods:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Public and open house meetings Drop-in information centers or booths Advisory committee meetings Design workshops Meetings with public officials Individual (one-on-one) meetings Meetings with community groups Project Internet pages WSDOT project e-mail alert lists

Community Engagement and Hearings
210.04(1)(a) Public Meetings and Open Houses Public meetings range from large informational workshops to small groups using one-on-one meetings with individuals. They are less formal than hearings. The region evaluates the desired outcome from a meeting, decides how the input will be tracked, and then plans accordingly.
•
•
•
Open house meetings can be effective for introducing a project to the public and stimulating an exchange of ideas. Small meetings are useful for gaining information from community groups, underrepresented groups, neighborhood groups, and advisory committees. Workshop formats, where large groups are organized into small discussion groups, serve to maximize the participation of all attendees while discouraging domination by a few groups or individuals.
210.04(1)(b) Follow-Up Procedures Effective community engagement is an ongoing collaborative exchange, and it is necessary to provide follow-up information several times during a large project to maintain a continuing exchange of information. At significant stages, the region provides information about the project. Follow-up information conveys, as accurately as possible, how public input was considered during development of the project. It may become necessary to revise the community engagement plan as the project evolves, conditions change, oppositional groups emerge, or new issues arise. Sometimes innovative methods must be used to ensure the inclusion of affected community members. This is especially important for underrepresented groups, such as minority and low-income groups, and in communities where a significant percentage of the affected population does not speak English or have limited English proficiency. Consider the need for translators, interpreters, and providing written information in languages other than English. Reference information on limited English proficiency is provided in Section 210.04(2)(d). A resident advisory committee can often help identify community issues and concerns as well as recommend effective methods for community engagement.
210.04(2) Community Engagement References Following are a number of recommended publications, references, and training courses available to assist regions in developing community engagement plans for their projects.
210.04(2)(a) WSDOT Project Management Guide A project’s community engagement plan is an essential element of the overall project management plan. The WSDOT Project Management Guide is an Internet resource intended to support delivery of transportation projects through effective project management and task planning. The guide includes best practices, tools, templates, and examples to enhance the internal and external communication processes: Project management guide | WSDOT (wa.gov)
210.04(2)(b) WSDOT Communications Intranet Page The WSDOT Communications Intranet page provides guidance for effective communications.

210.04(2)(c) Context Sensitive Solutions and Community Involvement A proposed transportation project must consider both its physical aspects as a facility serving specific transportation objectives and its effects on the aesthetic, social, economic, and environmental values within a larger community setting. Context sensitive solutions is a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach that involves the community in the development of a project. WSDOT’s philosophy encourages collaboration and consensusbuilding as highly advantageous to all parties to help avoid delays and other costly obstacles to project implementation. WSDOT endorses the context sensitive solutions approach for all projects, large and small, from early planning through construction and eventual operation of the facility. For further information, see WSDOT Executive Order E 1028 on context sensitive solutions.

210.04(3) Legal Compliance Statements All public announcements shall include the required statements relative to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Title VI legislation. The region Communications Office and the HQ Communications Office Intranet page can provide the current version of both of these statements for legal compliance.
210.04(3)(a) ADA Compliance The ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act require WSDOT to inform the general public of its obligation to ensure programs and activities are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. For publications, the notice must provide a way to obtain the materials in alternative formats (such as Braille or taped). For public meetings and hearings, the notice must inform the public that reasonable accommodations can be made for a variety of needs. The public meeting/hearing facility must always meet minimum ADA accessibility standards (such as ramps for wheelchair access, wide corridors, and accessible rest rooms). Additionally, WSDOT must provide, upon request, reasonable accommodations to afford equal access for persons with disabilities to information, meetings, and so on. Reasonable accommodations can include services and auxiliary aids such as qualified interpreters, transcription services, assistive listening devices for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing, or additional lighting for persons with visual impairments. The WSDOT Office of Equal Opportunity can provide assistance for reasonable accommodation provisions.

Community Engagement and Hearings
210.04(3)(b) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: Environmental Justice Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that WSDOT inform the general public of its obligation to ensure that no person shall, on the grounds of race, color, and/or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise discriminated against under any of its federally funded programs and activities. See Environmental Manual Chapter 460.
210.05 Public Hearings By state and federal law, certain capital transportation projects propose actions that require a public hearing. The remainder of this chapter provides guidance on public hearing procedures. The common types of public hearings associated with WSDOT projects include environmental, design, corridor, and limited access hearings, which are discussed in subsequent sections. The guidance in this chapter covers project actions that trigger a hearing and the procedures for effectively planning, conducting, and completing the hearing process. The different types of public hearings follow similar steps for planning and preparation of project materials and information. These steps facilitate efficient reviews and approvals required for the hearing to proceed as planned. Special attention to the scheduling of deliverables and notifications leading up to the hearing help the process progress smoothly. Public hearing formats are either formal or informal. Limited access hearings are always conducted as formal hearings. An informal process can be used for most other hearings. Hearings are often conducted in accordance with NEPA/SEPA procedures for Community Engagement during the environmental documentation phase of the project. The region reviews the requirements for hearings during the early stages of project development and before completion of the draft environmental documents.
210.05(1) Coordinating the Hearing Preparing for and conducting a successful public hearing requires considerable coordination and effort. The best way to do this is by establishing a support team to identify and carry out the tasks and arrangements. It is crucial to identify and schedule tasks and deliverables well in advance of a public hearing. A project team might enlist the support of region specialists from Communications, Environmental, Government Relations, Right of Way, Real Estate, and Traffic offices, as well as the HQ Hearing Coordinator, HQ NEPA Policy staff, Office of Equal Opportunity, and others involved with the project. The following exhibits and narrative help identify whether a public hearing is required and how to prepare.
210.05(2) Selecting the Hearing Type By law, certain project actions or proposed conditions require that specific types of public hearings are conducted. Exhibit 210-1 identifies project conditions and their associated hearing requirements. If one or more of the conditions in Exhibit 210-1 occurs, a notice of opportunity for a hearing is required by federal and state law (USC Title 23 §771.111 and RCW 47.52) and by WSDOT policy. Consult the Hearing Coordinator in the HQ Access and Hearings Section, as well as project environmental specialists, for hearing requirements.

Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
210.05(3) Selecting the Hearing Format The types of public hearing formats used by WSDOT are known as formal and informal. Hearing formats are different than hearing types. In some cases, the hearing type will dictate the required format, such as with limited access hearings. The following text and Exhibit 210-2 provide guidance on formats.
210.05(3)(a) Formal Hearings A formal hearing is conducted by a moderator using a formal agenda, overseen by a hearing examiner, and recorded by a court reporter, as required by law. Limited access hearings and administrative appeal hearings require the use of the formal hearing format. For projects that require a formal public hearing, it is common for WSDOT to hold a public open house preceding the hearing. The following are required for all formal hearings:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Hearing notice with a fixed time and date (see Sections 210.05(5) and 210.05(6)) Fixed agenda and script Hearing examiner Hearing moderator (may be the hearing examiner) Court reporter Specified comment period Hearing summary (see Section 210.05(10))
In addition to providing oral comments, people can write opinions on the comment forms available at or after the hearing and submit them before the announced deadline.
210.05(3)(b) Informal Hearings An informal hearing is also known as an open format hearing. Individual oral comments are recorded by a court reporter. The presence of a hearing examiner and a formal agenda are optional. These events are typically scheduled for substantial portions of an afternoon or evening so people can drop by at their convenience and fully participate. Activities usually include attending a presentation, viewing exhibits, talking to project staff, and submitting written or oral comments. The following items are features of an open format (or informal) hearing:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
They can be scheduled to accommodate people’s work schedules. Brief presentations about the project and hearing process are advertised at preset times in the hearing notice. Presentations can be live, videotaped, or computerized. Agency or technical staff is present to answer questions and provide details of the project. Information is presented buffet-style, allowing participants access to specific information. Graphics, maps, photos, models, videos, and related documents are frequently used. People have the opportunity to clarify their comments by reviewing materials and asking questions before commenting. People can comment formally before a court reporter, or they can write opinions on comment forms and submit them before the announced deadline.
210.05(4) Hearing Preparation When region staff have determined that a formal or informal public hearing will be held, they should contact the HQ Hearing Coordinator to discuss preliminary details. The HQ Hearing Coordinator specializes in assisting with preparations for the hearing and will usually attend. Other WSDOT groups involved with the project and tasked WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Community Engagement and Hearings
with developing and implementing the Community Engagement plan can assist with hearing preparations and provide assistance at the hearing. The exhibits in this chapter can be used as checklists to identify important milestones and work products needed. Important elements include setting an initial target date for the hearing and agreeing on staff roles and responsibilities at the hearing.
210.05(4)(a) Setting the Hearing Date and Other Arrangements The Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, sets the hearing date at the recommendation of the HQ Hearing Coordinator. This is known as the order of hearing. Final arrangements for the hearing date can be handled by telephone or brief check-in meetings between the HQ Hearing Coordinator and the region. The region proposes a hearing date based on the following considerations:
•
•
•
Convenient for community participation. Contact local community and government representatives to avoid possible conflict with local activities. Consider times and locations that are most appropriate for the community. For corridor and design hearings, at least 30 days after circulation of the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) or the published notice of availability of any other environmental document. In most cases, more than 45 days after submittal of the prehearing packet.
The region makes other arrangements as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Reviews the location of the hearing hall to ensure it is easily accessed by public transportation (whenever possible), convenient for community participation, and ADA accessible. Arranges for a court reporter. Requests that the HQ Hearing Coordinator provide a hearing examiner for all limited access hearings and for other hearings, if desired. Develops a hearing agenda for all limited access hearings and for other types of hearings, if desired. If requested in response to the hearing notice, provides communication auxiliary aids and other reasonable accommodations required for persons with disabilities. Examples include interpreters for persons who are deaf; audio equipment for persons who are hard of hearing; language interpreters; and the use of guide animals and Braille or taped information for persons with visual impairments. All public hearings and meetings require the development of procedures for the collection of statistical data (race, color, sex, and national origin) on state highway program participants and beneficiaries such as relocatees, impacted citizens, and affected communities. Community Engagement Forms should be available for meeting attendees to complete. This form requests attendees to provide information on their race, ethnicity, national origin, and gender. It is available in English, Spanish, Korean, Russian, Vietnamese, and Traditional and Simplified Chinese at: https://wsdot.wa.gov/about/title-vi-limitedenglish-proficiency If demographics indicate that 5% or 1000 persons or more in the affected project area speak a language other than English, vital documents, advertisements, notices, newspapers, mailing notices, and other written and verbal media and informational materials may need to be translated into other languages to ensure social impacts to communities and people are recognized and considered throughout the transportation planning and decision-making process. In addition, language interpreters may need to be present during the hearings or public meetings to ensure individuals and minority communities are included throughout the process.

210.05(4)(b) Developing the Prehearing Packet The region prepares a prehearing packet, which contains an organized grouping of project information to be used at the hearing. The project team members and specialists enlisted to support the Community Engagement and hearing processes typically coordinate to produce the prehearing packet elements. Much of the information needed in the prehearing packet will come from the project’s Community Engagement plan. The following information is included in the prehearing packet:
i Project Background Information and Exhibits A project vicinity map and pertinent plans and exhibits for the hearing. The prehearing packet also contains a brief written narrative of the project. Usually, this narrative is already prepared and available in Project File documents, Community Engagement plans, or on a project Internet page.
ii Proposed Hearing Type, Format, and Logistics The prehearing packet identifies the type of hearing required. A hearing support team provides various planning details and helps with arrangements (date, time, place, and announcements). A public open house is often scheduled on the same day, preceding a formal hearing, to provide opportunity for community involvement.
iii News Release The region Communications Office can assist in preparing announcements for the hearing and other public events.
iv Legal Hearing Notice Notices must contain certain legal statements provided by the HQ Access and Hearings Section. (See Sections 210.05(5) and 210.05(6) for guidance on notices.)
v List of Newspapers and Other Media Sources These are the media sources used to announce the hearing. The region Communications Office has developed relations with reporters and media outlets, including minority publications and media, and is accustomed to working these issues. Enlist the office’s support for hearing preparations.
vi List of Legislators and Government Agencies Involved Special notice is sent to local officials and legislators announcing public hearings. At formal hearings, the moderator and agenda typically identify those officials so they can interact with the public. The HQ Government Relations Office can assist with identifying and notifying legislators and key legislative staff within the project area.
vii The Hearing Agenda and Script These are required for formal hearings and are prepared by the region. The HQ Access and Hearings Section can provide sample agendas and scripts to support the region in its hearing preparations. Exhibit 210-3 provides a checklist of prehearing packet contents, including additional items needed for limited access hearings.

Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
210.05(4)(c) Preparing and Sending a Prehearing Packet You should prepare a prehearing packet at least 45 days in advance of the public hearing and send it to the HQ Access and Hearings Section. The HQ Hearing Coordinator reviews and concurs with the region’s plans and recommends the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division’s approval of the hearing date. Headquarters concurrence with the prehearing packet typically requires two weeks after receipt of the information.
210.05(5) Public Hearing Notices: Purpose and Content There are two types of public notices for hearings: notice of hearing and notice of opportunity for a hearing. Consult the HQ Hearing Coordinator for specific project hearing requirements and implementation strategies.
210.05(5)(a) Notice of Hearing A notice of hearing is prepared and published when a hearing is required by law and cannot be waived.
210.05(5)(b) Notice of Opportunity for a Hearing In select cases, a notice of opportunity for a hearing is prepared and published in order to gauge the public’s interest in having a particular hearing. This kind of notice is only used if the requirements for a hearing can be legally waived. In these cases, documentation is required as set forth in Section 210.05(7).
210.05(5)(c) Content Requirements The HQ Access and Hearings Section provides sample notices to the region upon request. Public notices include statements that are required by state and federal statutes. Some important elements of a notice include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
A map or graphic identifying project location and limits. For a notice of opportunity for a hearing, include the procedures for requesting a hearing and the deadline, and note the existence of the relocation assistance program for persons or businesses displaced by the project. For an environmental, corridor, design, or combined corridor-design hearing, or for a notice of opportunity for a hearing, announce the availability of the environmental document and accessible locations. Project impacts to wetlands; flood plains; prime and unique farmlands; Section 4(f), 6(f), or 106 properties; endangered species or related habitats; or affected communities. Information on any associated prehearing presentation(s). Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VI legislation statements.
210.05(6) Publishing Hearing Notices: Procedure To advertise a legal notice of hearing or a notice of opportunity for a hearing, use the following procedure for appropriate media coverage and timing requirements: (A) Headquarters Concurrence As part of the prehearing packet, the region transmits the proposed notice and a list of the newspapers in which the notice will appear to the HQ Hearing Coordinator for concurrence prior to advertisement.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 210-15
Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
(B) Region Distribution of Hearing Notice Upon receiving Headquarters concurrence, the region distributes copies of the hearing notice and news release as follows: o Send a copy of the hearing notice and a summary project description to appropriate legislators and local officials one week before the first publication of a hearing notice. Provide the HQ Government Relations Office with a copy of all materials that will be distributed to legislators, along with a list of legislative recipients. o Advertise the hearing notice in the appropriate newspapers within one week following the mailing to legislators. The advertisement must be published in a newspaper with general circulation in the vicinity of the proposed project or with a substantial circulation in the area concerned, such as foreign language and local newspapers. If affected limited-Englishproficient populations have been identified, other foreign language newspapers may be appropriate as well. The legal notices section may be used or, preferably, a paid display advertisement in a prominent section of the newspaper, such as the local news section. With either type of advertisement, request that the newspaper provide an affidavit of publication. o Distribute the project news release to all appropriate news media about three days before the first publication of a hearing notice, using newspapers publishing the formal advertisement of the notice. o Additional methods may also be used to better reach interested or affected groups or individuals, including notifications distributed via project e-mail lists, ads in local community news media, direct mail, fliers, posters, and telephone calls. o For corridor and design hearings, the first notice publication must occur at least 30 days before the date of the hearing. The second publication must be 5 to 12 days before the date of the hearing (see Exhibit 210-4). The first notice for a corridor or design hearing shall not be advertised prior to public availability of the draft environmental document. o For limited access and environmental hearings, the notice must be published at least 15 days prior to the hearing. The timing of additional publications is optional (see Exhibit 210-5). o For a notice of opportunity for a hearing, the notice must be published once each week for two consecutive weeks. The deadline for requesting a hearing must be at least 21 days after the first date of publication and at least 14 days after the second date of publication. o A copy of the published hearing notice is sent to the HQ Hearing Coordinator at the time of publication. (C) Headquarters Distribution of Hearing Notice The HQ Hearing Coordinator sends a copy of the notice of hearing to the Transportation Commission, Attorney General’s Office, HQ Communications Office, and FHWA (if applicable). For a summary of the procedure and timing requirements, see Exhibit 210-4 (for environmental, corridor, and design hearings) or Exhibit 210-5 (for limited access hearings).

Community Engagement and Hearings
210.05(7) No Hearing Interest: Procedure and Documentation As described in Section 210.05(5), in select cases the region can satisfy certain project hearing requirements by advertising a notice of opportunity for a hearing. This procedure can be beneficial, particularly with limited access hearings in cases where very few abutting property owners are affected. If no hearing requests are received after issuing the notice of opportunity, the following procedures and documentation are required to waive a hearing.
210.05(7)(a) Corridor or Design Hearing If no requests are received for a corridor or design hearing, the region transmits a package, which includes the notice of opportunity for a hearing, the affidavit of publication of the notice, and a letter stating that there were no requests for a hearing, to the HQ Access and Hearings Section.
210.05(7)(b) Limited Access Hearing When a notice of opportunity for a hearing is used to fulfill the requirements for a limited access hearing and there are no requests for a hearing, the following steps are taken:
•
•
•
The region must secure signed hearing waivers from every abutting property owner whose access rights will be affected by the project, as well as the affected local agency. The HQ Access and Hearings Section can supply a sample waiver to the region. The Project Engineer must contact every affected property owner of record (not tenant) and the local agency to explain the proposed project. This explanation must include information on access features, right of way acquisition (if any), and the right to a hearing. Property owners must also be advised that signing the waiver will not affect their right to fair compensation for their property, nor will it affect their access rights or relocation benefits. The region transmits the original signed waivers to the HQ Access and Hearings Section, along with the affidavit of publication of the notice of opportunity for a limited access hearing and a recommendation for approval of the right of way plan. Once the completed package is received by the HQ Access and Hearings Section, it is submitted to the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, for review and approval.
210.05(7)(c) Environmental Hearing Environmental hearings cannot use the process of waivers to satisfy project hearing requirements.
210.05(8) Prehearing Briefs and Readiness After publication of a hearing notice, the region should expect to receive public requests for information and project briefings, including requests for information in languages other than English.
210.05(8)(a) Presentation of Material for Inspection and Copying The information outlined in the hearing notice and other engineering and environmental studies, as well as information intended to be presented at the hearing, must be made available for public review and copying throughout the period between the first advertisement and the approval of the hearing summary or findings and order. The information may also need to be available in languages other than English if indicated by demographics. The information need not be in final form, but it must include every item currently included in the hearing presentation. The environmental documents must also be available for public review.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 210-17
Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
These materials are made available in the general locality of the project. The region reviews the variables (the locations of the Project Office and project site; the interested individuals; and the probability of requests for review) and selects a mutually convenient site for the presentation of the information. In accordance with RCW 42.56, a record should be kept for future evidence, stating who came in, when, and what data they reviewed and copied.
210.05(8)(b) Hearing Briefing On controversial projects, the HQ Hearing Coordinator arranges for a briefing (held before the hearing) for those interested in the project. Attendants typically include appropriate Headquarters, region, and FHWA personnel, with special notice to the Secretary of Transportation. Region personnel present the briefing.
210.05(8)(c) Prehearing Presentation The region is encouraged to give an informal presentation to the public for discussion of the project prior to the hearing. A prehearing presentation is informal, with ample opportunity for exchange of information between WSDOT and the public. Providing community members with opportunities to talk about their concerns in advance of the hearing promotes positive public relationships and can make the actual hearing proceed more smoothly. Prehearing presentations can be open house meetings, drop-in centers, workshops, or other formats identified in the Community Engagement plan. The prehearing presentation is usually held about one week before the hearing for more controversial projects, modified as needed. Include the date, time, and place in the hearing notice and ensure it is mailed in time to give adequate notice of the prehearing presentation.
210.05(9) Conducting the Hearing The hearing is facilitated by the Regional Administrator or a designee. Normally, a hearing examiner is used when significant controversy or considerable Community Engagement is anticipated. A hearing examiner is required for limited access hearings. A verbatim transcript of the proceedings is made by a court reporter. Hearings are generally more informative and gain more public participation when an informal format is used, where people’s views and opinions are openly sought in a casual and personal way. The informal hearing format may be used for all hearings except limited access hearings. At least one court reporter is required to take individual testimony. Use displays, exhibits, maps, and tables, and have knowledgeable staff available to answer specific questions about the proposed project. It is the responsibility of the hearing moderator and other department representatives to be responsive to all reasonable and appropriate questions. If a question or proposal is presented at the limited access hearing that can only be answered at a later date, the region shall reserve an exhibit to respond to the comment in the findings and order. The hearing moderator must not allow any person to be harassed or subjected to unreasonable cross-examination.
210.05(9)(a) Hearing Agenda Items For all limited access hearings, and for other formal hearings, the region prepares a hearing agenda to ensure all significant items are addressed. A hearing agenda includes the following:

Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
i Opening Statement
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Highway and project name. Purpose of hearing. Description of how the hearing will be conducted. Introduction of elected officials. Federal/State/County/City relationship. Statutory requirements being fulfilled by the hearing. Status of the project with regard to NEPA/SEPA documents. Description of information available for review and copying. For environmental, corridor, or design hearings, notice that written statements and other exhibits can be submitted during the open record period following the hearing. Statement that all who want to receive written notification of WSDOT’s action as a result of the hearing may add their names to the interest list or file a notice of appearance for limited access hearings.
ii Project History Present a brief project history, including purpose and need for the project, Community Engagement program, future hearing opportunities, and hearings held.
iii Presentation of Plans Develop alternatives that include comparable levels of detail and present them equally. Include the noaction alternative. Refer to any supporting studies that are available to the public. Identify a preliminary preferred alternative, if selected by WSDOT, for more detailed development. When a preliminary preferred alternative has been identified, stress that it is subject to revision and reevaluation based on public comments, additional studies, and other information that may become available.
iv Environmental, Social, and Economic Discussion Discuss all positive and negative environmental, social, and economic effects (or summarize the major effects) and refer to the environmental documentation.
v Statements, Plans, or Counterproposals from the Public Accept public views or statements regarding the proposal presented, the alternatives, and the social, economic, and environmental effects identified. Avoid evaluating the views presented while conducting the hearing.
vi Relocation Assistance Program Explain the relocation assistance program and relocation assistance payments available. At all hearings, the relocation assistance brochure must be available for free distribution, including (if appropriate) brochures in languages other than English. Real Estate Services personnel should be available. If the project does not require any relocations, the relocation assistance discussion may be omitted. Make a simple statement to the effect that relocation assistance is provided, but currently no relocations have been identified for the project. The relocation brochure and personnel should still be available to the public at the hearing.

Community Engagement and Hearings
vii Acquisition Discuss right of way acquisition, estimated cost, and currently proposed construction schedules and critical activities that may involve or affect the public.
viii Closing Summarize the hearing and announce proposed future actions.
ix Adjournment Adjourn the hearing with sincere gratitude for the public’s valuable participation.
210.05(10) Hearing Summary and Adoption Upon completion of a public hearing, a documentation and approval procedure leads to official adoption of the hearing proceedings. After the hearing, a summary is prepared by the region. There are two types of summary documents used, depending on the type of hearing. For environmental, corridor, and design hearings, a hearing summary is produced. Following a limited access hearing, a findings and order document is prepared. Each of these packages is comprised of documentation assembled by the region and approved by Headquarters.
210.05(10)(a) Hearing Summary Contents The hearing summary includes the following elements: 1. Hearing transcript. 2. Copy of the affidavit of publication of the hearing notice. 3. Hearing material: o Copies of the letters received before and after the hearing. o Copies or photographs of, or references to, every exhibit used in the hearing. 4. Summary and analyses of all oral and written comments. Include consideration of the positive and negative social, economic, and environmental aspects of these comments.
210.05(10)(b) Limited Access Hearing Findings and Order Following a limited access hearing, the “summary” document is labeled the findings and order. Refer to Section 210.09(12) for the process description and required documentation for findings and order documents.
210.05(10)(c) Adoption and Approval For specific hearing types, see subsequent sections in this chapter related to adoption procedures. Exhibit 210-6 identifies the Headquarters approval authority for hearing summary and findings and order documents.
210.06 Environmental Hearing Early coordination with appropriate agencies and the public may help to determine the appropriate level of environmental documentation, the scope of the document, the level of analysis, and related environmental disciplines to be analyzed. Environmental documents address the positive and negative social, economic, and environmental project effects, as described in Chapter 225 and the Environmental Manual. The project environmental documentation is the first step in the environmental hearing procedure. Each step of the hearing procedure is dovetailed into the environmental process and is important in achieving the appropriate project documentation. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 210-20
Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
Corridor and design hearings are not normally required for Environmental Assessments, SEPA Checklists, and categorically excluded projects. However, the opportunity for an environmental hearing might be required or advisable for controversial proposals. When an environmental hearing is not required, an informational meeting may serve as a useful forum for Community Engagement in the environmental process. Consult with region environmental staff and the HQ Hearing Coordinator for specific project requirements. Projects requiring an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) must use an evaluation process called scoping in the NEPA and SEPA requirements. This process helps the project proponents identify the significant issues and possible alternatives analyzed and documented in the Draft EIS, and it must follow the Community Engagement plan included in the environmental study plan for the project. After the project has been thoroughly analyzed through the environmental evaluation process and discussed within the community using informal Community Engagement methods, a hearing is held to present and gather testimony. The hearing is timed to fall within the comment period for the Draft EIS. For an environmental hearing, the hearing notice must be published at least 15 days prior to the hearing. The timing of additional publications is optional (see Exhibit 210-4). Responses to comments on the Draft EIS must be addressed in the Final EIS.
210.06(1) Environmental Hearing Summary The environmental hearing summary includes the items outlined in Section 210.05(10).
210.06(2) Adoption of Environmental Hearing Chapter 225 and the Environmental Manual provide guidance on NEPA and SEPA procedures, documentation requirements, and approvals.
210.07 Corridor Hearing A corridor hearing is a public hearing that:
•
•
•
Is held before WSDOT is committed to a preferred alternative establishing the final route corridor. Is held to ensure opportunity is afforded for effective participation by interested persons in the process of determining the need for and location of a state highway. Provides the public an opportunity to present views on the social, economic, and environmental effects of the proposed alternative highway corridors.
A corridor hearing is required if any of the following project actions would occur:
•
•
•
Proposed route on new location. Substantial social, economic, or environmental impacts. Significant change in layout or function of connecting roads or streets.
When a corridor hearing is held, the region must provide enough design detail on the proposed alignment(s) within the corridor(s) that an informed presentation can be made at the hearing. Justification to abandon an existing corridor must also be presented. For general procedures and notification requirements, see Section 210.05 and Exhibit 210-4.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 210-21
Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
210.07(1) Corridor Hearing Summary After the hearing, the region:
•
•
•
•
Reviews the hearing transcript. Responds to all questions or proposals submitted at or subsequent to the hearing. Compiles a corridor hearing summary. Transmits three copies (four copies for Interstate projects) to the HQ Access and Hearings Section.
When appropriate, the hearing summary may be included in the FEIS. If not included, submit the complete corridor hearing summary to the HQ Access and Hearings Section within approximately two months following the hearing. The corridor hearing summary includes the items outlined in Section 210.05(10).
210.07(2) Adoption of Corridor Hearing Summary The HQ Access and Hearings Section prepares a package that contains the corridor hearing summary and a formal description of the project and forwards it to the Assistant Secretary, Engineering & Regional Operations, for adoption. The HQ Hearing Coordinator notifies the region when adoption has occurred and returns an approved copy to the region.
210.08 Design Hearing A design hearing is a public hearing that:
•
•
Is held after a route corridor is established and approved, but before final design of a highway is engineered. Is held to ensure an opportunity is afforded for the public to present its views on each proposed design alternative, including the social, economic, and environmental effects of those designs.
A design hearing is required if any of the following project actions will occur:
•
•
•
Substantial social, economic, or environmental impacts. Significant change in layout or function of connecting roads or streets. Acquisition of a significant amount of right of way results in relocation of individuals, groups, or institutions.
For general procedures and notification requirements, see Section 210.05 and Exhibit 210-4.
210.08(1) Design Hearing Summary The design hearing summary includes the elements outlined in Section 210.05(10). Submit the complete hearing summary to the HQ Access and Hearings Section within approximately two months following the hearing. If new studies or additional data are required subsequent to the hearing, the region compiles the information in coordination with the HQ Design Office.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 210-22
Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
210.08(2) Adoption of Design Hearing Summary After the hearing, the region reviews the hearing transcript, responds to all questions or proposals submitted at or subsequent to the hearing, compiles a hearing summary, and transmits three copies (four copies for Interstate projects) to the HQ Access and Hearings Section. When appropriate, the design hearing summary may be included in the final environmental document. The HQ Access and Hearings Section prepares a formal document that identifies and describes the project and submits it to the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, for approval. One approved copy is returned to the region. The HQ Hearing Coordinator notifies the region that adoption has occurred. On Interstate projects, the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, (or designee) submits the approved design hearing summary to the FHWA for federal approval. If possible, this submittal is timed to coincide with the submittal of the Design Decision Summary to the FHWA.
210.08(3) Public Notification of Action Taken The region prepares a formal response to individuals who had unresolved questions at the hearing. The region keeps the public advised regarding the result(s) of the hearing process, such as project adoption or revision to the plan. A project newsletter sent to those on the interest list is an effective method of notification. Project news items can be sent via e-mail or by more traditional methods.
210.09 Limited Access Hearing Limited access hearings are required by law (per RCW 47.52) whenever limited access is established or revised on new or existing highways. Decisions concerning limited access hearings are made on a project-by-project basis by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, based on information that includes the recommendations submitted by the region (see Chapter 510, Chapter 520, Chapter 530, and Chapter 540). Limited access hearing procedures generally follow those identified in Section 210.05; however, several unique products and notifications are also prepared. These include limited access hearing plans and notifications sent to abutting property owners and local jurisdictions. (See Section 210.09(4) and Exhibit 210-3 for a listing of these products.) Exhibit 210-5 presents a summary of the limited access hearing procedures. Prior to the limited access hearing (RCW 47.52.131), discussions with the local jurisdictions shall be held on the merits of the limited access report and the limited access hearing plan(s). These are required exhibits for the limited access hearing. (See Chapter 530 for guidance on limited access reports.) The following information applies only to limited access hearings and procedures for approval of the findings and order.
210.09(1) Hearing Examiner The HQ Access and Hearings Section hires an administrative law judge from the Office of Administrative Hearings to conduct the limited access hearing.
210.09(2) Order of Hearing The order of hearing officially establishes the hearing date. The Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, approves the order of hearing. The HQ Hearing Coordinator then notifies the region, the Attorney General’s Office, and the hearing examiner of the official hearing date.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
210.09(3) Limited Access Hearing Plan The region prepares a limited access hearing plan to be used as an exhibit at the formal hearing and forwards it to the HQ Plans Engineer for review and approval approximately 45 days before the hearing. This is a Phase 2 Plan (see Chapter 510). The HQ Plans Engineer schedules the approval of the limited access hearing plan on the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division’s calendar.
210.09(4) Limited Access Hearing Information to Abutters The region prepares an information packet that must be mailed to abutters, and other entities as specified below, at least 15 days prior to the hearing and concurrent with advertisement of the hearing notice. These items are elements of the prehearing packet as described in Section 210.05(4)(b) and in Exhibit 210-3. If some of the limited access hearing packets are returned as undeliverable, the region must make every effort to communicate with the property owners. The limited access hearing packet for abutters contains the following:
•
•
•
Limited access hearing plan Limited access hearing notice Notice of appearance
The region also sends the limited access hearing packet to:
•
•
•
•
The county and/or city. The owners of property listed on the county tax rolls as abutting the section of highway, road, or street being considered at the hearing as a limited access facility. Local agencies and public officials who have requested a notice of hearing or who, by the nature of their functions, objectives, or responsibilities, are interested in or affected by the proposal. Every agency, organization, official, or individual on the interest list.
The limited access hearing packet is also sent, when applicable, to:
•
•
•
•
•
State resource, recreation, and planning agencies. Tribal governments. Appropriate representatives of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Other federal agencies. Public advisory groups.
210.09(5) Affidavit of Service by Mailing The region prepares an affidavit of service by mailing. This affidavit states that the limited access hearing packet was mailed at least 15 days prior to the hearing and that it will be entered into the record at the hearing.
210.09(6) Limited Access Hearing Plan Revisions The limited access hearing plan cannot be revised after the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division (or designee), approves the plan without rescheduling the hearing. If significant revisions to the plan become necessary during the period between the approval and the hearing, the revisions can be made and must be entered into the record as a revised (red and green) plan at the hearing. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 210-24
Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
210.09(7) Limited Access Hearing Notice The limited access hearing notice must be published at least 15 calendar days before the hearing. This is a legal requirement, and the hearing must be rescheduled if the advertising deadline is not met. Publication and notice requirements are the same as those required in Section 210.05, except that the statutory abutter mailing must be mailed after notification to the appropriate legislators.
210.09(8) Notice of Appearance The HQ Hearing Coordinator transmits the notice of appearance form to the region. Anyone wanting to receive a copy of the findings and order and the adopted right of way and limited access plan must complete a notice of appearance form and return it to WSDOT either at the hearing or by mail.
210.09(9) Reproduction of Plans The HQ Hearing Coordinator submits the hearing plans for reproduction at least 24 days prior to the hearing. The reproduced plans are sent to the region at least 17 days before the hearing, for mailing to the abutters at least 15 days before the hearing.
210.09(10) Limited Access Hearing Exhibits The region retains the limited access hearing exhibits until preparation of the draft findings and order is complete. The region then submits all the original hearing exhibits and three copies to the HQ Access and Hearings Section as part of the findings and order package. Any exhibits submitted directly to Headquarters are sent to the region for inclusion with the region’s submittal.
210.09(11) Limited Access Hearing Transcript The court reporter furnishes the original limited access hearing transcript to the region. The region forwards the transcript to the hearing examiner, or presiding authority, for signature certifying that the transcript is complete. The signed original and three copies are returned to the region for inclusion in the findings and order package.
210.09(12) Findings and Order The findings and order is a document containing the findings and conclusions of a limited access hearing, based entirely on the evidence in the hearing record. The region reviews a copy of the transcript from the court reporter and prepares a findings and order package. The package is sent to the HQ Access and Hearings Section. The findings and order package contains:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The draft findings and order. Draft responses to comments (reserved exhibits). A draft findings and order Plan as modified from the hearing plan. All limited access hearing exhibits: originals and three copies. The limited access hearing transcript: original and three copies. The notice of appearance forms. Estimate of the number of copies of the final findings and order plan and text the region will need for the mailing.

Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
210.09(13) Adoption of Findings and Order The Assistant Secretary, Engineering & Regional Operations, adopts the findings and order based on the evidence introduced at the hearing and any supplemental exhibits. Following adoption of the findings and order, the HQ Plans Section makes the necessary revisions to the limited access hearing plan, which then becomes the findings and order plan. The HQ Access and Hearings Section arranges for reproduction of the findings and order plan and the findings and order text and transmits them to the region. The region mails a copy of the findings and order plan and the findings and order text to all parties that filed a notice of appearance and to all local governmental agencies involved. Subsequent to this mailing, the region prepares an affidavit of service by mailing and transmits it to the HQ Access and Hearings Section. At the time of mailing, but before publication of the résumé, the region notifies the appropriate legislators of WSDOT’s action.
210.09(14) Résumé The résumé is an official notification of action taken by WSDOT following adoption of a findings and order. The HQ Access and Hearings Section provides the résumé to the region. The region must publish the résumé once each week for two consecutive weeks, not to begin until at least ten days after the mailing of the findings and order.
210.09(15) Final Establishment of Access Control When the findings and order is adopted, the findings and order plan becomes a Phase 4 Plan (see Chapter 510). The establishment of access control becomes final 30 days from the date the findings and order is mailed by the region, as documented by the affidavit of service by mailing.
210.09(16) Appeal Process An appeal from the county or city must be in the form of a written disapproval, submitted to the Secretary of Transportation, requesting a hearing before a board of review. An appeal from abutting property owners must be filed in the Superior Court of the state of Washington, in the county where the limited access facility is to be located and shall affect only those specific ownerships. The plan is final for all other ownerships.
210.10 Combined Hearings A combined hearing often alleviates the need to schedule separate hearings to discuss similar information. A combined hearing is desirable when the timing for circulation of the draft environmental document is simultaneous with the timing for corridor and design hearings and when all alternative designs are available for each alternative corridor. When deciding whether to combine hearings, consider:
•
•
•
•
Whether there is controversy. Whether alternative corridors are proposed. The nature of the environmental concerns. The benefits to the public of a combined hearing.

Community Engagement and Hearings
210.11 Administrative Appeal Hearing Administrative appeal hearings apply only to managed access highways, are conducted as formal hearings, and are initiated by a property owner seeking to appeal a decision made to restrict or remove an access connection. This is also known as an adjudicative proceeding, and the procedure is presented in Chapter 540.
210.12 Follow-Up Hearing A new hearing or the opportunity for a hearing is required for any previously held hearing when any one of the following occurs (USC 23, §771.111):
•
•
•
•
Major actions (such as adoption of findings and order and approval of hearing summaries) did not occur within three years following the date the last hearing was held or the opportunity for a hearing was afforded. A substantial change occurs in the area affected by the proposal (due to unanticipated development, for example). A substantial change occurs in a proposal for which an opportunity for a hearing was previously advertised or a hearing was held. A significant social, economic, or environmental effect is identified that was not considered at earlier hearings.

225.01 General The term “environmental documentation” refers to the documents produced for a project to satisfy the requirements contained in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). The Environmental Manual and supporting web pages provide detailed instructions on how to determine what level of documentation is required and how to prepare the documents. This chapter provides a summary of the relevant provisions in the Environmental Manual. The purpose of the environmental document is to provide decision makers, agencies, and the public with information on a project’s environmental impacts, alternatives to the proposed action, and mitigation measures to reduce unavoidable impacts. Final environmental documents identify and evaluate the project to be constructed. Because projects vary in their level of environmental impacts, the rules on environmental documentation allow for different levels of documentation. As a project’s impacts increase, so does the level of documentation. The region Environmental Office and the NEPA/SEPA Compliance Section of the Headquarters Environmental Services Office routinely provide environmental documentation assistance to designers and project engineers.
225.02 Determining the Environmental Documentation The Environmental Review Summary (ERS) provides the first indication of what form the environmental documentation will take. The ERS is developed as part of the Project Summary, which is prepared during the scoping or pre-design phase of all projects in the construction program. The Project Summary (see Chapter 300 for additional information) includes three components:
•
•
•
Project Profile Basis of Design Environmental Review Summary
The ERS is part of the Project Summary database. The ERS describes the potential environmental impacts, proposed mitigation, and necessary permits for a project. It establishes the initial environmental classification and identifies the key environmental elements to be addressed in the NEPA/SEPA process. The ERS database includes fully integrated “Help” screens. Contact your region Program Management Office to get set up to work in the database. Completing an ERS to determine the level of environmental documentation may begin once the project has been identified and basic environmental impacts to both physical and human environment can be assessed using preliminary project details. The region completes the ERS based best available information at the scoping or pre-design phase of development. The region Environmental Manager then approves the ERS, which enables the completed form to be included in the Project Summary package.

Chapter 225
Environmental Coordination
For many projects, the WSDOT Geographic Information System (GIS) Workbench coupled with a potential site visit provides sufficient information to fill out the ERS (see the GIS Workbench online Help).
225.02(1) Environmental Justice (New Section 2023) Environmental Justice (EJ), as obligated in Presidential Executive Order 12898, seeks to eradicate, mitigate, and avoid disproportionately high and adverse effects to low income and minorities, and Indian tribes during the NEPA process. Projects subject to NEPA that may adversely impact low income and minority populations may be required to conduct an EJ analysis. At the state level, the Healthy Environment for All Act (HEAL Act) addresses disproportionate environmental and health impacts in all laws, rules, and policies by prioritizing vulnerable populations and overburdened communities, the equitable distribution of resources and benefits, and eliminating harm. The federal definition of EJ means the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, rules, and policies. The HEAL Act broadens the definition of environmental justice, focuses attention on environmental health impacts and requires WSDOT to conduct an environmental justice assessment for significant actions (i.e., a project with a budget equal to or greater than $15M). Conduct an EJ assessment1 for WSDOT projects when the combined budget for all phases (PE, RW, and CN) are equal to or greater than $15 Million and when starting planning, or pre-design on or after July 1, 2023, regardless of whether the project’s impacts are expected to have adverse environmental impacts on overburdened communities and vulnerable populations. Evaluate ongoing projects with a combined budget equal to or greater than $15 Million that initiate a NEPA Re-Evaluation to determine whether an EJ assessment is required (contact Region Environmental Office for more information). A major component of EJ compliance is community engagement with the public and all communities potentially affected by the project. All projects are encouraged to have meaningful and inclusive project-specific community engagement with all members of the community potentially affected to better provide access to our decisionmaking processes (see Chapter 210 for more information). For more information about EJ compliance and obligations associated with the HEAL Act, see WSDOT Environmental Manual: Chapter 460 or contact the region’s environmental office.

Note: An EJ assessment as required by the HEAL Act is different from an EJ analysis required for federally funded projects under NEPA. A project may be required to conduct both. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 225
Environmental Coordination
225.02(2) Other Environmental Documentation Requirements (NEW Section 2023) As part of a project’s environmental documentation, there are other documents that may be required to demonstrate compliance with applicable federal and state laws. These may include Section 106 of the National Historical Preservation Act, Endangered Species Act, etc. Contact the region Environmental Office and Environmental Manual for more information.
225.03 Identifying the Project Classification Based on the environmental considerations identified during preparation of the ERS, WSDOT projects are classified for NEPA/SEPA purposes to determine the type of environmental documentation required. Projects with a federal nexus (i.e., using federal funds, involving federal lands, or requiring federal approvals or permits) are subject to NEPA and SEPA. Projects that are state funded only, with no federal nexus, follow SEPA guidelines. Since many WSDOT projects are prepared with the intent of obtaining federal funding, NEPA guidelines are usually followed. (Environmental Manual Chapters 300 and 400 and the Federal Nexus Requirements table on the NEPA & SEPA webpage provide more information on federal nexus and NEPA class of.) For most WSDOT projects, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is the lead agency for NEPA. Depending on the action, other federal agencies that may serve as NEPA lead are the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, and Federal Transit Administration. WSDOT follows the NEPA and associated documentation process required by the federal lead agency. If a project has been determined to be an FHWA Categorical Exclusion (CE), the Environmental Classification Summary (ECS) is completed by the Environmental office. The NEPA environmental review process is considered complete when the region Environmental Manager approves the ECS package and provides it to the PE Office. If it is determined that an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required, the region evaluates the project schedule and arranges for preparation of the appropriate document. Environmental Manual Chapter 400 provides additional information on completing NEPA documentation. For SEPA, WSDOT’s procedures align NEPA and SEPA so that WSDOT’s NEPA documentation meets the requirements of SEPA. If a project does not trigger NEPA, then WSDOT will still need to comply with SEPA requirements. The SEPA process is complete when the appropriate categorical exemption is identified, or the appropriate public comment period has ended and SEPA decision has been adopted. Environmental Manual Chapter 400 provides additional information on completing SEPA documentation.
225.04 Environmental Commitment File As an initial part of project development, the region establishes a project commitment file. It is WSDOT policy that a project commitment file be established as soon as the preparation of environmental documentation begins. The file consists of proposed mitigation measures; commitments made to regulatory agencies, tribes, and other stakeholders; and other documented commitments made on the project. Further commitment types (right of way, maintenance, and so on) may be added at the region’s discretion. The Region/Mode/Megaprograms Environmental Office is responsible for creating and maintaining the commitment file as a project progresses through its development process. Whenever commitments are made, they are incorporated into project documents and added to the environmental commitment file once they are finalized.

WSDOT has a Commitment Tracking System (CTS) to organize and track commitments from the commitment file. Refer to the Environmental Manual (Chapter 490) for policies associated with tracking commitments.
225.05 Environmental Permits and Approvals WSDOT projects are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental permits and approvals. Performing field work in support of the project design may also require environmental permits or approvals. Understanding and anticipating what permits and approvals may be required for a particular project type will assist the designer in project delivery. Thehttps://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/designtopics/environment/environmental-permits-approvals Environmental Guidance webpage provides guidance on the applicability of permits and approvals by environmental discipline. Because the facts of each project vary and the environmental regulations are complex, reliance on either the Design Manual or the Environmental Manual is insufficient. Consult region/mode/megaprograms environmental staff. The Environmental Review Summary (ERS), which is prepared as part of the Project Summary, identifies some of the most common environmental permits that might be required based on the information known at that stage. As the project design develops, additional permits and approvals can be identified. Conducting project site visits for engineering and environmental features may reduce project delays caused by late discoveries. Coordinate with and communicate any project changes to region environmental staff. The permit process begins well in advance of the actual permit application. For some permits, WSDOT has already negotiated permit conditions through the use of programmatic and general permits. These permits typically apply to repetitive, relatively simple projects, and the permit conditions apply regardless of the actual facts of the project type. For complex projects, the negotiations with permit agencies often begin during the environmental documentation phase for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). The mitigation measures developed for the NEPA/SEPA documents are captured as permit conditions on the subsequent permits.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 225-4
Chapter 225
Environmental Coordination
Environmental permits require information prepared during the design phase to demonstrate compliance with environmental rules, regulations, and policies. To avoid delays in project delivery, it is necessary for the designer to understand and anticipate this exchange of information. The timing of this exchange often affects design schedules, while the permit requirements can affect the design itself. In complex cases, the negotiations over permit conditions can result in iterative designs as issues are raised and resolved. Continuously consult region /mode/megaprograms environmental staff to help avoid delays in project delivery. The Project Engineer is encouraged to meet with and discuss expectations with support groups so that preliminary field investigations are conducted in compliance with environmental permits, agreements, laws, or regulations. At a minimum, the support groups should know how to access the environmental commitments for the project and determine which ones apply to their work. If a non-compliance event occurs, coordinate with support groups so that they know to initiate the Environmental Compliance Assurance Procedure (see Section 225.05(1) for details).
225.05(1) Environmental Compliance During Design Phase The purpose of the Environmental Compliance Assurance Procedure (ECAP) is to recognize and rectify environmental non-compliance events during all phases of the project development process including the Design phase. The ECAP provides prompt notification to WSDOT management and regulatory agencies. For purposes of ECAP, non-compliance events are defined as actions that violate environmental permits, agreements, laws, or regulations. Responsibilities for field work during design phase. 1. PE or designee: o Step A - Takes the necessary actions so that appropriate environmental documentation and permits are obtained for field work during the PE phase o Step B - Provides permits and communicates permit conditions to support groups performing field work (Geotechnical, Utilities, Environmental, etc.) 2. The Environmental Manager or designee will help generate or make accessible the appropriate environmental documentation and permits. 3. Support Group / Field Crew is responsible for permit compliance, including the following: o Confirming they have all the permits, and understanding of the permit conditions prior to beginning work o Evaluating field operations, including access to specific locations, and developing work plans so that permit conditions are met (Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control (TESC), etc.) o Recognizing and identifying non-compliance issues. o Notifying the PE and Environmental Manager when non-compliance issues/events happen. When non-compliance is suspected or known, it is the Project Engineer’s (PE) responsibility to initiate the Notification and Resolution Process below. The Regional Environmental Manager will serve as a resource to the PE and give priority to addressing the non-compliance event. The PE and Environmental Manager shall work together on an appropriate response to avoid or minimize environmental damage.

225.05(1)(a) Notification and Resolution Process When non-compliance occurs or is suspected, the following steps are taken: 1. The person/support group who discovers an event shall immediately notify the PE. 2. The PE or designee shall:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Step A – Inform the field crew to suspend all work that is causing non-compliance. Step B – Immediately contact the Environmental Manager or designee to help determine if it is or is not a non-compliance event. (Note: if event is compliant; stop the notification process and resume work activity). Step C - If non-compliant, collaborate with the Environmental Manager to determine the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction. Notify all regulatory agencies with jurisdiction. Step D – Consult with the Environmental Manager regarding response actions taken so far and any additional remediation actions that may be necessary. Step E– Notify the appropriate Assistant Region Administrator or Engineering Manager for Design and the Assistant State Design Engineer assigned to that Region or Project. Step F – Additional notifications (see F.1 and F.2 below) from the PE are necessary when the non-compliance event: o Results in a formal written/verbal enforcement action from a regulatory agency or o Presents significant risk to public health or o Presents significant risk to the environment or o Creates a public controversy. (The Region decides what “public controversy” means.) Step F.1 – Region Highway Projects: Notify the Region Administrator (give a courtesy notification to the Assistant State Design Engineer assigned to the project). Step F.2 – Mega Projects Highway Projects: Notify the Mega Project’s Program Administrator (give a courtesy notification to the Assistant State Design Engineer assigned to the project).
3. The Region Administrator, Assistant State Design Engineer, and/or Mega Projects Program Administrator shall notify the appropriate agency executives as warranted by the situation. 4. The Environmental Manager or designee shall:
•
•
•
Step A – Notify the Director of the Environmental Services Office (ESO) when the noncompliance event: o results in a formal written/verbal enforcement action from a regulatory agency; o presents significant risk to public health or o presents significant risk to the environment or o creates a public controversy. (The Region decides what “public controversy” means) Step B - Assist the PE in determining and recognizing the underlying root cause(s) that resulted in the non-compliant event and determining how to prevent a reoccurrence of the event. Step C - In consultation with the PE, identify and obtain new or modified permits, approvals, or agreements as needed to rectify the non-compliance event.
5. The Director of the ESO shall notify the ESO Compliance Solutions Branch Manager.

This chapter presents critical information for design teams, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
WSDOT’s Project Development process. Design documentation tools, procedures, and records retention policy. Major Project approvals including Design Approval, Project Development Approval, Basis of Design, Design Analysis, and other specific project documents for design-bid-build and for design-build delivery methods. FHWA oversight and approvals. Information about conducting project process reviews. Additional references and resources.
For local agency and developer projects on state highways, design documentation is also needed. It is retained by the region office responsible for the project oversight, in accordance with the WSDOT records retention policy. All participants in the design process are to provide the appropriate documentation for their decisions. See Section 300.04(3) for information about the approval process and authority. For more information about these types of projects, see Chapter 1130 and the Local Agency Guidelines.
300.02 WSDOT Project Delivery A project is developed in accordance with all applicable procedures, Executive Orders, Directives, Instructional Letters, Supplements, manuals, and the FHWA/WSDOT Stewardship and Oversight Agreement. A project can be influenced by separate plans or studies such as the Washington State Highway System Plan, corridor sketches, planning studies, Field Assessments, and scoping phase documentation.
300.02(1) Project Delivery Method The project delivery method pertains to WSDOT projects and may vary depending on project type and cost. Preservation projects with an overall project cost of $10 million and over, and all other projects with an overall project cost of $2 million and over, are required to go through the Project Delivery Method Selection process. The overall project cost is the total of the Preliminary Engineering, Right of Way, and Construction costs. Project Delivery Method Selection, described below, applies only to WSDOT projects and is not meant to be applied to local agency or developer projects that occur within WSDOT’s jurisdiction. Project Delivery Method Selection also does not apply to projects that WSDOT is asked to design and/or construct on behalf of another funding entity. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 300-1
Chapter 300
Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
WSDOT primarily uses two delivery methods: Design-bid-build (DBB) and design-build (DB). DBB is considered the traditional project delivery method where a project office puts together a complete set of plans, specifications, and estimate (PS&E) that is advertised for contractors to bid on. The project is constructed by a contractor in accordance with the PS&E and WSDOT provides construction oversight. For DB projects, the WSDOT develops a request for proposal (RFP) that includes a basic configuration for the project and a Conceptual Design Approval. The RFP is published, and a contractor is selected. The contractor is responsible for the design, project construction, and final Design Documentation Package. Design-build’s typical application is for improvement projects in the mobility, economic initiatives, or environmental subprograms where there are opportunities for innovation, greater efficiencies, or significant savings in project delivery time. For all projects, the delivery method is determined using WSDOT Project Delivery Method Selection Guidance (PDMSG) with the following exceptions:
•
•
Projects under $2 million are programmatically exempt from PDMSG, do not require a Project Delivery Method Selection Checklist, and will be DBB. Preservation Paving projects under $10 million are programmatically exempt from PDMSG, do not require a Project Delivery Method Selection Checklist, and will be DBB.
300.02(2) Environmental Requirements WSDOT uses the Environmental Review Summary (ERS) portion of the Project Summary to scope environmental impacts associated with the proposed project and document the anticipated environmental class of action (Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Assessment/Categorical Exclusion). Projects that have only state funds must have State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) documentation. Projects involving a federal action in any phase of the project require National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation. On National Highway System (NHS) routes, a Design Analysis involving one of the controlling criteria (see Section 300.05(2)) is a federal action. Upon receipt of the ERS approval for projects requiring an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement under NEPA, the region proceeds with environmental documentation, including Community Engagement, appropriate for the magnitude and type of the project. The environmental approval levels are shown in Exhibit 301-3. Refer to your Region Environmental Office and Chapter 225 for more information.
300.02(3) Real Estate Acquisition Design Approval and approval of right of way plans are required prior to acquiring property. A temporary construction easement may be acquired prior to Design Approval for State funded projects and with completion of NEPA for Federally funded projects. For early acquisition of right of way, consult the Real Estate Services Office, the April 2, 2013 memorandum on early acquisition policy, and Right of Way Manual Chapter 6-3.
300.02(4) Low-Cost Enhancements (Moved from General and Rewritten 2023) For operational changes identified by the Traffic Office as part of the Low-Cost Enhancement or Field Assessment Program that are included in a project, the project documentation will be provided by the Region Traffic Office in the form of a QBOD (Q program Basis of Design) with the Region Traffic Engineer as the approval authority. The QBOD is included in the project documentation along with the project’s BOD and retained in accordance with the WSDOT records retention policy. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 300-2
Chapter 300
Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
Design elements requested by the Low-Cost Enhancement or Field Assessment programs that are outside of the range of values provided in the Design Manual will require a Design Analysis. The Region Traffic Office will prepare the Design Analysis and obtain approvals in accordance with Exhibit 300-2.
300.02(5) Emergency Projects (Moved from General and Added to 2023) For emergency projects, also refer to the Emergency Funding Manual. It provides the legal and procedural guidelines for WSDOT employees to prepare all necessary documentation to respond to, and recover from, emergencies and disasters that affect the operations of the department. Emergency projects are required to acquire Project Development Approval in accordance with this chapter. Since the scope of an emergency project can vary greatly, contact your ASDE to determine the scale of this effort.
300.03 Design Documentation 300.03(1) Purpose Design documentation records the evaluations and decisions by the various disciplines that result in design recommendations. Design assumptions and decisions made prior to and during the scoping phase are included. Changes that occur throughout project development are documented. Required justifications and approvals are also included. All original technical documents must bear the certification of the responsible licensee as listed in Executive Order E 1010
300.03(2) Design Decisions Throughout the Design Manual, the terms consider, document, justify, and Design Analysis are used. These terms indicate a scaled level of documenting a design decision. The lowest level of documentation is consider. “Consider” means to think carefully about a decision and the level of documentation is at the discretion of the engineer. “Document” means to place a short note in the Design Documentation Package (see Section 300.03(3)) that explains the decision. The actual form of this note is at the discretion of the engineer. “Justify” means to prepare a design decision memo to the DDP that identifies the reason for the decision with a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages. The format used to justify a decision is the same as a Design Analysis except it is only approved by the engineer of record. The highest level of documenting a decision is the Design Analysis. When a Design Analysis is required, how it is documented, and who approves it, is explained in the next section.
300.03(2)(a) Design Analysis A Design Analysis is a process and tool used to document important design decisions, summarizing information needed for an approving authority to understand and support the decision. Design Analyses must include a comparison of safety and operations performance. The approving authority is shown in Exhibit 300-2 or Exhibit 300-4. A Design Analysis is required where a dimension chosen for a design element that will be changed by the project is outside the range of values provided for that element in the Design Manual. A Design Analysis is also required where the need for one is specifically referenced in the Design Manual. A region approved Design Analysis is required if a dimension or design element meets current AASHTO guidance adopted by FHWA, but is outside the corresponding Design Manual criteria. Email a PDF copy of all region approved Design Analyses to the ASDE supporting your region. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
In the case of a shoulder width reduction at an existing bridge pier, bridge abutment, sign structure, or luminaire base in a run of median barrier, the Design Parameter Sheet may be used instead of a Design Analysis to document the dimensioning decision for the shoulder at that location. On National Highway System (NHS) routes, a Design Analysis involving one of the controlling criteria (see Section 305.05(3)) is a federal action. Projects involving a federal action in any phase of the project require additional documentation, such as NEPA, Section 4(f) of the USDOT Act, ESA, etc., for which a programmatic agreement may or may not be provided. Contact region Environmental staff for more information. A template is available for the development of the Design Analysis document here: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/design-tools-and-support#Tools.
300.03(3) Design Documentation Package and Project File The Design Documentation Package and Project File include documentation of project work. They are effectively two separate documentation products that have two separate retention processes.
The Design Documentation Package (DDP) consists of the Design Approval, Project Development Approval, and supporting documents that preserves the decision documents generated during the design process. The DDP documents and explains design decisions, design criteria, and the design process that was followed. The contents of the DDP are listed in the DDP checklist in seven sections as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Introductory Documents Project Summary Documents Core Documents Environmental Documents Supporting Documents Other Approvals and Justifications Other Items
Sections one through five of the checklist remain the same for all projects. Items in section 6 and 7 may vary depending on the project at the discretion of the engineer of record. Reference the instructions for the DDP checklist of further information. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 300-4
Chapter 300
Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
Any time after completion of the design efforts, the design team submits the DDP to the person in the region responsible for records retention (e.g., Region Plans Engineer). These people work with the WSDOT Records Department to place the DDP into the State Records Center. The DDP is retained in a State Records Center for a period of 75 years and then transferred to State Archives for permanent storage. The Project File (PF) contains the documentation that is important to the project design, but not included in the DDP. This includes items for planning, scoping, programming, design, contract assembly, utility relocation, needed right of way, advertisement, award, constructability, traffic management, and maintenance review comments for a project. A Project File is completed for all projects and is retained by the region office responsible for the project. Responsibility for the project may pass from one office to another during the life of a project, and the Project File follows the project as it moves from office to office. See the Project File checklist for documents that are contained in the Project File. The Project File checklist should be included at the beginning of the Project File as a table of contents. If an item on the checklist is not applicable to the project, you may simply state such in the comment column. The Project File may be purged 3 years after the Construction Office has issued the Final Contract Voucher Certification.
300.04 Project Approvals This section describes WSDOT’s project design milestones for design-bid-build (DBB) and design-build (DB) projects. Work with the ASDE for project approvals that will be required for other delivery methods. Exhibit 300-1 shows all the deliverables that are required for DB and DBB projects. Use information in this section, Exhibit 300-1, and the DDP checklist to understand what is necessary for each project approval and how they are assembled. Information pertaining to FHWA approvals and oversight is provided in Section 300.05. Documents for projects requiring FHWA review or approval are submitted through the ASDE.
300.04(1) Design-Bid-Build Projects The region develops and maintains documentation for DBB projects using this chapter and the checklist for the Project File and Design Documentation Package (see Section 300.03(3)). For an idea of when design documentation should be completed in the design process, consult the Deliverables Expectation Matrix in Section 305.03(2). For the purpose of documentation, DBB projects have two approval milestones: Design Approval and Project Development Approval (PDA). Design Approval can be achieved when a basic configuration of the project is known, which is around 30% design. Project Development Approval is achieved near the end of the design process prior to advertising the project for construction. Design Approval locks the version of the Design Manual that will be utilized for up to three years of the design process. When PDA is acquired, the design must conform to the version of the Design Manual as stated in the Design Approval. In essence, having a Design Approval allows the design team to continue through the remainder of the design process without having to reanalyze their project for updates to the Design Manual. The contents of the Design Approval and PDA are discussed in detail in Sections 300.04(1)(a) and 300.04(1)(b). Projects that have a short duration may combine the Design Approval and PDA into one document. This is called a Combined Design Approval/PDA and is discussed further in Section 300.04(1)(c).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 300
Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
DBB projects that are designed by one project office and then turned over to another office for construction must transfer the Project File (along with a copy of the DDP) to the construction office for their use. Exhibit 300-5 is an example checklist of recommended items to be turned over to the construction office at the time of project transition. If the construction office changes an item documented in the DDP, it is responsible for documenting the change in a supplement to the DDP.
300.04(1)(a) Design Approval Design Approval may occur prior to NEPA/SEPA approval and is required prior to acquiring property. Approval levels for design and PS&E documents are presented in Exhibit 300-2 through Exhibit 300-5. The Design Approval contains the introductory documents, project summary documents, and core documents as shown in Exhibit 300-1 and detailed in the DDP Checklist. Include other items from the DDP Checklist that are complete prior to Design Approval. Once complete, the Design Approval becomes part of the DDP. The portion of the DDP Checklist applicable to Design Approval is used as the table of contents. Design Approval is entered into the DDP and remains valid for three years or as approved by the ASDE. An extension must be documented and filed in the DDP.
300.04(1)(b) Project Development Approval When all project development documents are completed and approved, Project Development Approval (PDA) is granted by the approval authority designated in Exhibit 300-2. The PDA becomes part of the DDP. Refer to this chapter and the DDP checklist for design documents necessary for PDA. Exhibit 300-2 through Exhibit 300-4 provide approval levels for project design and PS&E documents. The PDA contains the same introductory documents and project summary documents as the Design Approval (see Exhibit 300-1). Any of the documents that are unchanged from the Design Approval may simply be referenced in the PDA. If they have changed, update the document and insert it in the PDA. If the plans for approval are conceptual in the Design Approval, they must be finalized for the PDA. The NEPA/SEPA process must be complete for PDA. Project Development Approval remains valid for three years.
300.04(1)(c) Combined Design Approval / Project Development Approval All projects require Design Approval and PDA, however many projects have a short timeline for design and the design offices do not find it beneficial to create two separate documents. If this is the case, both approvals may be combined into one approval. To do this, complete all the products as listed in Exhibit 300-1 and title the approval “Combined Design Approval / Project Development Approval”. Even though the products listed in Exhibit 300-1 are not required until design is complete, most of these products should be completed early as they set direction for the project. For an idea of when products should be delivered in the design process, consult the Deliverables Expectation Matrix in Section 305.03(2). A Combined Design Approval / Project Development Approval remains valid for three years.

Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
300.04(2) Design-Build Projects For design-build (DB) projects, WSDOT provides a preliminary design referred to as the conceptual design and the design-builder becomes the engineer of record responsible for completing the final design. For this reason, WSDOT obtains Conceptual Design Approval (CDA) for DB projects and the engineer applies a PE stamp without signature per WAC 196-23-020(2). See the WSDOT Design-Build Manual for additional information regarding the level of completeness required for the conceptual design and development of the request for proposal (RFP). Once a contract is executed, the design-builder is responsible for maintaining and completing all design documentation, including the PDA, DDP supporting documents, and Project File. Refer to the design-build DDP checklist for design documents necessary for CDA, PDA, and DDP supporting documents.
300.04(2)(a) Conceptual Design Approval Conceptual Design Approval (CDA) is entered into the DDP and locks the version of the Design Manual that will be utilized for three years or as approved by the ASDE (an extension to the CDA must be filed in the DDP). Check with the ASDE for any required Design Manual policy updates that need to be included in the RFP. Once the RFP is issued, the version of the Design Manual and any required Design Manual policy updates are locked throughout the duration of the contract. Assemble the CDA similar to the DBB Design Approval (see Section 300.04(1)(a) and Exhibit 300-1) with the most significant difference being that CDA is required prior to publishing the request for qualifications (RFQ), which is considered advertisement for design-build projects. With ASDE concurrence, an RFQ may be published without a CDA. Environmental documentation must be complete prior to publishing the RFP, except for rare cases (see Design Build Manual 1-2.4 Federal Regulations and the NEPA Process and 2-7.9.1 Environmental Considerations). In these cases, the approving authority (Exhibit 300-2) must provide their approval and the environmental documentation must be complete prior to executing the DB contract.
300.04(2)(b) Project Development Approval For DB projects, the design-builder undertakes full responsibility for delivery of the project, including developing the final design. The CDA package is transferred to the design-builder upon contract execution, and the designbuilder updates the files to reflect their design. The updated documents, and all other items shown in Exhibit 300-1, make up the PDA package. Refer to the project RFP for final and intermediate deliverables, the approval process, and final records for the project. PDA and the applicable DDP Supporting Documents are required prior to project completion. It is a prudent practice to start the compilation of design documentation early in a project and to acquire PDA before the completion of the project. At the start of a project, it is critical that WSDOT project administration staff recognize the importance of all required documentation and how it will be used in the DB project delivery process.
300.04(3) Local Agency and Development Services Approvals Other entities (e.g. local agencies, tribes, or developers) proposing projects within WSDOT jurisdiction are required to follow WSDOT design documentation policy as noted in this chapter. Documentation is submitted to WSDOT for review and approval according to Exhibit 300-4. Where FHWA approval is indicated, the ASDE will forward project documentation to FHWA for approval and transmit FHWA’s approval, comments, and/or questions back to the submitter.

Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
A Summary of Design (SOD) may replace the Basis of Design (BOD) in Exhibit 300-1 if agreed to by the region signing authority and the ASDE. All other documentation required by this chapter must be provided, however a non-WSDOT funded project may not have a Project Profile or an Environmental Review Summary. In cases where design decisions are imposed by WSDOT or FHWA as mitigation, the decision will be documented by WSDOT and included in the design documentation package. The requirement to submit a BOD/SOD for approval may be waived by the approving authority designated in Exhibit 300-4, based on the criterion in Section 1100.05(1)(a). When a region is the approval authority for the BOD/SOD and is considering an exemption, the region approving authority can assume the role of the ASDE to determine if an exemption is appropriate. For information on jurisdiction, consult Section 1230.04.
300.05 FHWA Oversight and Approvals The  Stewardship & Oversight (S&O) Agreement between WSDOT and FHWA Washington Division created new procedures and terminology associated with FHWA oversight and approvals. One such term, and new relevant procedure, is “Projects of Division Interest” (PoDI) described below. For all projects on the National Highway System (NHS), the level of FHWA oversight and approvals can vary for numerous reasons such as type of project, the agency doing the work, PoDI/non-PoDI designation, and funding sources. Oversight and funding do not affect the level of design documentation required for a project, but it may instigate FHWA approval as detailed in the following sections. Documents requiring FHWA review and approval are submitted through the HQ Design Office.
300.05(1) FHWA Projects of Division Interest Projects of Division Interest (PoDI) are projects for which FHWA determines the need to exercise oversight and approval authority. These projects have an elevated risk, contain elements of higher risk, or present a meaningful opportunity for FHWA involvement to enhance meeting program or project objectives. Collaborative identification of these projects allows FHWA Washington Division to concentrate resources on project stages or areas of interest. It also allows WSDOT to identify which projects are PoDIs and plan for the expected level of engagement with FHWA. The Stewardship & Oversight Agreement generally defines Projects of Division Interest as:
•
•
•
•
Major Projects (A federal aid project with total cost >$500M) Federal Discretionary Grant Projects NHS Projects that may require FHWA Project or Program Approvals Projects Selected by FHWA based on Risk or Opportunity
The S&O Agreement also states: Regardless of retained project approval actions, any Federal-aid Highway Project either on or off the NHS that the Division identifies as having an elevated level of risk can be selected for risk-based stewardship and oversight and would then be identified as a PoDI. For each project designated as a PoDI, FHWA and WSDOT prepare a Project-Specific PoDI Stewardship & Oversight Agreement that identifies project approvals and related responsibilities specific to the project.

300.05(2) FHWA-Approved Design Analysis FHWA approves Design Analysis on all Interstate projects (mainline and ramps) associated with the following ten controlling criteria:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Design Speed Lane Width Shoulder Width Horizontal Curve Radius Superelevation Rate Stopping Sight Distance: horizontal alignments and vertical alignments except for sag vertical curves Maximum Grade Cross Slope Vertical Clearance Design Loading Structural Capacity
Interstate Design Analysis not associated with the above ten controlling criteria have been delegated to HQ Design. Approval of Design Analyses on non-Interstate NHS routes has been delegated to HQ Design. However, a Design Analysis on a NHS route is a federal action and NEPA documentation is required in the following cases:
•
•
NHS route with a speed greater than or equal to 50 mph: Any Design Analysis associated with the above ten controlling criteria. NHS routes with a speed less than 50 mph: Only Design Analysis associated with the following two controlling criteria: o Design Loading Structural Capacity o Design Speed
No FHWA involvement is required for non-NHS routes.
300.06 Changes to Approved Documents There are four ways to revise an already approved design document: errata, supplement, amend, or supersede. The person revising the document must work with the approving authorities to determine which of the approaches will be taken. These four approaches apply to all design documents requiring approval signatures and are detailed in the following subsections.
300.06(1) Errata Errata are corrections to errors in the original document (e.g., misspelled word or mistyped numbers). The intent and conclusion of the original document is unchanged. The highest Region and HQ approval authority must agree that the clerical errors do not change the intent of the originals. Errata are listed on a separate document by page and line reference and included in the DDP or PF in the same section as the original document. Errata are not circulated for approval signatures.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 300-9
Chapter 300
Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
300.06(2) Supplement Supplements provide new or additional information while leaving the original document intact. These are noted as supplements on the title page and an introductory paragraph/section is included in the supplement that clearly indicates the parent document and why it is being supplemented. The supplement is filed in the DDP or PF in the same section as the original document. Supplements are circulated for approval similar to the original document.
300.06(3) Amend Amended documents are where an original is modified beyond the level of an errata. For amendments, the original document is modified by marking up the original document. An amendment should be limited to a section or specific pages of the original document. If the amendment is large and covers a significant amount of the document, consider superseding the original (see below). The amendment must include a cover document that explains the reasons for the modifications and how they impact the conclusion of the original document. Amendments must have a signature page and obtain approvals according to Exhibit 300-2 thru Exhibit 300-4. Amendments are a separate document from the original and the original and the amendment are filed in the DDP or PF in the same section.
300.06(4) Supersede Superseded documents replace the original document in its entirety. A watermark is applied to the original document indicating that it has been superseded. Treat the superseding document as a completely new document. The superseding document must have a section stating what document it supersedes, clearly indicating the title and approval date of the original document. Superseding documents must have a signature page and obtain approvals according to Exhibit 300-2 thru Exhibit 300-4. Both the superseded and superseding documents are retained in the DDP or PF in the same section.
300.07 Process Review The ASDEs conduct process reviews. The process review is done to provide reasonable assurance that projects are prepared in compliance with established policies and procedures and adequate records exist to show compliance. Projects are normally selected for a review after contract award, which allows the design team appropriate time to assemble the final project documentation. The process review will focus on the Design Documentation Package and the Project File, but may include other documents as requested. A process review usually involves the region’s project development leadership, project engineer, and the design team leader. The ASDE may invite others to participate such as FHWA, Traffic, Hydraulics, Public Transit, or Active Transportation. At the conclusion of a process review, findings may be issued that ask for corrections or additions to the DDP. The original DDP will remain intact and additions or corrections will be added via memorandum and/or supplements and filed with the original DDP.

301.01 Introduction Maintenance plays an important role in the Washington State Department of Transportation’s (WSDOT’s) asset management program by meeting the daily requirements of maintaining and operating over 18,000 lane miles, approximately 2,000 miles of ramps and special-use lanes, and over 3,700 bridge and culvert structures, as well as hundreds of other special-use sites vital to the state’s transportation system. Activities in the highway maintenance program protect the public infrastructure as well as provide services necessary for daily operation of the highway system. Typical maintenance activities include patching potholes, cleaning ditches, painting stripes on the roadway, repairing damage to guardrail, and controlling noxious weeds. In addition to maintaining assets, operational services are also provided. They include plowing snow, cleaning rest areas, responding to incidents, operating structures like draw bridges, and operating traffic signals, lighting, and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). This limited list of maintenance and operational activities highlights the significant undertaking of maintaining and operating the State Highway System as designed. Highway maintenance and operations staff are unique stakeholders, because they utilize, maintain, and operate the facilities’ engineering designs and constructs. Given the nature and cost of maintenance work, as well as the exposure inherent in maintenance and operational activities, it is important for designers to consider maintenance and operations staff as major stakeholders in every project. It is also important for maintenance and operations staff to understand the purpose of the project and to participate in determining the best method(s) to keep it functioning as designed while maintaining their responsibilities outside of the specific project limits. This chapter provides multiple options to help improve coordination with maintenance and operations staff during project design. These “best practices” are a culmination of responses from Design Manual user surveys, interviews with maintenance and operations superintendents, and various regional practices that have demonstrated potential improvement related to the coordination of design and maintenance efforts and personnel. Note: The concepts and methods presented herein do not replace any approved communication or documentation processes that may be currently required by a WSDOT region during the project development process.
301.02 Communication Communication is the most fundamental component of coordination. Executing communication is often oversimplified by the phrase “communicate early and often.” In reality, effective communication is significantly more complex. For example: Who are you communicating with, what methods of communication are being used, what is being communicated, how are you responding to communication, where is the communication taking place, and when does the communication need to occur to maximize effectiveness? The following sections highlight areas that may increase the necessary communication between design and maintenance staff.

Design and Maintenance Coordination
301.02(1) Maintenance Organizational Roles The most important component of communication is knowing who you are communicating with and what their role is within the organization. Just as engineering has multiple disciplines that cover specific areas within engineering, WSDOT’s maintenance organization is also divided into multiple discipline areas, each with focused expertise and specific needs that may be relevant to a particular project.
Access to maintain luminaire is provided through use of full shoulder
When asking for maintenance input, it is not sufficient to contact just the Area Maintenance Office that covers that physical geographic area. Depending on the scope of the project, engineering must consult with the appropriate maintenance discipline area. It is a project management responsibility to properly identify and communicate with the appropriate project stakeholders (see EO 1032 – Project Management). It should not be assumed that the Area Maintenance Office will coordinate with all other maintenance disciplines, unless agreed to organizationally or identified within a particular Project Management Plan (PMP). The PMP is the documentation mechanism for identifying the various contacts and their roles within the project. Each region maintenance organization is different, but in general, the following discipline areas are present:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

301.02(2) Communicating Expectations Project design is heavily influenced by the subprogram and scope of a particular project. While this becomes a learned experience within engineering design, maintenance staff does not routinely work within these types of funding and project constraints. It is important to identify the type of project and elements that can be addressed under the particular subprogram, in order to effectively manage expectations for maintenance stakeholders participating in the project. It is also important to redirect issues presented by maintenance staff that may not be appropriate for your project but may meet a future need. The project team should work together with maintenance to redirect identified issues to region Program Management to evaluate their relevance for other subprograms or future identified projects or determine if there are funding mechanisms to include the requested feature(s) on the project in question.
301.02(3) Communication Timing There are multiple constraints to consider when establishing the timing of maintenance stakeholder input. What is the project timeline, when will maintenance involvement be most effective, and which work season(s) are maintenance and operations staff involved with when you need to communicate with them? Each one of these questions needs to be understood to yield the most effective communication result.

This procession of snow plows clearing the roadway demonstrates the urgency of labor and equipment necessary to maintain operations on the highway during certain seasons
Maintenance staff has identified scoping through the 30% design phase as a critical period for their input. The scoping phase presents opportunities to identify maintenance concerns and adequately address them within the project scope and budget. The period between scoping and 30% design presents opportunities to evaluate and refine options, as well as gain more understanding of project constraints that may impact a previously identified or requested maintenance feature. As the constraints and design trade-offs become evident, it is necessary to review the impacts to maintenance needs and requests that were originally captured in the project scope and ensure they are not impacted by constraints or the options under evaluation. Maintenance staff are obligated to respond to immediate incidents and weather conditions. They are not often able to delay their work functions and activities to make time for a design project review. It is essential that designers understand this issue and plan for reviews through scheduling techniques (see Section 301.03(1)(a)). In general, the best time to involve maintenance staff is during their slower work seasons.

301.02(4) Communication Methods Maintenance has identified field reviews as the primary and most effective method of communication for their staff. Designers are strongly encouraged to perform multiple field reviews with the appropriate maintenance disciplines. Depending on the size, scope, and location of the project, it may be appropriate to first meet in the office and review the project scope and plans, confirm and endorse the Pre-Activity Safety Plan, then proceed with the field review. Field reviews are recommended at the following periods:
•
•
•
•
Scoping phase Prior to the 30% design milestone (may need multiple meetings to evaluate design options) Each time a previously agreed-to maintenance feature is impacted through design iterations, as appropriate Prior to other major design review milestones
Maintenance clearing highway from rockfall overburdening catchment area
A primary purpose for performing field reviews with maintenance is to assist with visualizing the project and to understand existing conditions. When performing the field review, it is important to emphasize the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Reiterate the purpose of the project and subprogram, and discuss maintenance expectations. Determine the deficiency being corrected and the understood contributing factors. It is important to gain an understanding from maintenance staff on any other contributing factors or physical conditions that engineers may not be aware of. Visualize the project with maintenance: What will be new? What will be removed? What will be replaced, and what is the replacement? Where will new features be located? How will project changes affect neighbors? Determine whether the project can be operated and maintained with existing equipment.

Design and Maintenance Coordination
It is necessary for design and maintenance staff to fully understand the impacts to both the maintenance and project budgets to analyze and balance the obligations for the investments as assets are identified on a project. For example, new lighting means maintenance will be billed for the utility costs. Generally, this increased cost has not resulted in increased funding. Will proprietary item requests be needed so maintenance can maintain the project items with the tools and equipment they currently have? Will new equipment be needed, and who will fund that equipment acquisition? What is the maintenance frequency for affected assets? Will this change? What are the environmental and permit restrictions related to the asset or feature? How might maintenance physically maintain features to understand safety and access needs for the asset or feature? Identify explicit action items for design and maintenance staff to follow up on as design iterations continue. Document the outcomes of the field meeting, and follow up to ensure maintenance needs are addressed, or provide specific explanations.
In order for maintenance to assist in brainstorming alternative options, engineering design must explain the reasons and constraints behind the previous design options considered and abandoned through the design iteration process.
•
•
•
Provide maintenance stakeholders the reasons and justification behind design decisions. Allow for the time and discussions necessary to brainstorm other options to provide the desired accommodations and features, given the constraints and conflicting performance outcomes identified. Before removing any previously discussed maintenance features, always discuss and work on the issue with maintenance staff first.

While independent reviews of plan sheets are meaningful for engineers, it may be an inappropriate expectation that maintenance staff will see the same value. The repeated familiarity of reviewing plan sheets is not necessarily present within the maintenance staff, and plan review training may or may not be feasible for a given regional maintenance organization based on staffing, workloads, and skill retention. In some larger regional maintenance organizations, a liaison position has been designated for designers to coordinate plan reviews. This approach has seen some success. However, this liaison cannot possibly be aware of all comments/concerns for every maintenance discipline. Don’t assume that coordinating plan reviews through the liaison meets the expectation for maintenance stakeholder input. Always check with the various maintenance disciplines for their preferred contacts and include those contacts within the PMP.
301.03 Incorporating Maintenance Considerations in Design The intent of this section is to provide some project management options and potential strategies or products to help manage the incorporation of maintenance considerations into a design project.
301.03(1) Project Management and Review Strategies Design iterations are necessary as information is gained throughout the design process. Designers are constantly forced to balance competing stakeholder needs, regulatory requirements, design criteria, performance outcomes, and physical and political constraints. The following subsections include some recommended strategies for designers throughout the course of a design project.
301.03(1)(a) Project Management and Schedules Include maintenance discipline representatives within the PMP, and identify their specific roles and responsibilities within the design project. This is important for team members, to ensure their inclusion on interdisciplinary decision making and brainstorming options for specific features that may affect only a single or all maintenance disciplines. Schedule the appropriate duration and timing within the project schedule to complete the necessary field reviews with maintenance staff. There are multiple scheduling techniques that may assist you, ensuring this will be well planned based on maintenance staff availability and changing work priorities. Contingency activities, providing more activities detailing the effort, or expanding the duration for single activities may all be appropriate. If uncertain how to best represent the needed time within the schedule, consult the Region Project Management and Reporting System (PMRS) Coordinator for options. As the project works toward constructability reviews, be sure to include appropriate durations for procuring materials. There have been reported instances where maintenance and operations staff has been contacted to temporarily provide equipment while awaiting procurement and acceptance. This creates additional work efforts for maintenance staff to install and remove their equipment to keep a project operational, because inadequate procurement timelines were identified during the design phase. Note: Some regions have an internal policy that prohibits use of maintenance equipment on a temporary basis due to poor execution and management of procurement timelines. Designers should verify what options exist if procurement timelines appear problematic in construction staging exercises.

Design and Maintenance Coordination
Whenever possible, design should avoid creating environments that might be desirable to the homeless, both for their safety and the safety of maintenance staff.
301.03(1)(b) Project Reviews The skill sets of individuals throughout the department vary with experience and training. Strictly utilizing independent plan reviews to gain maintenance stakeholder input may be inappropriate. While field reviews are an optimal means of communicating and visualizing the project with maintenance, it is not prudent to meet in the field for every change or design iteration of a specific feature. However, design engineers frequently engage multiple stakeholders on a project, and those stakeholders are generally provided visual aids and descriptions in addition to a set of plans.
The same effort can be applied to the maintenance stakeholders. Use pictures of completed products, or generate 3D PDFs and/or working drawings, to better illustrate and visualize the features under discussion. Take the time to understand what matters regarding a particular feature and how it will be maintained, and ensure the illustrations provided depict the worst case for their concerns, not the average. For example, if the steepness of side slopes matters regarding how the feature will be accessed or maintained, be sure to depict how the slope will vary, including the steepest portion, not the typical slope.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 301-8
Chapter 301
Design and Maintenance Coordination
Every effort should be made to ensure stakeholders understand the balancing act design is working through and how it affects the various maintenance features or assets. Maintenance staff should never be in a position to review project details from a plan sheet without a meeting/discussion, examples, or other means of communicating what feature or issues they are reviewing on the plan sheet. This effort will help ensure there are “no surprises” for maintenance and operations staff when the planned project enters construction.
301.03(2) Maintenance Design Considerations –Tips, Tools, and End Products There are multiple potential products that design teams should consider to effectively document maintenance considerations. Note that some options presented in the following subsections may be more effective if implemented on a regionwide basis; however, all options can be described as project procedures and should be identified and explained within the PMP.
301.03(2)(a) Establish Maintenance Performance Measures For a given corridor or project location, it may be advantageous to identify desired performance measures and their established goal(s). Providing a performance-based outcome provides something tangible for designers to evaluate when exploring options. These performance objectives should be specific and state the actual needed outcome, not necessarily a proposed solution (see annotated example in Exhibit 301-1).

301.03(2)(b) Evaluate Maintenance Lifecycle Cost Designers should work with maintenance to understand the full life cycle cost for maintaining a certain feature. Maintenance will need to provide and explain to design:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The frequency of maintaining the asset Labor costs Material costs Traffic control costs Utility costs Additional equipment costs (cost to repair if equipment owned, rental costs, or purchase cost of new equipment needed) Cost of procuring replacement parts for the asset
Additionally, maintenance and operations staff should identify some qualitative risks and opportunities associated with certain assets. Some opportunities, like the one presented in Exhibit 301-2, may not be possible depending on material availability or funding restrictions. It is important for designers to understand that some products may have a short shelf-life. Procuring new replacement parts in the future may not be possible, which may result in a search for used parts or the total replacement of the particular asset. These are future risks that need to be identified so design engineers will understand what options or special provisions may be required to help address the potential risks. Maintenance staff can help design understand the history of different assets and determine options that have been successful for a given maintenance location. Design engineers also need to communicate the requirements and disadvantages of proprietary items specifically requested by maintenance. While it may be the desired product that maintenance is familiar with, it may not be the best product for what is being designed.
It is necessary to both determine the life span for a particular asset and utilize discounted cash flow techniques to understand the present worth of the future expenditures. The discounting process can be complex; however, for the purposes of evaluating maintenance life cycle cost, it is acceptable to use a flat discount rate applied to the sum of all future maintenance expenditures. In Exhibit 301-2, the asset life span is 20 years, and the discount rate is approximately 80% (based on a 4% interest rate per year). If the asset life span is different, then the discount rate will also change.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 301-11
Chapter 301
Design and Maintenance Coordination
To determine the life span of a particular asset type and the approximate discount rate for that life span, contact the Asset Management Group within the Capital Program Development and Management Office. After analyzing the life cycle cost to maintain a particular asset, and demonstrating an understanding of the associated risks, design and maintenance staff can justify the best return on the construction investment. While the primary intent of this process is to document justification for an asset decision, it is important that region Maintenance is supplied with the information as well. Providing this information during the design process can inform maintenance budgetary scenarios. Allow sufficient time for maintenance to capture budget impacts and apply for the necessary funding in the bi-annual maintenance budgeting process.

301.03(2)(c) CAE Design Tools Projects create assets that need to be maintained. The various CADD and modeling programs used for engineering design allow for significant flexibility to show maintenance considerations related to the project. This is true even if a feature won’t be physically built by the project, but we want to ensure its visibility throughout the design. Indicate maintenance work zones and access routes within the working files. Refer to the Electronic Engineering Data Standards Manual for symbology requirements and standards.

Chapter 301
Design and Maintenance Coordination
301.03(2)(d) Maintenance Review and Quality Control Products There are a number of different ways to support design reviews and quality control for maintenance features associated with a project. Some regions use maintenance review checklists to remind designers and reviewers of common maintenance needs on projects (see example in Exhibit 301-3).
Worksheets for each asset are another means to document the discussion, options considered, and the decided outcome for a particular asset placed or retained within the project limits (see example in Exhibit 301-2). Even if these review and documentation options are not specifically required by region documentation and approval processes, a decision to utilize these tools can be made at the project level. The established quality control and quality assurance (QA/QC) procedure within each region provides an additional process for ensuring maintenance comments and concerns have been addressed and the agreed-on features are in place. This procedure becomes increasingly important at the 60%, 90%, and constructability review milestones, where design iterations may have neglected to account for impacts to previously agreed-on features or treatments specific to maintenance and operational needs. Discuss increasing the visibility of maintenance-related quality control within the project or region QA/QC plan and identify the assigned staff responsible for quality control and quality assurance.

301.03(2)(e) Asset Management and Maintenance Owner’s Manual Maintenance and operations staff will need to maintain the assets placed or retained within a project location. It is important to be aware of the various asset management systems:
•
•
•
•
•
Highway Activity Tracking System (HATS) Roadside Features Inventory Program (RFIP) Signal Maintenance Management System (SIMMS) Maintenance Productivity Enhancement Tool (MPET) Traffic Sign Management System (TSMS)
The asset management system reviews are necessary to confirm the assets present on a project, as well as any identification numbers associated with the assets to track and list those that will be removed, replaced, or remain. Work with the appropriate maintenance staff and confirm the assets identified during field reviews with maintenance staff. Post-construction, any new assets placed will need to be logged into the appropriate asset management system(s) by maintenance or construction staff, depending on region procedures.
Maintenance and operations personnel have experience maintaining a variety of products and features on state highways. However, not every asset is strictly typical for the maintenance discipline or area responsible for maintaining or operating it. Review the assets planned for placement within a project and understand what information maintenance crews may need to adequately maintain the asset or feature. This should include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
Recommended equipment Frequency of maintenance activities Limits or boundaries (particularly for stormwater BMPs) Access location and route Any other relevant information discussed with maintenance or supplied by the product provider, including information on brand, make, and model of the asset
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 301-18
Chapter 301
Design and Maintenance Coordination
Information about these assets should be compiled into an Owner’s Manual for maintenance to reference.
•
•
•
The Owner’s Manual will be provided in hard copy, an editable electronic copy, and static electronic versions. Electronic versions of the Owner’s Manual must be titled in the following format: [YYYYMMDD]_Owner’s Manual_[route]_[MP Limits]_[Contract Number]. Hard copies will be bound in a binder and labeled on the cover and binding with the same information provided in the required PDF title.
The Owner’s Manual versions will be supplied to both maintenance and the construction office, upon contract advertisement. Note: This may not be necessary if needed content is captured within the area’s Integrated Vegetation Management (IVM) Plan. If changes occur during post advertisement for a particular asset or feature listed in the Owner’s Manual, it is the responsibility of the construction office and maintenance to coordinate an update of the Owner’s Manual, as appropriate. As the construction phase ends, after punch list items are resolved, Maintenance staff should undergo a final review to ensure the Owner’s Manual is complete and accurate.
301.03(2)(f) Maintenance Agreements Some project locations may have multiple maintenance jurisdictions, at both the state and local levels. In these circumstances, involve all maintenance jurisdictions throughout the planning and design process. They can help you understand their capabilities and the reasonable accommodations necessary for frequent maintenance operations. To understand the likely split between local and state jurisdictions, refer to Chapter 1230 and the Conformed Agreement… for the Construction, Operations and Maintenance Responsibilities… www.wsdot.wa.gov/localprograms/lag/construction.htm Some maintenance and operations agreements between state and local agencies exist for streets that are also state highways, and are important to the success of these projects. These agreements may need to be created, updated, or replaced due to the nature of the project. The potential agreements need to identify the maintenance, operational, and jurisdictional boundaries, roles, and responsibilities of the parties entering into the agreement, including liability, indemnification, and insurance. The Conformed Agreement (above) lists the likely split of jurisdictional responsibilities. However, maintenance jurisdiction(s) may want to create an operational plan or agreement for the infrequent maintenance functions that designs may not be able to accommodate. It is also possible that one maintenance jurisdiction will be better equipped to handle certain maintenance elements than another. It will be necessary to document the split of maintenance responsibilities even if responsibilities remain the same as those listed within the Conformed Agreement. Agreements require a level of detail that will not be known early in project development, so it is important to document trade-offs, benefits, and impacts with the affected maintenance jurisdictions while early decisions are being made.

305.01 Introduction The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) embraces project management best practices to deliver quality projects within the project scope, on schedule, and within budget. WSDOT’s project management process provides an organized approach to building collaborative teams. Resources including methods, processes, tools, templates, and examples. This chapter serves as a reference and gives a brief overview of project management resources. It outlines the project management steps. Project management includes strategies to manage:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Teams – identify roles and responsibilities; align the teams’ project goals. Collaboration – engage internal and external stakeholders and participants. Deliverables – identify what will be produced. See the WSDOT Master Deliverables List and the Deliverables Expectations Matrix. Tasks – plan and organize the sequence, levels of effort, and persons responsible for producing deliverables. Schedules – determine durations, critical dates, task linkages, and critical path(s). Costs – plan and control the project budget at each project stage. Risks – determine the threats to and opportunities for the project and plan accordingly. Integration and coordination of processes – for efficiency and eliminating waste. Change – describe the reason for, make decisions during, approving, and reporting change. Quality – determine the metric and target; monitor to assure, control, and verify quality. Communication – Constant communication amongst and between the project team, stakeholders, and external parties based on roles, responsibilities, and agreed to project goals. Inform sponsors and decision-makers.
Effective project delivery includes a strong commitment to project management best practices and principles. Another major factor in successful project delivery is building trust through communication about the project within, and external to, the design team. Executive Orders 1032, 1038, 1053, and Policy Statement 2047 ensure a consistent process for practical design, project management, and risk management statewide.
305.02 Project Management The project management process provides the framework for project managers and team members to deliver quality projects on time and within the scope and budget. Project management resources are consistent with a practical design approach and offer structure for organizing and aligning collaborative teams to engage stakeholders and the community. Exhibit 305-1 shows the project management process used to deliver projects. Each of the five parts shown is briefly described in the following sections.

Project Management
Exhibit 305-1 WSDOT Project Management Process
1. 2. 3. 4. 5.
Initiating: Organize team for success Planning: Develop project management plan and work plan Executing: Take action – direct and manage work and communications Monitoring and Controlling: Monitor deliverables, due dates, costs, and quality Closing: Prepare organized cessation activities; transition work or staff
305.02(1) Initiate (and Align) Teams deliver projects, hence one of the first orders of business in project management is to initiate and align the team. Our projects are successful because of the effectiveness of the team delivering them. To that end, initiating and aligning the team is an important early accomplishment. Aligning the team establishes communications and responsibilities of the project manager and team. The Initiate and Align worksheet is a tool that can be helpful in this phase.
305.02(2) Plan the Work Plan the work is the portion of the project management process that produces the Project Management Plan (PMP). The PMP defines the project performance baseline—including deliverables, schedule and budget, and management methods. As the project manager and project team plan the work, they integrate and coordinate processes in a manner that optimizes resources and reduces waste. For example, if a project requires an Access Revision Report (ARR), National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation, or a Value Engineering study (VE), the project manager and team coordinate and align these efforts. This way they make use of common information and subject matter experts. The performance baseline documents the team goals for project performance. The performance baseline includes:
•
•
•
•
Scope – the deliverables to be produced by the project team. Schedule – the logical sequence of work and related milestones. Budget – the amount of money programmed for the project. Risk – uncertainty that affects project objectives.
The PMP includes management plans for Risk, Change, Communication, Quality, Transition, and Closure. These plans align the team toward uniform goals. A complete PMP considers how the project will start, be executed, monitored, controlled, and close.
305.02(3) Executing (Working the Plan) During execution, the team, subject matter experts, and others are coordinated with as necessary to produce deliverables. The project manager and project team ensure the integration of various project development and design processes that are optimal for completing the required work and meeting the performance objectives.

Project Management
305.02(4) Monitoring and Controlling As the project team executes the work, progress is tracked and reported to the project manager. If changes or course corrections are required, the project manager takes appropriate action in a timely manner. As the team monitors progress, they may need to take action that includes: developing and implementing recovery strategies, updating the PMP, implementing risk response strategies and updating the risk assessment. Obtain change request approvals as necessary and ensure the quality plan is being implemented. Report on the performance of the team and communicate with management, staff and team.
305.02(5) Closing (the Project) At the end of the project, it is helpful to review lessons learned and reward and recognize the team for successes. Capturing lessons learned and recognize people occurs throughout the project; however, the closure phase provides an opportunity to finalize this and bring it to conclusion. As a project comes to an end it will either close or transition to a new phase. The project manager performs the closure or transition in an orderly and appropriate manner. This involves demobilizing and reassigning staff and transferring resources or facilities. Address the closure and transition phase of the project management process during creation of the PMP and the work plan. Project team planning and transitions can be aided by using the Deliverable Expectation Matrix which provides a range of project development deliverables and the general order in which they will occur (see Section 305.03(2). A project is complete after transition and closure is accomplished, and the project manager is released from responsibility for the project.
305.03 Project Management Tools For an overview of project management, with links to the WSDOT project management process and tools for delivering the WSDOT Capital Construction Program, see the following website: Project management | WSDOT (wa.gov)
305.03(1) WSDOT’s Master Deliverables List The Master Deliverables List (MDL) is a comprehensive list of project elements down to the deliverable level. This list serves as a starting point for creating the project’s Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) by adding or removing elements to match the specific project. This ensures:
•
•
Appropriate project deliverables are included in the PMP and schedule; and A common vocabulary and a map of the agreed to strategy that spans project teams and specialty/support groups in the region and Headquarters (HQ).
For additional information, see the MDL: MasterDeliverablesList.xlsx
305.03(2) Deliverables Expectations Matrix The Deliverables Expectation Matrix (DEM) communicates typical expectations for project deliverables and helps establish mutual understanding of these expectations. The DEM offers “at-a-glance” information about an extensive list of deliverables developed during the entire project development process from planning to design phase closure. Coordinate with appropriate support groups and other subject matter experts for deliverable details specific to the project.

Project Management
The DEM is intended to help scope, schedule, budget, and execute the work needed for each needed project deliverable along with the benefits of Quality Control, Quality Assurance, and Quality Verification. It also shows where the deliverable fit in the following project development milestones:
•

For additional information, see the DEM: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/design/demintro.pdf
305.03(3) Project Management and Reporting System The Project Management and Reporting System (PMRS) is a tool for effective and efficient management of design project schedules, resources, and costs. The following website provides tools for project planning, WBS development, scheduling, and resource and cost management: wwwi.wsdot.wa.gov/planning/cpdmo/pmrs.htm
305.04 Project Risk Management Project risk management is required for every WSDOT project. WSDOT has developed a world-renowned program for project risk management that is scalable and effective. Executive Order 1053 “Project Risk Management and Risk-Based Estimating” offers direction and general information about project risk management at WSDOT. Exhibit 305-2 summarizes project risk management requirements. Project managers may choose to use a higher level process than the required process.

* Project Managers can use a higher-level process if desired. Notes: [1] In some cases, it is acceptable to combine a Value Engineering Study with a Risk-Based Estimating Workshop. [2] Projects $25 million and over should use the self-modeling spreadsheet in the scoping phase of the risk-based estimating process, followed up by the more formal CRA or CEVP® process during the design phase. [3] An informal workshop is composed of the project team (or key project team members); other participants may be included as the Project Manager/project team deem necessary. Proactive risk management is an integral part of project management that monitors projects to determine, document, and, account for risks and uncertainty. Knowing the risk triggers, the risk probabilities and impacts allows a project team to develop risk strategies that benefit the efficiency of a project through the design and construction stages. For more information on risk planning and risk management, see: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/cevp/projectriskmanagement.pdf For more information on risk assessment, see: Cost risk assessment | WSDOT (wa.gov) Sound project risk management begins with a defined project scope, estimated cost, and schedule commensurate with the current level of development. To that end, there are several WSDOT sources for cost estimating guidance, including:

305.04(1) Risk Assessment Timing Timing matters. Risk analyses must be coordinated with other project development activities, especially Value Engineering. Optimizing the timing of the initial risk analysis maximizes the opportunity to identify and implement effective risk response actions. Subsequent updates to the risk assessment can be scheduled appropriately based on the specific needs of the project. 1. Planning / pre-scoping An early risk assessment helps refine expectations and evaluate alternatives. It also shows the importance of risk management through the life of the project. 2. Scoping Phase Early in preliminary engineering is a good time to consider project risks. At the conclusion of the risk assessment there are clearer expectations with regard to project cost and schedule and time to find innovative ways to respond to the risks. 3. Start of Design A risk assessment informs the project delivery method selection. It is conducted prior to final decision on delivery method (see the Project Delivery Method Selection Guide, PDMSG ). At the start of design, the project scope and preliminary costs have been established and major design decisions have been made. Some Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) activities may have begun, and coordination with support groups and subject matter experts is underway. At this stage, the project scope, costs, and schedule should be updated. This is a time to update the risk assessment as well. There is opportunity to focus on the technical issues of the design elements. 4. Design Approval After Design Approval, most of the important project decisions have been made and the opportunity to affect the design is limited. The risk analysis update can assess the risk profile of the project as it has evolved. The group may focus on constructability, construction sequencing, staging, traffic control, and significant design issues.
305.04(2) Risk Response and Value Engineering An effective tool to generate risk response actions is Value Engineering (VE). See Design Manual Chapter 310 and the Project Risk Management Guide. Section 305.04(2)(a) illustrates the natural complementary features of Project Management and VE.
305.04(2)(a) Project Management and Value Engineering Alignment of Value Engineering (VE) to PMBOK® The tools and techniques of VE align with, and can enhance, Project Management as defined in the PMBOK® Guide. Consider the following ways VE and Project Management work together: Initiate and Plan the work
Execute and Monitor
Close
Clarify vision and refine scope Identify/verify quality measures Promote innovation Enhance project function
Validate business case Implement value recommendations Coordinate with stakeholders Measure Quality
Validate benefits Lessons learned for quality

310.01 General Value engineering (VE) is a systematic review of a project by a multidisciplinary team. The VE process can include consideration of design; construction; maintenance; contractor; state, local, and federal partner agencies; other stakeholders; and the public. Value Engineering is one of the most effective techniques to identify and eliminate unnecessary costs in design, testing, manufacturing, construction, operations, maintenance, data, procedures, and practices. Value analyses are typically conducted early in project development to improve project value by identifying ideas that improve function, offer efficiencies, reduce cost and refine scope. Section 310.02(3) VE Analysis Timing, of this chapter offers additional information about timing. A VE analysis2 may be applied as a quick-response study to address a problem or as an integral part of an overall organizational effort to stimulate innovation and improve performance characteristics. Value Engineering (VE) is a critical part of good project management practices. Project managers are accountable for ensuring that, at a minimum, projects needing VE include VE activities in the project schedule. Project managers should carefully plan the timing of the VE analysis for optimum benefit. In addition, local programs projects are accountable for ensuring they comply with Local Agency Guidelines requirements. In all cases, when a VE study is completed, the project manager is accountable for completing, signing, and submitting the VE Recommendations Approval Form.
310.02 Statewide VE Program 310.02(1) Annual VE Plan The State VE Manager, located in the Development division, coordinates annually with the Capital Program Development & Management division and region VE Coordinators to prepare an annual VE Plan. The VE Plan is the basis for determining the projected VE program needs, including team members, team leaders, consultants, and training. The Statewide VE Plan is a working document that reflects coordination between Headquarters and the regions to keep it updated and projects on schedule.

310.02(2) Selecting Projects for VE Analysis 310.02(2)(a) Requirements WSDOT requires VE analyses for Design-Bid-Build (DBB) projects in accordance with FHWA requirements of 23 CFR Part 627 that meet the following thresholds:
•
•
•
•
A total estimated cost (includes project development, design, right of way, and construction costs) of $50 million or more. A bridge project located off of the federal-aid system with an estimated total project cost of $40 million or more. A Major Project with Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP) funding. In some cases, regardless of the amount of FAHP funding, a project team may be required to perform more than one VE analysis for a major project. Any other project the Secretary or FHWA determines to be appropriate.
After completing the required VE analysis, if the project is split into smaller projects in final design or is programmed to be completed by the advertisement of multiple construction contracts, an additional VE analysis is not required. However, splitting a project into smaller projects or multiple construction contracts is not an accepted method to avoid the requirements to conduct a VE analysis. Design-build projects are not required to perform Value Engineering. Even if a project is not required to conduct a VE study there may be benefits realized from the process.
310.02(2)(b) Recommendations Some projects that are not required to perform VE may find it beneficial—the following recommends considering a VE for projects having certain characteristics.
WSDOT strongly recommends a VE analysis for projects: 1. Bridge projects over $20 million and other projects over $25 million. 2. Projects of any size, having the potential for significant cost savings or improved project performance or quality. 3. Projects involving complex technical issues, challenging project constraints, unique requirements, or competing community and stakeholder objectives. 4. Encountering a three-year or longer delay prior to advertisement for construction, and a substantial change to the project’s scope or design is identified. Project Managers and teams should strongly consider value engineering for projects having a total estimated cost exceeding $5 million and one or more of the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Significant risks Alternative solutions that vary the scope and cost New alignment or bypass sections Capacity improvements that widen the existing highway Major structures Interchanges Social justice concerns and inclusion of underserved communities Possible or likely presence of cultural/archaeologic resources Geotechnical or geographical challenges

310.02(3) VE Analysis Timing 310.02(3)(a) Best time to Conduct a VE Analysis Timing is a key to the success of the VE analysis. A VE analysis must be coordinated with other project development activities. For example, a project requiring an Access Revision Report (ARR), NEPA and a VE must consider how to best integrate processes. Conducting VE analyses in conjunction with these efforts ensures VE outcomes are considered during environmental documentation and avoids the necessity to re-evaluate NEPA. Although VE is not required for design-build projects, in some cases there are benefits, including:
•
•
•
•
Enables WSDOT to be a better informed owner in procurement and selection of the design builder Allows focusing the VE analysis effort on response actions to identified risks and allocating risk ownership Promotes innovation in specific areas of interest or concern identified by the project manager or team Identifies possible improvements to procurement process documents, and in particular the request for proposal (RFP)
Optimizing the timing of a VE analysis minimizes impacts of approved recommendations on previous commitments (agency, community, or environmental) and project scope. VE analyses can also be coordinated with project risk assessments. Benefits can be realized by performing a VE analysis at any time during project development; however, the following typical windows of opportunity are identified for performing a VE analysis.
i Planning / pre-scoping An early Value Engineering study can be conducted to refine scope and evaluate alternative actions. VE analysis in planning and pre-scoping promotes identification of performance attributes that can be carried forward to future more focused and in-depth VE analysis during design. This early effort could be a Value Engineering / Practical Design peer review and used as a forum for community engagement with major stakeholders. Value Engineering in Planning can inform the project with respect to possible risks that need to be examined more fully at a future Cost Risk Assessment or Cost Estimate Validation Process workshop. Coordinate timing to complement NEPA and Access Revision Report activities. Optimize the VE process so that it integrates naturally with these processes and can utilize or inform project need statements.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 310-3
Chapter 310
Value Engineering
ii Scoping Phase Scoping is a good time for value analysis. This is a time to consider alternatives or design solutions. At the conclusion of the VE study, the project scope, preliminary costs, and major design decisions are informed by the recommendations. During the scoping phase the VE analysis focuses on project drivers. This stage often provides an opportunity for community engagement and building consent with stakeholders.
iii Start of Design During pre-design, or at the start of design, the project scope, and preliminary costs are being established and major design decisions have been made. Some Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) activities may have begun, and coordination with support groups and subject matter experts is underway. At this stage, the project scope, costs, and schedule define the limits of the VE analysis. There is opportunity to focus on the technical issues of design elements.
iv Design Approval After Design Approval, most of the important project decisions have been made and the opportunity to affect the design is limited. Provided there is time to incorporate VE recommendations, the VE analysis may likely focus on constructability, construction sequencing, staging, traffic control, and significant design issues. At this point “ease of implementation” may be a driving consideration for project managers as they consider VE recommendations to approve for implementation. A VE analysis late in the project development phase may be useful if the estimated cost of the project exceeds the project budget. The value engineering process can be applied to the project to lower the cost while maintaining the value and quality of the design.

310.02(4)(d) VE Team Leader The quality of a VE analysis relies on the skills of the VE team leader. The VE team leader guides the team’s efforts from preparation, through the VE job plan and any follow-up actions. The VE team leader should be knowledgeable and proficient in transportation design and construction and in the VE analysis process for transportation projects. The VE team leader’s responsibilities include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
Plans, leads, and facilitates the VE study. Ensures proper application of a value methodology and follows the job plan. Guides the team through pre-study activities, the VE study, and the post-study. Schedules a pre-workshop meeting with the project team and prepares the agenda for the VE study. Team leaders from within WSDOT are encouraged, but not required, to be certified by SAVE International as a Value Methodology Associate or Certified Value Specialist (CVS). Team leadership can be supplied from within the region, from another region, or from Headquarters. A statewide pool of qualified team leaders is maintained by the State VE Coordinator, who works with the Region VE Coordinator to select the team leader.
Consultants who lead VE teams are required to be a current SAVE International Certified Value Specialist.
310.02(4)(e) VE Team Members The VE teams are usually composed of six to ten people with diverse expertise relevant to the project under study. The team members may come from regions; Headquarters; other local, state, or federal agencies; or the private sector. VE team members are selected based on the expertise needed to address major issues and functions the project is to deliver. All team members must be committed to the time required for the study. It is desirable for team members to have attended Value Methodology Fundamentals 1 training before participating in a VE study. It is useful to have some team members who are not involved in the project.
310.03 VE Procedure The WSDOT VE analysis uses the Job Plan shown in Exhibit 310-1. A detailed discussion of how each phase is supposed to be conducted can be found in the document, Value Methodology Standard and Body of Knowledge, developed by SAVE International. This document can be downloaded at the SAVE website: https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.value-eng.org/resource/resmgr/standards_documents/vmstd.pdf
310.03(1) Pre-Analysis Preparation To initiate a VE study, the project manager completes the Request form and emails to the HQ Engineering Analysis Office, Region VE Coordinator, and Assistant State Design Engineer at least 10 to 12 weeks before the proposed study date. The Project Manager, Region VE Coordinator and State VE Coordinator collaborate to determine dates, VE team leader and team members for the VE study. The Request Form and Contacts are found at: Value engineering | WSDOT (wa.gov). The design team prepares project information for the VE team—see Exhibit 310-2. The State VE Coordinator for the best/most concise list of materials to send to the team members. If the package is provided via a network drive or FTP site, make sure the materials are organized. The VE team members should receive a link or the information at least one week prior to the study so they have time to review the material.

The project manager and state VE Coordinator determine if the VE study should be conducted virtually or inperson.
310.03(2) VE Analysis Requirements Value Engineering is a tool to serve the project, project manager and project team. Great flexibility is used to tailor the VE study to the needs of the project, project manager, and project team. Many project managers may desire to use VE, even if it is a smaller project and a VE study is not required. VE studies can be used to refine project scope, improve design, or engage stakeholders. VE is a process that can be easily adapted to such projects and may involve a brief one- or two-day event. For projects that require a VE analysis, the time required varies commensurate to project complexity and size, typical studies are three to five days. The VE team leader working with the project manager will determine the best length of time for the study. The VE analysis Final Report includes:

The Project Manager and Project team are responsible for: Implementation of approved recommendations. Documentation of reasons recommendations were not implemented.
310.03(3) Implementation Phase As soon as possible, preferably no more than two weeks following the VE analysis, the project manager reviews and evaluates the VE team’s recommendation(s). The project manager completes and signs the VE Recommendation Approval form and returns it to the Statewide VE Manager for inclusion in the final report. Recommendations not approved or modified by the project manager require a brief justification in the VE Recommendation Approval form. The project manager sends the completed VE Recommendation Approval form to the State VE Manager following receipt of the Final Report and not later than September 1 of each year, whichever comes first, so the results can be included in WSDOT’s annual VE Report to FHWA.

320.01 General This chapter is intended to address policy-related issues associated with WSDOT multimodal traffic analysis. It is not intended to address the specifics of demand forecasting; mesoscopic, analytical/deterministic, stochastic microsimulation; or safety performance analyses. For those items, see the latest versions of the Highway Capacity Manual and Highway Safety Manual (HSM). Traffic analysis is intended to produce information for decision makers; it is not intended as a stand-alone tool for making decisions. Consideration of empirical data, similar traffic situations, studies, local knowledge, and seasoned traffic engineering and planning experience can also add to a pool of traffic information that is provided to decision makers. Traffic analysis is either “operational” or “planning” in nature. Operational analysis is associated with engineering concepts focusing on near-term or existing/opening year, while planning analyses are generally focused on a horizon year or interim phase years. Planning-level analyses are also used to determine impacts for environmental documentation phases of Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) work. Much caution should be used when operational tools are used with planning-level future year projection data. Be aware that operational models were not primarily intended for use with planning-level future year projected volumes, but there is a need to understand the difference between proposed future scenarios. Therefore, operational models need to use data from forecasting models, but analysts need to do so with an understanding of the imperfections. Forecasting demand volumes 20 years into the future can be difficult to do well, so there should be little expectation that intersection turning movement projection-related traffic analyses by themselves will be sufficient to produce actionable designs. Consequently, some future year Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) such as turn lane queue length should not be considered accurate, but they may be useful when comparing various scenarios if the reported differences are substantial. With the aforementioned limitations, project-specific traffic volumes, forecasts, and system capacities are used to establish the extent of improvements needed for facilities to operate acceptably from year of opening or through interim phases and, eventually, through to the horizon year; for example:
•
•
•
•
•
Number of general purpose/ETL/HOV lanes Length and number of ramp or auxiliary lanes Intersection or interchange spacing Channelization Signal timing
•
•
•
•
•
Right of way needs Roundabout design parameters Width of sidewalks Extent of bike lanes Ferry holding lanes
Traffic analysis should examine multimodal access, mobility, and safety objectives; project benefits and costs; development impacts; and mitigation needs.

For projects that fall under FHWA approval, coordinate with the Headquarters (HQ) Traffic Office for concurrence on traffic analysis details. Other projects can be coordinated through region Traffic offices. (See Chapter 300 for FHWA oversight and approval policy.)
320.02 Design Year and Forecasting Considerations Project evaluation requirements can be (1) focused on near-term functionality, (2) contain interim phases, and/or (3) require a long-term focus. The project proponent can be the state (WSDOT or other state agencies) or developers (other public agencies or private concerns). For Access Revision Reports (AARs), the design year and multimodal travel demand forecasting methodologies are to be documented by the project stakeholders in the Methods and Assumptions (M&A) Documents. Guidance on the horizon year and interim design year(s) for projects is given in Chapter 1103, Design Controls. When selecting horizon year and interim design year phases, stakeholders need to consider the regional significance of a proposed project, how it functions within the existing system, and the expected lifespan. The traffic analysis for developer-related projects will typically focus on existing conditions and the build-out year of the proposed project. Some larger developer projects will need to be evaluated in multiple phases, as they have the potential to significantly impact the transportation system and will thus require a longer-term focus. Mitigation measures may also be phased with these projects. Project teams are encouraged to consider the strategic importance, economic potential, network constraints, and investment scale when determining the analysis methodologies for project phasing, design year, and forecasts. With acceptance/concurrence by the Traffic Office of purview3, the following are possible approaches to be used individually or in concert to develop future year demand volumes:

320.03 Traffic Analysis Software With acceptance by the Traffic Office of purview, use the least complex and data-intensive software deemed reasonable for any given project. Agreement for software and versions must be documented in the study’s M&A. Use the latest version sanctioned by WSDOT HQ Traffic.
•
•
•
For near-term analysis of locations that do not require an understanding of interactions between various transportation systems, Sidra, Rodel, Synchro, and HCS are the primary analytical tools. For systemwide multimodal complex forecasting, EMME3, TransCad, and Visum are the primary tools. For choosing between scenarios involving multimodal traffic and/or where various transportation system elements interact, CORSIM, Vissim, or Dynameq are the primary tools.
The software mentioned above may have version limitations due to WSDOT purchased rights and contract limitations. For details about these and other traffic analysis software used by WSDOT, contact the region or HQ Traffic Office.
320.04 Travel Demand Forecasting Designers, planners, and analysts need to be aware of the practical limitations of the selected method of multimodal traffic demand forecasting and should consider the impact of demand uncertainty when conducting analyses and drawing conclusions from those analyses. Special attention should be given to any post-processing efforts. Following are brief descriptions of the four main methods for demand forecasting.
320.04(1) Travel Demand Models For the vast majority of projects, this will be the proper approach for developing future year demand volumes. However, caution should be taken when using this approach to draw conclusions from operational model Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) that are based on such forecasts, because specific and accurate turning movement volumes are needed to produce credible MOEs. Forecast models are most commonly used to produce general volumes that can help traffic planners evaluate and compare the relative merits of potential solutions against each other.
320.04(2) Trend Line Projections Where travel demand models are not established or are otherwise considered inadequate, trend data can be used but must be constrained by system flow limitations. Trend line growth cannot account for peak spreading when traffic demand exceeds system supply. Use with caution and consult the HQ Transportation Data & GIS Office (TDGO) for further details about this method and any inherent limitations.
320.04(3) Cumulative Impacts This method is typically used to forecast volumes in areas that demonstrate uniform growth and exhibit only minor changes and marginal impacts to the region. It is also useful for analyzing growth in suburban areas that are experiencing rapid development, as other methods may not be as reliable. The basic concept is to add volumes for developments to the trending background traffic growth. The comprehensive plan for such areas should be consistent with the expected growth predicted by a project (and include other anticipated projects) in order to result in a reasonable estimate of cumulative impacts. Use with caution due to an inability to fully account for secondary impacts like future environmental issues, local network connectivity, public services, and multimodal demands.

Traffic Analysis
320.04(4) Limitations of the Surrounding Network For projects that contain infrastructure of particular importance, extraordinary expense, life span expectancy beyond 20 years, or where travel demand will likely always exceed transportation system capacity constraints, give consideration to the concept of facility capacity balancing within the context of the larger transportation system. This approach needs to demonstrate that the maximum amount of upstream traffic flowing into a project, as well as all project-area traffic flowing into downstream sections, can be handled acceptably. This does not require traditional travel demand forecasting, which has a limitation of about 20 years. Instead, it requires a sensitivity approach where maximum up- and downstream flows are used to right-size the project area’s proposed improvements. The simplest example is the SR 520 Floating Bridge: constraints on either end of the bridge limit the usefulness of adding more lanes on the bridge. TIAs and ARRs (see Chapter 550) shall clearly describe the methodology and process used to develop forecasts in support of a proposed project’s analysis. For example, include only those projects that:
•
•
•
Are on the six-year Transportation Improvement Plan. Are fully funded. Have entered the environmental review process.
320.05 Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) TIA is a term used for all analyses that are not structured ARRs (see Chapter 550) or planning-level efforts like corridor studies. The quality and level of service4 for state-owned and state-interest facilities shall be based upon MOEs that support the project purpose and need. They shall also be developed and presented in accordance with the latest versions of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), FHWA Traffic Analysis Toolbox, and WSDOT Vissim Protocol. For some example MOEs, see the FHWA MOE List, which describes measures typically used for analyzing state and local agency facilities such as freeway segments, signalized intersections, ramp terminals/junctions, sidewalks, and transit services. Depending on the facility and when HCM Level of Service MOE is used, WSDOT thresholds are “C” for rural and “D” for urban non-NHS facilities, unless a WSDOT region specifies otherwise for specific route segments. (See each WSDOT region for details.) Refer to the WSDOT State Highway Log for a determination of existing route segment definitions for urban or rural status. Depending on the project type and purpose, multimodal MOEs may be employed.
320.05(1) Updating an Existing TIA TIAs require either updating or a sensitivity analysis if they become more than 3 years old; however, a TIA will require updating sooner in rapidly developing areas. TIAs can avoid such update efforts in slowly developing areas. To determine if an update is required, an assessment of critical infrastructure functionality must be documented.

WSDOT sets level of service (LOS) standards for state highways and ferry routes of statewide significance (HSS) based on RCW 47.06.140(2). Regional transportation planning organizations (RTPOs) and WSDOT jointly develop and RTPOs establish LOS standards for regionally significant state highways and ferry routes (non-HSS) based on RCW 47.80.030(1)(c). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 320-4
Chapter 320
Traffic Analysis
If the amount or character of traffic in the study area is significantly different from an earlier analysis, an update will be required. The definition of significant is 10% (volume, flow rate, travel time, delay, density, or other key MOEs) where existing operations are currently acceptable. If they are not currently acceptable, the threshold is reduced to 5%. In cases where greater than 10% change or failed MOEs have been found, consultation and concurrence with WSDOT Traffic Office of purview is required to avoid a full ARRs or TIA update. Developer-initiated TIAs are typically valid for 5 or 6 years, as that is the window provided under the Growth Management Act for concurrency. The Development Services Office should be consulted regarding the need for updates to TIAs for developer, tribal, and local agency projects.
320.06 TIA Scope To establish the appropriate scope, consultation between the lead agency, WSDOT, and those preparing the TIA is encouraged before beginning work. A summary of typical TIA contents is listed in Section 320.10. Note: For developer-initiated TIAs, the local agency may prescribe the scope of the TIA per the local agency’s adopted standards.
320.06(1) TIA Boundaries The traffic impacts of local streets and roads can impact intersections on state highway facilities. In these cases, include in the TIA an analysis of adjacent local facilities (driveways, intersections, main lines, and interchanges) upstream and downstream of the intersection with the state highway. A “lesser analysis” may include obtaining traffic counts, preparing signal warrants, or a focused TIA. For developer projects, the boundaries of the analysis (such as the city limits) may be determined in consultation with local agencies and WSDOT.
320.06(2) Traffic Analysis Scenarios WSDOT must understand the effects of plan updates and amendments, as well as the effects of specific project elements (including site plans, conditional use permits, subdivisions, and rezoning) that have the potential to impact state facilities. Consultation between the lead agency, WSDOT, and those preparing the TIA is essential early in the process to help determine appropriate scenario analyses and goals. For further guidance, consult Chapter 1130. Depending on the type of work being analyzed, required TIA scenarios can range from simple “existing conditions with and without project,” to more complex analyses where TIA scenarios could include: existing; opening year with and without project; interim years with and without project; and design year with and without project. If developed with WSDOT, and if following ARR guidance, pre-ARR work such as Area Study TIAs can be used in future ARRs. The appropriate and necessary scenarios shall be agreed upon by the TIA study team and documented in the TIA Methods and Assumptions (M&A) Document. For existing networks, calibrate models to existing conditions. If a near-term baseline network is required, only funding-secured projects should be added to the existing network. This is typical of opening year models that are a few years beyond existing year. For interim scenario networks, include only projects or developments within the forecasting process that have the highest probability within the 10-year horizon. For example, include projects that are fully funded or have a construction phase in the six-year Transportation Improvement Plan. For scenarios with phases beyond 10 years, TIA or ARR teams should discuss and document the merits of including other potential projects. For example: WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

All other potential influences with lower probability should not be allowed to affect travel or trip demand forecast results—with one exception: TIAs and ARRs may include multiple scenarios for the design year. For example, if a major assumption for unfunded additional lanes “feeding traffic into” or “allowing traffic from” the project is desired for the design year to allow for a better understanding of expensive infrastructure sizing (such as ultimate bridge widths), ensure a constrained design year scenario is included so that proper funding-based phasing solutions are communicated.
320.07 TIA Methods and Assumptions Document The TIA M&A is similar to an ARR M&A in that it documents the “who, what, where, when, how, and why” items associated with the traffic analysis portion of a project. Prior to any substantial fieldwork or traffic/facility data collection, consultation between the lead agency, WSDOT, and those preparing the TIA is encouraged to help reach and document consensus on study data needs and assumptions. These and other items should be documented and the M&A signed by all lead staff that conduct work in association with the TIA M&A document. For further guidance, consult Chapter 1130.
320.08 TIA Methodologies The FHWA Traffic Analysis Toolbox, Volume 2, provides a methodology for selecting traffic analysis tools. However, in general, traffic analysis methodologies for those facility types indicated below are used by WSDOT and will be accepted if agreed upon by those who sign TIA or ARR M&A Documents.

Traffic Analysis
The procedures in the Highway Capacity Manual do not explicitly address operations of closely spaced signalized intersections, nor does WSDOT currently endorse microsimulation or roundabout guidance as noted in the HCM/S. Under such conditions, several unique characteristics must be considered, including spill-back potential from the downstream intersection to the upstream intersection; effects of downstream queues on upstream saturation flow rates; and unusual platoon dispersion or compression between intersections. An example of such closely spaced operations is signalized ramp terminals at urban interchanges. Queue interactions between closely spaced intersections can seriously distort the results of analyses that follow the procedures in the HCM. Other analysis methods may be accepted; however, consultation between the lead agency, region or HQ Traffic, and those preparing the TIA is encouraged to reach consensus on the data necessary for the analysis if meso- or microsimulation is employed. When a state highway has saturated flows, the use of a meso- or microsimulation models can provide additional understanding. Note, however, that the simulation model must be calibrated and validated for reliable results and is intended for near-term operational analyses. Operational MOEs for simulation models based on long-term forecasts should be used primarily to determine which scenarios are better than others. The models can only do so if the resultant MOEs demonstrate significant differentiation between scenarios. TIA or ARR teams will determine what is considered significant and will document those findings in the study. However, at a minimum, significant must be greater than the expected error band of the models used. For example, if Vissim is considered to be calibrated to a given MOE within 15% of existing conditions (a very wide band), the scenarios need to show greater than 15% differentiation between each other to be significant.
320.09 TIA Mitigation Measures Consultation between the lead agency, WSDOT, and the responsible parties preparing the TIA is recommended in order to reach consensus on the project mitigation measures. Mitigation measures, if applicable, need to be included in the TIA to determine whether a project’s impacts can be eliminated or reduced to a level of insignificance. Eliminating or reducing impacts to a level of insignificance is the standard pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The lead agency is responsible for administering the SEPA and/or NEPA review process. WSDOT is responsible for reviewing the TIA for impacts that pertain to state highway facilities. However, the authority vested in the lead agency under SEPA/ NEPA does not take precedence over other authorities in law. Development work in the state highway right of way requires a WSDOT permit or agreement. Normally, this work is coordinated by the region Development Services Office. Mitigation measures may take the following forms:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Channelization such as turn lanes or raised islands Installation of a roundabout or, if necessary, a traffic signal (signal warrant analysis per MUTCD is required) Frontage improvements Donation of right of way Addressing any design or operational deficiencies created by the proposal Possible restrictions of turning movements Sight distance enhancements Traffic mitigation payment (pro rata share contribution) to a programmed WSDOT project (consult Chapter 1130) Satisfaction of local agency guidelines and interlocal agreements

321.01 Sustainable Safety Related Policy The Washington State Strategic Highway Safety Plan, “Target Zero” has a vision to reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries to zero by 2030. WSDOT is pursuing this goal along with partners such as Washington State Patrol (WSP) and Washington Traffic Safety Commission (WTSC). WSDOT recognizes that risk exists in all modes of transportation. The universal objective is to reduce the number of fatal and serious injury crashes within the limits of available resources, science, technology, and legislatively mandated priorities. The Secretary’s Executive Order E 1085, Sustainable Highway Safety Program, sets the policy for the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) to embark on a targeted and scientifically-based Engineering approach for identifying and addressing crash risks that is multimodal and coordinated with the other three “E”s, Education, Enforcement, and Emergency Services. Sustainable Safety employs a “5th E”, Evaluation, this is the analysis and diagnosis of crashes and to target their contributing factors in addressing highway safety performance. Evaluation relies on quantifying safety performance using scientific tools and assessment techniques to determine appropriate safety countermeasures. Practical Solutions is an approach to making project decisions that focus on resolving the project need for the least cost without adversely impacting safety performance. Sustainable Safety is the approach for resolving safety performance within WSDOT’s Practical Solutions as directed in Secretary’s Executive Order E 1090, Moving Washington Forward: Practical Solutions. E 1085 directs engineers to base project-level decisions on safety analysis of specific locations and corridors and focus on proven lower-cost targeted countermeasures at specific locations that optimize the return on investment of safety dollars. These lower-cost investments allow for additional identified locations to be addressed. Sustainable Safety is therefore an essential part of successful Practical Design implementation. It provides the process and methods to incorporate safety performance assessment and peer-review into Performance-Based Practical Design. Sustainable Safety allows the planner, engineer, and decision maker, to identify and quantify the safety performance of alternatives during project development. Implementing Sustainable Safety improves WSDOT’s effectiveness in reducing the risk of fatal and serious injury crashes statewide. It focuses on the contributing factors and types of crashes through the use of state-of-the-art principles and analytical methods to diagnose, quantify, and predict safety performance. The Sustainable Highway Safety Policy directs WSDOT to use effective and efficient resources, like the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual (HSM) to achieve the goals of the Washington State Strategic Highway Safety Plan: Target Zero. This approach:
•
•
•
•
•
Optimizes the reduction in fatal and serious injury crash potential on Washington’s highways. Provides quantifiable assessment of crash potential. Identifies locations that have a higher potential for crash reduction. Provides reliable and accurate assessment of potential crash reduction benefits. Identifies and deploys solutions with optimal benefit/cost within the WSDOT safety priority programming process or through low cost operational improvements.

Sustainable Safety Analysis
Reduces waste by focusing on design elements that provide a reduction in crash potential. Addresses locations that will result in a higher crash risk reduction potential for a given investment level. Provides an accurate assessment of project and program performance. Provides scientific and engineering tools to continually improve and refine safety analyses.
Sustainable Safety is a critical, integral part of Practical Solutions that supports Washington in reaching its Target Zero goal.
321.02 HQ Safety Technical Group The HQ Safety Technical Group is comprised of experts in safety analysis. The team has several duties including maintaining the Safety Analysis Guide, safety analysis training, review of complex safety analysis, review of Crash Analysis Reports, and approve the use of crash modification factors. The team can also provide assistance to a project office as they conduct safety analysis.
321.03 Project Related Safety Analysis All projects are required to have a safety analysis for Design Approval (see Chapter 300). The safety analysis is intended to be scalable. The Safety Analysis Guide provides direction on the scope and scale of safety analysis for each funding subprogram (i.e. I-1, I-2, P-3) and each document needing a safety analysis (i.e. Design Analyses, Access Revision Reports (ARRs), Intersection Control Evaluations (ICEs)). Contact the HQ Safety Technical Group if your project is not covered by the Safety Analysis Guide or if you have questions regarding how to use the guide.
321.04 Safety Analysis The Safety Analysis Guide contains guidance on the content of stand-alone safety analyses for Design Analyses, Crash Analysis Reports (CAR), ICE, Transportation Management Plans, Road Safety Audits, Environmental Impact Statements, and ARRs. Use the procedures described in the WSDOT Safety Analysis Guide when performing a safety analysis. Contact the HQ Safety Technical Group if you have any questions or need to develop a standalone safety analysis that is not covered in the Safety Analysis Guide.
321.05 Reports and Documentation The CAR, ICE, and Basis of Design (BOD) utilize safety analysis. They are described in the following subsections. For approval requirements, refer to Chapter 300.
321.05(1) Crash Analysis Report A Crash Analysis Report (CAR) is developed during the scoping phase for I-2 Crash Reduction projects and is required for funding to be released. Contact Headquarters Traffic for a copy of the latest version of the CAR template. Projects with an approved CAR may, in some cases, be exempted from the requirement to prepare a Basis of Design (see Chapter 1100.)

Chapter 321
Sustainable Safety Analysis
321.05(2) Intersection Control Evaluation Projects that require an Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) need to do a safety analysis on the alternatives. If a project has a completed CAR, the ICE may reference this CAR. If not, the safety analysis for the ICE should have a scale and scope associated with its funding source as noted in the Safety Analysis Guide.
321.05(3) Basis of Design The Basis of Design (BOD) utilizes metrics and targets in the baseline and contextual needs. If the chosen metric is safety related utilize a safety analysis to determine the potential for crash reduction for various alternatives. The safety analysis may also be used as a component in the Alternative Comparison Table (ACT) to allow easier comparison across alternatives. The scale and scope of a safety analysis for a BOD is associated with its program type and is explained in the Safety Analysis Guide.

400.03(3) After Construction is Complete (a) Complete a post construction survey as described in the Highway Surveying Manual. (b) Have the DNR Completion Report signed and stamped by the appropriate professional in direct charge of the surveying work, then file with DNR as described in Chapter 410.
400.04 Datums A datum is a geometrical quantity (or set of quantities) that serves as a reference, forming the basis for computation of horizontal and vertical control surveys in which the curvature of the earth is considered. Adjusted positions of the datum, described in terms of latitude and longitude, may be transformed into State Plane Coordinates. All engineering work (mapping, planning, design, right of way, and construction) for WSDOT projects is based on a common datum.
400.04(1) Horizontal WAC 332-130-060 states, “The datum for the horizontal control network in Washington shall be NAD83 (1991) [the North American Datum of 1983] as officially adjusted and published by the National Geodetic Survey of the United States Department of Commerce and as established in accordance with Chapter 58.20 RCW. The datum adjustment shall be identified on all documents prepared; i.e., NAD83 (1991).” (See the Highway Surveying Manual for further information.)
400.04(2) Vertical The North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) as defined by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) is the official civilian datum for surveying and mapping activities in the United States. WSDOT has adopted this datum. (See the Highway Surveying Manual for further information.)
400.05 Global Positioning System A Global Positioning System (GPS) uses a constellation of satellites and earth stationed receivers to determine geodetic positions (latitude and longitude) on the surface of the earth. WSDOT personnel use this survey technology. (See the Highway Surveying Manual for more detailed discussions.) GPS technology is changing rapidly. The key point is for the designer and surveyor to select the best tool (GPS or conventional applications) for doing the survey fieldwork. Often, a combination of GPS and conventional (Total Station) surveying is appropriate.
400.06 WSDOT Survey Monument Database The WSDOT Survey Monument Database provides storage and retrieval capabilities for data associated with survey control monuments set by WSDOT. This database supports and tracks the Report of Survey Mark and aids in fulfilling WSDOT’s obligation to contribute to the body of public record, thereby minimizing the duplication of survey work. The Report of Survey Mark provides data on specific GPS stations. (See Exhibit 400-2 for an example of a Report of Survey Mark.) To access the WSDOT Survey Monument Database, see the following website: www.wsdot.wa.gov/monument/

Surveying and Mapping
400.07 Geographic Information System The Geographic Information System (GIS) is a compilation of information from many sources. Its purpose is to assemble data into a central database for the common good. The data is stored on many levels so the desired information can be selected and combined to achieve the desired product. Surveying and photogrammetric data are vital elements of this system.
400.08 Photogrammetric Surveys Photogrammetric surveys are performed to furnish topographic or planimetric maps and cross sections for use in the reconnaissance, location, and preliminary design phases of highway work. To use photogrammetric surveys for final design and construction requires that the ground be nearly bare to obtain the necessary accuracy. By using well-planned aerial photography in stereoscopic plotters, contours and other physical features are delineated on map sheets to a scale consistent with the accuracies or detail required. The usefulness of aerial photography is not limited to mapping. Taking the form of enlargements, mosaics, and digital images, it can be used as a visual communication tool (displays and exhibits) for planning, design, property acquisition, engineering, construction, litigation, and public relations. To obtain information on preparation, procedure, and programming of aerial photography and photogrammetric mapping and applications, contact the HQ GeoMetrix Office. When requesting a photogrammetric survey, specify the desired units and check the units of the product. Allow for the time required to communicate the complex and detailed work request, develop the service, and accomplish the product.
400.09 Documentation For documentation related to monuments, see Chapter 410. Primary and secondary survey control data are archived in the WSDOT Survey Monument Database and GIS when available. For the list of documents required to be preserved in the Design Documentation Package and the Project File, see the Design Documentation Checklist: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/designtools-and-support

410.01 General Proper monumentation is important in referencing a highway’s alignment, which is used to define its right of way. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) can contribute to the body of public records and minimize duplication of survey work by establishing and recording monuments that are tied to a state plane coordinate system and to a standard vertical datum. WSDOT is required by law to perpetuate existing recorded monuments (Chapter 58.09 RCW). The department provides monuments for realignments and new highway alignments and perpetuates existing monuments impacted by a project. The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is designated as the official agency for surveys and maps. New monuments set to establish property corners, highway alignment, and so on, shall be recorded on a Record of Survey or Monumentation Map and filed with the DNR Public Land Survey Office and the appropriate county auditor or county engineer. Records of Survey and Monumentation Maps are retained at DNR. Geodetic monuments are established and the Headquarters (HQ) GeoMetrix Office retains their placement records. Geodetic monuments are recorded on a Report of Survey Mark. These records are made available to the public on the following website: www.wsdot.wa.gov/monument/ Existing monuments are not to be disturbed without first obtaining the DNR permits required by state law. DNR allows the temporary covering of a string of monuments under a single permit. State law requires replacement of land boundary monuments after temporary removal according to permit procedures. WSDOT control and alignment monuments may not be removed without replacement unless the location of the original position is perpetuated by reference and the appropriate document(s) prepared and filed with the county and the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. Other requirements pertaining to specific monuments are discussed below. Exhibit 410-1 summarizes the documentation requirements for new and existing monuments. The region is responsible for identifying and locating existing monuments, obtaining required permits before any existing monument is disturbed, and conducting the research to locate existing monuments as required by WAC 332-120-030, as follows: Any person, corporation, association, department, or subdivision of the state, county or municipality responsible for an activity that may cause a survey monument to be removed or destroyed shall be responsible for ensuring that the original survey point is perpetuated. It shall be the responsibility of the governmental agency or others performing construction work or other activity (including road or street resurfacing projects) to adequately search the records and the physical area of the proposed construction work or other activity for the purpose of locating and referencing any known or existing survey monuments.

410.03 Control Monuments Horizontal and vertical control monuments are permanent references required for the establishment of project coordinates tied to the Washington State plane system and elevations tied to a standard vertical datum. By establishing and recording permanent control monuments, WSDOT eliminates duplication of survey work and contributes to the body of public records. Provide the horizontal and vertical control monuments for highway projects that require the location of existing or proposed alignment or right of way limits. Monuments set by other agencies may be used if within 1 mile of the project and where the required datum and accuracy were used. When control monuments are required for a given project, show the existing and proposed control monuments on the contract plans. For horizontal control:
•
•
•
•
•
Use North American Datum 1983, revised 1991 (NAD83/91). Use a minimum of second order, Class II procedures as defined in the Highway Surveying Manual. Provide two monuments near the beginning of the project. Where possible, when setting horizontal control, set points to act as azimuth points. Place points so that line of sight is preserved between them and in an area that will not be disturbed by construction. Provide two monuments near the end of the project. Provide a pair of monuments at about 3-mile intervals throughout the length of the project.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 410-2
Chapter 410
Monumentation
For vertical control:
•
•
•
Use North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD88). (See the Highway Surveying Manual for orders of accuracy required.) Use at least second order procedures for primary vertical control within project limits as defined in the Highway Surveying Manual. Use third order for secondary control throughout the project. Provide vertical control throughout the length of the project. Desirable spacing is at or near each milepost. Maximum spacing is 3 miles apart.
All control monuments that are established, reestablished, or reset must be filed with the county engineer and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Submit a Record of Survey or a Monumentation Map that has been signed by the supervising, licensed, professional engineer or licensed, professional land survey. If the monument is not used to reference right of way or land corners, submit a Report of Survey Mark. (See the Highway Surveying Manual for more detailed guidance on Control Monuments.)
410.04 Alignment Monuments Alignment monuments are permanent references required for the establishment or reestablishment of the highway and its right of way. Placing monuments at random points, in safe locations and tied to the Washington State plane coordinate system is recommended (see the Highway Surveying Manual). Establishment, reestablishment, or resetting of alignment monuments is required on the following highway projects:
•
•
•
New highway alignment projects. Highway realignment projects involving new right of way (monuments are only required for the realigned highway section). Highway projects where alignment monuments already exist.
Before an existing alignment monument is reestablished or reset, a DNR permit is required. All alignment monuments that are established, reestablished, or reset must be filed with the appropriate county auditor or county engineer. The Record of Survey is filed with the county auditor in the county in which the monument is located, and a recorded copy is sent to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. The original Monumentation Map is filed with the county engineer of the county in which the monument is located, and a recorded copy, with the filing signatures, is sent to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. The HQ Right of Way Plans Section will forward a copy to DNR for its records.
410.05 Property Corners A new property corner monument will be provided where an existing recorded monument, or an unrecorded monument set by a professional land surveyor (PLS) prior to the Recording Act of 1973 (RCW 58.09), has been invalidated as a direct result of a right of way purchase by the department. The property corner monument will be set on the new right of way line or at a point in reference thereto. Property corner monuments may also be set at the location of new acquisitions such as wetlands or stormwater mitigation sites or properties shown on Sundry Site Plans. The new property corner monument shall be set by or under the direct supervision of a licensed PLS. When any property corner monument is set, the licensed land surveyor shall file a Record of Survey with the county auditor. A copy of the recorded Record of Survey is sent to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section and HQ Real Estate Services.

Monumentation
410.06 Other Monuments A DNR permit is required before any monument may be removed or destroyed. Existing section corners and BLM or GLO monuments impacted by a project shall be reset to perpetuate their existence. After completing the work, a DNR Land Corner Record is required. Other permanent monuments established by any other governmental agency must not be disturbed until the agency has been contacted to determine specific requirements for the monument. If assistance is needed to identify a monument, contact the HQ GeoMetrix Office. Resetting monuments must be done by or under the direct supervision of a licensed professional engineer or a licensed professional land surveyor. If a Record of Survey is prepared, it will be filed with the county auditor in the county in which the monument is located. If a Monumentation Map is prepared, it is filed with the county engineer in the county in which the monument is located, and a recorded copy is sent to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. The HQ Right of Way Plans Section will forward a copy to DNR for its records.
410.07 Filing Requirements 410.07(1) DNR Permit When a DNR permit is required, use the application form shown in Exhibit 410-2. The completed application must be signed by a licensed professional engineer or a licensed professional land surveyor and submitted to DNR. The DNR permit applications can be downloaded in TIFF, PDF, or Word format at the following website: https://www.dnr.wa.gov/public-land-survey-office Monumentation work cannot be done until DNR has approved the permit. In extraordinary circumstances, verbal authorization may be granted by DNR pending the issuance of a written permit. After resetting the monument, the survey method used must be filed with DNR using the completion report form shown in Exhibit 410-3. The form is to be signed by a licensed professional engineer or a licensed professional land surveyor.
410.07(2) Monumentation Map When a Monumentation Map is required, a plan sheet is prepared. Generally, the plan sheet is based on a right of way plan obtained from the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. A Monumentation Map contains a description of all new and existing monuments indicating their kind, size, and location. In addition, it must contain the seal and signature of a licensed professional engineer or a licensed professional land surveyor (see the Plans Preparation Manual). A copy of a Monumentation Map is filed with the county engineer in the county in which the monument is located, and a recorded copy is sent to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. The HQ Right of Way Plans Section will forward a copy to DNR for its records.
410.07(3) Land Corner Record When a Land Corner Record is required, use the forms shown in Exhibit 410-4. The completed forms are to be signed and stamped by a licensed professional engineer or a licensed professional land surveyor and submitted to the county auditor for the county in which the monument is located.

510.01 General Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Real Estate Services personnel participate in the project definition phase of a project to assist in minimizing right of way costs, defining route locations and acquisition areas, and determining potential problems and possible solutions. Due to the variables in land acquisition, the categories of right of way costs considered in the project definition phase are:
•
•
•
Purchase costs (acquisition compensation). Relocation assistance benefits payments. Other Real Estate Services staff expenses (acquisition services, relocation services, and interim property management services).
Right of way cost estimates are made by Real Estate Services specialists. When the parcels from which additional right of way will be acquired are known, title reports (including assessors’ land areas) can be requested. Real Estate Services personnel also make project field inspections at appropriate times throughout the development of a project to ensure adequate consideration is given to significant right of way elements involved (including possible social, economic, and environmental effects) in accordance with the Right of Way Manual. During plan development:
•
•
•
•
•
Title reports are examined for easements or other encumbrances that would reveal the existence and location of water lines, conduits, drainage or irrigation lines, and so on, that must be provided for in construction. Easements that indicate other affected ownerships are added to the right of way and limited access plan. Arrangements are made to obtain utility, railroad, haul road, detour routes, or other essential agreements, as instructed in the Utilities Manual and the Agreements Manual (Consultants: Please contact your WSDOT Project Manager for access to the Agreements Manual). Right of way acquisition, disposal, and maintenance are planned. Easements and permits are planned (to accommodate activities outside of the right of way).
Engineering considerations for right of way are contained in many chapters in this manual. Examples include chapters in the 700 series related to bridges and walls and in Chapter 1230. (See Chapter 1102 as a recommended first read for discussion of right of way.) Preliminary right of way widths are developed and may be modified based on Real Estate Services’ input, but cannot be moved to coincide with property boundaries in anticipation of a total take. Jogs in the final widths of the right of way are held to a minimum. (See Right of Way Manual, Chapter 6, for discussion of remainders.)

All acquisition documents are processed through Headquarters (HQ) Real Estate Services except temporary permits that are not shown on right of way plans and are not needed for the project (such as for driveway connections).
510.01(1) Environmental Site Assessments (New Section 2023) Environmental site assessments are required before acquisition of real property required for transportation purposes can be accomplished. These assessments are described in Chapter 447 of the Environmental Manual and occur in different scales and levels of detail, starting with the lowest level of detail with 1) transaction screening, then moving to 2) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, and 3) Phase II Environmental Site Assessment. The sequence and timing of these assessments is related to the type of property and/or property rights to be acquired and project activities envisioned, and state of progress in design. At a minimum, a project footprint needs to be established in order to estimate the scope of property acquisitions that are involved. Once a decision is made to acquire a permanent interest in a property, or to acquire a temporary interest where ground or water disturbance is anticipated as a result of project related actions, perform a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment and determine whether there is a finding of concern. In the case of a temporary acquisition in which there is no ground or water disturbance anticipated, perform a transaction screening instead. If an assessment does not result in a finding of concern, then the project may proceed to acquire the property and/or property rights. If any assessment results in a finding of concern, then perform the next level of environmental assessment (either Phase I or Phase II). When a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment is performed, and one of the results is that contamination is found, consult with the appropriate representatives from the Environmental Services Office, and Real Estate Services Office to do a risk assessment to fully understand the impact and consequences to the project from acquiring the property and/or property rights and available alternatives. The Environmental Services Office and Real Estate Services Office will consult with Attorney General’s Office as needed. Any decision to acquire the property and/or property rights after contamination is found is made by the Assistant Region Administrator.
510.02 Special Features 510.02(1) Road Approaches On managed access highways, the department will reconstruct legally existing road approaches that are removed or destroyed as part of the highway construction. New approaches required by new highway construction are negotiated by the region with the approval of the Regional Administrator. The negotiator coordinates with the region’s design section to ensure new approaches conform to the requirements of Chapter 1340 for road approaches. All new approaches will be by permit through the appropriate region office. On limited access highways, road approaches of any type must be approved by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, before there is legal basis for negotiation by Real Estate Services. When approved, approaches will be specifically reserved in the right of way transaction and will contain the identical limitations set by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, and as shown on the approved right of way and limited access plan.

Right of Way Considerations
510.02(2) Cattle Passes The desirability of or need for a cattle pass will be considered during the appraisal or negotiation process. A cattle pass will be approved only after complete studies of location, utilization, cost, and safety elements have proved its necessity. Upon approval, such an improvement and appurtenant rights will be established. Future right of access for maintenance is negotiated during acquisition. On limited access highways, approval by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, and the addition of a traffic movement note on the right of way and limited access plan (see the Plans Preparation Manual) are required.
510.02(3) Pit, Stockpile, and Waste Sites These sites are investigated and planned as outlined in the Plans Preparation Manual. Detour and haul road agreements, approved by the Regional Administrator, are necessary when the state proposes to use city streets or county roads for the purpose of detouring traffic or hauling certain materials. (See the Utilities Manual for detour and haul road agreement guidelines.)
510.02(4) International Boundaries Construction proposed “within a 20-foot strip, 10 feet on each side of the international boundary,” must be coordinated between the department and the British Columbia Ministry of Highways and Public Works. Permission of the International Boundary Commission is required to work “within 10 feet of an international boundary.” Their primary concern is monumentation of the boundary line and the line of sight between monuments. The Commission requires a written request stating what, when, and why construction will be done, sent to: International Boundary Commission United States and Canada 2000 L Street NW, Suite 615 Washington, DC 20036 (www.internationalboundarycommission.org)
510.03 Easements and Permits 510.03(1) General If others request rights within existing WSDOT ownership, they are to contact the region Real Estate Services Office. Easements and permits to accommodate WSDOT activities outside the right of way usually fall into one of the categories defined below. Easements and permits are processed in accordance with the requirements of the Right of Way Manual. The region Real Estate Services Office drafts the legal descriptions for all easements and permits for acquisition of property and property rights. HQ Real Estate Services drafts the legal description for all easements and permits for disposition of property or property rights. The region Real Estate Services Office either obtains or assists in obtaining easements and permits. The region is responsible for compliance with and appropriate retention of the final documents. Records of permanent property rights acquired are maintained by HQ Real Estate Services. Easements and permits are to be shown on the contract plans in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual.

Right of Way Considerations
510.03(2) Perpetual Easements Perpetual easements are shown on the right of way plans in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual.
510.03(2)(a) State Maintenance Easement Used when the state is to construct a facility and provide all maintenance. Examples are slope and drainage easements.
510.03(2)(b) Dual Maintenance Easement Used when the state is to construct and maintain a facility and the owner is to maintain the remainder. Examples include the surface area above a tunnel and the area behind a retaining wall or noise wall.
510.03(2)(c) Transfer Easement On occasion an easement must be acquired for transfer to another party. In these cases, contact the region Real Estate Services Office for early involvement. The right of way and limited access plan is modified to identify the party to whom the easement will be transferred. The department cannot obtain easements for transfer across lands under the jurisdiction of the Department of Natural Resources, and WSDOT cannot condemn for a transfer easement.
510.03(3) Temporary Easements Temporary easements are used when the state requires a temporary property right that involves either more than minor work or construction activities on privately owned property. In the cases where the rights required or the work to be performed is not beneficial to the property owner, just compensation must be paid. When WSDOT is paying for the rights or when the encroachment is significant, temporary easements are shown on the right of way plans, in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual. Consult the region Plans and Real Estate Services personnel for exceptions. If the easement is not mapped, mark and submit plans according to the following information.
•
•
•
•
•
•
The region provides a right of way plan with the required temporary easement(s) delineated in red to the region Real Estate Services Office. These plan sheets provide: Ownership boundaries. Confirmation of ownership and parcel boundaries may be completed by a search of county records and mapping; a formal title report is required for temporary easements. A parcel number assigned to each ownership. Sufficient engineering detail to write legal descriptions. A statement of the intended use of each temporary easement area. In limited access areas, contact the HQ Access and Hearings Office.
510.03(4) Construction Permits Construction permits are used for temporary rights during construction. They are not used when WSDOT needs a perpetual right. A construction permit is only valid with the current owner and must be renegotiated if property ownership changes before construction begins. For private ownerships, a temporary construction easement is recommended. A construction permit is recommended for rights of entry to publicly owned property. Local agencies might require the use of specific forms when applying for these rights of entry. Regardless of the form or its name, the region is responsible for appropriate central storage of the original document.

Right of Way Considerations
When there is a benefit to the property owner (for example, driveway or parking lot approach improvements) the construction permit is usually obtained without the payment of compensation (for example, donation or mutual benefits). Consult the region Plans and Real Estate Services offices for exceptions.
510.04 Programming for Funds For plan development, the phases in Exhibit 510-1 apply to the authorization of stage programming. When federal funds are involved, special attention must be given to Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) requirements. When federal participation in right of way costs is anticipated, specific authorization must be obtained from the FHWA. The rules and procedures provided in RCW 8.26, WAC 468-100, and the Right of Way Manual must be followed to ensure federal and state participation. In many cases, federal funds are contingent upon the department setting up a relocation advisory procedure for any owner or tenant who is displaced by a project and desires such assistance. Relocation advisory assistance is a function of HQ Real Estate Services.
510.05 Appraisal and Acquisition 510.05(1) All Highways Exhibit 510-1 shows plan development phases for both limited access highways and managed access highways; thus, it applies to the authorization of right of way acquisition for all state highways.
510.05(2) Exceptions Exceptions can be made to the requirements in Exhibit 510-1 if unusual hardships result for the individual or the state. The approval of right of way hardship action will be based on the individual parcel merit and is processed in accordance with hardship acquisition policy (see the Right of Way Manual).
510.06 Transactions 510.06(1) Private Ownerships Right of way is ordinarily acquired from private property owners by region-level negotiation between the owner and the right of way agent.
510.06(2) Utilities The region determines the ownership of all utilities and makes arrangements for necessary adjustment, including relocation of portions of the utility, if necessary. Provisions for relocation or adjustment are included in the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) when:
•
•
The items are normal construction items and the department is obligated for the moving expense. The utility requests that relocation be performed by the department and the department has approved the request.
Readjustment may require WSDOT to purchase substitute rights of way or easements for eventual transfer to the utility. Such rights of way or easements must be shown on the right of way plans with the same engineering detail as highway right of way. On limited access highways, if an approach is required for maintenance of a utility, the approach will be shown on the approach schedule. (See the Utilities Accommodation Policy regarding location of and access to utilities.) Negotiations with the utilities are often done by HQ Real Estate Services.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 510-5
Chapter 510
Right of Way Considerations
Because of the considerable time required to obtain approvals, processing of utility relocation agreements must begin as soon as possible.
510.06(3) Railways Right of way is generally not acquired in fee from a railroad company. Instead, the state acquires a perpetual easement for encroachment or crossing. A construction and maintenance agreement may also be required. The easement must be shown on the right of way plan and identified by both highway and railroad stationing. The HQ Design Office coordinates with the railroad design staff to determine a mutually agreeable location before the proposed easement is sent to Real Estate Services. The negotiations with the railroads are generally done by HQ Real Estate Services. Because of the considerable time required to obtain approvals, processing of railroad agreements must begin as soon as possible. The perpetual easement document is executed by the Real Estate Services Director.
510.06(4) Federal Agencies Acquisition of right of way from most federal agencies must be negotiated and processed through several federal offices. Allow at least one year for efficient and economical right of way acquisition. Depending upon the particular federal agency involved, special exhibit maps and other documentation may be required, and the right of way may be acquired as an easement rather than in fee. The negotiations with the federal agencies are generally done by HQ Real Estate Services.
510.06(5) Other State Agencies Acquisition from other state agencies must be negotiated and processed through the individual agencies or designees. Negotiations with other state agencies are generally handled by HQ Real Estate Services. As in the case of federal agencies, substantial time must be allowed for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations peculiar to the agency before right of way will be granted.
510.06(6) Condemnations Condemnation can result from a disagreement between the department and the owner regarding a fair settlement or a faulty title. Since several months might elapse between the filing of a condemnation case and a court decision, the region Real Estate Services Office can be requested to investigate the possibility of obtaining a negotiated possession and use agreement as in the case of an emergency project or when a sundry site is required immediately.

Access Control Exhibit 520-1 Access Control Vocabulary
520.01 General The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) controls access to the state’s highways (with a few exceptions) in order to preserve the safety and efficiency of these highways as well as the public investment. All Washington State highways are distinguished as being either limited access or managed access highways. Control of access is accomplished by either acquiring rights of access from abutting property owners (limited access control) or by regulating access connections to the highway (managed access control). Until limited access rights have been acquired from abutting property owners, the route is a managed access highway. Managed access permits are issued either by a local authority (city or town) or by WSDOT. Numerous studies have shown that controlling and limiting access to highways is a cost-effective way to help maintain the safety, capacity, and functional integrity of a highway. Adding more lanes to an existing highway is expensive and frequently not possible. Controlling access to our state highways by promoting the use of frontage roads or other existing county or city roads, and advocating the internal shared circulation within adjacent developments, is a proactive and cost-effective way to accomplish this objective. WSDOT has been purchasing access rights and implementing limited access control since 1951 (RCW 47.52). While this has been effective, it is an expensive way to control access to the state highway system. Adequate funding to accomplish the purchasing of access rights has not kept up with the state’s continual population growth and land use development over the years. As a result, state lawmakers introduced a bill in the early 1990s recognizing that controlling access to the state highway system by regulation was a cost-effective means to preserve the safety and capacity of our state highway system. In 1991, the Legislature passed and the Governor approved RCW 47.50, titled “Highway access management.” This new law directed WSDOT to develop new rules to be included in the Washington Administrative Code for those state highways not already limited access highways. The result was a new class of access control called managed access. Chapter 530 describes limited access highways in greater detail. Chapter 540 describes managed access highways in greater detail. The following references and definitions apply to Washington’s access control as presented in Chapter 530 and Chapter 540.

Access Control
520.03 Definitions Access: A means of entering or leaving a public road, street, or highway with respect to abutting property or another public road, street, or highway. Access Control: The limiting and regulating of public and private access to Washington State’s highways, as required by state law. Access Control Tracking System Limited Access and Managed Access Master Plan: A database list, related to highway route numbers and mileposts, that identifies either the level of limited access or the class of managed access: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-access-requests-training Access Connection: See Approach and Access Connection. Access Connection Permit: A written authorization issued by the permitting authority for a specifically designed access connection to a managed access highway at a specific location; for a specific type and intensity of property use; and for a specific volume of traffic for the access connection based on the final stage of the development of the applicant’s property. The actual form used for this authorization is determined by the permitting authority. Access Design Analysis: A design analysis (see Chapter 300) that authorizes deferring or staging acquisition of limited access control, falling short of a 300-foot requirement, or allowing an existing access point to stay within 130 feet of an intersection on a limited access highway. Approval by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, is required (see Chapter 530). Access Hearing Plan: A limited access plan prepared for presentation at an access hearing. Access Point: Any point that allows private or public entrance to or exit from the traveled way of a state highway, including “locked gate” access and maintenance access points. Access Point Spacing: On a managed access highway, the distance between two adjacent access points on one side of the highway, measured along the edge of the traveled way from one access point to the next (see also corner clearance). Access Report Plan: A limited access plan prepared for presentation to local governmental officials at preliminary meetings before preparation of the access hearing plan. Access Rights: Property rights that allow an abutting property owner to enter and leave the public roadway system. Allowed: Authorized. Application for an Access Connection: An application provided by the permitting authority to be completed by the applicant for access to a managed access highway. Approach and Access Connection: These terms are listed under the specific access section to which they apply. The first section below is for limited access highways and uses the term approach. The second section below is for managed access highways and uses the term access connection. Approaches and access connections include any ability to leave or enter a highway right of way other than at an intersection with another road or street. (a) Limited Access Highways: Approach: An access point, other than a public road/street, that allows access to or from a limited access highway on the state highway system. There are five types of approaches to limited access highways that are allowed:
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 520
•
•
•
•
•
•
Access Control
Type A An off and on approach in a legal manner, not to exceed 30 feet in width, for the sole purpose of serving a single-family residence. It may be reserved by the abutting owner for specified use at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed on partial and modified control limited access highways. Type B An off and on approach in a legal manner, not to exceed 50 feet in width, for use necessary to the normal operation of a farm, but not for retail marketing. It may be reserved by the abutting owner for specified use at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed on partial and modified control limited access highways. This approach type may be used for wind farms when use of the approach is limited to those vehicles necessary to construct and maintain the farm for use in harvesting wind energy. Type C An off and on approach in a legal manner, for a special purpose and width to be agreed upon. It may be specified at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed on partial and modified control limited access highways and on full control limited access highways where no other reasonable means of access exists, as solely determined by the department. Type D An off and on approach in a legal manner, not to exceed 50 feet in width, for use necessary to the normal operation of a commercial establishment. It may be specified at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed only on modified control limited access highways. Type E This type is no longer allowed to be constructed because of the requirements that there be only one access point per parcel on a limited access state highway. Type F An off and on approach in a legal manner, not to exceed 30 feet in width, for the sole purpose of serving a wireless communication site. It may be specified at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed only on partial control limited access highways. (See WAC 468-58-080(vi) for further restrictions.)
(b) Managed Access Highways: Access Connection: An access point, other than a public road/ street, that permits access to or from a managed access highway on the state highway system. There are five types of access connection permits:
•
•
•
•
•
Conforming Access Connection: A connection to a managed access highway that meets current WAC and WSDOT location, spacing, and design criteria. Grandfathered Access Connection: Any connection to the state highway system that was in existence and in active use on July 1, 1990, and has not had a significant change in use. Joint-use Access Connection: A single connection to a managed access highway that serves two or more properties. Nonconforming Access Connection: A connection to a managed access highway that does not meet current WSDOT location, spacing, or design criteria, pending availability of a future conforming access connection. Variance Access Connection: A connection to a managed access highway at a location not normally allowed by current WSDOT criteria.
(c) Managed Access Connection Category: There are four access connection permit categories for managed access connections to state highways: Category I, Category II, Category III, and Category IV (see Chapter 540).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Access Control
Annual Daily Traffic (ADT): The volume of traffic passing a point or segment of a highway, in both directions, during a period of time, divided by the number of days in the period, and factored to represent an estimate of traffic volume for an average day of the year. Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT): The average volume of traffic passing a point or segment of a highway, in both directions, during a year. Average Weekday Vehicle Trip Ends (AWDVTE): The estimated total of all trips entering plus all trips leaving the applicant’s site based on the final stage of proposed development. Connection: See approach and access connection. Contiguous Parcels: Two or more pieces of real property, under the same ownership, with one or more boundaries that touch and have similarity of use. Corner Clearance: On a managed access highway, the distance from an intersection of a public road or street to the nearest access connection along the same side of the highway. The minimum corner clearance distance (see Chapter 540, Exhibit 540-2 ) is measured from the closest edge of the intersecting road or street to the closest edge of the traveled way of the access connection, measured along one side of the traveled way (through lanes) (see also access point spacing). DHV: Design hourly volume. E&EP: WSDOT’s Environmental and Engineering Programs Division. Easement: A documented right, as a right of way, to use the property of another for designated purposes. Findings and Order (F&O): A legal package containing information based on the hearing record from a limited access hearing (see Chapter 210 and Chapter 530). Findings and Order (F&O) Plan: A limited access plan, prepared after a limited access hearing, which is based on the hearing record. HQ: WSDOT’s Headquarters in Olympia. Intersection: An at-grade access point connecting a state highway with a road or street duly established as a public road or public street by the local governmental entity. Limited Access: Full, partial, or modified access control is planned and established for each corridor and then acquired as the right to limit access to each individual parcel.
•
•
•
Planned Limited Access Control: Limited access control is planned for some time in the future; however, no access hearing has been held. Established Limited Access Control: An access hearing has been held and the Assistant Secretary, Environmental and Engineering & Regional Operations Programs Director, has adopted the findings and order, which establishes the limits and level of control. Acquired Limited Access Control: Access rights have been purchased.

Access Control
Limited Access Highway: All highways listed as “Established L/A” on the Limited Access and Managed Access Master Plan (see below) and where the rights of direct access to or from abutting lands have been acquired from the abutting landowners.
•
•
•
Full Access Control: This most restrictive level of limited access provides access, using interchanges, for selected public roads/streets only, and prohibits highway intersections at grade. Partial Access Control: The second most restrictive level of limited access. At grade intersections with selected public roads are allowed, and there may be some crossings and some driveway approaches at grade. Direct commercial access is not allowed. Modified Access Control: The least restrictive level of limited access. Characteristics are the same as for partial access control except that direct commercial access is allowed.
Limited Access and Managed Access Master Plan: A map of Washington State that shows established and planned limited access highways: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-access-requests-training Managed Access Highway: Any highway not listed as “Established L/A” on the Limited Access and Managed Access Master Plan and any highway or portion of a highway designated on the plan as “Established L/A” until such time as the limited access rights are acquired. Under managed access legislation, the property owner’s access rights are regulated through an access connection permitting process. Median: The portion of a divided highway separating vehicular traffic traveling in opposite directions. Median Opening: An opening in a continuous median for the specific purpose of allowing vehicle movement. MOU: Memorandum of Understanding. There is one MOU (Highways Over National Forest Lands) between the United States Forest Service (USFS) and WSDOT that requires the USFS to obtain a road approach permit for new access to a state highway that is crossing Forest Service land. Permit Holder: The abutting property owner or other legally authorized person to whom an access connection permit is issued by the permitting authority. Permitted Access Connection: A connection for which an access connection permit has been issued by a permitting authority. Permitting Authority: The agency that has legal authority to issue managed access connection permits. For access connections in unincorporated areas, the permitting authority is WSDOT; for access connections within corporate limits, the permitting authority is a city or town. Right of Way (R/W): A general term denoting land or interest therein, acquired for or designated for transportation purposes. More specifically, lands that have been dedicated for public transportation purposes or land in which WSDOT, a county, or a municipality owns the fee simple title, has an easement devoted to or required for use as a public road/street and appurtenant facilities, or has established ownership by prescriptive right. Right of way and Limited Access Plan (R/W and L/A plan): A right of way plan that also shows limited access control details. Road Approach: A road or driveway built to provide private access to or from the state highway system. Shoulder: The portion of the highway contiguous with the traveled lanes for the accommodation of stopped vehicles for emergency use and, where allowed, for bicycles (see Chapter 530). State Highway System: All roads, streets, and highways designated as state routes in compliance with RCW 47.17.

520.04 Vocabulary The entries shown in Exhibit 520-1 are examples of suitable wording for the distinctly different types of access control in Chapter 530 and Chapter 540. These entries demonstrate the difference in terminology between limited access and managed access in the applicable WACs. For instance, there is nothing about permit, connection, category, or class in the limited access vocabulary and, likewise, nothing about approach or type in the managed access vocabulary. Also note that Chapter 1340 uses road approach, access, and driveway in a generic way, unrelated to WAC legal terminology, and makes no distinction related to access control.

530.01 General Limited access control is established to preserve the safety performance and efficiency of specific highways for all modes and to preserve the public investment. Limited access control is achieved by acquiring rights of direct access to or from abutting property owners and by selectively limiting a right of access, to a highway, considering all modes in the control and treatment of access. (For an overview of access control and the references list and definitions of terminology for this chapter, see Chapter 520, Access Control.) Requirements for the establishment of limited access highways are set forth in the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 47.52. The type of access control applied to a location is considered a design control (see Chapter 1103), and is determined during planning, scoping, or the early stages of design in conformance with this chapter. Highways controlled by acquiring rights of direct access to or from abutting property and by selectively limiting a right of access are termed limited access highways and are further distinguished as having full, partial, or modified control. The title to the right of way for limited access facilities vests in the state (pursuant to RCW 47.52.210). The number of access points per mile, the spacing of interchanges or intersections, and the location of frontage roads or local road/street/ shared-use path approaches are determined by the:

Functional classification and importance of the highway Context-based modal priorities and relevant considerations Character of the traffic Current adjacent land use and future planned changes to land use Environment and aesthetics Highway design, operation, safety, and connectivity for all modes Economic considerations involved
530.02 Achieving Limited Access 530.02(1) Evaluation The benefits of maintaining or acquiring full, partial, or modified control are to be evaluated during project development if the route is shown in the Access Control Tracking System Limited Access and Managed Access Master Plan database as either “established” or “planned” for limited access. It is generally known that full limited access control applies to interstates and freeways. However, state highways that do not fall under full access control may have more flexibility in the type of control applied (whether limited or managed control). These highways can benefit by having access control evaluations conducted early in planning and project development.

Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
The cost of acquiring limited access is evaluated to determine whether those costs will be included in the project. The evaluation includes the societal costs of crashes, current and future land use development, and the improved level of service for motor vehicle traffic of limited access highways. Use the Basis of Design documentation tool to summarize key results of the evaluation process, considering connectivity, mobility, safety and accessibility for all modes. (See chapters in the 1100 series for more information on using the Basis of Design tool.)
530.02(2) Process All Washington State highways are managed access highways (see Chapter 540), except where limited access rights have been acquired. The right of way and limited access plans for routes show the acquired limited access boundaries. This is further represented in the Access Control Tracking System, a database that identifies the status and type of access control for all state highways. The database lists the specific types of limited access control (full, partial, or modified) and identifies whether the control is planned, established, or acquired for a specific route segment. If limited access has not been acquired, the database reports the type of managed access classification that currently applies. The existing access classification is periodically updated to reflect changes on a corridor segment. The planned limited access reflects the vision for access on a corridor by resolution from the Washington Transportation Commission in the 1960s and 1970s. Conditions may have changed since the plan for limited access was envisioned. It is important to re-evaluate this plan and determine the access design control most appropriate for the agreed context. (See Chapter 1102 and Chapter 1103 for context and design control guidance, respectively.) For help determining the status of limited access control for any state highway, consult the Headquarters (HQ) Access and Hearings Section. The Access Master Plan database is available at: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-accessrequests-training

Limited Access Control
530.02(2)(a) Procedure for Limited Access Control Use the following procedure to achieve limited access control: 1. The Secretary of Transportation (or a designee) first identifies a highway as “Planned for Limited Access.” 2. To establish or revise limited access on a new or existing highway, either a limited access hearing is held or waivers are obtained. (See Chapter 210 regarding hearings, and Chapter 510 for the phases of appraisal and acquisition.) a. Phase 1 The region develops a limited access report and a limited access report plan for department approval and presentation to local officials. The plan notes the level of limited access proposed to be established. b. Phase 2 The region develops a limited access hearing plan for Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division (or designee), approval and for presentation at the hearing. c. Phase 3 After the hearing, the region develops the findings and order and revises the limited access hearing plan to become the findings and order plan (see Chapter 210). The findings and order is processed and sent to the HQ Access and Hearings Section for review and approval. The Assistant Secretary, Regions and Mega Programs/Chief Engineer, adopts the findings and order and thus establishes the limits and level of limited access control to be acquired. d. Phase 4 The findings and order plan is now revised by the HQ Right of Way Plans Section for approval by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division (or designee), as a Phase 4 final right of way and limited access plan. 3. Real Estate Services acquires limited access rights from individual property owners based on final design decisions and updates the right of way and limited access plans and the property deed. 4. These highways or portions thereof are now limited access highways and no longer fall under the managed access program.
530.02(3) Access Report The Access Report (RCW 47.52.131) is developed by the region to legally inform local governmental officials of the proposed limited access highway and the principal access features involved, and to secure their approval. This report is not furnished to abutting property owners. Submit the report to the HQ Access and Hearings Section for review and approval prior to submission to local authorities. Including local agencies as stakeholders from the onset of the project helps establish project expectations and positive working relationships, making reviews and approvals run as smoothly as possible.

530.02(3)(a) Access Report Content The Access Report consists of the following: 1. A description of the existing and proposed highways, including data on the history of the existing highway, which may include references to safety analyses and also locations identified in WSDOT’s priority programming process. 2. Traffic analyses pertaining to the proposed highway, including available information about current and potential future motor vehicle, pedestrian, bicyclist, transit, and freight traffic volumes on county roads and city streets crossing or severed by the proposed highway and reference sources such as origin-destination surveys. Traffic data, together with counts of existing traffic available from state or local records, is normally adequate for motor vehicle analysis. Special counts of existing traffic are obtained only if circumstances indicate that the available data is inadequate or outdated. Data for pedestrian and bicyclist traffic may rely on demographics, land-use context, and an analysis of the active transportation network where volume information is not available. 3. A discussion of factors affecting the design of the subject highway, including:

Limited Access Control
The limited access report plan shows the effects of the proposed highway on the street and road system, transit service and pedestrian/bicyclist network by delineating the points of public access. (See the Plans Preparation Manual for a list of the minimum details to be shown on the plan and for a sample plan.) 7. Notifications and reviews. Upon receipt of the Phase 1 approval (see Exhibit 510-1) from the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, the region publishes the necessary copies, submits the limited access report to the county or city officials for review and approval, and meets with all involved local governmental agencies to discuss the report. Providing a form letter with a signature block for the local agency to use to indicate its approval of the limited access report can help expedite the review and approval process. The region reviews any requests for modification and submits recommendations, with copies of any correspondence or related minutes, to the HQ Access and Hearings Section.
530.02(4) Limited Access Hearing Plan The region prepares a limited access hearing plan to be used as an exhibit at the public hearing (see Chapter 210 for hearings) and forwards it to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section for review. (See the Plans Preparation Manual for a list of data to be shown on the access hearing plan in addition to the access report plan data.) When the plan review is completed by Headquarters, the access hearing plan is placed before the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, for approval of Phase 2 authority (see Exhibit 510-1).
530.02(5) Documentation Documentation for the establishment of limited access control is in Chapter 210.
530.03 Full Control (Most Restrictive) 530.03(1) Introduction Full control limited access highways allow access only through interchanges at selected public roads/streets, rest areas, viewpoints, or weigh stations, and by prohibiting at-grade crossings and approaches. At times, on state highways (except interstate) where full access control has been established, staged acquisition of limited access may be used, subject to the approval of an access design analysis, with initial acquisition as partial or modified control and with ultimate acquisition of full control planned on the highway. When there is no feasible alternative within a reasonable cost, the decision to defer acquisition of limited access control must be documented and is subject to the approval of an access design analysis.
530.03(2) Application Terminate full control limited access sections at apparent logical points of design change. The following guidelines are to be used for the application of full control on limited access highways.
530.03(2)(a) Interstate Full control is required on interstate highways.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-5
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.03(2)(b) Principal Arterial Documentation assessing the evaluation of full control is required for principal arterial highways requiring four or more through traffic lanes within a 20-year design period unless approved for partial or modified control on existing highways.
530.03(2)(c) Minor Arterial and Collector Minor arterial and collector highways will not normally be considered for development to full control. However, short sections of full control to preserve the operational and safety performance of all modes may be appropriate in some situations.
530.03(3) Crossroads at Interchange Ramps At interchanges where ramps terminate with crossroads, limited access control will extend along crossroads, and in certain cases along local service or frontage roads (as shown in Exhibit 530-1 through Exhibit 530-6). This establishes the Interchange Functional Area, for the preservation of operational and safety performance of the interchange asset. For guidance on interchange spacing, see Chapter 1360.
530.03(3)(a) Ramps At-grade intersections and approaches are prohibited within the full length of any interchange ramp. The ramp is considered to terminate at its intersection with the local road or street.
530.03(3)(b) Frontage Roads Direct access from the highway to a local service or frontage road is allowed only via the interchange crossroad (see Exhibit 530-1, Exhibit 530-2, Exhibit 530-3, and Exhibit 530-6).
530.03(3)(c) Interchange Crossroads In both urban and rural areas, full control limited access must be established and then acquired along the crossroad at an interchange for a minimum distance of 300 feet. This distance is measured from the centerline of the intersection of the crossroad and ramp terminal unless noted otherwise in the conditions below. Control designs in all crossroad contexts should address and incorporate connectivity for shared-use paths, trails and sidewalks in and beyond the control area. If a frontage road or local road is located at or within 350 feet of a ramp terminal, limited access will be established and then acquired up to the intersection, then along the crossroad and for an additional minimum distance of 130 feet in all directions from the centerline of the intersection of the crossroad and the frontage or local road, or measured from the center for roundabouts (see Exhibit 530-1, Exhibit 530-2, Exhibit 530-3, and Exhibit 530-6). For interchanges incorporating partial cloverleaf or buttonhook ramps (see Exhibit 530-2), limited access is required for all portions of the crossroad and frontage roads between the ramp terminals and for a distance of 300 feet beyond the ramp terminals. If an at-grade intersection for a local road or street is served directly opposite the ramp terminals, limited access will be extended for a minimum of 300 feet along that leg of the intersection. When the intersection in question is a roundabout, see Exhibit 530-3. This shows extension of full control along the crossroad to be 300 feet, measured from the center of the roundabout for an intersection with a ramp terminal.

Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
Exhibit 530-4 shows the terminus of transition taper and that full control limited access is extended a minimum distance of 300 feet beyond the end of the farthest taper. For a single point urban interchange (SPUI) with a right- or left-turn “ramp branch” separated by islands, limited access control is established and acquired for a minimum distance of 300 feet from the intersection of the centerline of the ramp branch with the centerline of the nearest directional roadway (see Exhibit 530-5.) For a diverging diamond interchange, limited access control is established and acquired for a minimum distance of 300 feet from the end of the splitter island nose (see Exhibit 530-6). Not all interchange configurations match with the basic illustrations in this chapter. Consult with the HQ Access and Hearings Section for confirmation of limited access boundary requirements for non-traditional interchange configurations.
530.03(3)(d) Levels of Limited Access: Location of Approaches Provide full control for a minimum of 300 feet from the centerline of the ramp or terminus of a transition taper (see Exhibit 530-1 through Exhibit 530-6). The intent is to ensure approaches are far enough away from a frontage road intersection to provide efficient intersection operation. If the economic considerations to implement full control for the entire 300 feet are excessive, then provide full control for at least the first 130 feet; partial or modified control may be provided for the remainder, for a total minimum distance of 300 feet of limited access. Full limited access should be extended as far as possible before any partial or modified access is implemented. Contact the HQ Access and Hearings Section when considering this option. An approved access design analysis is required if the limited access control falls short of 300 feet or for any approach that has been allowed to remain within the first 130 feet.
530.03(4) Location of Utilities, Bus Stops, and Mailboxes 530.03(4)(a) Utilities Connecting utility lines are allowed along the outer right of way line between intermittent frontage roads. (See the Utilities Accommodation Policy regarding the location of and access to utilities.)
530.03(4)(b) Bus Stops Common carrier or school bus stops are not allowed, except at:
•
•
•
Railroad crossings (see Chapter 1350). Locations provided by the state on the interchanges (such as flyer stops). In exceptional cases, along the main roadway where pedestrian separation is available.
530.03(4)(c) Mailboxes Mailboxes are not allowed on full control limited access highways. Mail delivery will be from frontage roads or other adjacent local roads.
530.03(5) Pedestrian and Bicyclist Crossings and Paths All pedestrian and bicyclist traffic is managed as follows:
•
•
At-grade pedestrian and bicyclist crossings are allowed only at the at-grade intersections of ramp terminals. Pedestrian and bicyclist separations or other facilities are provided specifically for pedestrian and bicyclist use.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 530

•
Limited Access Control
Shared-use paths serving bicyclists, pedestrians, and other forms of active transportation. See Chapter 1515. Bicyclists use the right-hand shoulders or other facilities as shown in Chapter 1520, except where such use has been specifically prohibited. Information pertaining to such prohibition is available from the WSDOT website: wsdot.wa.gov/bike/closed.htm
Coordinate with the local agency when planning and designing a shared-use path and the access points within a limited access highway. Pedestrians and bicyclists are allowed, consistent with “Rules of the Road” (RCW 46.61), within the limits of full control limited access highways. Where existing or future planned paths are allowed they must be documented on the right of way and limited access plan. The plan shows the location of the existing or proposed path and where the path crosses limited access and provides movement notes (see Section 530.10(1)). See Chapter 1515 for shared-use path design guidance.
530.04 Partial Control 530.04(1) Introduction Partial control may be established, when justified, on any highway except interstate. Partial control provides a considerable level of protection from motor vehicle traffic interference and protects the highway from future strip-type development while maintaining and improving appropriate active transportation network connections. Upon acquisition of partial control limited access rights, the number, type, and use of access approaches of abutting property are frozen. The abutting property access rights and type of use are recorded on the property deed. The rights and use may not be altered by the abutting property owner, the local jurisdiction, or the region. This authority resides with the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division (see Section 530.10).
530.04(2) Application Partial control will not normally be used in urban areas, urbanizing area, suburban area, rural town centers or inside corporate limits on existing principal arterial highways where motor vehicle traffic volumes are less than 700 design hourly volume (DHV). Terminate limited access sections at apparent logical points of design change.
530.04(2)(a) Principal Arterial Partial control is considered when the estimated motor vehicle traffic volumes exceed 3,000 average daily traffic (ADT) within a 20-year design period on principal arterial highways requiring two through motor vehicle traffic lanes. For multilane principal arterial highways, see Section 530.03(2)(b).
530.04(2)(b) Minor Arterial The minimum route length is: urban, 2 miles; rural, 5 miles; and combination urban and rural, 3 miles. Partial control is required on:
•
•
Rural minor arterial highways at both new and existing locations. Urban minor arterial highways at new locations requiring four or more through motor vehicle traffic lanes within a 20-year design period or requiring only two through motor vehicle traffic lanes where the estimated motor vehicle traffic volumes exceed 3,000 ADT within a 20-year design period.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-8
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
Other rural minor arterial highways with only two motor vehicle lanes may be considered for partial control if any of the following conditions applies:
•
•
•
The partial control can be acquired at a reasonable cost. The route connects two highways of a higher functional classification. The highway traverses publicly owned lands where partial control is desirable.
530.04(2)(c) Collector: New Alignment Partial control is considered on collector highways in new locations requiring four or more through motor vehicle traffic lanes in a 20-year design period
530.04(2)(d) Collector: Existing Existing collector highways will normally be considered for partial control limited access only when all of the following conditions apply:
•
•
•
The highway serves an area that is not directly served by a higher functional classification of highway. Existing or planned development will result in motor vehicle traffic volumes significantly higher than what is required for partial control on minor arterials. Partial control can be established without a major impact on development of abutting properties within the constraints of established zoning at the time the partial control is proposed.
530.04(3) Interchanges and Intersections 530.04(3)(a) Interchanges Where an interchange occurs on a partial control limited access highway, full control applies at the interchange and interchange ramps. Refer to Section 530.03(3) and see Exhibit 530-1, Exhibit 530-2, Exhibit 530-3, and Exhibit 530-6 for required minimum lengths of access control along the crossroad. For these and other interchange configurations not shown, consult with the HQ Access and Hearings Section for support developing limits of access control. (See Chapter 1360 for guidance on interchange spacing.) Where appropriate, address and incorporate connectivity for shared-use paths, trails and sidewalks in and beyond the control area.
530.04(3)(b) Intersections At an at-grade intersection on a partial control limited access highway, control will be established and acquired along the crossroad for a minimum distance of 300 feet from the centerline of the highway (see Exhibit 530-7). Where appropriate, address and incorporate connectivity for shared-use paths, trails and sidewalks in and beyond the control area. If another frontage or local road is located at or within 350 feet of the at-grade intersection, limited access will be established and then acquired along the crossroad, between the intersections, and:
•
•
For an additional minimum distance of 130 feet in all directions from the centerline of the intersection of the frontage or local road (see Exhibit 530-7). In the case of a roundabout, for an additional minimum distance of 300 feet along the crossroad, measured from the center of the roundabout or a minimum distance of 130 feet measured from the end of the slip lane radius or the end of the slip lane taper (as shown in Exhibit 530-8).
On multilane highways, measurements will be made from the centerline of the nearest directional roadway (see Exhibit 530-7).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-9
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
An approved access design analysis is required if the limited access control falls short of 300 feet or for any access that has been allowed to remain within the first 130 feet. At-grade intersections with public roads are limited to the number allowed for the functional classification of highway involved, as follows:
i Principal Arterial If the ADT of the crossroad is less than 2,000, 1-mile spacing (minimum), centerline to centerline. If over 2,000 ADT within 20 years, plan for grade separation.
ii Minor Arterial If the ADT of the crossroad is less than 2,000, ½-mile spacing (minimum), centerline to centerline. If over 2,000 ADT within 20 years, plan for grade separation.
iii Collector Road (or street) plus property approaches, not more than six per side per mile. With approval from the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, shorter intervals may be used where topography or other conditions (such as parcel sizes in some cases) restrict the design. Where intersecting roads are spaced farther apart than one per mile, median crossings may be considered for Uturns, in accordance with Chapter 1310. Keep U-turns to a minimum, consistent with requirements for operation and maintenance of the highway. To discourage movement in the wrong direction on multilane highways, locate private approaches 300 feet or more from an at-grade intersection. At a tee intersection, a private approach may be located directly opposite the intersection or a minimum of 300 feet away from the intersection. Ensure a private approach directly opposite a tee intersection cannot be mistaken for a continuation or part of the public traveled way.
530.04(4) Access Approach Partial control is exercised to the level that, in addition to intersections with selected public roads, some crossings and private driveways may be allowed.
530.04(4)(a) Approach Types Partial control limited access highways allow at-grade intersections with selected public roads, trails, shared-use paths, and private approaches using Type A, B, C, and F approaches. (See Chapter 520 for the definitions of approach types.) Type D, commercial approaches, are not allowed direct access to partial control limited access highways. Commercial access is allowed only by way of other public roads. The type of approach provided for each parcel is based on current and potential land use and on an evaluation that assesses connectivity for all modes. (See Section 530.05(4) for a list of evaluation criteria.)

Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.04(4)(b) Design Considerations The following considerations are used to determine the number and location of access approaches on partial control limited access highways. 1. Access approaches must be held to a minimum. The number is limited as follows:
•
•
•
Principal arterial: two per side per mile Minor arterial: four per side per mile Collector: six per side per mile, including at-grade intersections
2. Approaches in excess of the number listed above may be allowed as staged construction (until full buildout is complete) if approved by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division. 3. Approaches are not allowed for parcels that have reasonable access to other public roads unless a parcel has extensive highway frontage. 4. Relocate or close approaches at locations where available sight distance is below Design Manual criteria. 5. Allow only one approach for each parcel, except for very large ownerships, or where terrain features do not allow the property to be served by a single approach. This includes contiguous parcels under a single ownership. 6. Where possible, locate a single approach to serve two or more parcels. 7. The approved design is to provide for future development of frontage roads that will eliminate an excessive number of approaches.
530.04(5) Location of Utilities, Bus Stops, and Mailboxes 530.04(5)(a) Utilities Connecting utility lines are allowed along the outer right of way line between intermittent frontage roads. (See the Utilities Accommodation Policy regarding the location of and access to utilities.)
530.04(5)(b) Bus Stops Bus stops for both common carriers and school buses are not allowed on either two-lane or four-lane highways except:
•
•
•
•
At railroad crossings (see Chapter 1350). At locations of intersections with necessary pullouts to be constructed by the state. Where shoulder widening has been provided for mail delivery service. For a designated school bus loading zone on or adjacent to the traveled lane, that has been approved by WSDOT.
Buses are not allowed to stop in the traveled lanes blocking at-grade intersections or private approaches to load or unload passengers. School bus loading zones on partial control limited access highways must be posted with school bus loading zone signs, in accordance with the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).

Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.04(5)(c) Mailboxes Locate mailboxes on frontage roads or at intersections, with the following exceptions for properties that are served by Type A or B approaches:
•
•
Locate mailboxes on a four-lane highway only on the side of the highway on which the deeded approach is provided. Locate mailboxes on a two-lane highway on the side of the highway that is on the right in the direction of the mail delivery.
Wherever mailboxes are allowed on a partial control limited access highway, provide mailbox turnouts to allow mail delivery vehicles to stop clear of the through traffic lanes. (See Chapter 1600 for additional information concerning mailbox locations and turnouts.)
530.04(6) Pedestrian and Bicyclist Crossings and Paths Pedestrian and bicyclist crossings are allowed on partial control limited access highways when they are gradeseparated or, crossings can be at grade, when the following conditions apply:
•
•
•
•
Only at intersections where an at-grade crossing is provided in accordance with Chapter 1510. On two-lane highways at mailbox locations. On two-lane highways not less than 100 feet from a school bus loading zone (pullout) adjacent to the traveled lane, if school district and WSDOT personnel determine that the bus stopping in the traveled lane is not recommended. On two-lane highways where the school bus is stopped on the traveled lane to load or unload passengers and the required sign and signal lights are displayed.
On partial control limited access highways, pedestrian and bicyclist traffic is allowed, consistent with “Rules of the Road” (RCW 46.61), except where unusual safety conditions support prohibition. Information pertaining to such prohibitions is available from the WSDOT website: wsdot.wa.gov/bike/closed.htm Shared-use paths and trails, and access to and from, within a partial control limited access highway are best planned and designed with the local agency’s participation. Where existing and future planned paths are allowed, they must be documented on the right of way and limited access plan. The plan shows the location of the existing or proposed shared-use path and where the path crosses limited access, and it provides movement notes (see Section 530.10(1)), with the intention of maintaining and improving active transportation connectivity.
530.05 Modified Control (Least Restrictive) 530.05(1) Introduction Modified control is intended to prevent further deterioration in the safety and motor vehicle operational characteristics of existing highways by limiting the number and location of access points. Upon acquisition of modified control limited access, the number, type, and use of access approaches of abutting property are frozen. The abutting property access rights and type of use are recorded on the property deed. The rights and use may not be altered by the abutting property owner, the local jurisdiction, or the region. This authority resides with the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division (see Section 530.10).

Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.05(2) Application In general, modified control is applied where some level of control is desired, but existing and potential commercial development precludes the implementation of full or partial control.
530.05(2)(a) Existing Highways Modified control may be established and acquired on existing highways other than main line interstate. Priority is given to highway segments where one or more of the following conditions applies:
•
•
•
Commercial development potential is high, but most of the adjoining property remains undeveloped. There is a reasonable expectation that the adjoining property will be redeveloped to a more intensive land use, resulting in greater motor vehicle traffic congestion and increased presence of people walking, bicycling, and/or accessing transit service. At interchange areas if full or partial access cannot be provided as described in Section 530.03(3)(d).
530.05(2)(b) Modified Control Evaluation Selection of highways on which modified control may be applied is based on an evaluation that includes the following contextual factors for all modes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The current form of managed access control Traffic volumes Level of service, or other selected mobility performance metric Selected safety performance Functional class Route continuity Mix of residential, destination and employment densities Operational considerations related to achieving the selected motor vehicle target speed Operational considerations related to transportation efficiency for people utilizing active transportation Local land use planning Current and potential land use Predicted growth rate Economic analysis
530.05(2)(c) Exceptions Where modified control is to be established, developed commercial areas may be excepted from control when all or most of the abutting property has been developed to the extent that few, if any, additional commercial approaches will be needed with full development of the area. Contact the HQ Access and Hearings Section when considering this option. If this exception is within the limits of access control, an approved access design analysis is required.
530.05(3) Intersections At an intersection on a modified control limited access highway, access control will be established and acquired along the crossroad for a minimum distance of 130 feet:
•
•
•
Measured from the centerline of a two-lane highway (see Exhibit 530-10). Measured from the centerline of the nearest directional roadway of a four-lane highway (see Exhibit 530-10). Measured from the center of a roundabout (see Exhibit 530-9).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-13
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
Approaches are allowed within this area only when there is no reasonable alternative. An approved access design analysis is required for any access that has been allowed to remain within the first 130 feet. Where appropriate, address and incorporate connectivity for shared-use paths, trails and sidewalks in and beyond the control area.
530.05(4) Access Approach The number and location of approaches on a highway with modified control must be carefully planned and monitored to provide a safe and efficient highway compatible with present and potential land use.
530.05(4)(a) Approach Types Modified control limited access highways allow at-grade intersections with selected public roads, shared-use paths, trails, and with private approaches using Type A, B, C, and D approaches. (See Chapter 520 for definitions of the approach types.) The type of approach provided for each parcel is based on present and potential land use and an evaluation of the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Local comprehensive plans, zoning, and land use ordinances Property covenants and agreements City or county ordinances The highest and best use of the property The highest and best use of adjoining lands A change in use by merger of adjoining ownerships All other factors bearing upon proper land use of the parcel
530.05(4)(b) Design Considerations The following items are used to determine the number and location of approaches: 1. Parcels that have access to another public road or street are not normally allowed direct access to the highway. 2. Meets sight distance criteria (see Chapter 1340). 3. Hold the number of access approaches to a minimum. Access approaches are limited to one approach for each parcel of land or where adjoining parcels are under one contiguous ownership. 4. Encourage joint use of access approaches where similar use of land and topography allows. 5. Additional approaches may be allowed for future development consistent with local zoning. Once limited access has been acquired, this will require a value determination process (see Section 530.10). Close existing access approaches not meeting the above.
530.05(5) Location of Utilities, Bus Stops, and Mailboxes 530.05(5)(a) Utilities Connecting utility lines are allowed along the outer right of way line between intermittent frontage roads. (See the Utilities Accommodation Policy regarding location of and access to utilities.)
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-14
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.05(5)(b) Bus Stops Bus stops are allowed as follows:
•
•
In rural areas, bus stops are subject to the same restrictions as in Sections 530.04(5) and 530.04(6). In urban areas, bus stops for both commercial carriers and school buses are allowed. (See Chapter 1730 for transit stop considerations and pullout designs.)
530.05(5)(c) Mailboxes Locate mailboxes adjacent to or opposite all authorized approaches as follows:
•
•
On a four-lane highway only on the side of the highway on which the deeded approach is provided. On a two-lane highway on the side of the highway that is on the right in the direction of the mail delivery.
Where mailboxes are allowed, a mailbox turnout is recommended to allow mail delivery vehicles to stop clear of the through traffic lanes. (See Chapter 1600 for additional information concerning mailbox locations and turnouts.)
530.05(6) Pedestrian and Bicyclist Crossings and Pedestrian and/or Bicycle Paths Pedestrian and bicyclist crossings are allowed as follows. Pedestrians and bicyclists are allowed, consistent with “Rules of the Road” (RCW 46.61), on modified control limited access highways except where unusual safety considerations support prohibition. Information pertaining to such prohibitions is available from the WSDOT website: wsdot.wa.gov/bike/closed.htm Shared-use paths and trails, and access to and from, within a modified control limited access highway are best planned and designed with the local agency’s participation. Where existing or future planned shared-use paths or trails are allowed, they must be documented in the right of way and limited access plan. The plan shows the location of the existing or proposed path and where the shared-use path crosses limited access, and it provides movement notes (see Section 530.10(1)) with the intention of maintaining and improving active transportation connectivity.
530.06 Access Approaches 530.06(1) General Access approaches may be allowed on limited access highways, consistent with the requirements outlined in Sections 530.03, 530.04, and 530.05. For additional information pertaining to approaches, refer to Chapter 1320, Chapter 1340, and Chapter 510, and the Plans Preparation Manual. The widths for the approach types are negotiated, and only the negotiated widths are shown on the right of way and limited access plan. (See Chapter 520 for definitions of the approach types.)
530.07 Frontage Roads Local agency approval is required for any planned frontage roads, county roads, city streets, cul-de-sacs, shareduse paths, or trails. The local agency must also agree in writing to accept and maintain the new section as a county road or city street.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-15
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.07(1) General Frontage roads are provided in conjunction with limited access highways to:
•
•
•
Limit access to the main line. Provide access to abutting land ownerships. Restore the continuity of the local street or roadway system and active transportation network.
Refer to Chapter 1210 for frontage road general policy and Chapter 300 for required documentation. By agreement under which the state is reimbursed for all costs involved, frontage roads that are not the responsibility of the state may be built by the state upon the request of a local political subdivision, a private agency, or an individual.
530.07(2) County Road and City Street To connect roads or streets or walk/bike connections that have been closed off by the highway, short sections of county roads, city streets, shared-use paths, or trails that are not adjacent to the highway may be constructed if they will serve the same purpose as, and cost less than, a frontage road.
530.07(3) Cul-de-sacs For a frontage road or local street bearing substantial traffic that is terminated or closed at one end, provide a cul-de-sac or other street or roadway consistent with local policy or practice, that is sufficient to allow vehicles to turn around without encroachment on private property. Consider and address continued connectivity and provision of alternate routes for pedestrians and bicyclists.
530.08 Turnbacks When WSDOT transfers jurisdiction of operating right of way to a city, town, or county, a turnback agreement is required. (See the Agreements Manual for turnback procedures (Consultants: Please contact your WSDOT Project Manager for access to the Agreements Manual).) Locate the turnback limits at points of logical termination. This will allow WSDOT to retain an adequate amount of right of way for maintenance of the highway and for other operational functions. In areas where limited access rights have been acquired from the abutting property owners, the limited access rights will continue to be required for highway purposes; therefore, the limited access rights will not be included as part of a turnback agreement.
530.09 Adjacent Railroads 530.09(1) General A limited access highway and a railroad are considered adjacent when they have a common right of way border with no other property separating them. The allowed approaches apply only to adjacent railroad property that is directly used for current railroad operation.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-16
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.09(2) Requirements It is in the public’s interest to provide access to the railroad right of way, from limited access highways, for maintenance of the railroad and the utilities located on the railroad right of way where other access is not feasible. This applies to both new highways and to existing highways where limited access has been acquired. Direct access is allowed where local roads are infrequent or there are few highway-railroad crossings from which unimproved road access for maintenance purposes is feasible, and where unique topography or other unusual conditions lead to its use. To provide direct approaches for access to railroad right of way, all of the following conditions must be met:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
A maximum of one approach is allowed for every 2 miles of highway. The approach must not adversely affect the design, construction, stability, traffic safety, or operation of the highway. Except where the railroad is located in the median area, the approach is to be accomplished in a legal manner by right turns only, to and from the roadway nearest the railroad. Median crossing is not allowed. The approach is secured by a locked gate under arrangements satisfactory to the department. (See the Definitions section in Chapter 520 for Approach Type C, and Chapter 550.) The parking of any vehicles or railroad equipment is prohibited within limited access highway right of way. A special emergency maintenance permit must be obtained for periods of intensive railroad maintenance. The approach must be closed if the railroad operation ceases. Approaches are limited to use by the railroad company unless specific provisions for other use are shown on the right of way and limited access plan and included in the right of way negotiations.
530.09(3) Restrictions Direct access to a railroad from the highway is considered unnecessary and is not allowed where:
•
•
•
•
There are local roads adjacent to or crossing the railroad. An unimproved road can be provided by the railroad between crossroads. The limited access highway is paralleled by a frontage road adjacent to the railroad. No highway previously existed adjacent to the railroad.
530.10 Access Breaks and Inner Corridor Access This section addresses three topics:
•
•
•
Section 530.10(1) applies to access breaks and inner corridor access of limited access rights of way on full, partial and modified highways. Section 530.10(2) provides specific detail on changes for private approaches. Section 530.10(3) provides specific guidance on changes for public approaches.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-17
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.10(1) General When non-highway purpose activities are proposed that involve either crossing limited access boundaries or entering into roadside areas from within limited access facilities, a formal request shall be approved prior to the activity or use. The request will be either an access break or an inner corridor access. An access break is needed when the limited access boundary is to be crossed. This refers to any point from inside or outside the state limited access right of way limited access hachures that crosses over, under, or physically through the plane of the limited access. An inner corridor access is needed when entry into roadside areas inside of the limited access corridor is to be made from within the limited access boundary. Inner corridor access may be from a mainline, a ramp, or from a local road or street that is also within limited access. Evaluate the following factors concerning a potential access break or inner corridor access:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Crash potential for all modes, including how crash types and contributing factors and how operational considerations related to the access break would change Level of access control (full, partial, or modified) Existing and planned land use changes Functional classification Land use and zoning Environment impacts/mitigation Determination from a Corridor Sketch, Basis of Design and/or CMAR
Regional staff or Program staff work with the requesting party to compile and submit access break and inner corridor access requests to the HQ Access and Hearings Section. The request package will contain the completed access request checklist and all supporting documents and will be submitted electronically using instructions located on the Access and Hearings Section website: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-accessrequests-training
530.10(1)(a) Approvals Access breaks (either temporary or permanent) and inner corridor access for all limited access state highways require approval prior to implementation. For permanent access breaks or inner corridor access approvals involving existing property rights, the right of way and limited access plan must be revised and deeds may need to be rewritten. On non-interstate limited access routes, WSDOT HQ approves access breaks and inner corridor access. On interstate routes, 23 CFR 710.403 requires prior approval from FHWA. Note that any changes proposed on Interstate limited access facilities must include environmental documentation in the request, as required by FHWA. Contact the HQ Access and Hearings Section for assistance.
530.10(2) Changes for Private Access Approaches (Modified/Partial Control Only) Private accesses are allowed within modified control and sometimes allowed within partial control (WAC 46858-010).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-18
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.10(2)(a) Requirements Examples of access modifications requested by abutting property owners include additional road approaches, changes in the allowed use, or additional users of existing road approaches. Plan revisions that provide for additional access to abutting properties after WSDOT has purchased the access rights are discouraged. However, these revisions may be considered if the following can be established:
•
•
•
•
There are no other reasonable alternatives. The efficiency and safety of the highway will not be adversely impacted. The existing situation causes extreme hardship on the owner(s). The revision is consistent with the limited access highway requirements.
530.10(2)(b) Procedures The region initiates a preliminary engineering review of the requested modification to or break in limited access and contacts the HQ Access and Hearings Section to determine whether conceptual approval can be granted for the request. If conceptual approval can be granted, then:
•
•
•
The region initiates an engineering review of the requested modification. The region prepares and submits to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section a preliminary right of way and limited access plan revision, together with a recommendation for Headquarters approval. When federalaid funds are involved in any phase of the project, the proposed modification will be sent to FHWA for review and approval. The recommendation will include an item-by-item analysis of the factors listed in Sections 530.10(1) and 530.10(2)(a).
530.10(2)(c) Valuation Determination Upon preliminary approval, region Real Estate Services prepares an appraisal for the value of the access change using a before and after appraisal.
•
•
•
The appraisal follows the requirements set forth in the Right of Way Manual. The appraisal package is sent to HQ Real Estate Services for review and approval. If federal-aid funds were involved in purchasing access control, HQ Real Estate Services will send a copy of the appraisal package to FHWA for review and approval.
530.10(2)(d) Final Processing
•
•
•
•
•
•
Region Real Estate Services informs the requester of the approved appraised value for the change. If the requester is still interested, the region prepares a “Surplus Disposal Package” for HQ Real Estate Services’ review and approval. At the same time, the preliminary right of way and limited access plan revision previously transmitted is processed for approval. After the department collects the payment from the requester, the region issues a permit for the construction, if required. If an existing approach is being surrendered, region Real Estate Services obtains a conveyance from the property owner. HQ Real Estate Services prepares and processes a deed granting the change to the access rights.

530.10(3) Changes for Public At-Grade Intersections (Modified/Partial Control Only) 530.10(3)(a) Requirements
•
•
•
Public at-grade intersections on partial or modified control limited access highways serve local arterials that form part of the local transportation network for all modes. Requests for new intersections on limited access highways must be made by or through the local governmental agency to WSDOT. The region will forward this request, including the data referenced in Sections 530.10(1) and 530.10(2)(a) to the HQ Access and Hearings Section. WSDOT must comply with the hearing, or waiver, process as outlined in Chapter 210 and discussed in Section 530.02(2)(a). The access acquisition and conveyance must be completed prior to beginning construction of the new intersection. The new intersection is to meet WSDOT design and spacing requirements, unless otherwise approved through design analysis document.
530.10(3)(b) Procedures
•
•
•
•
•
•
The region evaluates the request for modification and contacts the HQ Access and Hearings Section for conceptual approval. The region submits an intersection plan for approval (see Chapter 1310) and a right of way and limited access plan revision request (see the Plans Preparation Manual). This plan includes the limited access design requirements for all modes along the proposed public atgrade intersection. The Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, approves the intersection plan. The Assistant Secretary, Regions and Mega Programs/Chief Engineer (or designee), approves the access revision. The region submits the construction agreement to the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division (see the Agreements Manual). The Assistant Secretary, Regions and Mega Programs/Chief Engineer (or designee), approves the construction agreement.
530.10(3)(c) Valuation Determination
•
•
When a requested public at-grade intersection will serve a local arterial that immediately connects to the local transportation network, compensation will not be required. When a requested public at-grade intersection will serve only a limited area, does not immediately connect to the local transportation network, or is primarily for the benefit of a limited number of developers, compensation for the access change will be addressed in the plan revision request. In these situations, compensation is appropriate and a value will be determined as outlined in Section 530.10(2)(c).

Managed Access Control Exhibit 540-1 Managed Access Highway Class Description Exhibit 540-2 Minimum Corner Clearance: Distance From Access Connection to Public Road or Street
540.01 General Access management is the systematic regulation of the location, spacing, design, and operation of driveway, city street, and county road connections to state highways. This chapter describes the access management process for granting permission to connect to managed access highways within cities and unincorporated areas. For an overview of access control, references to related state laws and codes, and definitions of terminology for this chapter, see Chapter 520, Access Control. In Washington State, managed access highways include all state highways that are not limited access highways. State highways that are planned for or established as limited access, are treated as managed access highways until the limited access rights are acquired. The Access Control Tracking System Limited Access and Managed Access Master Plan (Access Master Plan) identifies not only the limits of limited access control, but also managed access control segments. The current managed access classification is based on access connection densities, distance between access connections, spacing of intersections, and context (see Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 468-52-040). The existing access classification is periodically updated by Headquarters (HQ) with region input to reflect changes on a corridor segment. Conditions may have changed since the Access Master Plan was envisioned or the last managed access classification update. On non-freeways it is important to consider the current classification and any classifications previously planned, and determine the access design control most appropriate for the agreed context (see Chapter 1102 and Chapter 1103 for context and design control guidance, respectively). The Access Master Plan database is available at: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-access-requests-training Access to managed access highways is regulated by the governmental entity with jurisdiction over a highway’s roadsides. Access connection permits are issued on managed access highways. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has access connection permitting authority over all state highways outside incorporated towns and cities. Incorporated towns and cities have access connection permitting authority for city streets that are part of state highways, as specified in Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 47.24.020. When any project is developed on a state highway outside an incorporated city or town, state law requires that existing access connections be evaluated to determine whether they are consistent with all current department spacing, location, and design standards (see Section 540.03).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 540
Managed Access Control
540.02 Design Considerations Evaluate access connections by using the Access Master Plan database to identify the route classification and determine access connection requirements in conformance with this chapter or Chapter 530 as appropriate. See also Chapter 1100, Practical Design, and chapters in that series for guidance on how access control is used as a design control. Review all connections and verify whether they are in the Roadway Access Management Permit System (RAMPS) database. Contact the region Development Services Office or the HQ Access and Hearings Section for permission to log on to the link through this page: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-access-requests-training If a nonconforming connection is identified, consider relocating, modifying, or eliminating the connection. It is not the intent of the managed access program that modifications to the connection will change the general functionality of the property. Where current department standards cannot be met while providing the same general functionality, classify the connection as nonconforming and process the appropriate documentation as discussed below. This documentation is part of the permit process.
540.03 Managed Access Highway Classes The principal objective of the managed access classification system is to maintain the safety and capacity of existing highways. This is accomplished by establishing access management criteria, which are to be adhered to in the planning and regional approval of access connections to the state highway system. The classification system for state managed access highways consists of five classes. The classes are arranged from the most restrictive, Class 1, to the least restrictive, Class 5. In general, most state highways outside the incorporated limits of a city or town have been designated as Class 1 or Class 2, with only the most urban and lowest-speed state highways within an incorporated town or city designated as Class 5. Exhibit 540-1 shows the five classes of highways, with a brief description of each class. WSDOT keeps a record of the assigned managed access classifications, by state route and milepost, in the Access Control Tracking System database: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-access-requests-training One of the goals of state law is to restrict or keep access connections to a minimum in order to help preserve the safety, operation, and functional integrity of the state highway. On Class 1 highways, mobility is the primary function, while on Class 5 highways, access needs have priority over mobility needs. Class 2 highways also favor mobility, while Class 3 and Class 4 highways generally achieve a balance between mobility and access. The most notable distinction between the five highway classes is the minimum spacing requirements of access connections. Exhibit 540-1 shows the minimum distances between access points on the same side of the highway. Exhibit 540-2 applies to the minimum clearance from a public road or street. In all five highway classes, access connections are to be located and designed to minimize interference with transit facilities and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities on state highways where such facilities exist or are proposed in state, regional, metropolitan, or local transportation plans. In these cases, if reasonable access is available to the local road/street system, access is to be provided to the local road/street system rather than directly to the state highway. Following are the functional characteristics and the legal requirements for each class.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 540-2
Chapter 540
Managed Access Control
540.03(1) Class 1 540.03(1)(a) Functional Characteristics Class 1 highways provide for high-speed and/or high-volume traffic movements for interstate, interregional, and intercity (and some intracity) travel needs. Service to abutting land is subordinate to providing service to major traffic movements. Highways in Class 1 are typically distinguished by a highly-controlled, limited number of (public and private) access points, restrictive medians with limited median openings on multilane facilities, and infrequent intersections.
540.03(1)(b) Legal Requirements 1. It is the intent that Class 1 highways be designed to have a posted speed limit of 50 to 65 mph. Intersecting streets, roads, and highways are planned with a minimum spacing of 1 mile. Spacing of ½ mile may be allowed, but only when no reasonable alternative access exists. 2. Private access connections to the state highway are not allowed except where the property has no other reasonable access to the local road/street system. When a private access connection must be provided, the following conditions apply: o The access connection continues until such time other reasonable access to a highway with a less restrictive access control class or access to the local road/street system becomes available and is allowed. o The minimum distance to another (public or private) access point is 1,320 feet along the same side of the highway. Nonconforming access connection permits may be issued to provide access connections to parcels whose highway frontage, topography, or location otherwise precludes issuance of a conforming access connection permit; however, variance permits are not allowed. o No more than one access connection may be provided to an individual parcel or to contiguous parcels under the same ownership. o All private access connections are for right turns only on multilane facilities. Where special conditions apply, justify the exception in a traffic analysis in the access connection permit application that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43. o Additional access connections to the state highway are not allowed for newly created parcels resulting from property divisions. All access for these parcels must be provided by an internal road/street network. Access to the state highway will be at existing permitted locations or revised locations. 3. Restrictive medians are provided on multilane facilities to separate opposing traffic movements and to prevent unauthorized turning movements.
540.03(2) Class 2 540.03(2)(a) Functional Characteristics Class 2 highways provide for low-to-high travel speeds depending on context, and medium-to-high-volume traffic movements over medium and long distances for interregional, intercity, and intracity travel needs. Direct access service to abutting land is subordinate to providing service to traffic movements.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 540-3
Chapter 540
Managed Access Control
Highways in Class 2 are typically distinguished by existing or planned restrictive medians on multilane facilities and by large minimum distances between (public and private) access points.
540.03(2)(b) Legal Requirements 1. It is the intent that Class 2 highways be designed to have a posted speed limit of 35 to 50 mph in urbanized areas and 45 to 55 mph in rural areas. Intersecting streets, roads, and highways are planned with a minimum spacing of ½ mile. Intersection spacing of less than ½-mile may be allowed, but only when no reasonable alternative access exists. In urban areas and developing areas where higher volumes are present or growth that will require a change to intersection control is expected in the foreseeable future, it is imperative that the location of any public access point be planned carefully to ensure adequate traffic progression. The addition of all new public or private access points that might require signalization or other form of intersection control will require an engineering analysis that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43. 2. Private access connections to the state highway system are allowed only where the property has no other reasonable access to the local road/street system or where access to the local road/street system will cause unacceptable traffic operational conditions or safety concerns on that system. When a private access connection must be provided, the following conditions apply: o The access connection continues until such time other reasonable access to a highway with a less restrictive access control class or acceptable access to the local road/street system becomes available and is allowed. o The minimum distance to another (public or private) access point is 660 feet on the same side of the highway. Nonconforming access connection permits may be issued to provide access to parcels whose highway frontage, topography, or location precludes issuance of a conforming access connection permit. o Only one access connection is allowed for an individual parcel or to contiguous parcels under the same ownership. This applies unless the highway frontage exceeds 1,320 feet and it can be shown that the additional access connection will not adversely affect the desired function of the state highway in accordance with the assigned managed access Class 2 or the safety or operation of the state highway. o Variance permits may be allowed if there are special conditions and the exception can be justified to the satisfaction of the department by a traffic analysis in the access connection permit application that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43. o All private access connections are for right turns only on multilane facilities. This applies unless there are special conditions and the exception can be justified to the satisfaction of the department by a traffic analysis in the access connection permit application that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43 and only if left-turn channelization is provided. o Additional access connections to the state highway are not allowed for newly created parcels that result from property divisions. All access for these parcels must be provided by an internal road/street network. Access to the state highway will be at existing permitted locations or at revised locations.

Managed Access Control
3. On multilane facilities, restrictive medians are provided to separate opposing traffic movements and to prevent unauthorized turning movements. However, a nonrestrictive median or a two-way leftturn lane may be used where special conditions exist and main line volumes are below 20,000 average daily traffic (ADT).
540.03(3) Class 3 540.03(3)(a) Functional Characteristics Class 3 highways provide for moderate travel speeds depending on context, and moderate traffic volumes for medium and short travel distances for intercity, intracity, and intercommunity travel needs. There is a reasonable balance between access and mobility needs for highways in this class. This class is to be used primarily where the existing level of development of the adjoining land is less intensive than maximum buildout and where the probability of significant land use change and increased traffic demand is high. Highways in Class 3 are typically distinguished by planned restrictive medians on multilane facilities and by meeting minimum distances between (public and private) access points. Two way left-turn lanes may be used where justified and main line traffic volumes are below 25,000 ADT. Development of properties with internal road/street networks and joint access connections is encouraged.
540.03(3)(b) Legal Requirements 1. It is the intent that Class 3 highways be designed to have a posted speed limit of 30 to 40 mph in urbanized areas and 45 to 55 mph in rural areas. In rural areas, intersecting streets, roads, and highways are planned with a minimum spacing of ½ mile. Intersection spacing of less than ½-mile may be allowed, but only when no reasonable alternative access exists. In urban areas and developing areas where higher volumes are present or growth that will require a change to intersection control is expected in the foreseeable future, it is imperative that the location of any public access point be planned carefully to ensure adequate traffic progression. Where feasible, major intersecting roadways that might ultimately require signalization or other intersection control type are planned with a minimum of ½-mile spacing. The addition of all new public or private access points that may require signalization or other intersection control type, will require an engineering analysis that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43. 2. Private Access Connections o No more than one access connection may be provided to an individual parcel or to contiguous parcels under the same ownership. This applies unless it can be shown that additional access connections will not adversely affect the desired function of the state highway in accordance with the assigned managed access Class 3 and will not adversely affect the safety or operation of the state highway. o The minimum distance to another (public or private) access point is 330 feet on the same side of the highway. Nonconforming access connection permits may be issued to provide access to parcels whose highway frontage, topography, or location precludes issuance of a conforming access connection permit. o Variance permits may be allowed if there are special conditions and the exception can be justified to the satisfaction of the department by a traffic analysis in the access connection permit application that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43.

540.03(4) Class 4 540.03(4)(a) Functional Characteristics Class 4 highways provide for low to intermediate travel speeds depending on context, and moderate traffic volumes for medium and short travel distances for intercity, intracity, and intercommunity travel needs. There is a reasonable balance between direct access and mobility needs for highways in this class. This class is to be used primarily where the existing level of development of the adjoining land is more intensive and where the probability of major land use changes is less than on Class 3 highway segments. Highways in Class 4 are typically distinguished by existing or planned nonrestrictive medians. Restrictive medians may be used to mitigate unfavorable operational conditions such as turning, weaving, and crossing conflicts. Minimum access connection spacing requirements apply if adjoining properties are redeveloped.
540.03(4)(b) Legal Requirements 1. It is the intent that Class 4 highways be designed to have a posted speed limit of 30 to 35 mph in urbanized areas and 35 to 45 mph in rural areas. In rural areas, intersecting streets, roads, and highways are planned with a minimum spacing of ½ mile. Intersection spacing of less than ½ mile may be allowed, but only when no reasonable alternative access exists. In urban areas and developing areas where higher volumes are present or growth that will require a change in intersection control is expected in the foreseeable future, it is imperative that the location of any public access point be planned carefully to ensure adequate traffic progression. Where feasible, major intersecting roadways that might ultimately require intersection control changes are planned with a minimum of ½-mile spacing. The addition of all new public or private access points that may require signalization, or other intersection control type, will require an engineering analysis that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43. 2. Private Access Connections o No more than one access connection may be provided to an individual parcel or to contiguous parcels under the same ownership. This applies unless it can be shown that additional access connections will not adversely affect the desired function of the state highway in accordance with the assigned managed access Class 4 and will not adversely affect the safety or operation of the state highway. o The minimum distance to another (public or private) access point is 250 feet on the same side of the highway. Nonconforming access connection permits may be issued to provide access connections to parcels whose highway frontage, topography, or location precludes issuance of a conforming access connection permit. o Variance permits may be allowed if there are special conditions and the exception can be justified to the satisfaction of the department by a traffic analysis in the access connection permit application that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43.

540.03(5) Class 5 540.03(5)(a) Functional Characteristics Class 5 highways provide for low travel speeds and moderate traffic volumes for primarily short travel distances for intracity and intracommunity trips and for access to state highways of a higher class. Access needs generally may be higher than the need for through-traffic mobility without compromising the public’s health, welfare, or safety. These highways will normally have nonrestrictive medians.
540.03(5)(b) Legal Requirements 1. It is the intent that Class 5 highways be designed to have a posted speed limit of 25 to 35 mph. In rural areas, intersecting streets, roads, and highways are planned with a minimum spacing of ¼ mile. Spacing of less than ¼ mile may be allowed where no reasonable alternative exists. In urban areas and developing areas where higher volumes are present or growth that will require changes to intersection control is expected in the foreseeable future, it is imperative that the location of any public access point be planned carefully to ensure adequate traffic progression. Where feasible, major intersecting roadways that might ultimately require changes to intersection control are planned with a minimum of ¼ mile spacing. The addition of all new public or private access points that might require signalization, or other control type, will require an engineering analysis that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43. 2. Private Access Connections o No more than one access connection may be provided to an individual parcel or to contiguous parcels under the same ownership. This applies unless it can be shown that additional access connections will not adversely affect the desired function of the state highway in accordance with the assigned managed access Class 5 and will not adversely affect the safety or operation of the state highway. o The minimum distance to another (public or private) access point is 125 feet on the same side of the highway. Nonconforming access connection permits may be issued to provide access to parcels whose highway frontage, topography, or location precludes issuance of a conforming access connection permit. o Variance permits may be allowed if there are special conditions and the exception can be justified to the satisfaction of the department by a traffic analysis in the access connection permit application that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43.

540.03(6) Changes in Managed Access Classification WSDOT, RTPOs, MPOs, or other entities such as cities, towns, or counties may initiate a review of managed access classifications per the process identified by WAC 468-52. In all cases, WSDOT consults with the RTPOs, MPOs, and local agencies and takes into consideration comments received during the review process. For city streets that are designated as state highways, the department will obtain concurrence in the final classification assignment from the city or town. The modified highway classification list shall be submitted to Headquarters for approval by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, or a designee. WSDOT regions shall notify the RTPOs, MPOs, and local governmental entities in writing of the final determination of the reclassification.
540.04 Corner Clearance Criteria In addition to the five access control classes, there are also corner clearance criteria that must be used for access connections near intersections (see Exhibit 540-2). Corner clearance spacing must meet or exceed the minimum access point spacing requirements of the applicable managed access highway class. A single access connection may be placed closer to the intersection, in compliance with the permit application process specified in WAC 468-51 and in accordance with the following criteria:
•
•
•
The minimum corner clearance criteria in Exhibit 540-2 may be used where access point spacing cannot be obtained due to property size and where a joint-use access connection cannot be secured or where it is determined by WSDOT not to be feasible because of conflicting land use or conflicting traffic volumes or operational characteristics. Some local agencies have adopted corner clearance as a design element in their design standards; these standards are to meet or exceed WSDOT standards. Coordinate with the local agency regarding corner clearance of an access connection on or near an intersecting local road or street. When a joint-use access connection or an alternate road/street system access—meeting or exceeding the minimum corner clearance requirements—becomes available, the permit holder must close the permitted access connection unless the permit holder shows to WSDOT's satisfaction that such closure is not feasible.

540.05 Access Connection Categories Whenever an access connection permit is issued on a managed access state highway, the permit must also specify one of four access connection categories: Category I to Category IV. Categories I through III are based on the maximum vehicular usage of the access connection. Category IV specifies temporary use, usually for less than a year. Access connection permits must specify the category and the maximum vehicular usage of the access connection in the permit. All access connections are determined by WSDOT to be in one of the following categories (WAC 468-51-040):
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 540-10
Chapter 540
Managed Access Control
540.05(1) Category I “Category I – minimum connection” provides connection to the state highway system for up to ten single-family residences, a duplex, or a small multifamily complex of up to ten dwelling units that use a common access connection. This category also applies to permanent access connections to agricultural and forestlands, including field entrances; access connections for the operation, maintenance, and repair of utilities; and access connections serving other low-volume traffic generators expected to have average weekday vehicle trip ends (AWDVTE) of 100 or less.
540.05(2) Category II “Category II – minor connection” provides connection to the state highway system for medium-volume traffic generators expected to have an AWDVTE of 1,500 or less, but not included in Category I.
540.05(3) Category III “Category III – major connection” provides connection to the state highway system for high-volume traffic generators expected to have an AWDVTE exceeding 1,500.
540.05(4) Category IV “Category IV – temporary connection” provides a temporary, time-limited connection to the state highway system for a specific property for a specific use with a specific traffic volume. Such uses include, but are not limited to, logging, forestland clearing, temporary agricultural uses, temporary construction, and temporary emergency access. The department reserves the right to remove any temporary access connection at its sole discretion and at the expense of the property owner after the expiration of the permit. Further, a temporary access connection permit does not bind the department, in any way, to the future issuance of a permanent access connection permit at the temporary access connection location.
540.06 Access Connection Permit RCW 47.50 requires all access connections to be permitted. This can be accomplished by the permitting process (see Section 540.07) or by the connection being “grandfathered” (in place prior to July 1, 1990). All new access connections to state highways, as well as alterations and improvements to existing access connections, require an access connection permit. Every owner of property that abuts a managed access state highway has the right to reasonable access, but not a particular means of access. This right may be restricted with respect to the highway if reasonable access can be provided by way of another local road/street. When a new private road or street is to be constructed, approval by the permitting authority is required for intersection design, spacing, and construction work on the right of way. However, if an access connection permit is issued, it will be rendered null and void if and when the road or street is duly established as a local road or street by the local governmental entity. It is the responsibility of the applicant or permit holder to obtain all necessary local, state, and federal approvals and permits (which includes all environmental permits and documentation). The access connection permit only allows the applicant permission to connect to the state highway. It is also the responsibility of the applicant to acquire any and all property rights necessary to provide continuity from the applicant’s property to the state highway.

Chapter 540
Managed Access Control
The alteration or closure of any existing access connection caused by changes to the character, intensity of development, or use of the property served by the access connection or the construction of any new access connection must not begin before an approved access connection permit is obtained. If a property owner or permit holder with a valid access connection permit wishes to change the character, use, or intensity of the property or development served by the access connection, the permitting authority must be contacted to determine whether an upgraded access connection permit will be required.
540.07 Permitting and Design Documentation An access connection permit is obtained from the department by submitting the appropriate application form, including the fee, plans, traffic data, and access connection information, to the department for review. All access connection and roadway design documents for Category II and III permits must bear the seal and signature of a professional engineer registered in Washington State. The permitting process begins with the application. Upon submittal of the application with all the attached requirements, it is reviewed and either denied or accepted. If denied, the department must notify the applicant in writing stating the reasons, and the applicant will have thirty (30) days to submit a revised application. Once the application is approved and the permit is issued, the applicant may begin construction. The Access Manager in each region keeps a record of all access points, including those that are permitted and those that are grandfathered (see Section 540.08). A permit for a grandfathered access point is not required but may be issued for recordkeeping reasons.
540.07(1) Conforming Access Connection Permit Conforming access connection permits may be issued for access connections that conform to the functional characteristics and all legal requirements for the designated class of the highway.
540.07(2) Nonconforming Access Connection Permit Nonconforming access connection permits may be issued:
•
•
•
•
•
For short-term access connections pending the availability of a future joint-use access connection or local road/street system access. For location and spacing not meeting requirements. For Category I through IV permits. After an analysis and determination by the department that a conforming access connection cannot be made at the time of permit application submittal. After a finding that the denial of an access connection will leave the property without a reasonable means of access to the local road/street system.
In such instances, the permit is to be noted as being a nonconforming access connection permit and may contain the following specific restrictions and provisions:
•
•
•
•
•
Limits on the maximum vehicular use of the access connection. The future availability of alternate means of reasonable access for which a conforming access connection permit can be obtained. The removal of the nonconforming access connection at the time the conforming access is available. The properties to be served by the access connection. Other conditions as necessary to carry out the provisions of RCW 47.50.

Chapter 540
Managed Access Control
540.07(3) Variance Access Connection Permit Variance access connection is a special nonconforming or additional access connection permit issued for longterm use where future local road/street system access is not foreseeable:
•
•
For location and spacing not meeting requirements or for an access connection that exceeds the number allowed for the class. After an engineering study demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the department, that the access connection will not adversely affect the safety, maintenance, or operation of the highway in accordance with its assigned managed access class.
In such instances, the permit is to be noted as being a variance access connection permit and may contain the following specific restrictions and provisions:
•
•
•
Limits on the maximum vehicular use of the access connection The properties to be served by the access connection Other conditions as necessary to carry out the provisions of RCW 47.50
This permit will remain valid until modified or revoked by the permitting authority unless an upgraded permit is required due to changes in property site use (see Section 540.08(1)). A variance access connection permit must not be issued for an access connection that does not conform to minimum corner clearance requirements (see Section 540.04).
540.07(4) Corner Clearance Design Analysis 540.07(4)(a) Outside Incorporated City Limits A design analysis request will be required for nonconforming access connections if corner clearance criteria are not met. The ASDE should be involved early in the process. Such an access will be outside the corner radius and as close as feasible to the property line farthest away from the intersection. An exception to the above may be allowed for a single-family residence, serving a single residence, not meeting the minimum corner clearance criteria and having no feasible connection to the local cross street. One single family home generates a very low volume of traffic and will pose a low conflict potential for traffic on the State Highway System. A single-family access connection exception is to comply with the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
•
Serves a single residence Access is to be outside the corner radius Access is to be located as close as feasible to the property line farthest away from the intersection The denial of an access connection would leave the property without a reasonable means of access. The connection is to be relocated to a local road/street system, if one becomes available.
Document the above criteria in the access connection permit.
540.07(4)(b) Within Incorporated Cities In accordance with RCW 35.78.030 and RCW 47.50, incorporated cities and towns have jurisdiction over access permitting on streets designated as state highways and, therefore, no design analysis by WSDOT will be required. On WSDOT projects, document decisions made on these accesses in the DDP.

540.08 Other Considerations 540.08(1) Changes in Property Site Use With Permitted Access Connection The access connection permit is issued to the permit holder for a particular type of land use generating specific projected traffic volumes at the final stage of proposed development. Any changes made in the use, intensity of development, type of traffic, or traffic flow require the permit holder, an assignee, or the property owner to contact the department to determine whether further analysis is needed because the change is significant and will require a new permit and modifications to the access connection (WAC 468-51-110). A significant change is one that will cause a change in the category of the access connection permit or one that causes an operational, safety, or maintenance problem on the state highway system based on objective engineering criteria or available collision data. Such data will be provided to the property owner and/or permit holder and tenant upon written request (WAC 468-51-110).
540.08(2) Existing Access Connections 540.08(2)(a) Closure of Grandfathered Access Connections Any access connections that were in existence and in active use on July 1, 1990, are grandfathered. The grandfathered access connection may continue unless:
•
•
•
There are changes from the 1990 AWDVTE. There are changes from the 1990 established use. The department determines that the access connection does not provide minimum acceptable levels of highway safety and mobility based on collision and/or traffic data or accepted traffic engineering criteria, a copy of which must be provided to the property owner, permit holder, and/or tenant upon written request (WAC 468-51-130).
540.08(2)(b) Department Construction Projects i Notification The department must notify affected property owners, permit holders, business owners, and emergency services in writing, when appropriate, whenever the department’s work program requires the modification, relocation, or replacement of its access connections. In addition to written notification, the department will facilitate, when appropriate, a process that may include, but is not limited to, public notices, meetings, or hearings, as well as individual meetings.
ii Modification Considerations When the number, location, or design of existing access connections to the state highway is being modified by a department construction project, the resulting modified access connections must provide the same general functionality for the existing property use as they did before the modification, taking into consideration the existing site design, normal vehicle types, and traffic circulation requirements. These are evaluated on an individual basis. It is important to remember that the intent is not to damage the property owner by removing nonconforming access connections, but to eliminate access connections that are both nonconforming and not needed.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 540-14
Chapter 540
Managed Access Control
The permitting authority evaluates each property individually to make a determination about which category of access connection (see Section 540.05) and which design template (see Chapter 1340) will be reasonable. If it is a commercial parcel, determine whether the business can function with one access connection. Each parcel, or contiguous parcels under the same ownership being used for the same purpose, is allowed only one access connection. If the business cannot function properly with only one access connection, a variance permit may be issued for additional access connections. If the property is residential, only one access connection is allowed; however, certain circumstances might require an additional access connection (see 540.07(4)(a)).
iii Costs: Replacement of/Modifications to Existing Access Connections The costs of modifying or replacing the access points are borne by the department if the department construction project caused the replacement or modification. Modification of the connection may require a change to the existing permit.
540.08(3) Work by Permit Holder’s Contractor The department requires that work by the owner’s contractor be accomplished at the completion of the department’s contract or be scheduled so as not to interfere with the department’s contractor. The department may require a surety bond prior to construction of the access connection in accordance with WAC 468-51-070.
540.09 Preconstruction Conference All new access connections, including alterations and improvements to existing access connections to the highway, require an access connection permit. The permitting authority may require a preconstruction conference prior to any work being performed on the access. The preconstruction conference must be attended by those necessary to ensure compliance with the terms and provisions of the permit. Details regarding the individual access connections will be included in the construction permit. This may include access connection widths, drainage requirements, surfacing requirements, mailbox locations, and other information (WAC 468-51090).
540.10 Adjudicative Proceedings Any person who can challenge any of the following departmental actions may request an adjudicative proceeding (an appeal to an Administrative Law Judge) within thirty (30) days of the department’s written decision (WAC 468-51-150):
•
•
•
•
•
•
Denial of an access connection permit application pursuant to WAC 468-51-080 Permit conditions pursuant to WAC 468-51-150 Permit modifications pursuant to WAC 468-51-120 Permit revocation pursuant to WAC 468-51-120 Closure of permitted access connection pursuant to WAC 468-51-120 Closure of grandfathered access connection pursuant to WAC 468-51-130
An appeal of a decision by the department can be requested only if the administrative fee has been paid. If the fee has not been paid, the permit application is considered incomplete and an adjudicative proceeding cannot be requested.

540.10(1) Adjudicative Proceedings Process Following is a brief summary of the adjudicative proceeding process. For the purpose of this summary, the responsibilities of the department are separated into those actions required of the region and those actions required of Headquarters. The summary is written as if the appealable condition was a denial of an access connection request. 1. The region receives an access connection permit application, with fee. 2. The region processes the application and makes a determination that the access connection request will be denied. 3. The region sends the applicant a written letter denying the access connection. Included in this letter is notification that the applicant has thirty (30) days to request an adjudicative proceeding if the applicant disagrees with the region’s denial decision. The region must notify affected property owners, permit holders, business owners, tenants, lessees, and emergency services, as appropriate. 4. The applicant requests, within thirty (30) days, an adjudicative proceeding. 5. The region reviews its initial denial decision and determines whether there is any additional information presented that justifies reversing the original decision. 6. If the region determines that the original denial decision will stand, the region then forwards copies of all applicable permit documentation to the HQ Development Services & Access Manager for review and processing. 7. The HQ Development Services & Access Manager reviews the permit application and sends the permit documentation and appeal request to the Office of the Attorney General (AG). 8. If the initial findings of the AG agree with the region’s denial decision, the AG’s Office sends the applicant a written letter, with the AG’s signature, informing the applicant that a hearing will be scheduled for the applicant to appeal in person the department’s decision to deny access. 9. The region reserves a location and obtains a court reporter, and Headquarters obtains an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to conduct the proceeding. The AG, by written letter, notifies the applicant of the time and place for the hearing. The AG’s Office has ninety (90) days from receipt of the applicant’s appeal to approve or deny the appeal application, schedule a hearing, or decide not to conduct a hearing. The actual hearing date can be set beyond this ninety-day (90-day) review period. 10. The AG’s Office leads the department’s presentation and works with the region regarding who will testify and what displays and other information will be presented to the ALJ. The HQ Development Services & Access Manager will typically not attend these proceedings. 11. After hearing all the facts, the ALJ issues a decision, usually within a few weeks after the proceedings. However, the ALJ has ninety (90) days in which to serve a written Initial Order stating the decision. 12. The ALJ’s decision is final unless the applicant, or the department through the HQ Development Services & Access Manager, decides to appeal the ALJ’s decision to the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division. This second appeal must occur within twenty (20) days of the ALJ’s written decision. 13. If appealed to the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, the Director & State Design Engineer has ninety (90) days to review the Initial Order and all the facts and supporting documentation and issue a Final Order. The review by the Director & State Design Engineer does not require the applicable parties to be present and may involve only a review of the material submitted at the adjudicative proceeding.

14. The Director & State Design Engineer’s decision is final unless appealed within thirty (30) days to the Washington State Superior Court. The above represents a general timeline if all appeals are pursued. Based on the noted timelines, it can take nearly a year before a Final Order is issued. If appealed to Superior Court, up to an additional 18 months can be added to the process. In any case, contact the region Development Services Engineer for further guidance and direction if an appeal might be forthcoming.

Freeway Access Revision Exhibit 550-1 Non-Access Feasibility Study Process Exhibit 550-2 Access Revision Report Process Exhibit 550-3 Access Revision Documentation and Review/Approval Levels
550.01 Overview It is in the national and state interest to preserve and enhance the Interstate and non-Interstate freeway system in Washington providing an appropriate level of service in terms of safety and mobility performance for the movement of people and goods. Full control of access along the freeway mainline and ramps, along with control of access on the local roadway network within the interchange functional area, is critical to providing such service. Therefore, decisions to approve new or revised interchange access points on Washington’s freeways depend on consistent application of procedures, analysis, and supporting documentation. In , the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) significantly revised its access policy. In the memorandum transmitting the new policy to the FHWA Division Administrators, FHWA states: “The FHWA has identified several areas where the current Policy may be streamlined to eliminate duplication with other project reviews. The new Policy will now focus on the technical feasibility of any proposed change in access in support of FHWA's determination of safety, operational, and engineering acceptability. Consideration of the social, economic, and environmental impacts and planning considerations will be addressed through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review of the project. This change will eliminate the potential for duplicative analysis of those issues in the State DOT's Interstate Access report and the NEPA documentation. The change will allow State DOTs to submit only a single technical report describing the types and results of technical analyses conducted to show that the change in access will not have significant negative impact on the safety and operations of the Interstate System.” The federal policy change points to a clear link between the NEPA and access revision processes. The NEPA process will account for the social, economic, and environmental impacts and a technical report herein called the Access Revision Report (ARR) will account for the safety and operational impacts.
550.02 Freeway Access Policy Federal law requires FHWA approval of all access revisions to the Interstate system. Both FHWA and WSDOT policy require the formal submission of a request to either add, revise, or abandon access to freeways. FHWA and WSDOT freeway access policies also require proposed access changes be consistent with the vision, goals, and long-range transportation plans of a metropolitan area, region, and state.

Chapter 550
Freeway Access Revision
Interstate freeways: New or revised access to Interstate freeways requires collaboration with and approval from FHWA. WSDOT and local partners need to include FHWA from the beginning of the planning process throughout the development of the proposal. WSDOT is the only entity recognized by FHWA Washington Division that is allowed to submit requests for Interstate access revisions for review and approval. Non-Interstate freeways: New or revised access to non-Interstate freeways requires engagement with and approval from WSDOT. For consistency in analysis and reporting, the policy to revise freeway access is the same for both Interstate and non-Interstate freeways. The only major difference is in the approving authorities, described above. Exhibit 550-3 helps clarify what is considered an access revision and presents approval authorities for both Interstate and non-Interstate access revisions. The contents of this chapter provides the requirements and expectations to fulfill this policy. Note: For breaks in freeway limited access that do not involve new, revised, or abandoned traffic interchanges, follow procedures given in Chapter 530 Limited Access Control. Examples include locked gates, pedestrian structures, and access to fire hydrants within the full control limited access. Contact the HQ Design Office, Access and Hearings Section for support.
550.03 Access Revision Process The access revision process begins when an entity considers the potential of revising access to a freeway (Interstate or non-Interstate). There are two distinct steps in the access revision process: a non-access feasibility study and an Access Revision Report. Both steps focus on safety performance and operations for all modes. The feasibility study is the beginning of the process and the conclusion of the feasibility study defines the purpose and verifies the need for a potential access revision. If the feasibility study concludes that an access revision is not necessary, the process is finished. If the feasibility study concludes that an access revision is necessary, then an Access Revision Report is written and the conclusion of the ARR determines the preferred access revision alternative. These two steps are detailed in the subsequent sections of this chapter. Exhibit 550-1 presents a flow chart detailing the Non-Access Feasibility Study process; Exhibit 550-2 provides the ARR process. For the process to be successful, there needs to be a clear link to the planning and environmental processes. The planning linkage should be addressed at the beginning of the process to make sure the access revision decision aligns with local, regional, and state planning efforts. This planning linkage is discussed in more detail in Section 550.05(2)(a). The environmental linkage exists throughout the process as the Federal policy promotes a more direct link between this access revision process and the environmental process. This chapter includes callouts to the environmental process at key points to highlight this linkage and to help align the processes and reduce duplication between the two processes. The access revision and practical design processes correlate through the use of the Context and Modal Accommodation Report (CMAR) and the Basis of Design (BOD). The CMAR can help determine modal priority and accommodation on non-freeway segments, such as the crossroad proposed for the freeway access connection. The CMAR may be completed during the feasibility study. The BOD can help document baseline and contextual needs and set the direction for a future project. Sections 1 through 3 of the BOD (Project Need, Context, and Design Controls) may be completed at the end of the Non-Access Feasibility Study. Sections 4 and 5 (Alternatives Analysis and Design Element Selection) of the BOD should be completed in conjunction with the ARR. The BOD completed with the ARR may be considered the scoping BOD. Use the Design Support website to download the CMAR, the CMAR learners Guide, the Basis of Design and Alternatives Comparison Table. https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/design-tools-and-support

Freeway Access Revision
550.03(1) Scalability The access revision process varies greatly due to the complexities of the transportation system and context environment planned for the horizon year (see Chapter 1103). Not all access revision cases require a full-scale ARR. Exhibit 550-3 reflects the access revision documentation levels for select project types. For variation from Exhibit 550-3 or clarification on scalability, discuss with the Assistant State Design Engineer (ASDE). Document the scalability in the method and assumptions documents.
550.03(2) Environmental Documentation Linkage Implement Planning and Environmental Linkage (PEL) principles during the access revision process to minimize rework in the environmental review/NEPA stage of the project. Using the PEL approach is most valuable where an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required. Chapter 200 of the Environmental Manual details this beneficial link between planning and environmental processes. The new FHWA policy states clearly that the environmental documentation and access revision processes be linked and aligned to reduce duplication of effort. Throughout this access revision analysis process, key points correlate with the environmental process. For best results, make sure the environmental staff is fully engaged and involved in the process. Region Environmental staff will help determine the best NEPA / SEPA compliance strategy. The team, including FHWA, determines the type of environmental document required during the feasibility phase of access review. Since FHWA approval of Interstate access revisions entails a federal action, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements apply to Interstate access reviews. If NEPA does not apply to a freeway access revision, environmental documentation through the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) does apply. In either case, the team, comprised of experts and agents from WSDOT and FHWA, is authorized to determine the type of environmental documentation required. If the team determines the project can be documented as a Categorical Exclusion/ Exemption (CE), involvement from environmental staff at key decision points will help ensure the project is appropriately scoped and environmental considerations are integrated into the ARR as appropriate. For a CE, information from the NonAccess Feasibility Study can be useful but is typically much more detailed than the information required for the CE checklist.
550.04 Support Teams 550.04(1) Executive Support Team Establish an executive support team before beginning the feasibility study. The executive support team is active throughout the access revision process. Their primary duty is to interpret policy and set direction for their representatives involved in the technical support team. The representatives will be signees on the deliverables that are required throughout this chapter. The executive support team meets to monitor the progress of the deliverables and prepares records of meeting minutes and decisions. Due to the scalability of the process, the executive support team can vary with each access revision case but will typically have a core of the following individuals:
•
•
•
•
•
FHWA Safety and Geometric Design Engineer Region Representatives (Assistant Regional Administer, Traffic Engineer, Local Programs Engineer, Environmental Manager, and/or Planning Manager) Assistant State Design Engineer HQ Transportation Operations Division Local agency representatives (city, county, port, transit and/or tribal government)

Chapter 550
Freeway Access Revision
550.04(2) Technical Support Team The technical support team conducts a majority of the detailed analyses required throughout the access revision process. This team meets regularly to ensure deliverables and project details are coordinated across disciplines. A subgroup of the technical team may also conduct separate meetings to coordinate specific details. The technical team delivers results and conclusions of their work back to the executive support team for review and approval. The technical group records and tracks meeting minutes and action items. Due to the scalability of the process, the technical support team can vary with each access revision case. Work with the executive support team to make sure the right personnel are on the team. The team members may include representation from the following groups:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Planning organization (Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) and/or Regional Transportation Planning Organization (RTPO)) FHWA (Area Engineer, Environmental Program Manager, and/or ITS Engineer) WSDOT Region (planning, design, environmental, maintenance, and/or traffic) WSDOT HQ Multimodal Development & Delivery Local agency specialist (planning, developer services, public works, and/or engineering) Project proponents specialists (developer and/or consultant) Multimodal specialist (transit, bike, and/or pedestrian) Other identified stakeholders/partners
550.05 Non-Access Feasibility Study Process The goal of this first step in the access revision process is to look at the non-access transportation network to determine if improvements can be made that address performance gaps for all modes. Non-access improvements are solutions that do not impact the gore points to/from the mainline of the freeway. Examples are changes to the local street network, travel demand management, traffic operations enhancements, crossroads, ramp meters, minor geometric ramp modifications, transit, and minor ramp terminal modifications. The Non-Access Feasibility Study is a multistep process and begins (see Exhibit 550-1) with assembling an executive support team. The WSDOT Region assembles the executive support team. The executive support team convenes and the local, regional, tribal, or state entity that is the proponent of the access revision presents the performance gaps that represent the probable baseline needs for an access revision. If the executive support team agrees there is a probable performance gap that needs further study, then the technical support team is formed. The technical support team develops the draft purpose and need and the process of conducting a nonaccess feasibility study begins and a method and assumptions (M&A) document is prepared.

Linking to the state and local planning representatives is essential. It is possible that a local planning study has been conducted that meets the requirements of the non-access feasibility study. If this is the case, the executive support team can make the determination that the planning study is sufficient and move on to the ARR. It is necessary to also coordinate with the region’s environmental representative to help ensure the local planning study is sufficient in developing the purpose and need necessary for the environmental process.
550.05(1) Non-Access Feasibility Study Methods and Assumptions Document The next step in a Non-Access Feasibility Study is to create a methods and assumptions (M&A) document that establishes the methods followed while the study is being conducted and the assumptions made during the study. Cover the following points in the M&A document:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Team Participants o Executive team members, roles, and responsibilities o Technical team members, roles, and responsibilities Scalability (if applicable, see Section 530.03(1) and Exhibit 550-3) Planning Linkage o Pertinent planning documents o Prior community engagement Environmental Linkage o Probable environmental documentation: EIS, EA, or CE o NEPA/SEPA compliance strategy Community Engagement o See Community Engagement Plan Alternatives Selection o Process for determining non-access reasonable alternatives including alternative development and screening Traffic Operational Analysis Scope and Scale o Determine the study area for operational analysis. For efficiency and uniformity of data, it may be beneficial to assume a freeway access revision will be necessary when determining the study area. Discuss the study area in detail, reach agreement on its scope and scale, and record in the M&A document. Typical analysis study areas include: ▪ Particularly in urbanized areas, at least the first adjacent existing or proposed interchange on either side of where an access revision is being considered and the entire freeway components within this area. ▪ The crossroads to at least the first major intersection on either side of where the access revision is being considered. The local street network should be extended as necessary to fully evaluate the impacts of the proposed change in access. ▪ Incorporate connections to the transit network inside the study area as modifications to the transit service may impact travel demand. ▪ Incorporate regional trails and shared-use paths inside the study area as improving multimodal connectivity may impact travel demand. o Study period: AM/PM Peak, midday, weekends o Study years: Current, opening, design/horizon o Methodology: Highway Capacity Manual or other tool o Multimodal priorities and accommodation

The above list is not all-encompassing nor is everything in the list covered in every study. The technical support team refines the above list as necessary and submits the outline of the feasibility study to the executive support team for concurrence. The Non-Access Feasibility Study M&A document contains a signature page for concurrence by the executive support team. A template for the M&A document is here: Non-Access-Feasibility-Study-Signature-Page.docx (live.com) The Non-Access Feasibility Study may begin upon concurrence of the M&A document.
550.05(2) Non-Access Feasibility Study Conduct and document the non-access feasibility study following the assumptions and guidance set forth in the M&A document. This determines whether non-access improvements can address the performance gaps agreed upon by the executive support team. The Non-Access Feasibility Study contains the following items:
•
•
•
•
Signature Page Project Background Vicinity Map o Study Area Planning Linkage (see Section 550.05(2)(a)) o Multimodal Needs
•
•
•
•
•
Traffic Volumes (see Section 550.05(2)(b)) Traffic Operational Analysis (see Section 550.05(2)(c)) Safety Performance Analysis (see Section 550.05(2)(d)) Reasonable Non-Access Alternatives (see Section 550.05(2)(e)) Conclusion (see Section 550.05(2)(f)) o Purpose and Need for Access Revision
Non-Access Feasibility Study is compiled and reviewed first by the technical support team prior to being sent to the executive support team for signature.

If the process does not go into the ARR phase, then send a final copy of the Non-Access Feasibility Report to your ASDE for filing. If the process continues into the ARR phase, then attach the Non-Access Feasibility Report to the ARR as an appendix.
550.05(2)(a) Planning Linkage It is essential to create the linkage to the transportation planning processes and outputs by the WSDOT and other agencies in the non-access feasibility study. Any transportation improvement considered in the access revision process should align with these planning processes. Describe how the improvements are consistent with local land use plans, and local, regional, and state transportation plans including possible future interchanges, bicyclist/pedestrian networks, transit service, and possible development. While the need for freeway access is motor vehicle based, it is also important to address the needs of all modes that will access and use the local networks and freeway crossroad(s). An important aspect of the planning linkage is to address multimodal connectivity on the crossroad. While interchange crossroads may provide vehicle access to and from the freeway mainline, they also provide critical multimodal connectivity between land uses on either side of the freeway. Consult comprehensive land use and transportation plans for multimodal elements. Document multimodal needs, priority, and accommodation in the Non-Access Feasibility Study. A non-access feasibility study may be performed in conjunction with another planning process. When a nonaccess feasibility study is performed in conjunction with another planning process, then that process must address the requirements for a non-access feasibility study in addition to requirements of other planning processes. Include WSDOT Planning and local agency staff (land use and transportation planning specialties) in the technical support team to determine if this linkage is possible or beneficial. If another planning process or study appears to meet the requirements of the Non-Access Feasibility Study, have the technical support team review it and determine if it is applicable. If the technical team finds the process or study meets the requirements of the feasibility study, then present it to the executive support team and request an exemption from the feasibility study process. Clearly document this exemption and receive written approval from the members of the executive support team.
550.05(2)(b) Traffic Volumes Traffic volumes for the existing, opening, design, and horizon year are determined and reported in the feasibility study. It is important to consider pedestrian, bicyclist, and transit volumes where applicable. The existing year is the year the traffic data is collected. Consult Chapter 1103 for definitions and details of opening, design, and horizon years. The data for the future years may come from a regional transportation model or linear projections unique to the study. Exponential growth projections are not recommended. Regional transportation models may also be used for the opening and design year volumes. Transportation models are commonly maintained by a Metropolitan Planning Organization. These models predict traffic volumes by dividing the area into zones, populating these zones with the appropriate type of land use, and predicting travel demand on the road network based upon the trip demand and travel time between destinations. The process to develop these models is extensive; therefore, the models are not continuously updated. Opening/design years that do not correlate with the years of the regional transportation model may be adjusted by a linear growth rate to the opening/design year of the traffic study. The technical support team determines how to best use an available model. Document the model used, how the model was calibrated and validated. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 550-8
Chapter 550
Freeway Access Revision
Traffic models used for the ARR process should incorporate transit, bicyclists, and pedestrians. If the model does not have the ability to incorporate these other modes, investigate the viability of modifying link and intra-zone trips with the technical support team to reflect the multimodal trips. Consider how changing access to these other modes may impact travel demand within and through the study area. If linear projections are used, be careful to not base projection on a valley or peak in historic traffic volumes. Record any assumptions applied to linear projections in the feasibility study.
550.05(2)(c) Operational Analysis Conduct the operational analysis over the study area, using the tools and methodology in accordance with the M&A document. Conduct the operational analysis on the opening and design year. The technical support team determines if it is necessary to have existing year analysis or if the no-build at opening year is sufficient. For these years:
•
•
•
Conduct the Existing operational analysis over the study area (if required by the technical support team) o No change in the existing roadway network. o Use the existing traffic volumes and calibrate to existing conditions to determine if the analysis reflects existing conditions and the model is validated. Conduct Base Improvements operational analysis over the study area. o The existing roadway network with the addition of local or non-access transportation projects and services that are funded for construction/delivery or have a high likelihood of being constructed/delivered, as identified as base network improvements in the M&A document. Incorporate base network improvements into the analysis. o The result of this base improvements operational analysis is a list of the locations where the transportation system has potential performance gaps. Compare this list of locations to the performance gaps identified in the beginning of the access revision process. The analysis helps clarify whether or not performance gaps exist. Identify these gaps in the report. These identified gaps will be where the technical support team focuses in the operational analysis done for the reasonable non-access alternatives. This leads to identification of performance targets by mode. Conduct the Build operational analysis over the study area. o Incorporate the base improvements as the starting point, then evaluate reasonable nonaccess alternatives as discussed in Section 550.05(2)(e) o The build operational analysis assesses whether the non-access alternatives address the identified performance gaps.
i Intersection Control Evaluation (New Section 2023) Conduct an Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) per Section 1300.05 or incorporate the requirements of an ICE into the non-access feasibility study operational analysis for all parts of the study area that are state highways. If the non-access feasibility study appropriately incorporates all aspects of Section 1300.05 into the study, a separate ICE for state highway intersections will not be required.
550.05(2)(d) Safety Analysis Conduct a safety analysis per Chapter 321.04 and Section 8.1 of the Safety Analysis Guide. In this section of the feasibility study, discuss the safety performance of the existing transportation network. For the non-access Feasibility Study, the safety analysis needs to focus on the non-access network; safety analysis of the freeway mainline is not required. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 550-9
Chapter 550
Freeway Access Revision
550.05(2)(e) Reasonable Non-Access Alternatives The Non-Access Feasibility Study must look at reasonable alternatives that can address the performance gaps noted in the operational analysis and/or safety performance analysis. The determination of reasonable alternatives follows the process as noted in Chapter 400.07(1)4 of the WSDOT Environmental Manual. Each reasonable alternative must consider the change in safety performance per the Safety Analysis Guide. The goal of the alternatives is to identify non-access improvements and performance targets that address operation gaps and safety performance characteristics for all modes. Alternatives should first consider nonaccess, operational and/or demand management improvements. Coordinate these improvements with local and state planning staff. The technical support team initiates alternatives for consideration and presents them to the executive support team for approval. Include alternatives comprised of varying types such as intersection solutions, corridor solutions, land use modifications, transit improvements, mode shift, travel demand management or other systematic network-based Practical Solutions approaches. Use the measures of effectiveness discussed in the methods and assumptions document to compare alternatives. Provide a list of non-access improvements needed to address the performance gaps. If an improvement will be within the state’s jurisdiction, then complete a scoping Basis of Design for this improvement and include as an appendix to the feasibility study. If the non-access improvements can address the performance gaps within the criteria defined in the M&A, then state such in this section and conclude the access revision process. If the non-access improvements do not completely address the performance gaps, but do show value, then they should be carried forward into the access revision analysis for further inclusion in the project.
550.05(2)(f) Non-Access Conclusion If the non-access improvements can address the performance gaps within the criteria defined in the M&A, then state such in this section and conclude the access revision process. If the feasibility study indicates that addressing performance gaps cannot be reasonably achieved without revising freeway access, then write a purpose and need for access revision in this section of the feasibility study. This purpose and need statement should be written in close coordination with the Environmental Office as this is a key linkage point between the NEPA/SEPA process and the access revision process. The goal of this section is to provide a purpose and need statement that can be used for the Access Revision Report, a Basis of Design for an access revision, and the NEPA/SEPA process. In addition to the purpose and needs statement, summarize the non-access alternatives that are needed and carried this list forward into the ARR.
550.06 Access Revision Report Process In order to approve or reject a proposed revision to freeway access, specific analyses are to be completed and then documented in a technical report. This report is the Access Revision Report (ARR), previously known as an Interchange Justification Report (IJR). The proponents, with the help of the support team, prepares the ARR. One of the first steps should be the formation of the Executive Support Team. See Section 550.04. Next develop a methods and assumptions document as outlined in Section 550.05(2). The M&A document will be used to analyze the access revision and assist in developing the Access Revision Report.

Freeway Access Revision
550.06(1) Access Revision Report Method and Assumptions Document Begin by reevaluating the Non-Access Feasibility Study M&A to determine if it is applicable to the ARR. Pay attention to the sections on alternatives selection and assumptions. These two sections will likely change between the feasibility and the ARR phases. If there is no change, the Non-Access Feasibility M&A may be adopted by the executive committee. If a modification of the M&A is necessary, the executive committee has the ability to require a full rewrite or to agree to a scaled down effort for the ARR. If a full rewrite is necessary, follow the same outline as presented in Section 550.05(1) with the addition of allowing on-system improvements.
550.06(2) Access Revision Report The Access Revision Report addresses: 1. 2. 3. 4.
Reasonable Alternatives; see Section 550.06(2)(a) Operational Analysis; see Section 550.06(2)(b) Safety Performance Analysis; see Section 550.06(2)(c) Conceptual Signing Plan; see Section 550.06(2)(d)
The following provides details for completing the Access Revision Report.
550.06(2)(a) ARR Reasonable Alternatives Consider alternatives in the Non-Access Feasibility Study that are carried forward into the ARR process and any new alternatives that may be developed for on-system alternatives. Then narrow the alternatives down to a few reasonable alternatives that will go through the evaluation process. Determine the reasonable alternatives for the ARR phase near the beginning of the process. This is necessary because the alternatives will set the course for the operational and safety analysis and determine exactly what must be analyzed. The technical team evaluates each reasonable alternative with respect to operations and safety performance for all modes (see Section 550.06(2)(b) and 550.06(2)(c)). Alternatives are refined based upon the results of the analysis and then presented to the executive support team for acceptance. Conduct the alternatives selection and analysis process within the ARR with full consideration of the environmental process and environmental documentation that will be required. The ARR must be fully compatible with the corresponding environmental process. Include Region environmental staff in the alternatives selection process. In the ARR document, include a description of the reasonable alternatives identified for consideration. At this point, you should have a few reasonable alternatives that will be carried forward through the whole ARR process and will have detailed operations and safety analysis conducted (see Section 550.06(2)(b) and 550.06(2)(c)). The results of this analysis will be used to compare the alternatives and ultimately reach a preferred alternative. To document the evaluation criteria and the results of the analysis, use the Alternatives Comparison Table (ACT) or a similar tool.

Chapter 550
Freeway Access Revision
i Public Road Connection The ARR must show that the proposed access will connect to a public road network. Less than “full interchanges” may be considered on a case-by-case basis for applications requiring special access, such as managed lanes (e.g., transit or high occupancy vehicle and high occupancy toll lanes) or park and ride lots. In other cases where all basic movements are not provided by the proposed design, the ARR typically includes a full interchange option with a comparison of the operational and safety performance analyses to the partial-interchange option. The ARR should also include the mitigation proposed to compensate for the missing movements, including wayfinding signage, impacts on local intersections, mitigation of driver expectation leading to wrong-way movements on ramps, etc. The ARR should demonstrate that the future provision of a full interchange is not precluded by the proposal or describe how that future decision will be accommodated. The crossroad must address the needs of all modes that are supported by the land use and demographics of the area. While the needs and priority of multimodal users are identified in the feasibility study, the ARR helps ensure multimodal needs are incorporated in the design.
ii Design Standards and Criteria FHWA policy requires that AASHTO Interstate standards (A Policy on Design Standards – Interstate System, AASHTO, latest edition) are used. This Design Manual provides criteria to meet FHWA and WSDOT policy on geometric standards. To achieve design standards requirements, apply the criteria in these key Design Manual Chapters:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Chapters 1100 – 1106 for an overview of practical design procedures, development of need statements, procedures for selecting appropriate multimodal design controls and design element dimensions. Assume the crossroad design will have implications and effects on all travel modes legally allowed. Provide obvious traffic control for all modes. Chapters in the 1200 series provide geometrics including plan and profile elements and freeway and other roadway type cross section criteria. Chapter 1232 provides geometric cross section dimensions for Interstate and non-Interstate freeways. Other chapters in this series provide cross section criteria for roadway types which could apply to multimodal crossroads and local street or roadway contexts. Chapters in the 1300 series provide design criteria for Interchange spacing and design, and procedures for evaluating intersection control types. Chapter 1300 and Chapter 1360 For special interchanges for HOV or Transit, see chapters in the 1400 series. Chapters in the 1500 series provide design guidance for pedestrian and bicyclist facilities. See other chapters as applicable for various aspects of design and approvals.
550.06(2)(b) ARR Operational Analysis The operational analysis for the ARR builds upon the operational analysis from the feasibility study. If demonstrated in the feasibility study that local solutions will not completely satisfy the Purpose and Need, the scope of the ARR operational analysis includes reasonable alternatives that consider revisions in freeway access as well as non-access improvements that are carried forward from the Non-Access Feasibility Study.

Freeway Access Revision
This analysis must conclude that the proposed change in access does not have a significant adverse impact on the safety and operation of the freeway facility or on the local street network for all modes, based on both current and planned future traffic projections. The freeway facility includes the main line lanes, collectordistributor lanes, existing, new, or modified ramps, and ramp intersections with crossroad. The following are typical requirements for the analysis. The technical support team makes the ultimate decisions on transportation operational and safety performance analysis requirements. However, FHWA policy suggests the following expectations.
•
•
•
•
The analysis includes, particularly in urbanized areas, a minimum of the first adjacent existing or proposed interchange on either side of the proposed change in access. The crossroads and the local street network, to a minimum of the first major intersection on either side of the proposed change in access, should be included in this analysis to the extent necessary to fully evaluate the safety performance and operational impacts that the proposed change in access and other transportation improvements may have on the local street network. The requested proposed change in access should include a description and assessment of the impacts and ability of the proposed changes to collect, distribute, and accommodate traffic on the Interstate facility, ramps, intersection of ramps with crossroad, and local street network. Intersection Control Analysis (ICE)(see Section 550.05(2)(c)i)
550.06(2)(c) ARR Safety Analysis Conduct a safety performance analysis per Chapter 321 and Section 8.1 of the Safety Analysis Guide. For the ARR, discuss the safety performance of the reasonable alternatives. Use the results of the safety performance analysis to compare alternatives.
550.06(2)(d) ARR Signing Plan Include a conceptual plan of the type and location of the signs proposed for the preferred alternative to support the Access Revision Report. The conceptual plan is typically limited to guide signage, but regulatory or warning signs may be required if the interchange configuration is unusual.
550.06(3) Access Revision Report Review and Approval A template for Access Revision Report approvals and concurrence signatures is available on the Design Tools & support webpage, under the Signature pages for approval section. Design guidance & support | WSDOT (wa.gov) Draft ARR review: The draft ARR is first reviewed by the executive and technical support teams. After their review, the Region submits an electronic copy (in PDF format), including appendices, to the ASDE along with a cover memo requesting review. The ASDE responds in writing either with needed revisions or to request the final draft. Final ARR Submittal: For final submittal, send the final ARR in PDF format to the ASDE. Contact the ASDE for the necessary number of hard copies. The Region submits a memo to the appropriate ASDE, requesting final approval of the ARR. After ASDE concurrence, the ASDE submits Interstate ARRs to FHWA for approval. ARR Approvals can be a two-step process:
•
•
If environmental documentation is not complete, teams can request a finding of engineering and operational acceptability. FHWA grants this for Interstate access revisions and WSDOT grants for noninterstate. If the environmental documentation is complete, teams request final ARR approval.

Interstate Approval Notes:
•
Interstate Access Revision Reports are most often reviewed and approved by the Washington FHWA Division Office. A 30-day review period must be allowed for the FHWA Division Office. Occasionally they are sent to FHWA Headquarters Office in Washington, DC (see Exhibit 550-3). If this is the case, additional review time is necessary.
FHWA provides final approval of the Interstate ARR when the appropriate final environmental document is complete: CE, FONSI, or ROD. The intent of the federal policy is to create a clear link between the ARR and NEPA processes. The ARR may be used as the transportation discipline report for an EIS/EA or included as an attachment to a CE. Coordinate with the Region Environmental Staff to integrate the ARR with the environmental documentation. WSDOT provides final approval of the non-Interstate ARR when the appropriate final environmental document is complete.
550.06(4) Updating the Access Revision Report The period between the approval of the Access Revision Report, completion of the environmental documentation, and the construction contract commonly spans several years. If the period exceeds three years, the approved ARR must be reviewed to identify changes that may have occurred during this period. If there have been little or no changes, an extension of the period may be granted. In this case, write a summary assessment for approval by the Region Traffic Engineer, ASDE, and FHWA. If no work has begun within three years of completion of the environmental documentation, a re-evaluation of the CE/EA/EIS may be required (see Environmental Manual 400.06(1)). Contact the Region Environmental Office to determine if the environmental documentation must be re-evaluated.

Notes: [1] Washington Transportation Management Areas include Southwest Washington Regional Transportation Council (RTC) (Clark County), Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) (King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties), and Spokane Regional Transportation Council (SRTC) (Spokane County). [2] “Revision” includes changes in interchange configuration even if the number of access points does not change. Changing from a cloverleaf to a directional interchange is an example of a “revision.” [3] “Revision” includes changes that might adversely affect the level of service of the through lanes. Examples include: doubling lanes for an on-ramp with double entry to the freeway; adding a loop ramp to an existing diamond interchange; and replacing a diamond ramp with a loop ramp. Revisions to the ramp terminal intersections may not require an ARR unless the traffic analysis shows an impact to the main line traffic. [4] The scale and scope of the access revision dictate the level of effort needed. Consult the Assistant State Design Engineer (ASDE), Region Traffic, and the FHWA Area Engineer, if applicable, for direction. [5] Consult the Region Planning Manager for the status of planning at this location. [6] An Operations and Safety Analysis must be conducted. The ASDE will send and Access Change Determination with the analysis for FHWA to determine if the proposal is considered a change in access in accordance with FHWA access policy. If FHWA determines it is not a change in access, then the ASDE sets the scale and scope of the remainder of the ARR process. Otherwise, FHWA and ASDE will be involved in setting the scale and scope.

Fencing
560.01 General 560.02 Design Criteria 560.03 Fencing Types 560.04 Gates 560.05 Procedure 560.06 Documentation 560.07 References
560.01 General Fencing is provided primarily to discourage encroachment onto Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) highway right of way from adjacent property, to delineate the right of way, and to replace fencing that has been disrupted by construction. Encroachment onto the right of way is discouraged to limit the presence of people and animals that might disrupt the efficient flow of traffic on the facility. Although not the primary intent, fencing does provide some separation between people, animals, traffic flow, and other features.
560.02 Design Criteria 560.02(1) General Fencing on a continuous alignment usually has a pleasing appearance and is the most economical to construct and maintain. The recommended practice is to locate fencing on or, depending on the terrain, 12 inches inside the right of way line. Where the anticipated or existing right of way line has abrupt irregularities over short distances, coordinate with Maintenance and Real Estate Services personnel to dispose of the irregularities as excess property (where possible) and fence the final property line in a manner acceptable to Maintenance. Whenever possible, preserve the natural assets of the surrounding area and minimize the number of fence types on any particular project.
560.02(2) Limited Access Highways On highways with full and partial limited access control, fencing is mandatory unless it has been established that such fencing may be deferred. Fencing is not required for modified limited access control areas, but may be installed where appropriate. Fencing is required between frontage roads and adjacent parking or pedestrian areas (such as rest areas and flyer stops) and highway lanes or ramps unless other barriers are used to discourage access violations. On new alignment, fencing is not provided between the frontage road and abutting property unless the abutting property was enclosed prior to highway construction. Such fencing is normally part of the right of way negotiation.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 560-1
Chapter 560
Fencing
Unless there is a possibility of access control violation, fencing installation may be deferred until needed at the following locations:
•
•
•
•
•
In areas where rough topography or dense vegetation provides a natural barrier. Along rivers or other natural bodies of water. In sagebrush country that is sparsely settled. In areas with high snowfall levels and sparse population. On long sections of undeveloped public or private lands not previously fenced.
When in doubt about fencing installation, consult the Headquarters (HQ) Access and Hearings Manager.
560.02(3) Managed Access Highways Fencing is not required for managed access highways. When highway construction will destroy the fence of an abutting property owner (which was originally constructed on private property), the cost of replacement fencing may be included in the right of way payment. When the fences of several property owners will be impacted, it may be cost-effective to replace the fences as part of the project. If fencing is essential to the safe operation of the highway, it will be constructed and maintained by the state. An example is the separation of traveled highway lanes from adjacent facilities with parking or pedestrian areas (such as rest areas and flyer stops).
560.02(4) Special Sites Fencing may be needed at special sites such as pit sites, stockpiles, borrow areas, and stormwater detention facilities. Fencing is not normally installed around stormwater detention ponds. Evaluate the need to provide fencing around stormwater detention facilities when pedestrians or bicyclists are frequently present. Document your decision in the Design Documentation Package. The following conditions suggest a need to evaluate fencing:
•
•
•
Children or persons with mobility impairments are frequently present in significant numbers in locations adjacent to the facility, such as routes identified in school walk route plans or nearby residential areas or parks. Water depth reaches or exceeds 12 inches for several days. Sideslopes into the facility are steeper than 3H:1V.
Fencing proposed at sites that will be outside WSDOT right of way requires that local ordinances be followed if they are more stringent than WSDOT’s. Wetland mitigation sites are not normally fenced. When evaluating fencing for wetland mitigation sites, balance the need to restrict human access for safety considerations (such as the presence of children) with the need to provide animal habitat. Other special sites where fencing may be required are addressed in the following chapters:
•
•
•
Section 720.03(13), Bridge Fence Chapter 1510 Pedestrian Facilities Chapter 1520 Roadway Bicycle Facilities
The fencing types and designs for special sites are determined by the requirements of each situation.

Chapter 560
Fencing
560.03 Fencing Types 560.03(1) Chain Link Installation of chain link fence is appropriate for maximum protection against right of way encroachment on sections of high-volume highways in the following locations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Along existing business districts adjacent to a freeway. Between freeways and adjacent parallel city streets. Where existing streets have been cut off by freeway construction. In industrial areas. At large residential developments. On military reservations. At schools and colleges. In recreational and athletic areas. In developed areas at the intersection of two limited access highways. At any other location where a barrier is needed to protect against pedestrian, bicyclist, or livestock encroachment in limited access areas.
For roadway sections in rock cuts, see Chapter 1239. The Standard Plans contains details for the approved types of chain link fence. The recommended uses for each type of fence are as follows:
560.03(1)(a) Type 3 This is a high fence for areas of intensified use, such as industrial areas or school playgrounds. Use this fence for new installations of high fencing. It may be used within the Design Clear Zone.
560.03(1)(b) Type 4 This is a lower fence for special use, such as between the traveled highway lanes and a rest area or transit flyer stop or as a rest area boundary fence if required by the development of the surrounding area. This fence may be used along a shared-use path or trail to separate it from an adjacent roadway. Justify why corrective action is not taken when existing fencing with a rigid top rail will be left in place within the limits of a proposed project. For cases where a more rigid fence is needed, contact the HQ Design Office. Coated galvanized chain link fence is available in various colors and may be considered in areas where aesthetic considerations are important. Coated ungalvanized chain link fence is not recommended.
560.03(2) Wire Fencing The Standard Plans and the Standard Specifications contain details for the two approved types of wire fence. The recommended uses for each type of fence are as follows:
560.03(2)(a) Type 1 This fence is used in urban and suburban areas where improvements along the right of way are infrequent and future development is not anticipated. It may also be used adjacent to livestock grazing areas. The lower portion of this fence is wire mesh and provides a barrier to children and small animals.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 560-3
Chapter 560
Fencing
560.03(2)(b) Type 2 This fence is used in farming areas to limit highway crossings by farm vehicles to designated approaches. These areas include irrigation districts to prevent ditch riders, maintenance personnel, and farmers from making unauthorized highway crossings, and where new alignment crosses parcels previously enclosed by barbed wire.
560.03(3) Other Considerations Extremely tall fences (7 to 10 feet high) may be used in areas where there are exceptional conditions such as large concentrations of deer or elk. (See the region Environmental Services Office and the Roadside Manual concerning wildlife management.) Metal fencing can interfere with airport traffic control radar. When locating fencing in the vicinity of an airport, contact the Federal Aviation Administration to determine whether metal fence will create radar interference at the airport. If so, use nonmetallic fencing. Do not straddle or obstruct surveying monuments with any type of fencing.
560.04 Gates Keep the number of fence gates along limited access highways to a minimum. On limited access highways, all new gates must be approved as described in Chapter 550. Usually such gates are necessary only to allow highway maintenance personnel and operating equipment to reach the state right of way without using the highway or freeway main line. Gates may be needed to provide access to utility supports, manholes, and so on, located within the right of way. Use gates of the same type as each fence and provide locks to deter unauthorized use. In highly developed and landscaped areas where maintenance equipment is parked outside the fence, provide the double gate shown in the Standard Plans. Where continuous fencing is not provided on limited access highways (see Chapter 530), approaches are normally gated and locked, with a short section of fence on both sides of the gate.
560.05 Procedure Fencing is addressed in the access report (see Chapter 530) and the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates, in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual.

Exhibit 610-1 Materials Source Development
610.01 General It is the Washington State Department of Transportation’s (WSDOT’s) responsibility to understand the characteristics of the soil and rock materials that support or are adjacent to a transportation facility so that, when designed, constructed, and maintained, the facility will be adequate to safely carry the estimated traffic. It is also the responsibility of WSDOT to ensure the quality and quantity of all borrow, soils, rock, and surfacing materials used in the construction of transportation facilities. Specific requirements for geotechnical investigation, design, construction, and maintenance support are set forth in the WSDOT Geotechnical Design Manual. The following information serves as guidance in the above areas. When a project consists of a surface overlay on an existing highway, the WSDOT Pavement Policy is used. Before making project budget and schedule commitments to the Legislature, other agencies, and the public, it is necessary to identify the extent and estimated cost for a project. Contact the Region Materials Engineer (RME) and the Headquarters (HQ) Geotechnical Office as early as possible to obtain conceptual-level recommendations regarding how the project soil, rock, and groundwater conditions may affect the design of the project elements. The project soil, rock, and groundwater conditions, and the availability, quantity, and quality of borrow and surfacing materials, can affect the project scope, schedule, and budget. The RME and the HQ Geotechnical Office will use existing subsurface information and their knowledge of the project area to assess the subsurface conditions within the project limits. If there is little information available or the information is poor, and the subsurface conditions have the potential to significantly affect the project budget or schedule, it may be necessary to obtain a limited number of geotechnical borings or test pits during Project Definition to assess soil, rock, and groundwater conditions within the project limits. Once the Project Definition has been developed and project funding secured, a more detailed geotechnical investigation follows during the design and Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) phases. It is essential to involve the RME and the HQ Geotechnical Office in the design as soon as possible once the need for geotechnical work is identified. (See Section 610.04(3) for time-estimate information.) If major changes occur as the project is developed, inform the RME and the HQ Geotechnical Office as soon as possible so that the geotechnical design can be adapted to the changes without significant delay to the project.

610.03 Materials Sources 610.03(1) General The region Project Development Engineer determines when a materials source is needed. The RME determines the best materials source for the project (see Exhibit 610-1). It is preferred that existing approved materials source sites be used when there are suitable sites available. When there are no approved sites available, the RME determines the locations for new materials sources. The RME contacts the HQ Geotechnical Office to provide a geotechnical investigation for the proposed site. The HQ Geotechnical Office provides geologic mapping of the site; develops a subsurface exploration plan and cost estimate; conducts the subsurface investigation; develops a subsurface geologic model including groundwater; evaluates slope stability issues; and makes recommendations. The HQ Geotechnical Office develops and provides a geotechnical report with materials source development recommendations to the RME. The RME uses this report and materials source recommendations to develop the Materials Source Report and to identify the quantity and quality of material that are intended for the life of the materials source. Specific requirements for materials source investigations are set forth in the Geotechnical Design Manual.
610.03(2) Materials Source Approval The HQ Geotechnical Office must review and approve the Materials Source Report produced by the RME to ensure consistency with the geotechnical report produced by the HQ Geotechnical Office. The HQ Materials Office and the HQ Design Office must approve each pit or quarry site before it is purchased, leased, or acquired on a royalty basis. Until the approval process is complete, the project cannot be advertised for bids. Local and state permits are required for materials sources. To avoid delay in advertising the project, begin the site investigations and permitting process in the early stages of the Project Definition phase.
610.04 Geotechnical Investigation, Design, and Reporting 610.04(1) General A geotechnical investigation is conducted on all projects that involve significant grading quantities (including state-owned materials source development), unstable ground, foundations for structures, and groundwater impacts (including infiltration). The goal of the geotechnical investigation is to preserve the safety of those who use the facility, as well as to preserve the economic investment by the state of Washington. Additional WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 610-2
Chapter 610
Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
requirements regarding geotechnical investigations and who conducts these investigations are set forth in the Geotechnical Design Manual.
610.04(2) Key Contacts for Initiating Geotechnical Work For regions, the RME is the first person to contact for geotechnical work. Projects with structures designed by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, Washington State Ferries (WSF) projects, and Urban Corridors projects generally require the involvement of the HQ Geotechnical Office. These particular WSDOT offices should contact the HQ Geotechnical Office directly for their geotechnical project needs. The specific roles and responsibilities of the RME and HQ Geotechnical Office, including application to the Project Management Process (PMP), are set forth in the Geotechnical Design Manual. For information on retaining walls and noise walls, see Design Manual Chapter 730 and Chapter 740, respectively. For geosynthetic design, see Chapter 630.
610.04(3) Scheduling Considerations for Geotechnical Work The region Project Office, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, the WSF, and the HQ Facilities Office are responsible for identifying the potential need for geotechnical work and requesting time and budget estimates from the RME or the HQ Geotechnical Office as early as possible to prevent delays to the project. Once the geotechnical design request and the site data are received by the RME or the HQ Geotechnical Office, it can take from two to six months or more to complete the geotechnical design. Design completion depends on the complexity of the project, whether or not test holes are needed, current workload, the need to give the work to consultants, and how long it takes to obtain environmental permits and rights of entry. If a consultant must be used, the minimum time required to complete a design (for even a simple project) is typically two and a half months. In true emergency situations (such as a highway blocked by a landslide or a collapsed bridge), it is possible to get geotechnical design work completed (in-house or by consultants) more rapidly to at least provide a design for temporary mitigation. Consider all of these factors when deciding how soon (in general, as early as possible) to initiate the geotechnical work for a project. To incorporate geotechnical scheduling considerations into the overall project schedule, see the Geotechnical Design Manual, which provides a description and discussion of the Master Deliverables List (MDL) as it applies to geotechnical work.
610.04(4) Site Data and Permits Needed to Initiate Geotechnical Work 610.04(4)(a) Geotechnical Work During Project Definition Phase To initiate geotechnical work on a project during the Project Definition phase, provide the following information: 1. Project description. 2. Plan view or description showing the proposed alignment or alignment alternative(s). 3. Description of project scope as it relates to geotechnical features such as major cuts and fills, walls, structures, and potential stormwater facilities.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 610-3
Chapter 610
Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
610.04(4)(b) Geotechnical Work During Design and PS&E Phases To initiate geotechnical work on a project during the design and PS&E phases, provide the following information: 1. Project description. 2. Plan sheets showing: o Station and location of cuts, fills, walls, bridges, retention/detention ponds, and other geotechnical features to be designed. o Existing utilities; as-built plans are acceptable. o Right of way limits. o Wetlands. o Drainage features. o Existing structures. o Other features or constraints that could affect the geotechnical design or investigation. 3. Electronic files, or cross sections every 50 feet or as appropriate, to define existing and new ground line above and below walls, cuts, fills, and other pertinent information. o Show stationing. o Show locations of existing utilities, right of way lines, wetlands, and other constraints. o Show locations of existing structures that might contribute load to the cut, fill, wall, or other structure. 4. Right of entry agreements and permits required for geotechnical investigation. 5. Due date and work order number. 6. Contact person. When the alignment and any constraints (as noted above) are staked, the stationing on the plans and in the field must be in the same units. Physical surveys are preferred to photogrammetric surveys to ensure adequate accuracy of the site data. Permits and agreements to be supplied by the region might include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
HPA Shoreline permits Tribal lands and waters Railroad easement and right of way City, county, or local agency use permits Sensitive area ordinance permits
The region Project Office is also responsible for providing survey locations of test holes once the test holes have been drilled. The survey information includes the station, offset, elevation, and test hole coordinates. Coordinates are the latitude and longitude or state plane coordinates (north or south as appropriate), but not project coordinates.
610.04(5) Well Decommissioning In accordance with RCW 18.104.020 and WAC 173-160-111, a well is defined as a water well, resource protection well, dewatering well, and geotechnical soil boring. Specifically, RCW 18.104.020(8) defines "geotechnical soil boring" or "boring" as “a well drilled for the purpose of obtaining soil samples or information to ascertain structural properties of the subsurface.”

Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
Wells may be installed as part of the project design for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to monitoring groundwater and performing downhole testing after drilling within the cased hole. A more detailed definition of a well and all applicable WACs and RCWs related to this subject are summarized in Chapter 3 of the Geotechnical Design Manual (GDM). All wells are assigned a unique well tag ID that is unique to that well throughout the life cycle from the time of installation during drilling until decommissioning when the well is no longer needed. The region project office and the geotechnical office should work together to ensure that the decommissioning of all wells within the limits of a project and within WSDOT right of way occurs in accordance with Department of Ecology regulations prior to construction. This includes wells completed by WSDOT HQ Geotechnical crews, Region drill crews, consultant drillers under subcontract to WSDOT (both directly and through GECs), and wells installed by outside agencies within WSDOT right of way. The HQ Geotechnical Office is responsible for maintaining a database of all active wells within WSDOT right-of way, including those done by outside agency or by drilling contractors under subcontract. All wells, including those installed by outside agencies or consultants, should be clearly identified in the PS&E plans (see Plans Preparation Manual). The timing of decommission can vary depending on the purpose of the well installation, but in general all wells should be decommissioned prior to contract award unless there is an unusual circumstance that would make it beneficial to continue monitoring from a safety standpoint or other reason during construction. If this is the case, then this must be discussed at the first general pre-construction meeting for the project with the contractor so that they fully understand the importance of leaving the wells undisturbed until they are properly decommissioned. Decommissioning of wells for design build projects shall be done in accordance with the requirements in Section 2.6 of the RFP (see Design Build Manual). All wells installed as part of the development of the Geotechnical Data Report for the project should be decommissioned prior to contract advertisement.
610.04(6) Overview of Geotechnical Design Objectives for the Various Project Stages Geotechnical design objectives for the various design phases are described in the Geotechnical Design Manual.
610.04(7) Earthwork 610.04(7)(a) Project Definition The designer contacts and meets with the RME (and the HQ Geotechnical Office as needed) at the project site to conduct a field review to help identify the geotechnical issues for the project. In general, if soil/rock conditions are poor and/or large cuts or fills are anticipated, the RME requests that the HQ Geotechnical Office participate in the field review and reporting efforts. The designer provides a description and location of the proposed earthwork to the RME as follows:
