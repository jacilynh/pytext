equire mulch and may lead to shadow areas (areas where the mulch application is blocked and soil is not covered). Shadow areas are a common problem for WSDOT projects because mulch is generally only able to be sprayed from the roadway (from above or below area to be mulched) rather than from multiple directions (from above and below area to be mulched). To minimize shadow areas, the installer should spray the mulch from multiple angles or in multiple passes. Full coverage (no visible soil) is necessary to ensure the product doesn’t fail as a temporary stabilization method.

Interceptor Dikes and Swales
No Standard Specification or Standard Plan
SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C200 Interceptor Dike and Swale
Function
Use interceptor dikes and swales to intercept runoff and/or groundwater from drainage areas on slopes and direct it to a stabilized outlet.
Additional Information
Use the dike and/or swale to intercept the runoff from unprotected areas and direct it to areas where erosion can be controlled. This can prevent runoff from entering the work area or sediment-laden runoff from leaving the construction site. 

Note that, when placed horizontally across a disturbed slope, the dike and swale reduces the amount and velocity of runoff flowing down the slope. 
Stabilization of the dike and swale with temporary or permanent vegetation depends on soil characteristics and gradient. You may not need to apply a higher level of protection to low-gradient highly porous soils, because much of the water infiltrates the ground, reducing erosion potential. 
Use swale protection, check dams, or level spreaders on steeper grades. 
Provide energy dissipation measures at the swale outlet. 
Release sediment-laden runoff to a sediment-trapping facility. 

Function
Mulching is organic material used to protect bare soil from raindrop erosion. Mulch also enhances seed germination and plant establishment by conserving moisture; holding fertilizer, seed, and topsoil in place; and moderating soil temperatures.
Additional Information
Table 5-4 provides additional information on some types of mulch material.
Design, Installation and Maintenance
Mulch covering must be maintained when erosion becomes evident. Reapplication of mulch to cover soils that have been eroded due to concentrated flows will not prevent reoccurrence of erosion – employ BMPs that prevent concentrated flows from developing of eroding mulched areas.

Remarks
Hand-spread straw generally requires greater thickness than blown straw. Handspread straw is less likely to be displaced by wind or runoff because of its weight and length. Blown straw should be held in place with a netting or tackifier to prevent displacement of mulch by wind and rain. Straw often introduces weed species. Certified Weed-Free Straw is required by 9-14.4(1). It should also not be used within the ordinary high-water elevation or in areas with concentrated flow (due to flotation). Straw mulch needs to be maintained often to be an effective soil cover and it may need to be removed for soil compaction purposes.
See BMP 5-1.1.19
A “compost blanket” is often used to protect soils at final grades until permanent vegetation is planted because it can be directly seeded or tilled into soil as an amendment. Compost applied too thickly (over 3") on slopes may slide down as it becomes heavy when it absorbs water. If slopes are composted, it is best to till in the first lift or roughen the soil surface by cat-tracking or other means.
Compost should not be applied in areas where water will sit for long periods of time because it will create a compost leachate that can elevate turbidity readings and nutrient levels in runoff. Do not use composted mulch near wetlands or nutrient-impaired waters. Must be produced per Chapter 173-350 WAC, Solid
Waste Handling Standards, but may have up to 35% biosolids if not applied on stormwater BMPs.
A cost-effective way to dispose of debris from clearing and grubbing. If seeding is expected shortly after mulch, the decomposition of the chipped vegetation can create a nitrogen deficiency in the soil, making it difficult for grass to grow. It can be used where woody native vegetation will be planted. It is not recommended within 200 feet of surface waters. Wood chip mulch is also a suitable material for stabilizing entrances and haul roads that are not heavily used by construction vehicles. Special attention is needed to ensure invasive species are not being spread through this method.
May be a suitable material for stabilizing entrances and haul roads that are not heavily used by construction vehicles. Wood material may need to be removed for compaction purposes and the structural integrity of roadways. The use of wood chip mulch ultimately improves the organic matter in the soil. However, if seeding is immediately expected, the decomposition of bark or wood chips can create a nitrogen deficiency, making it difficult for grass to grow. Wood chips can be used where native woody vegetation will be planted. Special attention is needed to ensure invasive species are not being spread through this method.

Outlet Protection
Standard Specification 8-01.3(11) – Outlet Protection
SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C209 Outlet Protection
Function
Outlet protection prevents scour at temporary outlets and minimizes the potential for downstream erosion by reducing the velocity of concentrated flow.
Additional Information
Outlet protection is required at the outlets of all ponds, pipes, ditches or other conveyances, and where runoff is conveyed to a natural or manmade drainage feature such as a stream, wetland, lake or ditch. WSDOT incorporates permanent outfall protection into the design process for permanent BMPs and stormwater conveyance facilities. This BMP is only intended to address temporary outlet protection needs during construction (e.g., outlets from temporary pipe slope drains, temporary channels). 
Common locations for outlet protection include discharge points for ponds, pipes, ditches, or spillways with erosive concentrated flow.

Design, Installation and Maintenance
Page 5-38 
Size the scale of the outlet protection based on expected flow volumes and velocities. Refer to the Hydraulics Manual for guidance in choosing appropriately-sized rock outlet protection or alternative materials. 
Outlet structures designed for permanent facilities may not be installed yet, or if installed, may not provide adequate holding time to treat construction stormwater. The outlet structure may need to be adapted during construction to provide adequate holding time allowing sediment to settle. 

Pipe Slope Drains
Standard Specification 8-01.3(14) – Temporary Pipe Slope Drain

SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C204 Pipe Slope Drains
Function
Pipe slope drains are used to collect runoff and route concentrated flow down a slope or structure without causing erosion or to minimize saturation of slide-prone soils. Also used to collect and route different sources of water.
Additional Information
Pipe slope drains are often used at bridge ends to collect runoff and pipe it to the base of the fill slopes along bridge approaches. Another use is to collect runoff from pavement and pipe it away from side slopes. This is useful because there is often a time lag between installation of the first lift of asphalt and installation of curbs, gutters, and permanent drainage. Water can be collected and channeled to pipe slope drain inlets with sand bags, triangular silt dikes, berms, or other material. 
Use pipe slope drains when a temporary or permanent stormwater conveyance is needed to move the water down a slope to prevent erosion. 
Use pipe slope drains at bridge ends to collect runoff and pipe it to the base of the fill slopes along bridge approaches. You can design these into a project and include them as bid items. 
Use on road projects to collect runoff from pavement and pipe it away from side slopes. 
Use temporary drains on new slopes.
Design, Installation and Maintenance
Temporary pipe slope drains should be sized to handle expected flows: 

Eastern Washington should be designed to handle the 6-month, 3-hour peak flow rate using a single-event model. The designer should consult the Region
Hydraulics staff to determine whether a higher level of protection is needed beyond the 6-month, 3-hour storm due to the time of year for construction (freezing conditions and snowmelt), the downstream conditions, or the expectation that the project will last several construction seasons.

If flow is exclusively surface water, use the design criteria contained in HRM
Section 4-3.3 for western Washington or Section 4-4.3 for eastern
Washington.


If flow is from seeps or groundwater, use best professional judgment in consultation with the Region Materials Engineer (RME) when sizing slope drains.
Collect water and channel it to pipe slope drain inlets with sand bags, triangular silt dikes, berms, or other material.
Compact the soil around and under the pipe and entrance section to prevent undercutting.
Securely connect prefabricated flared inlet sections to the slope drain pipe.
Securely fasten multiple slope drain sections together, or use gasketed watertight fittings.
If 90° bends cannot be avoided in the drain pipe, install thrust blocks constructed from sandbags, “t” posts and wire, or ecology blocks to anchor the bends. For pipe slope drains that are to remain as permanent features, ensure the thrust block materials are capable of lasting for the expected life of the pipe.
Secure pipe along its full length to prevent movement (this can be done with steel “t” posts and wire). Install posts on each side of the pipe and wire the pipe to them. Do this approximately every 10–20 feet of pipe length, depending on the size of the pipe and quantity of water to be diverted.
Use pipe slope drains to convey water collected by interceptor dikes. Ensure the height of the dike is at least 1 foot higher at all points than the top of the inlet pipe.
Stabilize the area at the outlet with an energy-dissipating material (such as riprap).


If the pipe slope drain is conveying sediment-laden water, direct all flows into a sediment-trapping facility.
Inspect inlet area of pipe slope drain regularly to ensure continued function of collection point strategy. Inspect outlet area of pipe slope drain to ensure erosion is not being created. Maintain and adapt pipe slope drain as needed to ensure continued function.

Plastic Covering
Standard Specifications 8-01.3(5) – Placing Plastic Covering 9-14.5(3) – Clear Plastic Covering
SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C 123 Plastic Covering
Function
Plastic provides immediate soil coverage and prevents soil saturation.
Additional Information
The primary uses for plastic are: 

Coverage of temporary grade cut/fill slopes and stockpiles. 
Temporary coverage of active work areas. 
Protection of areas vulnerable to saturation. 
Temporary liner for concrete washout areas or secondary containment.
Plastic prevents infiltration, which means 100% of rainfall is transferred to somewhere else. Preventing infiltration and soil saturation may be the goal in some cases; however, you must plan for the large volumes and velocities of clean water coming off the plastic. Unmanaged runoff from plastic covering can quickly create erosion issues. Make a plan for managing the water coming off the plastic.
Design, Installation and Maintenance
Key factors to remember when installing plastic: 
Plastic will increase flow velocity, so use soil stabilization and energy dissipation BMPs to minimize the erosive energy of flows coming off sloped areas of plastic (e.g., toe of slope). 
When feasible, prevent the clean runoff from plastic from hitting bare soil.
Direct flows from plastic to stabilized outlet areas.


Anchor plastic at the top of the slope and along seams to prevent water from going under the plastic. Place upslope sheets over downslope sheets like shingles on a roof.
Secure overlapping edges and terminal ends. Plastic can easily be blown off in wind and become a safety hazard for the traveling public.

Chapter 5

Additional Information
Managing a large construction project with multiple contractors is a major coordination challenge. Weekly meetings, progress reports and schedules, or other methods of consistent communication are vital. Developing and following a specified work schedule that coordinates the timing of land-disturbing activity with the installation of appropriate BMPs requires effective communication between environmental site inspectors, CESCLs, contractors, subcontractors, and the Project Engineer.
Construction practices that limit or phase land-clearing activity and provide timely installation of erosion and sediment control BMPs can significantly reduce potential environmental impacts. Sediment control (treatment) BMPs must be installed to protect potential discharge points prior to land-disturbing activity in an area.
Whenever feasible: 5-1.1.30 

TESC Best Management Practices
Additional Information 
Intended for use on sites where the tributary drainage area is less than
3 acres, with no unusual drainage features and with a projected buildout time of 6 months or less. If the tributary drainage area is more than 3 acres, use a temporary sediment pond. 
Trap efficiency is enhanced when runoff is passed through multiple sediment control BMPs.


Sediment traps are limited to removing silt/larger-sized sediment particles.
Trap effectiveness increases with trap size.
Design, Installation and Maintenance 1. Sizing Procedure
To determine the sediment trap geometry, first calculate the design surface area (SA) of the trap, measured at the invert of the weir. Use the following equation:
SA = FS(Q/Vs) where: Q = Design inflow based on criteria below.
Vs = The settling velocity of the soil particle of interest. The 0.02 mm (medium silt) particle with an assumed density of 2.65 g/cm3 has been selected as the particle of interest and has a settling velocity (Vs) of 0.00096 ft/sec.
FS = A safety factor of 2 to account for non-ideal settling.
Therefore, the equation for computing surface area becomes:
SA = 2 x Q/0.00096 or 2,080 square feet per cfs of inflow

Note: Even if permanent facilities are used, they must still have a surface area that is at least as large as that derived from the above formula. If they do not, the pond must be enlarged.

Design Q for sizing: 
Eastern Washington should be designed to handle the 2-year peak flow rate from the appropriate long duration storm event using a single event model. See HRM Appendix 4C to determine the Climatic
Region and appropriate long duration storm event for the project.
The designer should consult with Region Hydraulics staff to determine whether a higher level of protection is needed beyond the 2-year peak flow due to the time of year for construction (freezing conditions and snowmelt), the downstream conditions, or the expectation that the project will last several construction seasons. 
Western Washington should be designed to handle peak flows generated by the 2-year storm event using 15-minute time steps predicted by MGSFlood for the developed site condition without flow control. The designer should consult Region Hydraulics staff to determine if downstream conditions warrant a higher level of protection. The 10-year peak flow using 15-minute time steps should be used if the project is expected to last several construction seasons. 
Note that sediment traps may not be feasible on utility projects due to the limited work space or the short-term nature of the work. Use portable tanks in place of sediment traps for utility projects.


Remove sediment from the trap when it reaches 1 foot in depth.
Repair any damage to the pond embankments or slopes.
Sedimentation Bags
No Standard Specification or Standard Plan
No SWMM Volume II equivalent
Function
Sedimentation bags are considered pre-treatment BMPs because they work to remove coarse sediment from turbid water before it receives additional treatment.
Additional Information
Sedimentation or filtration dewatering bags are a pretreatment BMP, meaning the water that filters through the bag must receive additional treatment prior to discharging to surface waters.
Base the selection of the bag product on pump flow rate, the amount and type of suspended sediment in the water, and permittivity of the bag. As the bag fills with sediment, take measures to prevent bag failure or bursting (e.g., reduce pump flow

TESC Best Management Practices rate, maintain or replace bag). Stabilize uncontaminated dewatered sediment from the bag in a controlled upland location away from drainages. 
Products should be made from nonwoven, needle-punched polypropylene geotextile.
Design, Installation and Maintenance
Filter bags require the following: 5-1.1.32 
Place at least 50 feet away from potential discharge locations. 
Never place on slopes or on surfaces that may puncture the bag. 
Filtered water from the bag must not cause onsite erosion. 
Water that filters through the bag must receive additional sediment control treatment (e.g., vegetative dispersion) prior to discharging to surface waters.


Install and maintain in accordance with manufacturers’ instructions, including recommended pump flow rates, sediment loading rates, and hose connections.
Silt Fence

I-30.15 – Silt Fence
I-30.20 – Erosion Control at Culvert Ends
I-40.10 – Temporary Silt Fence for Inlet Protection in Unpaved Areas
SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C233 Silt Fence
Function
Silt fences reduce the transport of coarse sediment from a construction site by providing a geotextile barrier that reduces velocities of sheet flow or shallow overland flow.

WSDOT Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Manual M 3109.02
Page 5-47 TESC Best Management Practices
Chapter 5
Additional Information
Silt fence can create serious erosion problems quickly if not properly installed.
Though sometimes referred to as “filter fence”, silt fence is not intended to provide an ongoing filtering function. The geotextile fabric quickly becomes clogged with sediment creating a dam like BMP in which sediment can drop out of the standing water behind the silt fence. 
Place fence below disturbed areas subject to shallow overland flow (sheet erosion) as a sediment control BMP. 
Never install silt fence in streams or in areas with concentrated flows.
Design, Installation and Maintenance 5-1.1.33 
Place fence on contour to maximize sediment-trapping performance and prevent concentrated flows and scouring from developing along fence.


Silt fence must be trenched in accordance with the Standard Plan to be considered effective sediment control. If trenching is infeasible due to rocky soil consider using a compost sock as sediment control because they do not need to be trenched in.
Do not install silt fence in areas that receive concentrated flows (over 0.5 cfs). Concentrated flows will overtop silt fence or collapse it altogether.
Monitor for signs of erosion, flows bypassing treatment and sediment buildup. Adapt or maintain the silt fence as needed to ensure continued functional performance.
Sodding
Standard Specification 9-14.6(8) – Sod
SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C124 Sodding
Function
Sodding is used to establish permanent turf for immediate erosion protection or to stabilize areas where concentrated flow will occur (roots must be attached to underlying soil before erosion can be prevented in areas with concentrated flows).
Page 5-48

WSDOT Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Manual M 3109.02 Chapter 5
TESC Best Management Practices
Additional Information 
Place sod on soil areas where roots can penetrate and keep the sod healthy.
Any sod that either does not attach to the soil or dies must be removed, because water can flow under the dead sod mats and create unseen erosion issues. 
Note that sod provides instant soil coverage, and permanent stabilization should be achieved if the roots successfully attach to the soil. 
In swales, place sod strips perpendicular to the flow of water to increase the ability to resist shear stress. 
Stagger sod strips to produce a more stable soil cover.
Design, Installation and Maintenance 5-1.1.34 
Ongoing care such as irrigation may be required to ensure sod establishment.


Inspect regularly to ensure sod remains healthy and erosion does not develop.
If the sod is unhealthy, the cause shall be determined and appropriate action taken to reestablish a healthy groundcover.
Stabilized Construction Entrances
Standard Specification 8-01.3(7) – Stabilized Construction Entrance
Standard Plan
I-80.10 – Miscellaneous Erosion Control Details
SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C105 Stabilized Construction Entrance/Exit
Function
Stabilized construction entrances are used to stabilize entrance and exit areas to reduce the amount of sediment track-out onto roadways that may generate a turbid discharge.

WSDOT Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Manual M 3109.02
Page 5-49 TESC Best Management Practices
Chapter 5
Additional Information 
Paved areas and steel rumble plates can be used in conjunction with this
BMP. Care must be used when placing rumble plates because they are impervious and fill with sediment (i.e., can create a turbid discharge if placed adjacent to drainage areas). 
Manage construction traffic with signage or fencing to minimize track-out locations and unintended exit points (e.g., restrict use of access points for exit or entrance only). 
Limit planned access points. 
Include extra materials in the contract for large projects or projects with a lot of grading and hauling activity to maintain the entrance/exit areas. 
Source control (preventing track-out) is the goal, because relying on street sweeping is not a substitute for a stabilized construction entrance. If sediment is tracked offsite, street sweeping is required at a minimum at the end of each day, and more frequently if necessary to prevent turbid discharges. However, most street sweeping equipment does not remove fine sediments from the roadway; therefore, a rain event can still cause a turbid discharge. High-efficiency sweepers remove sediment track-out and prevent fugitive dust more effectively than standard broom sweepers. High-efficiency sweepers use water and brooms to clean the roadway, vacuums to remove the sediment and wash water, and a filter to minimize fugitive dust. Verify the performance of contractor equipment during construction to ensure effective sediment removal and containment.


Street washing may only be used after sweeping to remove the fine sediments. Street wash wastewater cannot be discharged to surface waters of the state.
Design, Installation and Maintenance
Page 5-50
Where possible, stabilized entrances should be constructed on a firm compacted subgrade.
Inspect all exit points regularly to ensure sediment track-out is being prevented.
If a stabilized construction entrance/exit fails to prevent sediment track-out or transport, the stabilization methods must be maintained or enhanced (e.g., rock cleaned or added, stabilized entrance lengthened).
If sediment is tracked offsite, effective street sweeping must occur at the end of each day, or more frequently as needed (e.g., during wet weather) to prevent a turbid discharge.
A tire wash facility may be required if BMPs are not preventing sediment track-out.

Storm Drain Inlet Protection
Standard Specification 8-01.3(9)D – Inlet Protection (below inlet grate, above inlet grate, and inlet grate cover)
Standard Plans
I-30.40 – Compost Sock
I-40.10 – Temporary Silt Fence for Inlet Protection in Unpaved Areas
I-40.20 – Storm Drain Inlet Protection
SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C220 Storm Drain Inlet Protection
Function
Storm drain inlet protection is used to prevent coarse sediment from entering an operational drainage system. Inlet protection is often the last opportunity to treat runoff prior to a discharge.
Additional Information
Tucking geotextile fabric under or over storm drains is not an acceptable practice.
Inlet protection BMPs must meet materials requirements to ensure no sediment or geotextile fabric is lost down the catch basin during maintenance or removal of the inlet protection device.
Inlet filter socks clog quickly and water simply bypasses the filter area and overflows without treatment. If the inlet filter sock appears clogged or the water is discharging through the overflow bypass as shown in Standard Plan I-40.20, replace or maintain the inlet device.
Inlet protection devices vary widely in their ability to capture sediment. In general, these devices clog quickly and do not provide a high level of treatment. They should not be relied on to clean up dirty water. Other BMPs must be used to minimize the turbidity of water going to inlets. 

There is a difference in how internal and external inlet protection devices function.
WSDOT Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Manual M 3109.02
Page 5-51 TESC Best Management Practices
Chapter 5 
Internal devices tend to consist of a nonwoven material that is semiporous.
Larger sediments are trapped, but silt and clay-sized particles pass through.
They are most appropriate in situations where roadway flooding is a concern or construction traffic will damage an external device. Filtering devices, sometimes called “witches hats” clog quickly and need to be replaced often. 
External devices may be prefabricated or assembled in the field using silt fence. Both types trap sediment by creating a ponding area surrounding the inlet. The reduced velocities allow sediment to settle. This process allows external devices to be more efficient at trapping greater volumes of smallersized sediment. 
In an emergency, berms of sand bags or washed gravel can be placed around the inlet.
Design, Installation and Maintenance 

5-1.1.36
Inspect devices regularly to ensure continued function. Devices full of sediment or other debris that impairs filtering ability must be cleaned or replaced to ensure water doesn’t bypass treatment.
Straw Wattles
Standard Specifications 8-01.3(10) – Wattles 9-14.5(5) – Wattles
Standard Plan
I-30.30 – Wattle Installation on Slope
SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C235 Wattles
Function
The two main purposes of wattles are to reduce flow velocity and to trap sediment.
Additional Information
Wattles are used to break up the continuous length of a slope and to prevent concentrated flows from developing. They are also used as a sediment control device. Wattles, including netting, must be made of natural plant fibers unaltered by synthetic materials, such as plastic.

Page 5-52
WSDOT Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Manual M 3109.02 Chapter 5
TESC Best Management Practices 
Trench in straw wattles to prevent flows from going under them. The lightweight springy nature of the straw material makes the staking and trenching installation absolutely necessary for performance. 
Install wattles perpendicular to flows and parallel to slope contours. 
Do not use straw wattles as check dams because straw wattles are designed to be trenched in to prevent flows from going under them. However, it is not a good idea to trench anything into a conveyance area because those areas will become vulnerable to erosion from the concentrated flows.
Design, Installation and Maintenance  5-1.1.37
Inspect regularly to ensure continued performance. If flows are going under, over or around wattles, adapt the installation to ensure functional performance.
Subsurface Drains
No Standard Specification or Standard Plan
SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C205 Subsurface Drains

Function
Subsurface drains intercept, collect and convey water to a desired location.
Additional Information
Subsurface drains, also known as french drains, provide a mechanism for dewatering excessively wet soils, provide a stable base for construction, improve stability of structures with shallow foundations, or reduce hydrostatic pressure. Subsurface drains can also be used to collect and convey stormwater runoff. Common types of subsurface drains include relief or interceptor drains used to temporarily intercept and collect runoff or excessive groundwater and convey it in an underground conduit to a stabilized outlet, infiltration area, collection area, or an area where additional treatment will occur. 
Determine the capacity of underground drainage systems by calculating the maximum rate of groundwater or overland flow to be intercepted. Ensure the drainage system has an adequate capacity and a stabilized outlet (e.g., by gravity or pumping) to manage flows.

Chapter 5
Design, Installation and Maintenance 5-1.1.38 
The trench shall be constructed on a continuous grade with no reverse grades or low spots.


Soft or yielding soils under the drain shall be stabilized with gravel or other suitable material.
Monitor and maintain collection points and outlet areas to ensure the drainage system is functioning as intended. Ensure the discharges from drainage systems do not cause polluted discharges, erosion, or a danger to the public.
Surface Roughening
Standard Specification 8-02.3(5) – Roadside Seeding, Lawn and Planting Preparation
SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C130 Surface Roughening
Function
Surface roughening adds texture to the soil surface that will aid in the establishment of vegetation, reduce runoff velocity, encourage infiltration, and may trap sediment.
Additional Information
Roughening methods include stairstep grading, grooving, contour furrows, and track walking. Factors to be considered in choosing a method are slope steepness, mowing requirements, and whether the slope is formed by cutting or filling. Surface roughening should be used in conjunction with other practices such as seeding, composting, mulching, planting or sodding.

Page 5-54 
Select the surface roughening method based on site specific factors such as slope gradient, soil type and future mowing requirements. 
Stairstep grading is particularly appropriate in soils containing large amounts of soft rock. Each step catches material that sloughs from above and provides a level site where vegetation can become established. Stairs should be wide enough to work with standard earth-moving equipment. 
All areas to be seeded shall be prepared for seeding to provide a firm but friable seedbed.
WSDOT Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Manual M 3109.02 Chapter 5
TESC Best Management Practices
Design, Installation and Maintenance 5-1.1.39 
Track walking texture must be parallel to slope contour. 
Additional soil covering BMPs should occur as quickly as possible after surface preparation. Inspect the area regularly for signs of erosion and seed loss. If rill erosion develops, the area should be regraded and reseeded as soon as possible.
Tackifiers and Polyacrylamide

Standard Specifications 8-01.3(2)E – Tackifier 9-14.5(1) – Polyacrylamide
SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C126 Polyacrylamide for Soil Erosion Protection
Function
Tacking agents such as Polyacrylamide (PAM) are used to hold soil, seed and/ or mulch in place and may provide other benefits. PAM is a synthetic polymer used in temporary erosion and sediment control applications for several reasons: 
Binds soil particles (encouraging sediment to gravity settle if suspended) 
Increases soil porosity (improves infiltration rates) 
Reduces soil compaction, dust, and water runoff
Conditions of Use
Never apply PAM directly to water without prior approval from Ecology (considered chemical treatment). You may apply PAM to soil without prior approval from
Ecology in accordance with these guidelines. The use of PAM may be restricted in a
401 Water Quality Certification.
PAM products must meet the ANSI/NSF Standard 60 for drinking water treatment and be anionic and linear (non-cross-linked). Never use cationic PAM, because it is known to cause aquatic toxicity. Approved PAM products are listed on the
Qualified Product List in accordance with Standard Specification 9-14.5(1).

WSDOT Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Manual M 3109.02
Page 5-55 TESC Best Management Practices
Chapter 5
Design, Installation and Maintenance
Page 5-56 
Measure the area where PAM is to be applied and calculate the amount of product and mixing water necessary to provide coverage at the specified application rate. Always add PAM to the mixing water; never add mixing water to PAM. Use mechanical mixing to help the PAM dissolve completely. 
PAM works best when applied to dry soil, so apply PAM to bare soil in accordance with Standard Specification 8-01.3(2)E. 
Ensure runoff from PAM-treated areas passes through sediment control devices that provide adequate opportunity for PAM-treated sediments to drop out before water discharges to surface waters: 
If less than 5 acres of soil are treated with PAM, all runoff from treated areas must drain to sediment control BMP(s) that will allow enough time for sediment to settle out. For example, three check dams per acre treated, prior to discharge. 
If 5 acres or more of soil have been treated with PAM, all of the runoff from the treated area must drain to a pond prior to discharge.


Use PAM in conjunction with, not as a replacement for, other BMPs. It also works well when used in conjunction with mulches.
Do not apply PAM to areas that flow directly into a surface water, including wetlands.
For small areas that need coverage, apply PAM at the dry application rate using a hand-held seed spreader.
Note that, depending on site conditions, PAM remains in the soil
3 to 6 months from the date of application. Extreme weather and heavy traffic (if used on haul roads) shorten the lifespan. These conditions require more frequent re-application.
Reapply PAM, if necessary, on actively worked areas after a 48-hour period.
PAM breaks down and loses its effectiveness when exposed to climatic conditions such as high or low temperatures and sunlight. Store PAM in an airtight container in secondary containment and out of the sun.

Temporary and Permanent Seeding
Standard Specifications 8-01.3 – Temporary Seeding and Mulching (Temporary) 8-02.3 – Seeding, Fertilizing, and Mulching (Permanent) 9-14.2 – Seed
SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C120 Temporary and Permanent Seeding
Function
A well-established vegetative cover is one of the most effective methods of erosion and sediment control. Vegetation protects bare soil from raindrop impact, binds the soil with roots, encourages infiltration, and slows and filters sheet flows. Temporary seeding can be used in areas where permanent cover is not necessary (such as stockpiles or over-wintering of incomplete grades).
Additional Information
Seed laying on soil is not a stabilizing cover. A healthy stand of vegetation must be established before soil is considered covered and stabilized (green should dominate brown, approximately 70% coverage in western Washington and 50% in eastern
Washington). Mulch should be used with seeding to achieve immediate soil coverage and temporary stabilization until the vegetation can establish. Getting vegetation established can be difficult if site soils are of poor quality or weather conditions are not conducive to seed germination.
Additional methods such as soil amendments and/or irrigation may be used to improve conditions. Related specifications for seeding include: 
Prepare soil surfaces prior to seeding in accordance with Standard
Specification 8-02.3(5)


Use soil binders and tacking agents in accordance with Standard Specification 8-01.3(2).
Perform seeding and fertilizing in accordance with Standard Specification 801.3(2)B (for temporary seeding) and 8-02.3(5) (for permanent seeding)
Unless otherwise approved, place seeding during the seeding windows in
Standard. Seeding outside of the seeding window will likely require additional care through the seed germination phase, such as cover in the cold season or irrigation in the dry season.
Protect, care, inspect, and mow seeded areas in accordance with Standard.

Temporary Curbs
Standard Specification 8-01.3(13) – Temporary Curb
SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C203 Water Bars
Function
A small ridge of material, sometimes in conjunction with an upstream depression, used to disperse or direct stormwater runoff.
Additional Information
Temporary curbs or water bars used along the edge of a roadway must not create ponding or a potential danger to the traveling public. As with other BMPs, temporary curbs can create more problems than they solve if they are installed without considering the high flow scenarios. Do not install temporary curbs in a way that will create concentrated flow. Ensure curbs direct flows to a stabilized area capable of dealing with the expected flow rates.
Common uses for temporary curbs and water bars include:

Page 5-58 
Top of slope areas to prevent overland flows from hitting vulnerable slope. 
Edge of pavement or edge of right of way to prevent offsite water from entering construction site. 
Around inlets to prevent discharges. 
To divert overland flows to vegetated or otherwise stabilized area.

Temporary or Mobile Containment

No Standard Specification or Standard Plan
No SWMM Volume II equivalent
Function
Temporary or mobile containment provides supplemental containment of stormwater or construction waste materials, spoils, or wastewater. This BMP can be used as containment or as part of a treatment strategy.
Additional Information
Large tanks can be delivered to a construction site and moved around within a site as needed to contain stormwater or wastewater. Tanks are often used as part of a treatment system or as temporary storage for wastewaters or contaminated soils.

SWMM Volume II equivalent: BMP C241 Temporary Sediment Pond
Collect stormwater runoff and detain it long enough to trap sediment.
They are typically used for tributary drainage areas that are greater than or equal to
3 acres. Bioretention areas should not be used for temporary sediment ponds. If these areas will be used for sediment ponds, they must be rehabilitated before placement of the final bioretention soils to restore infiltration rates. Contact the HQ
Hydraulics Office for guidance.

Page 5-59 TESC Best Management Practices
Chapter 5 
The use of a permanent infiltration facility as a temporary sediment pond may clog the soils and reduce the long term infiltration capacity. The project must restore the infiltration capacity to those specified in the permanent infiltration facility design per the project’s hydraulics report. 
Use sediment traps as pretreatment devices to minimize the need for pond maintenance and prevent soil clogging. If pretreatment is not possible, install a permeable rock divider within the pond.


Design pond outlets to provide flow control. Design outlets in accordance with Figure 5-3 and the dewatering orifice design guidance. Contact the
Region Hydraulics Office if site conditions warrant any modification of the figures.
Structures having a maximum storage capacity at the top of the dam of 10 acre-ft (435,600 ft3) or more are subject to the Washington Dam Safety
Regulations (Chapter 173-175 WAC).
If a permanent detention pond is a part of the project, consider using it as a temporary sediment pond during construction, if possible. You must meet the surface area and minimum depth requirements of the temporary sediment pond design. This may require enlarging the permanent detention pond to comply with the surface area requirements and minimum depth requirements. If a permanent control structure is used, it may be advisable to partially restrict the lower orifice with gravel to increase residence time while still allowing dewatering of the temporary sediment pond. 1. Sizing Procedure
Determine the surface area (SA) of the sediment pond at the top of the riser pipe. Use the equation:
SA = 2 x Q/0.00096 or 2,080 square feet per cfs of inflow
For more information on the derivation of the surface area calculation, see Section 5-1.1.31. Design inflow (Q) based on criteria below. 
Page 5-60

Eastern Washington should be designed to handle the 2-year peak flow rate from the appropriate long duration storm event using a single event model. See HRM Appendix 4C to determine the Climatic Region and appropriate long duration storm event for the project. The designer should consult with Region
Hydraulics staff to determine whether a higher level of protection is needed beyond the 2-year peak flow due to the time of year for construction (freezing conditions and
WSDOT Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Manual M 3109.02 Chapter 5
TESC Best Management Practices snowmelt), the downstream conditions, or the expectation that the project will last several construction seasons.   
Western Washington should be designed to handle peak flows generated by the 2-year storm event using 15-minute time steps predicted by MGSFlood for the developed site condition without flow control. The designer should consult Region Hydraulics staff to determine if downstream conditions warrant a higher level of protection. The 10-year peak flow using 15-minute time steps should be used if the project is expected to last several construction seasons.
Determine the basic geometry of the pond using the following design criteria: 
Minimum 3.5-foot depth from top of riser to bottom of pond. 
Maximum 3H:1V interior side slopes and maximum 2H:1V exterior slopes. The interior slopes can be increased to a maximum of 2H:1V if fencing is provided at or above the maximum water surface. 
One foot of freeboard between the top of the riser and the crest of the emergency spillway. 
Flat bottom.


Minimum 1-foot-deep spillway.
Length-to-width ratio between 3:1 and 6:1.
Sizing of Discharge Mechanisms:
The outlet for the temporary sediment pond consists of a combination of principal and emergency spillways. These outlets must pass the peak runoff expected from the contributing drainage area for a 100-year storm. If, due to site conditions and pond geometry, a separate emergency spillway is not feasible, the principal spillway must pass the entire peak runoff expected from the 100-year storm. However, an attempt to provide a separate emergency spillway should always be made. The runoff calculations should be based on the site conditions during construction. The flow through the dewatering orifice cannot be utilized when calculating the 100year storm elevation because of its potential to become clogged; therefore, available spillway storage must begin at the principal spillway riser crest.
The principal spillway should result in some reduction in the peak rate of runoff.
