 the widening, relative to the current facility, are provided. For realignments, the approximate new location proposed for the facility is provided. Locations in terms of length can be by milepost or stations.
A brief conceptual-level report that summarizes the results of the investigation is provided to the designer.

Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
610.04(7)(b) Project Design Geotechnical data necessary to allow completion of the PS&E-level design is compiled during the design phase. This includes soil borings, testing, and geotechnical design based on final geometric data. Detailed design of cut and fill slopes can be done once the roadway geometry is established and geotechnical data are available. The purpose of this design effort is to determine the maximum stable cut or fill slope and, for fills, the potential for short- and long-term settlement. Also, the usability of the cut materials and the type of borrow needed for the project (if any) are evaluated. Evaluate the use of soil bioengineering as an option for building steeper slopes or to prevent surface erosion. (See Roadside Manual Chapter 740, Soil Bioengineering, for more information.) The designer requests a geotechnical report from the RME. The site data given in Section 610.04(4), as applicable, is provided. It is important that the request for the geotechnical report be made as early as possible in the design phase. Cost and schedule requirements to generate the report are project-specific and can vary widely. The time required to obtain permits and rights of entry must be considered when establishing schedule requirements. The Geotechnical Design Manual, Chapter 24, summarizes the type of information and recommendations that are typically included in the geotechnical report for earthwork. The recommendations should include the background regarding analysis approach and any agreements with the region or other customers regarding the definition of acceptable level of risk. The region Project Office uses the report to finalize design decisions for the project. To meet slope stability requirements, additional right of way might be required or a wall might be needed. Wall design is covered in Chapter 730. Construction timing might require importing material rather than using cut materials. The report is used to address this and other constructability issues. The report is also used to proceed with completion of the PS&E.
610.04(7)(c) PS&E Development Adequate geotechnical design information to complete the PS&E is typically received during the design phase. Additional geotechnical work might be needed when right of way cannot be acquired, restrictions are included in permits, or other requirements are added that result in changes to the design. Special provisions and plan details, if not received as part of the report provided during design, are developed with the assistance of the RME or the HQ Geotechnical Office. The designer uses this information, as well as the design phase report, to complete the PS&E documents. Both the region Materials Laboratory and the HQ Geotechnical Office can review (if requested) the contract plans before the PS&E review process begins. Otherwise, they will review the contract plans during the normal PS&E review process.
610.04(8) Hydraulic Structures, Ponds, and Environmental Mitigation 610.04(8)(a) Project Definition The designer provides a description and location of the proposed hydraulic/ environmental improvements and other pertinent site information and discusses the extent of the improvements with both the RME and the HQ Hydraulics Section to identify the geotechnical issues to be investigated. At this stage, only the identification and feasibility of the proposed hydraulic structures or environmental mitigation are investigated. The cost and schedule requirements for the geotechnical investigation are also determined at this time. Examples of hydraulic structures include, but are not limited to, large culverts, pipe arches, underground detention vaults, and fish passage structures. Examples of environmental mitigation include, but are not limited to, detention/retention ponds, wetland creation, and environmental mitigation measures on fill slopes.

Chapter 610
Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
It is especially important to identify the potential to encounter high groundwater at the proposed hydraulic structure or pond location. In general, avoid high groundwater locations (see the Highway Runoff Manual) as groundwater can greatly affect design, constructibility, operations, performance, and maintenance.
610.04(8)(b) Project Design The designer requests a geotechnical report from the RME. The site data given in Section 610.04(4), as applicable, is provided along with the following information:
•
•
Pertinent field observations (such as unstable slopes, existing soft soils or boulders, evidence of high groundwater, or erosion around and damage to existing culverts or other drainage structures). Jurisdictional requirements for geotechnical design of berms/dams.
It is important that the request for the geotechnical report be made as early as possible in the design phase. Cost and schedule requirements to generate the report are project-specific and can vary widely. The time required to obtain permits and rights of entry must be considered when establishing schedule requirements. Furthermore, since the depth to groundwater can be critical to the feasibility of these types of facilities, and since seasonal variation of groundwater is typically important to know, it is essential to have adequate time to determine the effect of seasonal variations on groundwater. The RME, with support from the HQ Geotechnical Office as needed, provides the following information in addition to the overall requirements specified in the Geotechnical Design Manual, when requested and where applicable, as part of the project geotechnical report:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Soil boring logs. Soil pH and resistivity. Water table elevation. Soil infiltration rates (the highest rate for assessing spill containment/aquifer protection and the longterm rate for determining pond capacity). Bearing capacity and settlement for hydraulic structure foundations. Slope stability for ponds. Retention berm/dam design. Potential for and amount of differential settlement along culverts and pipe arches and the estimated time required for settlement to occur. Soil pressures and properties (primarily for underground detention vaults). Erosion potential. Geosynthetic design in accordance with Chapter 630. Recommendations for mitigation of the effects of soft or unstable soil on the hydraulic structures. Recommendations for construction.
Note that retaining walls that are part of a pond, fish passage, and so on, are designed in accordance with Chapter 730 and the Geotechnical Design Manual. The designer uses the geotechnical information to:
•
•
•
Finalize design decisions. Evaluate and mitigate environmental issues. Proceed with completion of the PS&E design. This includes determining the most cost-effective hydraulic structure/pond to meet the desired objectives; locating and sizing ponds and foundations for hydraulic structures; structural design; mitigating the effects of settlement; and satisfying local jurisdictional requirements for design.

610.04(8)(c) PS&E Development During PS&E development, the designer uses the information provided in the geotechnical report to:
•
•
Select pipe materials in accordance with corrosion, resistivity, and abrasion guidelines in the Hydraulics Manual. Consider and include construction recommendations.
Additional design and specification guidance and support from the RME or the HQ Geotechnical Office are sought as needed. Both sections provide careful review of the contract plans before the PS&E review process begins, if requested. Otherwise, they will review the contract plans during the normal PS&E review process.
610.04(9) Signals, Sign Bridges, Cantilever Signs, and Luminaire Foundations 610.04(9)(a) Project Definition and Design Geotechnical information is usually not required for signals, sign bridges, cantilever signs, and luminaires during Project Definition. The region Traffic Design Office contacts the RME for conceptual foundation recommendations. The conceptual recommendations are based on existing information in the area and identify whether Standard Plan foundations are feasible or whether special-design foundations are required. If good soils are anticipated or the foundations will be placed in fill, Standard Plan foundations can be assumed. If special-design foundations are required, additional time and money can be included in the project to accommodate increased field exploration for foundation design, HQ Geotechnical Office involvement, and structural design by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office.
610.04(9)(b) PS&E Development Foundation recommendations are made by either the RME or the HQ Geotechnical Office. The recommendations provide all necessary geotechnical information to complete the PS&E. The region Traffic Design Office (or region Project Engineer in some cases) is responsible for delivering the following project information to the RME:
•
•
Plan sheet showing the location of the structures (station and offset) and the planned structure type. Applicable values for: XYZ coordinates, strain pole class, sign bridge span length, luminaire height, variable message sign weight, wind load, CCTV pole height, and known utility information in the area.
The RME provides the following information to the requester if Standard Plans foundation types can be used:
•
•
•
•
Allowable lateral bearing capacity of the soil Results of all field explorations Groundwater elevation Foundation constructibility
The region uses this information to complete the plan sheets and prepare any special provisions. If utilities are identified during the field investigation that could conflict with the foundations, the region pursues moving or accommodating the utility. Accommodation could require special foundation designs. If special designs are required, the RME notifies the requester that special designs are required and forwards the information received from the region to the HQ Geotechnical Office. The HQ Geotechnical Office provides the HQ Bridge and Structures Office with the necessary geotechnical recommendations to complete the foundation designs. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 610-8
Chapter 610
Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
The region coordinates with the HQ Bridge and Structures Office to ensure they have all the information necessary to complete the design. Depending on the structure type and complexity, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office might produce the plan sheets and special provisions for the foundations, or they might provide the region with information so they can complete the plan sheets and special provisions. Additional guidelines and requirements for design of foundations for these types of structures are contained in the Geotechnical Design Manual.
610.04(10) Buildings, Park & Ride Lots, Communication Towers, and Rest Areas In general, the RME functions as the clearinghouse for the geotechnical work to be conducted in each of the phases, for technical review of the work if it is performed by consultants, or for getting the work done in-house. For sites and designs that are more geotechnically complex, the RME contacts the HQ Geotechnical Office for assistance. (See the Geotechnical Design Manual for geotechnical investigation and design requirements for these types of facilities.)
610.04(10)(a) Site Selection Conceptual geotechnical investigation (based on historical data and minimal subsurface investigation) of several alternative sites is performed in which the geotechnical feasibility of each site for its intended use is evaluated, allowing the sites to be ranked. In this phase, geological hazards (such as landslides, rockfall, compressible soils, and liquefaction) are identified, and geotechnical data adequate to determine a preliminary cost to develop and build on the site is gathered.
610.04(10)(b) Schematic Design For the selected site, the best locations for structures, utilities, and other elements of the project are determined based on site constraints and ground conditions. In this phase, the site is characterized more thoroughly than in the site selection phase, but subsurface exploration is not structure specific.
610.04(10)(c) Design and PS&E Development The final locations of each of the project structures, utilities, and other project elements determined from the schematic design phase are identified. Once these final locations are available, a geotechnical investigation is conducted that is adequate to complete the final design of each of the project elements, such as structure foundations, detention/retention facilities, utilities, parking lots, roadways, and site grading. From this investigation and design, the final PS&E is developed.
610.04(11) Retaining Walls, Reinforced Slopes, and Noise Walls 610.04(11)(a) Project Definition The designer provides the RME with a description and location of the proposed walls or reinforced slopes, including the potential size of the proposed structures and other pertinent site information. At this stage, only the identification and feasibility of the proposed walls or reinforced slopes are investigated. A field review may also be conducted as part of the investigation effort. In general, if soil/rock conditions are poor and/or large walls or reinforced slopes are anticipated, the RME requests that the HQ Geotechnical Office participate in the field review and reporting efforts. The cost and schedule requirements for the geotechnical investigation are also determined at this time. A brief conceptual-level report that summarizes the results of the investigation may be provided to the designer at this time, depending on the complexity of the geotechnical issues.

610.04(11)(b) Project Design and PS&E Development Geotechnical data necessary to allow completion of the PS&E-level design for walls and reinforced slopes are compiled during the design and PS&E development phases. These include soils borings, testing, and final geometric data. Detailed designs of walls and reinforced slopes can be done once the roadway geometry is established and geotechnical data are available. The purpose of this design effort is to determine the wall and slope geometry needed for stability; noise wall and retaining wall foundation requirements; and the potential for short- and long-term settlement. The designer requests a geotechnical report from the RME for retaining walls, noise walls, and reinforced slopes that are not part of the bridge preliminary plan. For walls that are part of the bridge preliminary plan, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office requests the geotechnical report for the walls from the HQ Geotechnical Office. (See Chapter 730 for the detailed design process for retaining walls and reinforced slopes, Chapter 740 for the detailed design process for noise walls, and the Geotechnical Design Manual for design requirements for all walls.) It is important that requests for a geotechnical report be made as early as possible in the design phase. The time required to obtain permits and rights of entry must be considered when establishing schedule requirements. For retaining walls and reinforced slopes, the site data to be provided with the request for a geotechnical report are as given in Chapter 730. Supply right of entry agreements and permits required for the geotechnical investigation. The site data given in Section 610.04(4), as applicable, are provided for noise walls. The RME or the HQ Geotechnical Office provides the information (see Chapter 730 or Chapter 740 for specific responsibilities for design) specified in the Geotechnical Design Manual as part of the project geotechnical report. The recommendations may also include the background regarding the analysis approach and any agreements with the region or other customers regarding the definition of acceptable level of risk. Additional details and design issues to be considered in the geotechnical report are as provided in Chapter 730 for retaining walls and reinforced slopes and in Chapter 740 for noise walls. The designer uses this information for final wall/reinforced slope selection and to complete the PS&E. For final PS&E preparation, special provisions and plan details (if not received as part of the report provided during design) are developed with the assistance of the region Materials Laboratory or the HQ Geotechnical Office. Both the region Materials Laboratory and the HQ Geotechnical Office can review the contract plans before the PS&E review process begins, if requested. Otherwise, they will review the contract plans during the normal PS&E review process.
610.04(12) Unstable Slopes Unstable slope mitigation includes the stabilization of known landslides and rockfall that occur on slopes adjacent to the WSDOT transportation system and that have been programmed under the P3 Unstable Slope Program.
610.04(12)(a) Project Definition The region Project Office provides the RME with a description and location of the proposed unstable slope mitigation work. Location of the proposed work can be milepost limits or stationing. The designer meets at the project site with the RME and HQ Geotechnical Office to conduct a field review, discuss project requirements, and identify geotechnical issues associated with the unstable slope project. The RME requests that the HQ Geotechnical Office participate in the field review and Project Definition reporting.

Page 610-10
Chapter 610
Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
The level of work in the Project Definition phase for unstable slopes is conceptual in nature, not a final design. The geotechnical investigation generally consists of a field review, a more detailed assessment of the unstable slope, review of the conceptual mitigation developed during the programming phase of the project, and proposed modification (if any) to the original conceptual-level unstable slope mitigation. The design phase geotechnical services cost and schedule, including any required permits, are determined at this time. A brief conceptual-level report is provided to the designer that summarizes the results of the Project Definition investigation.
610.04(12)(b) Project Design Geotechnical information and field data necessary to complete the unstable slope mitigation design is compiled during this design phase. This work includes, depending on the nature of the unstable slope problem, test borings, rock structure mapping, geotechnical field instrumentation, laboratory testing, and slope stability analysis. The purpose of this design effort is to provide design-level geotechnical recommendations to stabilize the known unstable slope. The designer requests a geotechnical report from the HQ Geotechnical Office through the RME. The site data given in Section 610.04(4), as applicable, is provided along with the following information:
•
•
A plan sheet showing the station and location of the proposed unstable slope mitigation project. If requested, the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) files necessary to define the on-ground topography of the project site (the limits of the DTM will have been defined during the Project Definition phase).
It is important that the request for the geotechnical report be made as early as possible in the design phase. Cost and schedule requirements to generate the report are project-specific and can vary widely. Unstable slope design investigations might require geotechnical monitoring of ground movement and groundwater over an extended period of time to develop the required field information for the unstable slope mitigation design. The time required to obtain rights of entry and other permits, as well as the long-term monitoring data, must be considered when establishing schedule requirements for the geotechnical report. In addition to the geotechnical report requirements specified in the Geotechnical Design Manual, the HQ Geotechnical Office provides the following information as part of the project geotechnical report (as applicable):
•
•
•
Unstable slope design analysis and mitigation recommendations. Constructibility issues associated with the unstable slope mitigation. Appropriate special provisions for inclusion in the contact plans.
The region Project Office uses the geotechnical report to finalize the design decisions for the project and the completion of the PS&E design.
610.04(12)(c) PS&E Development Adequate geotechnical design information to complete the PS&E is typically obtained during the project design phase. Additional geotechnical work might be needed when right of way cannot be acquired, restrictions are included in permits, or other requirements are added that result in changes to the design. Special provisions, special project elements, and design details, if not received as part of the design phase geotechnical report, are developed with the assistance of the RME and the HQ Geotechnical Office. The designer uses this information in conjunction with the design phase geotechnical report to complete the PS&E document. The RME and the HQ Geotechnical Office can review the contract plans before the PS&E review begins, if requested. Otherwise, they will review the contract plans during the normal PS&E review process.

610.04(13) Rockslope Design 610.04(13)(a) Project Definition The region Project Office provides the RME with a description and location of the proposed rock excavation work. For widening of existing rock cuts, the anticipated width and length of the proposed cut in relationship to the existing cut are provided. For new alignments, the approximate location and depth of the cut are provided. Location of the proposed cut(s) can be milepost limits or stationing. The designer meets at the project site with the RME and the HQ Geotechnical Office to conduct a field review, discuss project requirements, and identify any geotechnical issues associated with the proposed rock cuts. The RME requests that the HQ Geotechnical Office participate in the field review and Project Definition reporting. The level of rockslope design work for the Project Definition phase is conceptual in nature. The geotechnical investigation generally consists of the field review, review of existing records, an assessment of existing rockslope stability, and preliminary geologic structure mapping. The focus of this investigation is to assess the feasibility of the rock cuts for the proposed widening or realignment, not final design. A brief conceptual-level report that summarizes the result of the Project Definition investigation is provided to the designer.
610.04(13)(b) Project Design Detailed rockslope design is done once the roadway geometrics have been established. The rockslope design cannot be finalized until the roadway geometrics have been finalized. Geotechnical information and field data necessary to complete the rockslope design are compiled during this design phase. This work includes rock structure mapping, test borings, laboratory testing, and slope stability analysis. The purpose of this design effort is to determine the maximum stable cut slope angle and any additional rockslope stabilization measures that could be required. The designer requests a geotechnical report from the HQ Geotechnical Office through the RME. The site data given in Section 610.04(4), as applicable, is provided. It is important that the request for the geotechnical report be made as early as possible in the design phase. Cost and schedule requirements to generate the report are project-specific and can vary widely. The time required to obtain permits and rights of entry must be considered when establishing schedule requirements. In addition to the geotechnical report requirements specified in the Geotechnical Design Manual, the HQ Geotechnical Office provides the following information as part of the project geotechnical report pertaining to rockslope design analysis and recommendations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Type of rockslope design analysis conducted and limitation of the analysis. Also included will be any agreements with the region and other customers regarding the definition of “acceptable risk.” The slope(s) required for stability. Additional slope stabilization requirements (such as rock bolts or rock dowels). Rockslope ditch criteria (see Chapter 1239). Assessment of rippability. Blasting requirements, including limitations on peak ground vibrations and air blast over-pressure if required. Usability of the excavated material, including estimates of shrink and swell. Constructibility issues associated with the rock excavation.
The region Project Office uses the geotechnical report to finalize the design decisions for the project and the completion of the PS&E design for the rockslope elements of the project.

610.04(13)(c) PS&E Development Adequate geotechnical design information to complete the PS&E is typically obtained during the design phase. Additional geotechnical work might be needed when right of way cannot be acquired, restrictions are included in permits, or other requirements are added that result in change to the design. Special provisions, special blasting requirements, and plan details, if not received as part of the design phase geotechnical report, are developed with the assistance of the RME or the HQ Geotechnical Office. The designer uses this information in conjunction with the design phase geotechnical report to complete the PS&E documents. The RME and the HQ Geotechnical Office can review (if requested) the contract plans before the PS&E review begins. Otherwise, they will review the contract plans during the normal PS&E review process.
610.04(14) Bridge Foundations 610.04(14)(a) Project Definition The HQ Geotechnical Office supports the development of reasonably accurate estimates of bridge substructure costs beginning with the Project Definition phase. A field review is recommended for major projects and projects that are located in areas with little or no existing geotechnical information. The region office responsible for Project Definition coordinates field reviews. Subsurface exploration (drilling) is usually not required at this time, but might be needed if cost estimates cannot be prepared within an acceptable range of certainty. Once it has received the necessary site data from the region Project Office, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for delivering the following project information to the HQ Geotechnical Office:
•
•
•
Alternative alignments and/or locations of bridge structures. A preliminary estimate of channelization (structure width). Known environmental constraints.
The HQ Geotechnical Office provides the following to the HQ Bridge and Structures and region offices:
•
•
•
•
•
Summary of existing geotechnical information. Identification of geotechnical hazards (such as slides, liquefiable soils, and soft-soil deposits). Identification of permits that might be required for subsurface exploration (drilling). Conceptual foundation types and depths. If requested, an estimated cost and time to complete a geotechnical foundation report.
The HQ Bridge and Structures Office uses this information to refine preliminary bridge costs. The region Project Office uses the estimated cost and time to complete a geotechnical foundation report to develop the project delivery cost and schedule.
610.04(14)(b) Project Design The HQ Geotechnical Office assists the HQ Bridge and Structures Office with preparation of the bridge preliminary plan. Geotechnical information gathered for Project Definition will normally be adequate for this phase, as test holes for the final bridge design cannot be drilled until accurate pier location information is available. For selected major projects, a type, size, and location (TS&L) report might be prepared, which usually requires some subsurface exploration to provide a more detailed, though not final, estimate of foundation requirements.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 610-13
Chapter 610
Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
The HQ Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for delivering the following project information, based on bridge site data received from the region Project Office, to the HQ Geotechnical Office:
•
•
•
Anticipated pier locations. Approach fill heights. For TS&L, alternate locations/alignments/structure types.
The HQ Bridge and Structures Office can expect to receive the following:
•
•
•
•
Conceptual foundation types, depths, and capacities. Permissible slopes for bridge approaches. For TS&L, a summary of site geology and subsurface conditions, and more detailed preliminary foundation design parameters and needs. If applicable or requested, the potential impact of erosion or scour potential (determined by the HQ Hydraulics Section) on foundation requirements.
The HQ Bridge and Structures Office uses this information to complete the bridge preliminary plan. The region Project Office confirms right of way needs for approach embankments. For TS&L, the geotechnical information provided is used for cost estimating and preferred alternate selection. The preliminary plans are used by the HQ Geotechnical Office to develop the site subsurface exploration plan.
610.04(14)(c) PS&E Development During this phase, or as soon as a 95% preliminary plan is available, subsurface exploration (drilling) is performed and a geotechnical foundation report is prepared to provide all necessary geotechnical recommendations needed to complete the bridge PS&E. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for delivering the following project information to the HQ Geotechnical Office:
•
•
•
•
95% preliminary plans, concurrent with distribution for region approval. Estimated foundation loads and allowable settlement criteria for the structure when requested. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office can expect to receive: The bridge geotechnical foundation report.
The HQ Bridge and Structures Office uses this information to complete the bridge PS&E. The region Project Office reviews the geotechnical foundation report for construction considerations and recommendations that might affect region items, estimates, staging, construction schedule, or other items. Upon receipt of the structure PS&E review set, the HQ Geotechnical Office provides the HQ Bridge and Structures Office with a Summary of Geotechnical Conditions for inclusion in Appendix B of the contract.

For upland retaining walls and grading, utility trenches, and pavement design, the RME assists WSF with determining geotechnical feasibility. In addition to the site data provided in Section 610.04(4), as applicable, the following information is supplied by WSF to the HQ Geotechnical Office or the RME, as appropriate, with the request for the project geotechnical report:
•
•
•
•
•
A plan showing anticipated structure locations as well as existing structures. Relevant historical data for the site. A plan showing utility trench locations. Anticipated utility trench depths. Proposed roadway profiles.
WSF can expect to receive the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Results of any borings or laboratory tests conducted. A description of geotechnical site conditions. Conceptual foundation types, depths, and capacities. Conceptual wall types. Assessment of constructibility issues that affect feasibility. Surfacing depths and/or pavement repair and drainage schemes. If applicable or requested, potential impact of erosion or scour potential (determined by the HQ Hydraulics Section) on foundation requirements.
WSF uses this information to complete the design report, design decisions, and estimated budget and schedule. WSF is responsible for obtaining any necessary permits or right of entry agreements needed to access structure locations for the purpose of subsurface exploration (such as test hole drilling). The time required for obtaining permits and rights of entry must be considered when developing project schedules. Possible permits and agreements might include, but are not limited to:
•
•
City, county, or local agency use permits. Sensitive area ordinance permits.
610.04(16)(b) PS&E Development Subsurface exploration (drilling) is performed and a geotechnical foundation report is prepared to provide all necessary geotechnical recommendations needed to complete the PS&E. The designer requests a geotechnical report from the HQ Geotechnical Office or the RME, as appropriate. The site data given in Section 610.04(4), as applicable, is provided along with the following information:
•
•
A plan showing final structure locations as well as existing structures. Proposed structure loadings.

Final wall types and geotechnical designs/parameters for each wall. Assessment of constructibility issues to be considered in foundation selection and when assembling the PS&E. Pile driving information: driving resistance and estimated overdrive. Surfacing depths and/or pavement repair and drainage schemes.
WSF uses this information to complete the PS&E. Upon receipt of the WSF PS&E review set, the HQ Geotechnical Office provides WSF with a Summary of Geotechnical Conditions for inclusion in Appendix B of the Contract. A Final Geotechnical Project Documentation package is assembled by the HQ Geotechnical Office and sent to WSF or the Plans Branch, as appropriate, for reproduction and sale to prospective bidders.
610.05 Use of Geotechnical Consultants Prior to authorizing a consultant to conduct the geotechnical investigation for a project, the region Project Office, the HQ Geotechnical Office, and the RME determine the scope of work and schedule for the project and whether or not the project will go to a geotechnical consultant. Once the decision has been made to have a consultant conduct the geotechnical investigation for a project, the HQ Geotechnical Office or the RME assists in developing the geotechnical scope and estimate for the project (WSDOT Consultant Services assists in this process). A team meeting between the consultant team, the region or Washington State Ferries (depending on whose project it is), and the HQ Geotechnical Office/RME is conducted early in the project to develop technical communication lines and relationships. Good proactive communication between all members of the project team is crucial to the success of the project due to the complex supplierclient relationships. Additional guidelines on the use of geotechnical consultants and the development of a scope of work for the consultant are provided in the Geotechnical Design Manual.
610.06 Geotechnical Work by Others Geotechnical design work conducted for the design of structures, or other engineering works by other agencies or private developers within the right of way, is subject to the same geotechnical engineering requirements as for engineering works performed by WSDOT. Therefore, the provisions contained within this chapter also apply in principle to such work. All geotechnical work conducted for engineering works within the WSDOT right of way or that otherwise directly impacts WSDOT facilities must be reviewed and approved by the HQ Geotechnical Office or the RME, depending on the nature of the work. Additional requirements for geotechnical work by others that impacts WSDOT facilities and land within the WSDOT right of way are set forth in the Geotechnical Design Manual.

610.08(2) Final Geotechnical Project Documentation and Geotechnical Information for the Construction Contract Once a project PS&E is near completion, all of the geotechnical design memorandums and reports are compiled together to form the Final Geotechnical Project Documentation, to be published for the use of prospective bidders. The detailed process for this is located in the Plans Preparation Manual. Geotechnical information included in the contract consists of the final project boring logs and, as appropriate for the project, a Summary of Geotechnical Conditions. The boring logs from the geotechnical reports are incorporated into the contract by the region, WSF, or Urban Corridors Office (UCO) staff. The Summary of Geotechnical Conditions is provided to the region, WSF, or UCO by the HQ Geotechnical Office and/or RME. Additional geotechnical project documentation requirements are set forth in the Geotechnical Design Manual.

620.01 General Detailed criteria and methods that govern pavement design are in the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Pavement Policy, which is available from the Pavements website: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/construction-materials/pavement-design-management The pavement design for all Design-Build project Request for Proposals (RFPs) will be conducted by the State Materials Lab, Pavement Division.
620.02 Estimating Tables The tables in Exhibit 620-1 through *Tabulated quantities are based on compacted weight of 1.85 tons/yd3 Exhibit 620-12 are for developing estimates of quantities for pavement sections, shoulder sections, stockpiles, asphalt distribution, and fog seal.

*3,700 lb/cy (1.85 tons/cy) is recommended as the most suitable factor; however, if the grading approaches the coarseness of ballast, the factor would approach 3,800 lb/cy (1.90 tons/cy), and if the grading contains more than 45% sand, the factor would decrease, approaching 3,400 lb/cy (1.70 tons/cy) for material that is essentially all sand. Notes:

Weights shown are dry weights and corrections are required for water contents. The tabulated weights for the materials are reasonably close; however, apply corrections in the following order: For specific gravity: Wt. = tabular wt. x specific gravity on surface report/2.65 For water content: Wt. = tabular wt. x (1 + free water % in decimals) If material is to be stockpiled, increase required quantities by 10% to allow for waste. Consider the inclusion of crushed surfacing top course material for keystone when estimating quantities for projects having ballast course.

Notes: [1] Quantities shown do not provide for widening, waste from stockpile, or thickened edges. [2] Quantities of asphalt shown are based on 60°F temperature. Recompute to the application temperature for the particular grade. [3] The column “Basic Asphalt Used” is shown for the purpose of conversion to proper weights for the asphalt being used and does not imply that the particular grade shown is required for the respective treatment. [4] For stress-absorbing membrane (rubberized asphalt), increase asphalt by 25%.

630.01 General Geosynthetics include a variety of manufactured products that are used by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) in drainage, earthwork, erosion control, and soil reinforcement applications. The following geosynthetic applications are addressed in the Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction (Standard Specifications):
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Low survivability underground drainage Moderate survivability underground drainage Separation Soil stabilization Moderate survivability permanent erosion control High survivability permanent erosion control Ditch lining Temporary silt fence
The Standard Specifications addresses geosynthetic properties as well as installation requirements and are not site-specific. The geosynthetic properties provided are based on the range of soil conditions likely to be encountered in Washington for the applications defined. Other applications, such as prefabricated edge drains, pond liners, and geotextile retaining walls, are currently handled by special provision. Design responsibilities are discussed in Section 630.05 and illustrated in Exhibit 630-4 and Exhibit 630-5. This chapter does not address applications where geosynthetics are used to help establish vegetation through temporary prevention of erosion (vegetation mats).

Geosynthetics
630.03 Geosynthetic Types and Characteristics Geosynthetics include woven and nonwoven geotextiles, geogrids, geonets, geomembranes, and geocomposites. (Examples of the various types of geosynthetics are provided in Exhibit 630-5.) Terms used in the past for these construction materials include fabrics, filter fabric, or filter cloth, which are for the most part synonymous with the newer term geotextile.
630.03(1) Definitions Definitions of the geosynthetic types are as follows:
630.03(1)(a) Woven Geotextiles Slit polymer tapes, monofilament fibers, fibrillated yarns, or multifilament yarns simply woven into a mat. Woven geotextiles generally have relatively high strength and stiffness and, except for the monofilament wovens, relatively poor drainage characteristics.
630.03(1)(b) Nonwoven Geotextiles A sheet of continuous or staple fibers entangled randomly into a felt for needle-punched nonwovens and pressed and melted together at the fiber contact points for heat-bonded nonwovens. Nonwoven geotextiles tend to have low-to-medium strength and stiffness with high elongation at failure and relatively good drainage characteristics. The high elongation characteristic gives them superior ability to deform around stones and sticks.
630.03(1)(c) Geogrids A polymer grid mat constructed either of coated yarns or a punched and stretched polymer sheet. Geogrids usually have high strength and stiffness and are used primarily for soil reinforcement.
630.03(1)(d) Geonets Similar to geogrids, but typically lighter weight and weaker, with smaller mesh openings. Geonets are used in light reinforcement applications or are combined with drainage geotextiles to form a drainage structure.
630.03(1)(e) Geomembranes Impervious polymer sheets that are typically used to line ponds or landfills. In some cases, geomembranes are placed over moisture-sensitive swelling clays to control moisture.
630.03(1)(f) Geocomposites Prefabricated edge drains, wall drains, and sheet drains that typically consist of a cuspated or dimpled polyethylene drainage core wrapped in a geotextile. The geotextile wrap keeps the core clean so that water can freely flow through the drainage core, which acts as a conduit. Prefabricated edge drains are used in place of shallow geotextile-wrapped trench drains at the edges of the roadway to provide subgrade and base drainage. Wall drains and sheet drains are typically placed between the back of the wall and the soil to drain the soil retained by the wall.
630.04 Geosynthetic Function Definitions and Applications The function of the geosynthetic varies with the application. (See Exhibit 630-7 for examples of the various applications.) The geosynthetic must be designed with its application function(s) in mind. Typical geosynthetic functions include filtration, drainage, separation, reinforcement, and erosion control. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 630
Geosynthetics
630.04(1) Definitions Definitions of these functions and examples of their dominant applications are as follows:
630.04(1)(a) Geosynthetic Filtration The passage of water through the geosynthetic relatively unimpeded (permeability or permittivity) without allowing passage of soil through the geosynthetic (retention). This is the primary function of geotextiles in underground drainage applications.
630.04(1)(b) Drainage The carrying of water in the plane of the geosynthetic as a conduit (transmissivity) is a primary function of geocomposite drains. In some cases, the function includes thick, nonwoven needle-punched geotextiles placed in underground drainage applications where water must be transported away from a given location by the geosynthetic itself.
630.04(1)(c) Separation The prevention of the mixing of two dissimilar materials. This is a primary function of geotextiles placed between a fine-grained subgrade and a granular base course beneath a roadway.
630.04(1)(d) Reinforcement The strengthening of a soil mass by the inclusion of elements (geosynthetics) that have tensile strength. This is the primary function of high-strength geotextiles and geogrids in geosynthetic reinforced wall or slope applications, or in roadways placed over very soft subgrade soils that are inadequate to support the weight of the construction equipment or even the embankment itself.
630.04(1)(e) Geosynthetic Erosion Control The minimizing of surficial soil particle movement due to the flow of water over the surface of bare soil or due to the disturbance of soil caused by construction activities under or near bodies of water. This is the primary function of geotextiles used as silt fences or placed beneath riprap or other stones on soil slopes. Silt fences keep eroded soil particles on the construction site, whereas geotextiles placed beneath riprap or other stones on soil slopes prevent erosion from taking place at all. In general, the permanent erosion control methods described in this chapter are only used where more natural means (like the use of biodegradable vegetation mats to establish vegetation to prevent erosion) are not feasible. These functions control some of the geosynthetic properties, such as apparent opening size (AOS) and permittivity, and in some cases load-strain characteristics. The application will also affect the geosynthetic installation conditions. These installation conditions influence the remaining geosynthetic properties needed, based on the survivability level required.
630.04(1)(f) Geosynthetic Survivability The ability of the geosynthetic to resist installation conditions without significant damage, such that the geosynthetic can function as intended. Survivability affects the strength properties of the geosynthetic required.

Geosynthetics
630.05 Design Approach for Geosynthetics The following questions must be answered to complete a geosynthetic design:
•
•
•
•
Is a geosynthetic really needed? What geosynthetic properties will ensure the geosynthetic functions as intended? Where should the geosynthetic be located? Will maintenance of the geosynthetic, or the structure of which it is a part, be needed? If so, how will it be maintained?
The site conditions and purpose for the geotextile are reviewed to determine whether or not a geotextile is needed.
•
•
•
•
For most drainage, separation, soil stabilization, permanent erosion control, and silt fence applications, if a geotextile is needed, the geotextile properties in the Standard Specifications can be used. In some situations where soil conditions are especially troublesome or in critical or high-risk applications, a project-specific design may be needed. The location of the geosynthetic will depend on how it is intended to function. (See Exhibit 630-7 for examples.) Consider the flow path of any groundwater or surface water when locating and selecting the geotextile to be used. For example, in permanent erosion control applications, water may flow to the geotextile from the existing ground as well as from the surface through wave action, stream flow, or overland sheet flow. For saturated fine sandy or silty subgrades, water must be able to flow from the subgrade through the geotextile soil stabilization layer during the pumping action caused by traffic loads.
Background information and the answers to each of these questions, or at least guidance to obtaining the answers to these questions, are provided for each of the following Standard Specifications applications:
630.05(1) Underground Drainage: Low and Moderate Survivability Geotextiles used for underground drainage must provide filtration to allow water to reach the drain aggregate without allowing the aggregate to be contaminated by finer soil particles. Geotextile filtration properties are a function of the soil type. For underground drainage applications, if the subgrade soil is relatively clean gravel or coarse sand, a geotextile is probably not required. At issue is whether or not there are enough fines in the surrounding soil to eventually clog the drain rock or drain pipe if unrestricted flow toward the drain is allowed. To approximately match the geotextile filtration properties to various soil types, specifications for three classes of Construction Geotextile for Underground Drainage are available in the Standard Specifications. For underground drainage applications, use the gradation of the soil, specifically the percent by weight passing the #200 sieve, to select the drainage geotextile class required. Base your selection of the appropriate class of geotextile on Exhibit 630-1. Exhibit 630-1 Selection Criteria for Geotextile Class
Percent Passing the #200 Sieve Less than 15% 15% to 50% Greater than 50% WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Geosynthetics
Obtain soil samples for geotextile underdrain design every 300 feet along the roadway alignment, using hand holes, and at major soil type transitions. This may be spread to every 1000 feet if the soil conditions appear to be uniform. Use existing soil data where feasible instead of taking new soil samples. If soil conditions vary widely along the alignment where underground drainage geotextile is anticipated, different classes of drainage geotextile may be required for specific sections of a continuous system. Strength properties for the underground drainage geotextile depend on the survivability level required to resist installation stresses. Low survivability designates that the installation stresses placed on the geotextile will be relatively low, requiring only moderate geotextile strength to resist potentially damaging installation conditions. Examples of low survivability level underground drainage applications include:
•
•
•
Trench drains. Drains placed behind walls or other structures to drain the backfill. A geotextile filter sheet placed behind a gabion wall to prevent fines from being washed through the gabion wall face. Trench depths, or the height of the geotextile filter sheet behind gabion walls, must be less than or equal to 6 feet for the low survivability level.
In moderate survivability applications, significant installation stresses may occur, requiring higher geotextile strength. Examples of the moderate survivability application include:
•
•
•
Trench drains with a depth of greater than 6 feet. A geotextile filter sheet behind a gabion wall with a height greater than 6 feet. Any area drain.
An area drain is defined as a geotextile placed over or under a horizontal-to-moderately sloping (1.5H:1V or flatter slope) layer of drainage aggregate. Examples of area drains include:
•
•
•
•
Drainage layers over cut-and-cover tunnels. Rock buttress drainage. Permeable base beneath highway pavement (see the WSDOT Pavement Policy for additional information on permeable bases). A parking lot drainage layer.
Note that pipe wrapping (the geotextile is wrapped around the surface of the pipe) is not included as an underground drainage application. Locate the geotextile such that it will function as intended. For example, if the objective is to keep the drainage aggregate surrounding a drain pipe clean, locate the geotextile so that it completely separates the drainage aggregate from more silty surrounding soils, which may include native soils as well as relatively silty roadway base or fill materials. Consider the flow path of any groundwater or surface water when locating the geotextile. The flow path from the geotextile, as part of the groundwater drainage, is typically directed to a surface water conveyance system. Design of surface water conveyance is guided by the Hydraulics Manual. The surface water conveyance must be low enough to prevent backflow and charging of the groundwater drainage—typically, by matching inverts of groundwater drainage to crowns of surface water conveyance pipes. A 1-foot allowance is usually applied when connecting to open water or ditches.

Geosynthetics
630.05(2) Separation Geotextile used for separation must prevent penetration of relatively fine grained subgrade soil into the ballast or other roadway or parking lot surfacing material to prevent contamination of the surfacing material (the separation function). This application may also apply to situations other than beneath roadway or parking lot surfacing where it is not necessary for water to drain through the geotextile unimpeded (filtration), but where separation of two dissimilar materials is required. Separation geotextile should only be used in roadway applications where the subgrade is can be prepared and compacted as required in the Standard Specifications, but without removal and replacement of the subgrade soil with granular material. Such removal and replacement defeats the purpose of the geotextile separator. Separation geotextile placed beneath roadway surfacing is feasible if the subgrade resilient modulus is greater than 5,800 psi and if a saturated fine sandy, silty, or clayey subgrade is not likely to be present. Note that the feasibility of separation geotextile may be dependent on the time of year and weather conditions expected when the geotextile is to be installed. For separation applications, a geotextile is not needed if the subgrade is dense and granular (silty sands and gravels), but is not saturated fine sands. In general, a separation geotextile is not needed if the subgrade resilient modulus is greater than 15,000 psi.
630.05(3) Soil Stabilization Geotextile used for soil stabilization must function as a separator, a filtration layer, and (to a minor extent) a reinforcement layer. This application is similar to the separation application, except the subgrade is anticipated to be softer and wetter than in the separation application. Soil stabilization geotextile is used in roadway applications if the subgrade is too soft and wet to be prepared and compacted as required in the Standard Specifications. Soil stabilization geotextile is placed directly on the soft subgrade material, even if some overexcavation of the subgrade is performed. Backfill to replace the overexcavated subgrade is not placed below the geotextile soil stabilization layer, as this would defeat the purpose of the geotextile. Anticipate the need for soil stabilization geotextile if the subgrade resilient modulus is less than or equal to 5,800 psi, or if a saturated fine sandy, silty, or clayey subgrade is likely to be present. Consider the flow path of any groundwater or surface water when locating the soil stabilization geotextile and when selecting the geotextile to be used. For saturated fine sandy or silty subgrades, water must be able to flow from the subgrade through the geotextile soil stabilization layer during the pumping action caused by traffic loads. Even if the subgrade is not anticipated to be saturated based on available data, if the subgrade is silty or clayey and it is anticipated that the geotextile will be installed during prolonged wet weather, a soil stabilization geotextile may still be needed. Soil stabilization geotextile should not be used for roadway fills greater than 5 feet high or when extremely soft and wet silt, clay, or peat is anticipated at the subgrade level (for example, the deposits encountered in wetlands). In such cases, the reinforcement function becomes more dominant, requiring a site-specific design.

630.05(4) Permanent Erosion Control: Moderate and High Survivability The primary function of geotextile used for permanent erosion control is to protect the soil beneath it from erosion due to water flowing over the protected soil. The need for a permanent erosion control geotextile depends on the type and magnitude of water flow over the soil being considered for protection, the soil type in terms of its erodability, and the type and amount of vegetative cover present (see the Highway Runoff Manual). The source of flowing water could be streams, constructed channels, wave action, or runoff. Water may also flow from the soil behind the geotextile depending on the groundwater level. If groundwater cannot escape through the geotextile, an erosion control system failure termed ballooning (resulting from water pressure buildup behind the geotextile) or soil piping could occur. Therefore, the geotextile must have good filtration characteristics. Three classes of permanent erosion control geotextile are available to approximately match geotextile filtration characteristics to the soil. In order to select the drainage geotextile class, determine the gradation of the soil, specifically the percent by weight passing the #200 sieve. Base selection of the appropriate class of geotextile on Exhibit 630-1. A minimal amount of soil sampling and testing is needed to determine the geotextile class required. Permanent erosion control geotextile generally does not extend along the roadway alignment for significant distances as does underground drainage geotextile. One soil sample per permanent erosion control location is sufficient. If multiple erosion control locations are anticipated along a roadway alignment, soil sampling requirements for underground drainage can be applied. If soil conditions vary widely along the alignment where permanent erosion control geotextile is anticipated, different classes of erosion control geotextile may be required for specific sections of a continuous system. Examples of the permanent erosion control application are the placement of geotextile beneath riprap or gabions along drainage channels, shorelines, and waterways; around bridge piers; and under slope protection for highway cut or fill slopes. If a moderate survivability geotextile is to be used, the geotextile must be protected by a 12-inch aggregate cushion and be placed on slopes of 2H:1V or flatter to keep installation stresses to a relatively low level. Large stones can cause significant damage to a moderate survivability geotextile if the geotextile is not protected in this manner. If these conditions are not met, then a high survivability erosion control geotextile must be used.
630.05(5) Ditch Lining The primary function of the geotextile in a ditch lining application is to protect the soil beneath it from erosion. This ditch lining application is limited to constructed ditches less than 16 feet wide at the top with side slopes of 2H:1V or flatter. If the ditch does not meet these requirements, then permanent erosion control, with moderate or high survivability geotextile, must be used. It is assumed that only quarry spall-sized stones or smaller will be placed on the geotextile, so only a moderate survivability geotextile will be required. Filtration is not a significant function in this application. Since the ditch is relatively shallow, it is expected that the main water source will be the water carried by the ditch, and little water will pass through the geotextile. Another application with a similar geotextile function is the placement of geotextile below culvert outlets to prevent erosion at the outlet.

Geosynthetics
630.05(6) Temporary Silt Fence The primary function of geotextile used in a temporary silt fence is to prevent eroded material from being transported away from the construction site by runoff water. The silt fence acts primarily as a temporary dam and secondarily as a filter. In some cases, depending on the topography, the silt fence may also function as a barrier to direct flow to low areas at the bottom of swales where the water can be collected and temporarily ponded. It is desirable to avoid the barrier function as much as possible, as silt fences are best suited to intercepting sheet flow rather than the concentrated flows that would occur in swales or intermittent drainage channels. To function as intended, the silt fence should have a low enough permeability to allow the water to be temporarily retained behind the fence, allowing suspended soil particles in the water to settle to the ground. If the retention time is too long, or if the flow rate of water is too high, the silt fence could be overtopped, thus allowing silt-laden water to escape. Therefore, a minimal amount of water must be able to flow through the fence at all times. Temporary water ponding is considered the primary method of silt removal and the filtration capabilities of the fence are the second line of defense. However, removal of silt-sized particles from the water directly by the geotextile creates severe filtration conditions for the geotextile, forcing the geotextile to either blind or allow the fines to pipe through the geotextile. (Blinding is the coating of the geotextile surface with soil particles such that the openings are effectively plugged.) If the geotextile openings (AOS) are designed to be small enough to capture most of the suspended soil particles, the geotextile will likely blind, reducing the permeability enough to allow water to overtop the fence. Therefore, it is best to allow some geotextile openings that are large enough to allow the silt-sized particles to easily pass through. Even if some silt particles pass through the fence, the water flow rate below the fence will be decreased and the volume of silt-laden water passing through the geotextile is likely to be relatively small and the water is partially filtered. The geotextile apparent opening size (AOS) and permittivity are typically used to specify the filtration performance of geotextiles. The geotextile function in silt fence applications is more complex than this and AOS and permittivity do not relate directly to how well a silt fence will perform. However, nominal values of AOS and permittivity can be specified such that the types of geotextile products known to perform satisfactorily in this application are selected. These values are provided in the Standard Specifications. The source of load on the geotextile is from silt buildup at the fence and water ponding. The amount of strength required to resist this load depends on whether or not the geotextile is supported with a wire or polymer grid mesh between the fence posts. Obviously, unsupported geotextile must have greater strength than supported geotextile. If the strength of the geotextile or its support system is inadequate, the silt fence could fail. Furthermore, unsupported geotextile must have enough stiffness that it does not deform excessively and allow silt-laden water to go over the top of the fence.
630.05(6)(a) Need for Silt Fence The need for a silt fence can be anticipated where construction activities disturb and expose soil that could erode. The ground surface is considered disturbed if vegetative cover is at least partially removed over a significant area by construction activities. Consider whether or not silt-laden runoff water from the disturbed area can reach an environmentally sensitive area or a constructed stormwater system. If the exposed soil is a clean sand or gravel or if a significant zone of heavy vegetative cover separates the exposed soil from the environmentally sensitive area, a silt fence may not even be needed. Contact the Headquarters (HQ) Hydraulics Section for help in determining whether or not a silt fence is needed in such situations.

Geosynthetics
630.05(6)(b) Feasibility of Silt Fence The feasibility of a geotextile silt fence depends on the magnitude of water flow to the fence, the steepness of the slope behind the fence, and whether or not flow is concentrated at the fence. If the silt fence is not feasible, alternative erosion control methods may be needed (see the Highway Runoff Manual). Consider all feasible erosion control options in terms of potential effectiveness and economy before making the final decision to use a silt fence. Select the best option for the site conditions, including site geometry and contours, soil type, and rainfall potential. Consider silt fences for temporary erosion control in disturbed areas in the following circumstances:
•
•
•
•
•
Fully covering disturbed areas temporarily with polyethylene sheeting or other temporary covering is not feasible or practical. Permanent ground cover for disturbed areas is not yet established. Runoff water reaches the silt fence primarily as sheet flow rather than as concentrated flows, with the exception of some ditch and swale applications. Slopes above the silt fence are not steeper than 1.5H:1V. The sheet flow length (length of slope contributing runoff water to the silt fence) is not too long.
630.05(6)(c) Sheet Flow Length Maximum sheet flow lengths allowed for silt fences are provided in Exhibit 630-2, which is based on the typical 2-year, 24-hour design storm for Washington, resulting in a 24-hour rainfall of 3 inches. Exhibit 630-2 Maximum Sheet Flow Lengths for Silt Fences
Slope 1.5H:1V 2H:1V 4H:1V 6H:1V
Sheet Flow Length 100 ft 115 ft 150 ft 200 ft
The sheet flow length represents the area contributing runoff water from precipitation. The sheet flow length is defined in Exhibit 630-8. The sheet flow lengths provided in Exhibit 630-2 were determined assuming a bare soil condition, with the soil classified as a silt. These are worst-case assumptions because less runoff would be expected for sand or gravel soils or when some vegetation is present. The sheet flow length is usually equal to or greater than the disturbed soil slope length. However, undisturbed sloping ground above the disturbed slope area may also contribute runoff to the silt fence area. The length of undisturbed sloping ground above the disturbed slope to be included in the total contributing slope length depends on the amount and type of vegetation present, the slope steepness, and the degree of development above the slope. If unsure whether the proposed silt fence meets the requirements in Exhibit 630-2, contact the HQ Hydraulics Section for assistance.

630.05(6)(d) Temporary Silt Fence Temporary silt fences may also be used in ditch or swale applications. If the area contributing runoff to the fence exceeds the value determined from Exhibit 630-3, hydraulic overload will occur. The ditch or swale storage length and width are defined in Exhibit 630-9. The assumptions used in the development of Exhibit 630-3 are the same as those used for Exhibit 630-2 in terms of the design storm and ground conditions. As an example, if a site has a 13-foot-wide ditch with an average slope of 2%, the fence can be located such that 7800 ft2 of area drain to it. If it appears that the area draining to the fence will be larger than the allowable, it may be possible to divide the contributing area into smaller areas and add a silt fence for each smaller area as shown in Exhibit 630-10. The minimum storage length for the ditch behind each silt fence must be maintained. If this is not possible, it may be necessary to use an alternate erosion control structure, as described in the Highway Runoff Manual, or develop a special silt fence design. Exhibit 630-3 was developed with the assumption that water will be able to pond to a depth of at least 2 feet behind the fence. If this is not the case (the ditch or swale depth is less than 2 feet), the table cannot be used. Furthermore, the ditch depth must be greater than the height of the silt fence at its lowest point within the ditch. Otherwise, there will not be enough storage available behind the fence and water will circumvent the fence by flowing around it.
630.05(6)(e) Locating a Silt Fence Locate silt fences on contour as much as possible. At the ends of the fence, turn it up hill such that it captures the runoff water and prevents water from flowing around the end of the fence. This is illustrated in Exhibit 630-11. Silt fences are designed to capture up to a 2-foot depth of water behind the fence. Therefore, the ground line at the ends of the fence must be at least 2 feet above the ground line at the lowest part of the fence. This 2-foot requirement applies to ditches as well as to general slope erosion control.

Chapter 630
Geosynthetics
If the fence must cross contours (except for the ends of the fence), use gravel check dams placed perpendicular to the back of the fence to minimize concentrated flow and erosion along the back of the fence (see Exhibit 630-12).
•
•
•
•
The gravel check dams are approximately 1 foot high at the back of the fence and are continued perpendicular to the fence at the same elevation until the top of the dam intercepts the ground surface behind the fence. Locate the gravel check dams every 10 feet along the fence. In general, the slope of the fence line is not to be steeper than 3H:1V. For the gravel check dams, use Crushed Surfacing Base Course, Gravel Backfill for Walls, or Permeable Ballast (see the Standard Specifications).
If the silt fence application is considered critical (such as when the fence is placed immediately adjacent to environmentally sensitive areas like streams, lakes, or wetlands), place a second silt fence below the first silt fence to capture any silt that passes through the first fence and/or place straw bales behind the silt fence. Locate silt fences at least 7 feet from an environmentally sensitive area. Where this is impossible, and a silt fence must be used, a special design may be necessary. Temporary silt fences are sometimes used to completely encircle underground drainage inlets or other similar features to prevent silt from entering the drainage system. This is acceptable, but the silt fence functions primarily as a barrier, and not as a ponding or filtering mechanism, unless the drainage inlet is in a depression that is large enough to allow water to pond behind the silt fence.
•
•
If the drainage inlet and silt fence are not in a large enough depression, silt-laden water will simply be directed around the fence and must be captured by another fence or sedimentation pond downslope. If the depression is deep, locate the silt fence no more than 2 feet below the top of the depression to prevent overtopping. A site-specific design may be needed if the silt fence is located deeper than 2 feet within the depression.
It may be necessary to relocate silt fences during the course of a construction project as cuts and fills are built or as disturbed areas change. An erosion control/silt fence plan that accounts for the anticipated construction stages (and eventual removal) should be developed. Do not assume that one silt fence location can routinely be used for the entire life of the contract. Periodically check the locations in the field during the construction project, and field-adjust the silt fence locations as necessary to ensure the silt fences function as intended.
630.05(7) Standard Specification Geotextile Application Identification in the Contract Plans Identify the geotextile in the contract plan detail in a way that ties it to the appropriate application in the Standard Specifications. For example:
•
•
If a geotextile is to be used to line an underground trench drain 3 feet deep and the native soil has less than 15% passing the #200 sieve, identify the geotextile on the plan sheet as “Construction Geotextile for Underground Drainage, Low Survivability, Class A.” If the geotextile is to be placed beneath riprap on a slope without a cushion layer between the geotextile and the riprap, and the native soil contains 35% passing the #200 sieve, identify the geotextile on the plan sheet as “Construction Geotextile for Permanent Erosion Control, High Survivability, Class B.”

•
Geosynthetics
If the geotextile is to be placed between the roadway base course and a moist silt subgrade with a resilient modulus of 6,500 psi, and the roadway is planned to be constructed during the dry summer and early fall months, identify the geotextile on the plan sheet as “Construction Geotextile for Separation.”
630.05(8) Site-Specific Designs (All Applications) A site-specific design is required:
•
•
For all reinforcement applications. For applications not covered by the Standard Specifications.
Consider a site-specific design for:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
High-risk applications. Exceptionally large geotextile projects: if the geotextile quantity in a single application is over 35,000 yd2 or over 85,000 yd2 for the separation application. Severe or unusual soil or groundwater conditions. Soil in the vicinity of the proposed geotextile location that consists of alternate thin layers of silt or clay with potentially water-bearing sand layers on the order of 1 to 3 inches thick or less. Soil known through past experience to be problematic for geosynthetic drains. Drains in native soil behind structures except drains contained within granular backfill. Drains designed to stabilize unstable slopes. Drains designed to mitigate frost heave.
In such cases, obtain assistance from the HQ Materials Laboratory, Geotechnical Office. To initiate the special design, provide a plan and cross section showing:
•
•
•
•
The geosynthetic structure to be designed. The structure’s relative location to other adjacent structures that it could potentially affect. The structure’s intended purpose. Any soil data in the vicinity.
Consider a site-specific design for temporary silt fences:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
If silt fence must be used in intermittent streams or where a significant portion of the silt fence functions as a barrier that directs flow to the lower portions of the silt fence. If the fence must be located on steep slopes. In situations not meeting the requirements in Exhibit 630-2 and Exhibit 630-3. If the 2-year, 24-hour design storm for the site is greater than the 3 inches assumed for the development of Exhibit 630-2 and Exhibit 630-3. Where concentrated flow is anticipated. If closer than 7 feet from an environmentally sensitive area. If more than 2 feet of storage depth is needed.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 630-12
Chapter 630
Geosynthetics
For a site-specific temporary silt fence design, obtain assistance from the HQ Hydraulics Section. To initiate the design, send the following information to the HQ Hydraulics Section and a copy to the HQ Materials Laboratory, Geotechnical Office:
•
•
•
Plan sheets showing proposed silt fence locations and grading contours. Estimate of the area contributing runoff to each silt fence, including percentage and general type of vegetative cover within the contributing area. Any available site soil information.
For all site-specific designs of applications not covered by the Standard Specifications, complete plans and special provisions are needed. In general, for site-specific designs of Standard Specifications applications, only a minor modification of the appropriate geotextile property table will be needed.
630.06 Design Responsibility The design responsibility and process for geotextile design are illustrated in Exhibit 630-4 and Exhibit 630-5. The region Project Development Office, in particular the region Project Manager, is responsible to initiate and develop all geotextile designs for the Standard Specifications, except for roadway separation and soil stabilization applications, which are initiated and developed by the region Materials Laboratory. The region Materials Laboratory assists the region Project Manager with Standard Specifications underground drainage and permanent erosion control designs. The region Environmental Design Office assists with Standard Specifications, permanent erosion control, and temporary silt fence designs. Once the region Project Manager or Materials Laboratory has determined that a geotextile is appropriate, development of a geotextile design for the Standard Specifications includes the development of plan details showing the plan location and cross section of the geotextile installation. Standard details for geotextiles as provided in the Plans Preparation Manual may be used or modified to adapt to the specific project situation. Note that only minimum dimensions for drains are provided in these standard details. Site-specific geosynthetic designs and applications not addressed by the Standard Specifications are designed by the region with the assistance of the HQ Materials Laboratory, Geotechnical Office, or the HQ Hydraulics Section as described in Section 630.05. Design assistance by the HQ Geotechnical Office or HQ Hydraulics Section for site-specific design of Standard Specifications applications includes determination of geosynthetic properties and other advice as needed to complete the geosynthetic plans and any special provisions required. The HQ Geotechnical Office is fully responsible to develop and complete the following:
•
•
•
Geosynthetic design, plan details that can be used to develop the contract plan sheets, and special provisions for geosynthetic reinforced walls, slopes, and embankments. Deep trench drains for landslide stabilization. Other applications that are an integral part of a Headquarters geotechnical design.
The region Project Manager incorporates the plan details and special provisions into the PS&E.

Chapter 700 Project Development Roles and Responsibilities for Projects with Structures 700.01 General 700.02 Procedures
Exhibit 700-1 Determination of the Roles and Responsibilities for Projects with Structures: Project Development Phase
700.01 General This chapter presents the project development process used by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) in the regions and the Headquarters (HQ) Bridge and Structures Office to determine the roles and responsibilities for projects with structures during the project development phase of a project. This chapter complements WSDOT’s Project Management Guide: Project management guide | WSDOT (wa.gov) For design procedures, see Division 7 chapters and the Bridge Design Manual. The primary objective of this process is to provide a consistent means of selecting a bridge design team to perform the structural design work, whether it is by a consultant or the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. If the local agency will be requesting any services from WSDOT, the local agency will contact WSDOT’s Local Programs Engineer, who will help define the level of WSDOT’s involvement in design and construction.
700.02 Procedures The flow diagram (see Exhibit 700-1) begins at the left with the initial approval and funding of the project and ends at the right with the start of the project delivery process. After a project is programmed, WSDOT is tasked with confirming the project scope and defining the structural team’s level of involvement in design and construction. Structural support will be provided by the Bridge and Structures Office. The Bridge and Structures Office may procure or recommend the Region procure a consultant as needed. If a consultant is used, the region and the HQ Bridge and Structures Office will determine the level of involvement and responsibility for the design, including scope and level of effort. Agreements defining the level of involvement and responsibility will be developed and executed between the region office responsible for project development and the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, and the appropriate project delivery process will be implemented. More information on this process and the desired outcomes is available on the WSDOT website under the Structures Design Topic : Preliminary design, plan preparation & specifications | WSDOT (wa.gov)

710.01 General The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Headquarters (HQ) Bridge and Structures Office provides preliminary site data reviews to determine the applicability of, and requirements surrounding, proprietary structural solutions, or the need for specific structural design strategies, as well as structural design services to the regions. This chapter describes the information required by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office to perform these functions.
710.02 Required Data for All Structures Structure site data provides information about the type of crossing, topography, type of structure, and potential future construction. Submit structure site data to the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for all structures meeting the Chapter 720 definition of a bridge with a structural clear span equal to 30 feet or greater measured along the overcrossing alignment. This includes all buried structures such as concrete three-sided structures, concrete box culverts and split box culverts, and steel and aluminum structural plate, pipes, arches, and boxes. Structures conforming to the National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) definition of a bridge, as cited in Chapter 720, having structural clear spans less than 30-feet as a general rule do not require preparation of a preliminary plan at the onset of design, and hence do not require structure site data to be submitted to HQ Bridge and Structures Office. See Section 720.03(14) when the delivery method involves a contractor supplied design. However, unique site-specific conditions known at the completion of the Preliminary Hydraulics Report may indicate the need for preparation of a preliminary plan in the design process, and thus require development of structural site data. Contact HQ Bridge and Structures Office after the completion of the Preliminary Hydraulics Report for collaboration. See Chapter 800 for specialty group coordination. Site data shall also provide information on nonstandard retaining walls needing project-specific design by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. Submit the structure site data to the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, Project Support unit, by email. In the email message, provide a general description of the project and provide a bullet list itemization of the structure site data forms, files, and data attached or linked in the email. Submit the structure site data as a CAD file with associated supplemental drawings and a report. (See Exhibit 710-1 for items to include in a structure site data submittal). Direct any questions relating to the preparation of structure site data to the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, Project Support unit. The Bridge Design Manual shows examples of required WSDOT forms.

710.02(1) Scour At any location where a structure can be in contact with water (such as culvert outfall, lake, river, or floodplain), there is a risk of scour. This risk is to be analyzed as part of the preliminary hydraulic design (PHD) and final hydraulic design (FHD) reports. Contact the HQ Geotechnical Office and the HQ Hydraulics Office to determine whether a scour analysis is required. See Chapter 800.

Coordinate any realignment of the waterway with the HQ Hydraulics Section. Many waterway crossings require a permit from the U.S. Coast Guard (see Bridge Design Manual Chapter 2.2.4 and the Environmental Manual). Generally, ocean tide-influenced waterways and waterways used for commercial navigation require a Coast Guard permit. These structures require the following additional information: o Names and addresses of the landowners adjacent to the bridge site. o Quantity of new embankment material within the floodway. This quantity denotes, in cubic yards, the material below and the material above normal high water.
For all waterway crossings, where the structural clear span parallel to the centerline of roadway width is less than 30 feet, the Region’s designer shall contact the US Coast Guard for determination of waterway jurisdiction and any associated permit requirements.

710.05(1) Bridge Widenings Submit DOT Form 235-002A, Supplemental Bridge Site Data-Rehabilitation/ Modification. Supplement structure site data for structures involving bridge widenings by the following:
710.05(1)(a) Plan
•
•
•

Elevations accurate to 0.1 foot taken at 10-foot intervals along the curb line of the side of the structure being widened. Pair these elevations with corresponding elevations (same station) taken along the crown line or an offset distance (10-foot minimum from the curb line). This information will be used to establish the cross slope of the existing bridge. Tabulate elevations in a format acceptable to the HQ Bridge and Structures Office.
Take these elevations at the level of the concrete roadway deck. For bridges with concrete overlay, elevations at the top of the overlay will be sufficient. For bridges with a nonstructural overlay, such as an asphalt concrete overlay, take elevations at the level of the concrete roadway deck. For skewed bridges, take elevations along the crown line or at an offset distance (10-foot minimum from the curb line) on the approach roadway for a sufficient distance to enable a cross slope to be established for the skewed corners of the bridge.
710.06 Site Data for Design-Build Conceptual Drawings Structure site data content and submittal requirements for development of structure conceptual drawings associated with Design-Build projects are similar but simplified to those associated with Design-Bid-Build projects. The simplified content requirements are outlined in Exhibit 710-2. The submittal of elements identified in Exhibit 710-2 as conceptual plan structure site data components shall conform to and be as described in Sections 710.02 through 710.05.

720.01 General The National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS), published in the Code of Federal Regulations (23 CFR 650, Subpart C), defines a bridge as: A structure including supports erected over a depression or an obstruction, such as water, highway, or railway, and having a track or passageway for carrying traffic or other moving loads, and having an opening measured along the center of the roadway of more than 20 feet between undercopings of abutments or spring lines of arches, or extreme ends of openings for multiple boxes; it may also include multiple pipes, where the clear distance between openings is less than half of the smaller contiguous opening. The term “bridge” as used in this chapter applies to all structures conforming to the above definition. This includes all buried structures with a structural clear span greater than 20 feet measured along the overcrossing alignment, such as concrete three-sided structures, concrete box culverts and split box culverts, and steel and aluminum structural plate, pipes, arches, and boxes. Bridge design is the responsibility of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Headquarters (HQ) Bridge and Structures Office, which develops a preliminary or conceptual bridge plan for a new or modified structure in collaboration with the region. This chapter provides basic design considerations for the development of this plan. Unique staging requirements, constructability issues, and other considerations are addressed during plan development. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office early in the planning stage regarding issues that might affect the planned project (see Chapter 700). See Exhibit 800-1 thru Exhibit 800-3 for specialty group coordination of water crossings.
720.02 Bridge Locations Bridge locations are chosen to conform to the alignment of the highway. Conditions that can simplify design efforts, minimize construction activities, and reduce structure costs are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
A perpendicular crossing. The minimum required horizontal and vertical clearances. A constant bridge width (without tapered sections). A tangential approach alignment of sufficient length not to require superelevation on the bridge. A crest vertical curve profile that will facilitate drainage. An adequate construction staging area.

Bridges
720.03 Bridge Site Design Elements 720.03(1) Structural Capacity The structural capacity of a bridge is a measure of the structure’s ability to carry vehicle loads. For new bridges, the bridge designer chooses the design load that determines the structural capacity. For existing bridges, the structural capacity is calculated to determine the “load rating” of the bridge. The load rating is used to determine whether or not a bridge is “posted” for legal weight vehicles or “restricted” for overweight permit vehicles.
720.03(1)(a) New Structures All new structures that carry vehicular loads are designed to HL-93 notional live load in accordance with AASHTO’s LRFD Bridge Design Specifications.
720.03(1)(b) Existing Structures When the structural capacity of a bridge will be affected by the project, the Region requests a Structural Capacity Report from the Risk Reduction Engineer in the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. Permanent redistribution of traffic, introduction of median barrier, and widening or deck rehabilitation are among the triggers for evaluation of a bridge’s structural capacity. The report will state:
•
•
The structural capacity status of the structures within the project limits. What action, if any, is appropriate.
The Region requests the Bridge and Structures Asset Manager to provide status about whether a bridge is included in the 6-year or 20-year plans for replacement or rehabilitation under the P2 program and, if so, in which biennium the P2 project is likely to be funded. The criteria used by the Bridge and Structures office to evaluate the structural capacity of a bridge are as follows: 1. On National Highway System (NHS) routes (including Interstate routes): o The operating load rating is at least 36 tons (which is equal to HS-20). o The bridge is not permanently posted for legal weight vehicles. o The bridge is not permanently restricted for vehicles requiring overweight permits. 2. On non-NHS routes: o The bridge is not permanently posted for legal weight vehicles. o The bridge is not permanently restricted for vehicles requiring overweight permits. Include the Structural Capacity Report in the Project File (see Chapter 300).
720.03(2) Bridge Widths The Design Manual contains multiple chapters that provide geometric cross section criteria and procedures relevant to determining design element widths. See Chapter 1230 for a guide to chapters that provide geometric cross section element widths. While it is preferred not to alter the continuity of a roadway, there may be situations where providing a structure width more or less than the roadway approaching the structure is appropriate. All structures on city or county routes crossing over a state highway must conform to the Local Agency Guidelines. For structures involving railroads, contact the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison.

Bridges
720.03(3) Horizontal Clearance Horizontal clearance for structures is the distance from the edge of the traveled way to bridge piers and abutments, traffic barrier ends, or bridge end embankment slopes. Minimum distances for this clearance vary depending on the type of structure. (See Chapter 1239, Chapter 1600, and Chapter 1610 and the Bridge Design Manual for guidance on horizontal clearance.) For structures involving railroads, contact the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison.
720.03(4) Bridge Medians Designs for bridges on divided multilane highways often include the decision to join parallel bridges as one or build them as independent structures. There are several factors in this decision, such as in new corridor construction, phased construction of corridors, and the general median width of the divided highway. This section covers some common design considerations related to bridge medians. Advances in crash barriers and their applications have resulted in an expanded set of choices for bridge medians on divided highways. Modern barrier designs and applications have allowed for longer runs of traffic barrier, different barrier types, and bullnose guardrail designs for shielding the gap between parallel structures. These tools have reduced collisions with abrupt bridge ends as well as shielded the opening between bridges. Some highway corridors are initially planned as multilane divided highways but may be developed in logical, affordable phases and individual projects. This could result in an initial phase where a corridor may open as a two-lane rural highway used by both travel directions. A later phase could convert the facility to a divided highway, bringing with it the need for median separation. Consider the long-range plans when determining median widths for bridges. The photos in Exhibit 720-1 show a completed multilane highway where two separate bridges were ultimately constructed years apart and a new corridor underway where one bridge is now built. Joining two structures may not be the most cost-effective or sustainable solution for all projects. Coordinate with the Bridge and Structures Office and the local Maintenance Office when discussing options and concerns. For bridges on parallel horizontal and vertical alignments, practical considerations for joining two structures as one includes, but are not limited to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Phased development where one structure exists, and another is planned. Old and new structure types and compatibility (with phased corridor construction). Median width. Median barrier treatment options. Environmental contexts and regulations. Seismic conditions and load ratings. Bridge maintenance and inspection techniques: accessibility options and equipment for terrain in specific contexts. An open area between structures may be needed for bridge inspection. Skew angles and/or curvature of waterways or roadways beneath the structures. Economics. Historical/aesthetic value of existing bridges to remain in place.

Chapter 720
Bridges
If structures will not be joined, evaluate the median as described here: When there is a median gap between bridges of 6 inches or more, the Region PEO will evaluate whether or not the median gap needs to be screened. Address the potential for pedestrians on the bridge and if closing the median gap to less than 6 inches, or installing fencing, netting, or other elements to enclose the area between the bridges would be beneficial. Document this evaluation in the Basis of Design and Alternatives Comparison Table. Exhibit 720-1 Phased Development of Multilane Divided Highways
720.03(5) Vertical Clearance Vertical clearance is the critical height under a structure that will accommodate vehicular and rail traffic based on its design characteristics. This height is the least height available from the lower roadway surface (including usable shoulders) or the plane of the top of the rails to the bottom of the bridge. Usable shoulders are the design shoulders for the roadway and do not include paved widened areas that may exist under the structure. In addition to the following vertical clearance guidance, consider whether the corridor experiences overheight loads. Consider a vertical clearance such that it will not create a new “low point” in the corridor.
720.03(5)(a) Vertical Falsework Clearance for Bridges Over Highways Construction of new bridges and the reconstruction or widening of existing structures often requires the erection of falsework across the traveled way of a highway. The erection of this falsework can reduce the vertical clearance for vehicles to pass under the work area. The potential for collisions to occur by hitting this lower construction stage falsework is increased. 1. On all routes that require a 16.5-foot vertical clearance, maintain this same clearance for falsework vertical clearance. o On structures that currently have less than a 16.5-foot vertical clearance for the falsework envelope, maintain existing clearance. o On new structures, maintain the falsework vertical clearance at least to those of the minimum vertical clearances referenced below. 2. Any variance from the above must be approved by the Regional Administrator or designee in writing and made a part of the Project File.

720.03(5)(b) Minimum Clearance for New Structures For new structures, the minimum vertical clearances are as follows:
i Bridge Over a Roadway The minimum vertical clearance for a bridge over a roadway is 16.5 feet.
ii Bridge Over a Railroad Track The minimum vertical clearance for a bridge over a railroad track is 23.5 feet (see Exhibit 720-2). A lesser clearance may be negotiated with the railroad company based on certain operational characteristics of the rail line; however, any clearance less than 22.5 feet requires the approval of the Washington State Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) per WAC 480-60. Vertical clearance is provided for the width of the railroad clearance envelope. Coordinate railroad clearance issues with the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison.
iii Pedestrian Bridge Over a Roadway The minimum vertical clearance for a pedestrian bridge over a roadway is 17.5 feet. Exhibit 720-2 Highway Structure Over Railroad
Notes:
•
•
•
•
Use 22.5-foot vertical clearance for existing structures. Lesser vertical clearance may be negotiated (see Section 720.03(5)). Increase horizontal clearance when the track is curved. Coordinate railroad clearance issues with the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison.

Bridges
iv Water Crossing Structures When determining the vertical clearance beneath a bridge or inside a buried structure, there are two elements that must be considered. The first is freeboard above the hydraulic design flood, and the second is Maintenance Clearance. Freeboard is related to the hydraulic capacity of the structure and is required by state and federal guidance. Typically, all bridges and buried structures are required to have a minimum of 1-3 feet of Freeboard above the hydraulic design flood water surface elevation (see WSDOT Hydraulics Manual). The State Hydraulics Engineer determines the Freeboard, and it is documented in the Preliminary/Final Hydraulic Design Report (PHD/FHD). Approval from the State Hydraulics Engineer is required for any vertical clearance that is less than Freeboard. Maintenance Clearance is the distance from the highest ground elevation within the horizontal limits of the Hydraulic Width to the controlling top elevation. The State Hydraulics Engineer determines the Hydraulic Width, and it is documented in the Hydraulic Design Report. Providing Maintenance Clearance beyond the minimum Freeboard is beneficial for required monitoring and inspections, as well as any maintenance activities that may be required during the life of the structure. Generally, these activities include staff walking through the culvert, taking measurements and photographs, but could also involve the use of machinery within the structure limits. Clearances above the minimums that are driven by other contextual needs, are typically captured in the structure free zone (SFZ) height term. For each water crossing location, evaluate and document the type of activities that will be conducted in collaboration with Region Maintenance, Bridge Preservation, ESO/Stream Restoration Biologists, and other key stakeholders. Additionally, site specific considerations must be evaluated in order to determine the appropriate Maintenance Clearance. See Vertical Clearance Considerations Design Bulletin 2022-03 (wa.gov) for additional information and considerations when determining the preferred vertical clearance. In general, when no large objects are placed beneath the structure, use 6 feet as the initial Maintenance Clearance target. Design Instructions - Vertical Clearance Considerations Large objects, including boulders and large woody debris, under or inside water crossing structures are not allowed unless approved by the State Hydraulics Engineer. When large objects are approved to be placed beneath the structure, provide 10 feet minimum Maintenance Clearance. The ARA for Development approves vertical clearance where greater than or equal to the Freeboard and does not otherwise require a Design Analysis.
720.03(5)(c) Minimum Clearance for Existing Structures The criteria used to evaluate the vertical clearance for existing structures depend on the work being done on or under that structure. When evaluating an existing structure on the Interstate System, see Section 720.03(5)(e), Coordination. This guidance applies to bridge clearances over state highways and under state highways at interchanges. For state highways over local roads and streets, city or county vertical clearance requirements may be used as minimum design criteria. (See Exhibit 720-3 for bridge vertical clearances.)

Bridges
i Bridge Over a Roadway For a project that will widen an existing structure over a highway or where the highway will be widened under an existing structure, the vertical clearance can be as little as 16.0 feet on the Interstate System or other freeways or 15.5 feet on nonfreeway routes. An approved design analysis is required for clearance less than 16.0 feet on Interstate routes or other freeways and 15.5 feet on nonfreeway routes. For a planned resurfacing of the highway under an existing bridge, if the clearance will be less than 16.0 feet on the Interstate System or other freeways and 15.5 feet on nonfreeway routes, evaluate the following options and include in a design analysis request:
•
•
•
Pavement removal and replacement Roadway excavation and reconstruction to lower the roadway profile Providing a new bridge with the required vertical clearance
Reducing roadway paving and surfacing thickness under the bridge to achieve the minimum vertical clearance can cause accelerated deterioration of the highway and is not recommended. Elimination of the planned resurfacing in the immediate area of the bridge might be a short-term solution if recommended by the Region Materials Engineer (RME). Solutions that include milling the existing surface followed by overlay or inlay must be approved by the RME to ensure adequate pavement structure is provided. For other projects that include an existing bridge where no widening is proposed on or under the bridge, and the project does not affect vertical clearance, the clearance can be as little as 14.5 feet. For these projects, document the clearance in the Design Documentation Package. For an existing bridge with less than a 14.5-foot vertical clearance, an approved design analysis request is required.
ii Bridge Over a Railroad Track For an existing structure over a railroad track (see Exhibit 720-2), the vertical clearance can be as little as 22.5 feet. A lesser clearance can be used with the agreement of the railroad company and the approval of the Washington State Utilities and Transportation Commission. Coordinate railroad clearance issues with the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison.

720.03(5)(d) Signing Low-clearance warning signs are necessary when the vertical clearance of an existing bridge is less than 15 feet 3 inches. Refer to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and the Traffic Manual for other requirements for low-clearance signing.
720.03(5)(e) Coordination The Interstate System is used by the Department of Defense (DOD) for the conveyance of military traffic. The Military Traffic Management Command Transportation Engineering Agency (MTMCTEA) represents the DOD in public highway matters. The MTMCTEA has an inventory of vertical clearance deficiencies over the Interstate System in Washington State. Contact the MTMCTEA, through the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), if either of the following changes is proposed to these bridges:
•
•
A project would create a new deficiency of less than a 16.0-foot vertical clearance over an Interstate highway. The vertical clearance over the Interstate is already deficient (less than 16.0 feet) and a change (increase or decrease) to vertical clearance is proposed.
Coordination with MTMCTEA is required for these changes on all rural Interstate highways and for one Interstate route through each urban area.
720.03(6) Liquefaction Impact Considerations To determine the amount of settlement and the potential for the soil to flow laterally during the design level earthquake due to liquefaction, an analysis performed by the HQ Geotechnical Office is needed for each bridge project site location. The information collected is used by bridge engineers to determine the bridge’s capability to withstand the movement and loading in a seismic event and to explore other foundation mitigation options not necessitating total bridge replacement. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office, in collaboration with the HQ Geotechnical Office, evaluates bridgewidening projects involving liquefiable soils and recommends appropriate liquefaction mitigation. See the Bridge Design Manual LRFD for further information.
720.03(7) Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities When pedestrians or bicyclists are anticipated on bridges, provide facilities consistent with guidance in Chapter 1510, Chapter 1515, and Chapter 1520. For locations where pedestrian users are not anticipated, evaluate the potential for stranded motorists to become pedestrians, where they may have exited their vehicle after a breakdown or other emergency. The infrequent and random nature of these occurrences makes it difficult to identify locations with even a moderate probability of pedestrian exposure. Evolving programs and technologies such as incident response, personal cell phones, and ITS cameras have further reduced the probability of motorists becoming pedestrians. Investigate other methods of treatment such as pedestrian signing or other low-cost safety improvement measures. Document decisions in the Basis of Design.

720.03(8) Bridge Approach Slab Bridge approach slabs are reinforced concrete pavement installed across the full width of the bridge ends. They provide a stable transition from normal roadway cross section to the bridge ends, and they compensate for differential expansion and contraction of the bridge and the roadway. Bridge approach slabs are provided on all new bridges. If an existing bridge is being widened and it has an approach slab, slabs are required on the widenings. The region, with the concurrence of the State Geotechnical Engineer and the State Bridge Design Engineer, may decide to omit bridge approach slabs. Document decisions in the DDP.
720.03(9) Traffic Barrier End Treatment Plans for new bridge construction and bridge traffic barrier modifications include provisions for the connection of bridge traffic barriers to the longitudinal barrier approaching and departing the bridge. Indicate the preferred longitudinal barrier type and connection during the review of the bridge preliminary plan.
720.03(10) Bridge End Embankments The design of embankment slopes at bridge ends depends on several factors. The width of the embankment is determined not only by the width of the roadway, but also by the presence of traffic barriers, curbs, and sidewalks, all of which create the need for additional widening. Examples of the additional widening required for these conditions are shown in the Standard Plans. The end slope is determined by combining the recommendations of several technical experts within WSDOT. Exhibit 720-4 illustrates the factors taken into consideration and the experts involved in the process.
720.03(11) Bridge Slope Protection Slope protection provides a protective and aesthetic surface for exposed slopes under bridges. Slope protection is normally provided under:
•
•
•
•
Structures over state highways. Structures within an interchange. Structures over other public roads unless requested otherwise by the public agency. Railroad overcrossings if requested by the railroad.
Slope protection is usually not provided under pedestrian structures. The type of slope protection is selected at the bridge preliminary plan stage. Typical slope protection types are concrete slope protection, and rubble stone.
720.03(12) Slope Protection at Water Crossings The HQ Hydraulics Section determines the slope protection requirements for structures that cross waterways. The type, limits, and quantity of slope protection are shown on the bridge preliminary plan.

720.03(13) Bridge Fence The Washington State Patrol (WSP) classifies the throwing of an object from a highway structure as an assault, not an accident or collision. Therefore, records of these assaults are not contained in WSDOT’s crash databases. Contact the Region Traffic Engineer, RME’s office and the WSP for the history of reported incidents. Bridge fence might reduce the number of incidents but will not stop a determined individual at that location, or deter them from moving to other locations in the area. Enforcement provides the most effective deterrent and is typically the first approach used. Installing bridge fence is analyzed on a case-by-case basis at the following locations:
•
•
•
•
•
On existing structures where there is a history of multiple incidents of objects being dropped or thrown and where enforcement has not changed the situation. On new structures near schools, playgrounds, or areas frequently used by children not accompanied by adults. In urban areas on new structures used by pedestrians where surveillance by local law enforcement personnel is not likely. On new structures with walkways where experience on similar structures within a 1-mile radius indicates a need. On private property structures, such as buildings or power stations, subject to damage.
In most cases, installing bridge fence on a new structure can be postponed until there are indications of need. Submit all proposals to install bridge fence on structures to the State Design Engineer, for approval. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for approval to attach bridge fence to structures and for specific design and mounting details.
720.03(14) Contractor Supplied Designs for Buried Structures When utilizing a contractor supplied design for a buried structure in a design-bid-build Contract (see WSDOT Bridge Design Manual 8.3.3.A), provide for sufficient time from award to any construction windows to allow for design, review, and fabrication of the Buried Structure (typically up to 6 months). Determine any restrictions to be placed on the contractor in their selection of buried structure, headwall, wingwall, vehicle barrier, and fall protection types. Include sufficient information in the contract documents so that the contractor can properly execute the design (see Plans Preparation Manual 700.06(2)).
720.03(15) Maintenance Access (New Section 2023) Provide permanent maintenance access from the roadway to all scour countermeasures when a bridge abutment is supported by a deep foundation (e.g., piles, drilled shafts) and the foundation is designed assuming the soil protected by the scour countermeasures remain in place. Additional consideration may include adequate maintenance staging area(s). Design any necessary highway elements such as the road approach to the highway (see Chapter 1340), access gate(s), roadside safety hardware and other highway features in accordance with Design Manual guidance. The width, grade and other features associated with the maintenance access beyond the highway features are designed on a case-by-case basis to reflect the needs of the individual location and the area maintenance’s equipment and ability to conduct potential scour countermeasures repair work. The Assistant Region Administrator for Maintenance & Operations must concur with the design of the maintenance access beyond the roadway features.

The project’s required restoration, right of way, and environmental footprint may be impacted. For example, the access road will be planted with vegetation that can be infrequently mowed or is easily removed and restored following the scour countermeasure maintenance activities (see Roadside Manual 830.06(3)). To ensure impacts and other considerations associated with the maintenance access to the scour countermeasures are adequately addressed, coordinate with subject matter experts such as region hydraulics, region landscape architect, environmental coordinator, area maintenance, materials engineer, right of way and others when developing the maintenance access.
720.04 Coordination with US Coast Guard for Existing Bridges Existing bridges crossing navigable waters occasionally require construction or maintenance activities that impact navigation channels governed by USCG permits. See Federally regulated waters, US Coast Guard (USCG) section of - https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/environmental-guidance/wetlands-other-waters and See “Bridges” Section of Federal Navigation Regulations | Navigation Center (uscg.gov). For fixed span bridges, this may include construction or maintenance activities that infringe upon the horizontal and vertical navigation opening defined in the USCG permit. See Environmental guidance - Wetlands & other waters | WSDOT (US Coast Guard (USCG), For bridge work) For movable bridges, in addition to the above, this may also include adjustments to existing bridge opening operating notice and process as defined in current regulations. See Movable bridges on state routes | WSDOT (wa.gov). Because these impacts are temporary and are limited to the duration of the construction or maintenance activity, they do not affect or change the actual USCG bridge permit. However, such temporary adjustments still require coordination with the US Coast Guard early in the project design schedule. The primary responsibility for this contact and coordination lies with the Region Design Project Office. The scope of such coordination varies depending on the extent of the infringement into the defined horizontal or vertical navigation clearance opening, the extent of the change to the bridge operation notice or process as defined in current regulation, and the duration of the construction or maintenance activity. This coordination activity may require the Design Project Office to conduct a survey of waterway users or to perform other background information tasks requested by the US Coast Guard. Projects with more extensive impacts may lie outside the approval authority of the local USCG Commander and may require review and action by US Coast Guard HQ in Washington, DC. In all cases, the earlier in the design process that the Region Design Project Office initiates these coordination efforts, the more likely the USCG can complete their regulatory process without impacting the project schedule.

730.01 General The function of a retaining wall is to form a nearly vertical face through confinement and/or strengthening of a mass of earth or other bulk material. Likewise, the function of a reinforced slope is to strengthen the mass of earth or other bulk material such that a steep (up to 1H:2V) slope can be formed. In both cases, the purpose of constructing such structures is to make maximum use of limited right of way. The difference between the two is that a wall uses a structural facing, whereas a steep reinforced slope does not require a structural facing. Reinforced slopes typically use a permanent erosion control matting with low vegetation as a slope cover to prevent erosion. (See the Roadside Manual for more information.) To lay out and design a retaining wall or reinforced slope, consider the following items:
•
•
•
•

•
Functional classification Highway geometry Design Clear Zone requirements (see Chapter 1600) Amount of excavation required Traffic characteristics Constructability Impact to adjacent environmentally sensitive areas Impact to adjacent structures Potential added lanes

Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
730.01(1) Retaining Wall Classifications Retaining walls are generally classified as gravity, semigravity, nongravity cantilever, or anchored. The various wall types and their classifications are summarized in Exhibit 730-1 through Exhibit 730-6. a) Gravity Walls Gravity walls derive their capacity to resist lateral soil loads through a combination of dead weight and sliding resistance. Gravity walls can be further subdivided into rigid gravity walls, prefabricated modular gravity walls, and mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) gravity walls. Rigid gravity walls consist of a solid mass of concrete or mortared rubble, and they use the weight of the wall itself to resist lateral loads. Prefabricated modular gravity walls consist of interlocking soil or rock-filled concrete, steel, or wire modules or bins (such as gabions). The combined weight resists the lateral loads from the soil. MSE gravity walls use strips, bars, or mats of steel or polymeric reinforcement to reinforce the soil and create a reinforced soil block behind the face. The reinforced soil block then acts as a unit and resists the lateral soil loads through the dead weight of the reinforced mass. MSE walls may be constructed as fill walls, with fill and reinforcement placed in alternate layers to create a reinforced mass, or reinforcement may be drilled into an existing soil/rock mass using grouted anchor technology to create a reinforced soil mass (soil nail walls). b) Semigravity Walls Semigravity walls rely more on structural resistance through cantilevering action of the wall stem. Generally, the backfill for a semigravity wall rests on part of the wall footing. The backfill, in combination with the weight of the wall and footing, provides the dead weight for resistance. An example of a semigravity wall is the reinforced concrete wall provided in the Standard Plans. c) Nongravity Cantilever Walls Nongravity cantilever walls rely strictly on the structural resistance of the wall in which vertical elements of the wall are partially embedded in the soil or rock to provide fixity. These vertical elements may consist of piles (such as soldier piles or sheet piles), caissons, or drilled shafts. The vertical elements may form the entire wall face or they may be spanned structurally using timber lagging or other materials to form the wall face. d) Anchored Walls Anchored walls derive their lateral capacity through anchors embedded in stable soil or rock below or behind all potential soil/rock failure surfaces. Anchored walls are similar to nongravity cantilevered walls except that anchors embedded in the soil/rock are attached to the wall facing structure to provide lateral resistance. Anchors typically consist of buried or grouted soil/rock anchors. Reinforced slopes are similar to MSE walls in that they also use fill and reinforcement placed in alternate layers to create a reinforced soil mass. However, the face is typically built at a 1.2H:1V to 1H:2V slope. Rockeries (rock walls) behave to some extent like gravity walls. However, the primary function of a rockery is to prevent erosion of an oversteepened but technically stable slope. Rockeries consist of large, well-fitted rocks stacked on top of one another to form a wall. An example of a rockery and reinforced slope is provided in Exhibit 730-10.

730.03 Design Principles The design of a retaining wall or reinforced slope consists of the following principal activities:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Develop wall/slope geometry Provide adequate subsurface investigation Evaluate loads and pressures that will act on the structure Design the structure to withstand the loads and pressures Design the structure to meet aesthetic requirements Ensure wall/slope constructibility Coordinate with other design elements
The structure and adjacent soil mass also needs to be stable as a system, and the anticipated wall settlement needs to be within acceptable limits.
730.04 Design Requirements 730.04(1) Wall/Slope Geometry Wall/slope geometry is developed considering the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Geometry of the transportation facility itself Design Clear Zone requirements (see Chapter 1600) Flare rate and approach slope when inside the Design Clear Zone (see Chapter 1610) Right of way constraints Existing ground contours Existing and future utility locations Impact to adjacent structures
Impact to environmentally sensitive areasFor wall/slope geometry, also consider the foundation embedment and type anticipated, which requires coordination between the various design groups involved. Retaining walls are designed to limit the potential for snagging vehicles by removing protruding objects (such as bridge columns, light fixtures, or sign supports).

Page 730-3
Chapter 730
Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
Provide a traffic barrier shape at the base of a new retaining wall constructed 12 feet or less from the edge of the nearest traffic lane. The traffic barrier shape is optional at the base of the new portion when an existing vertical-faced wall is being extended (or the existing wall may be retrofitted for continuity). Depending on the application, precast or cast-in-place Single Slope Concrete Barrier with vertical back or Type 4 Concrete Barrier may be used for both new and existing walls except when the barrier face can be cast as an integral part of a new wall. Design analyses may be considered, but they require approval as prescribed in Chapter 300. A design analysis is not required where sidewalk exists in front of the wall or in other situations where the wall face is otherwise inaccessible to traffic.
730.04(2) Investigation of Soils All retaining wall and reinforced slope structures require an investigation of the underlying soil/rock that supports the structure. Chapter 610 provides guidance on how to complete this investigation. A soil investigation is an integral part of the design of any retaining wall or reinforced slope. The stability of the underlying soils, their potential to settle under the imposed loads, the usability of any existing excavated soils for wall/reinforced slope backfill, and the location of the groundwater table are determined through the geotechnical investigation.
730.04(3) Geotechnical and Structural Design The structural elements of the wall or slope and the soil below, behind, and/or within the structure are designed together as a system. The wall/slope system is designed for overall external stability as well as internal stability. Overall external stability includes stability of the slope the wall/reinforced slope is a part of and the local external stability (overturning, sliding, and bearing capacity). Internal stability includes resistance of the structural members to load and, in the case of MSE walls and reinforced slopes, pullout capacity of the structural members or soil reinforcement from the soil.
730.04(3)(a) Scour At any location where a retaining wall or reinforced slope can be in contact with water (such as a culvert outfall, ditch, wetland, lake, river, or floodplain), there is a risk of scour at the toe. This risk must be analyzed. Contact the HQ Geotechnical Office and HQ Hydraulics Office to determine whether a scour analysis is required.
730.04(4) Drainage Design One of the principal causes of retaining wall/slope failure is the additional hydrostatic load imposed by an increase in the water content in the material behind the wall or slope. This condition results in a substantial increase in the lateral loads behind the wall/slope since the material undergoes a possible increase in unit weight, water pressure is exerted on the back of the wall, and the soil shear strength undergoes a possible reduction. To alleviate this, adequate drainage for the retaining wall/slope needs to be considered in the design stage and reviewed by the region Materials Engineer during construction. The drainage features shown in the Standard Plans are the minimum basic requirements. Underdrains behind the wall/slope need to daylight at some point in order to adequately perform their drainage function. Provide positive drainage at periodic intervals to prevent entrapment of water. Native soil may be used for retaining wall and reinforced slope backfill if it meets the requirements for the particular wall/slope system. In general, use backfill that is free-draining and granular in nature. Exceptions to this can be made depending on the site conditions as determined by the Geotechnical Office of the Headquarters (HQ) Materials Laboratory.

Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
A typical drainage detail for a gravity wall (in particular, an MSE wall) is shown in Exhibit 730-11. Include drainage details with a wall unless otherwise recommended to be deleted by the Region Materials Engineer or HQ Geotechnical Office.
730.04(5) Aesthetics Retaining walls and slopes can have a pleasing appearance that is compatible with the surrounding terrain and other structures in the vicinity. To the extent possible within functional requirements and cost-effectiveness criteria, this aesthetic goal is to be met for all visible retaining walls and reinforced slopes. Aesthetic requirements include consideration of the wall face material, top profile, terminals, and surface finish (texture, color, and pattern). Where appropriate, provide planting areas and irrigation conduits. These will visually soften walls and blend them with adjacent areas. Avoid short sections of retaining wall or steep slope where possible. In higher walls, variations in slope treatment are recommended for a pleasing appearance. High continuous walls are generally not desirable from an aesthetic standpoint, because they can be quite imposing. Consider stepping high or long retaining walls in areas of high visibility. Plantings may be considered between wall steps. Approval by the State Bridge and Structures Architect is required on all retaining wall aesthetics, including finishes, materials, and configuration (see Chapter 950).
730.04(6) Constructability Consider the potential effect that site constraints might have on the constructability of the specific wall/slope. Constraints to be considered include but are not limited to site geometry, access, time required to construct the wall, environmental issues, and impact on traffic flow and other construction activities.
730.04(7) Coordination With Other Design Elements 730.04(7)(a) Other Design Elements Retaining wall and slope designs are to be coordinated with other elements of the project that might interfere with or impact the design or construction of the wall/slope. Also consider drainage features; utilities; luminaire or sign structures; adjacent retaining walls or bridges; concrete traffic barriers; and beam guardrails. Locate these design elements in a manner that will minimize the impacts to the wall elements. In general, locate obstructions within the wall backfill (such as guardrail posts, drainage features, and minor structure foundations) a minimum of 3 feet from the back of the wall facing units. Greater offset distances may be required depending on the size and nature of the interfering design element. If possible, locate these elements to miss reinforcement layers or other portions of the wall system. Conceptual details for accommodating concrete traffic barriers and beam guardrails are provided in Exhibit 730-12. Where impact to the wall elements is unavoidable, the wall system needs to be designed to accommodate these impacts. For example, it may be necessary to place drainage structures or guardrail posts in the reinforced backfill zone of MSE walls. This may require that holes be cut in the upper soil reinforcement layers or that discrete reinforcement strips be splayed around the obstruction. This causes additional load to be carried in the adjacent reinforcement layers due to the missing soil reinforcement or the distortion in the reinforcement layers.

The need for these other design elements and their impacts on the proposed wall systems are to be clearly indicated in the submitted wall site data so the walls can be properly designed. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office (or the Geotechnical Office for geosynthetic walls/slopes and soil nail walls) for assistance regarding this issue.
730.05 Guidelines for Wall/Slope Selection Wall/slope selection is dependent on:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Whether the wall/slope will be located primarily in a cut or fill (how much excavation/shoring will be required to construct the wall or slope). If located in a cut, the type of soil/rock present. The need for space between the right of way line and the wall/slope or easement. The amount of settlement expected. The potential for deep failure surfaces to be present. The structural capacity of the wall/slope in terms of maximum allowable height. The nature of the wall/slope application. Whether or not structures or utilities will be located on or above the wall. Architectural requirements. Overall economy.
730.05(1) Cut and Fill Considerations Due to the construction technique and base width required, some wall types are best suited for cut situations, whereas others are best suited for fill situations. For example, anchored walls and soil nail walls have soil reinforcements drilled into the in-situ soil/rock and are therefore generally used in cut situations. Nongravity cantilevered walls are drilled or cut into the in-situ soil/rock, have narrow base widths, and are also well suited to cut situations. Both types of walls are constructed from the top down. Such walls are also used as temporary shoring to allow other types of walls or other structures to be constructed where considerable excavation will otherwise be required. MSE walls and reinforced slopes, however, are constructed by placing soil reinforcement between layers of fill from the bottom up and are therefore best suited to fill situations. Furthermore, the base width of MSE walls is typically on the order of 70% of the wall height, which requires considerable excavation in a cut situation. Therefore, in a cut situation, base width requirements usually make MSE structures uneconomical and possibly unconstructible. Semigravity (cantilever) walls, rigid gravity walls, and prefabricated modular gravity walls are free-standing structural systems built from the bottom up, but they do not rely on soil reinforcement techniques (placement of fill layers with soil reinforcement) to provide stability. These types of walls generally have a narrower base width than MSE structures (on the order of 50% of the wall height). Both of these factors make these types of walls feasible in fill situations as well as many cut situations. Reinforced slopes generally require more room overall to construct than a wall because of the sloping face, but they typically are a feasible alternative to a combination wall and fill slope to add a new lane. Reinforced slopes can also be adapted to the existing ground contours to minimize excavation requirements where fill is placed on an existing slope. Reinforced slopes might also be a feasible choice to repair slopes damaged by landslide activity or deep erosion.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 730-6
Chapter 730
Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
Rockeries are best suited to cut situations as they require only a narrow base width, on the order of 30% of the rockery height. Rockeries can be used in fill situations, but the fill heights they support need to be kept relatively low. It is difficult to get the cohesive strength needed in granular fill soils to provide minimal stability of the soil behind the rockery at the steep slope typically used for rockeries in a cut (such as 1H:6V or 1H:4V). The key considerations in deciding which walls or slopes are feasible are the amount of excavation or shoring required and the overall height. The site geometric constraints are defined to determine these elements. Another consideration is whether or not an easement will be required. For example, a temporary easement might be required for a wall in a fill situation to allow the contractor to work in front of the wall. For walls in cut situations, especially anchored walls and soil nail walls, a permanent easement may be required for the anchors or nails.
730.05(2) Settlement and Deep Foundation Support Considerations Settlement issues, especially differential settlement, are of primary concern in the selection of walls. Some wall types are inherently flexible and can tolerate a great deal of settlement without suffering structurally. Other wall types are inherently rigid and cannot tolerate much settlement. In general, MSE walls have the greatest flexibility and tolerance to settlement, followed by prefabricated modular gravity walls. Reinforced slopes are also inherently very flexible. For MSE walls, the facing type used can affect the ability of the wall to tolerate settlement. Welded wire and geosynthetic wall facings are the most flexible and the most tolerant to settlement, whereas concrete facings are less tolerant to settlement. In some cases, after the wall settlement is complete, concrete facing can be placed such that the concrete facing does not limit the wall’s tolerance to settlement. Facing may also be added for aesthetic reasons. Semigravity (cantilever) walls and rigid gravity walls have the least tolerance to settlement. In general, total settlement for these types of walls needs to be limited to approximately 1 inch or less. Rockeries also cannot tolerate much settlement, as rocks can shift and fall out. Therefore, semigravity cantilever walls, rigid gravity walls, and rockeries are not used in settlement prone areas. If very weak soils are present that will not support the wall and are too deep to be overexcavated, or if a deep failure surface is present that results in inadequate slope stability, select a wall type capable of using deep foundation support and/or anchors. In general, MSE walls, prefabricated modular gravity walls, and some rigid gravity walls are not appropriate for these situations. Walls that can be pile-supported, such as concrete semigravity cantilever walls, nongravity cantilever walls, and anchored walls, are more appropriate for these situations.
730.05(3) Feasible Wall Heights and Limitations Feasible wall heights are affected by issues such as the capacity of the wall structural elements, past experience with a particular wall, current practice, seismic risk, long-term durability, and aesthetics. For height limitations, see Exhibit 730-1 through Exhibit 730-6.
730.05(4) Supporting Structures or Utilities Not all walls are acceptable to support other structures or utilities. Issues that are to be considered include the potential for the wall to deform due to the structure foundation load, interference between the structure foundation and the wall components, and the potential long-term durability of the wall system. Using retaining walls to support other structures is considered to be a critical application, requiring a special design.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 730
Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
In general, soil nail walls, semigravity cantilever walls, nongravity cantilever walls, and anchored walls are appropriate for use in supporting bridge and building structure foundations. In addition to these walls, MSE and prefabricated modular gravity walls may be used to support other retaining walls, noise walls, and minor structure foundations such as those for sign bridges and signals. On a project-specific basis, MSE walls can be used to support bridge and building foundations as approved by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. Consider the location of any utilities behind the wall or reinforced slope when making wall/slope selections. This is mainly an issue for walls that use some type of soil reinforcement and for reinforced slopes. It is best not to place utilities within a reinforced soil backfill zone because it will be impossible to access the utility from the ground surface without cutting through the soil reinforcement layers, thereby compromising the integrity of the wall. Sometimes utilities, culverts, pipe arches, and so on must penetrate the face of a wall. Not all walls and facings are compatible with such penetrations. Consider how the facing can be formed around the penetration so that backfill soil cannot pipe or erode through the face. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for assistance regarding this issue.
730.05(5) Facing Options Facing selection depends on the aesthetic and structural needs of the wall system. Wall settlement may also affect the feasibility of the facing options. More than one wall facing may be available for a given system. Consider the available facing options when selecting a particular wall.
730.05(5)(a) MSE Walls For MSE walls, facing options typically include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Precast modular panels. In some cases, full height precast concrete panels. Full height panels are generally limited to walls with a maximum height of 20 feet placed in areas where minimal settlement is expected. Welded wire facing. Timber facing. Shotcrete facing with treatment options that vary from a simple broom finish to a textured and colored finish. Segmental masonry concrete blocks. Cast-in-place concrete facing with various texturing options.
Plantings on welded wire facings can be attempted in certain cases. The difficulty is in providing a soil at the wall face that is suitable for growing plants and meets engineering requirements in terms of soil compressibility, strength, and drainage. If plantings in the wall face are attempted, use only small plants, vines, and grasses. Small bushes may be considered for plantings between wall steps. Larger bushes or trees are not considered in these cases due to the loads they can create on the wall face. Geosynthetic facings are not acceptable for permanent facings due to potential facing degradation when exposed to sunlight. For permanent applications, use some type of timber, welded wire, or concrete face for geosynthetic walls. Shotcrete, masonry concrete blocks, cast-in-place concrete, welded wire, or timber are typically used for geosynthetic wall facings.

Chapter 730
Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
730.05(5)(b) Soil Nail Walls Soil nail walls can use either architecturally treated shotcrete or a cast-in-place facia wall textured as needed to produce the desired appearance.
730.05(5)(c) Prefabricated Modular Gravity Walls For prefabricated modular gravity walls, the facing generally consists of the structural bin or crib elements used to construct the walls. For some walls, the elements can be rearranged to form areas for plantings. In some cases, textured structural elements might also be feasible. This is also true of rigid gravity walls, though planting areas on the face of rigid gravity walls are generally not feasible. The concrete facing for semigravity cantilever walls can be textured as needed to produce the desired appearance.
730.05(5)(d) Nongravity Cantilevered Walls For nongravity cantilevered walls and anchored walls, a textured cast-in-place or precast facia wall is usually installed to produce the desired appearance.
730.05(6) Cost Considerations Usually, more than one wall type is feasible for a given situation. Consider initial and future maintenance costs throughout the selection process, as the decisions made may affect the overall cost. For example, you may have to decide whether to shut down a lane of traffic to install a low-cost gravity wall system that requires more excavation room or use a more expensive anchored wall system that will minimize excavation requirements and impacts to traffic. In this case, determine whether the cost of traffic impacts and more excavation justifies the cost of the more expensive anchored wall system. Consider long-term maintenance costs when determining wall type. Decisions regarding aesthetics can also affect the overall cost of the wall system. In general, the least expensive aesthetic options use the structural members of the wall as facing (welded wire or concrete or steel cribbing or bins), whereas the most expensive aesthetic options use textured cast-in-place concrete facias. In general, concrete facings increase in cost in the following order: shotcrete, segmental masonry concrete blocks, precast concrete facing panels, full height precast concrete facing panels, and cast-in-place concrete facing panels. Special architectural treatments usually increase the cost of any of these facing systems. Special wall terracing to provide locations for plants will also tend to increase costs. Therefore, weigh the costs against the value of the desired aesthetics. Other factors that affect the costs of wall/slope systems include wall/slope size and length; access at the site and distance to the material supplier location; overall size of the project; and competition between wall suppliers. In general, costs tend to be higher for walls or slopes that are high, but short in length, due to lack of room for equipment to work. Sites that are remote or have difficult local access increase wall/ slope costs. Small wall/slope quantities result in high unit costs. Lack of competition between materials or wall system suppliers can result in higher costs as well. Some of the factors that increase costs are required parts of a project and are therefore unavoidable. Always consider such factors when estimating costs because a requirement may not affect all wall types in the same way. Current cost information can be obtained by consulting the Bridge Design Manual or by contacting the HQ Bridge and Structures Office.

Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
730.05(7) Summary For wall/slope selection, consider factors such as the intended application; the soil/ rock conditions in terms of settlement, need for deep foundations, constructibility, and impacts to traffic; and the overall geometry in terms of wall/slope height and length, location of adjacent structures and utilities, aesthetics, and cost. Exhibit 730-1 through Exhibit 730-6 provide a summary of many of the various wall/slope options available, including their advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. Note that specific wall types in the exhibits may represent multiple wall systems, some or all of which will be proprietary.
730.06 Design Responsibility and Process 730.06(1) General The retaining walls available for a given project include standard walls, nonstandard walls, and reinforced slopes. Standard walls are those walls for which standard designs are provided in the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Standard Plans. These designs are provided for reinforced concrete cantilever walls up to 35 feet in height. The internal stability design and the external stability design for overturning and sliding stability have already been completed for these standard walls. Determine overall slope stability and allowable soil bearing capacity (including settlement considerations) for each standard-design wall location. Nonstandard walls may be either proprietary (patented or trademarked) or nonproprietary. Proprietary walls are designed by a wall manufacturer for internal and external stability, except bearing capacity, settlement, and overall slope stability, which are determined by WSDOT. Nonstandard nonproprietary walls are fully designed by WSDOT. The geosynthetic soil reinforcement used in nonstandard nonproprietary geosynthetic walls is considered to be proprietary. It is likely that more than one manufacturer can supply proprietary materials for a nonstandard nonproprietary geosynthetic wall. Reinforced slopes are similar to nonstandard nonproprietary walls in terms of their design process.
730.06(1)(a) Preapproved Proprietary Walls Some proprietary wall systems are preapproved. Preapproved proprietary wall systems have been extensively reviewed by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office and the Geotechnical Office. Design procedures and wall details for preapproved walls have already been agreed upon between WSDOT and the proprietary wall manufacturers, allowing the manufacturers to competitively bid a particular project without having a detailed wall design provided in the contract plans. Note that proprietary wall manufacturers might produce several retaining wall options, and not all options from a given manufacturer have necessarily been preapproved. For example, proprietary wall manufacturers often offer more than one facing alternative. It is possible that some facing alternatives are preapproved, whereas others are not preapproved. WSDOT does not preapprove the manufacturer, but specific wall systems by a given manufacturer can be preapproved. It is imperative with preapproved systems that the design requirements for all preapproved wall alternatives for a given project be clearly stated so that the wall manufacturer can adapt the preapproved system to specific project conditions. For a given project, coordination of the design of all wall alternatives with all project elements that impact the wall is critical to avoid costly change orders or delays during construction.

Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
These elements include drainage features, utilities, luminaires and sign structures, noise walls, traffic barriers, guardrails, or other walls or bridges. In general, standard walls are the easiest walls to incorporate into project Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E), but they may not be the most cost-effective option. Preapproved proprietary walls provide more options in terms of cost-effectiveness and aesthetics and are also relatively easy to incorporate into a PS&E. Nonstandard state-designed walls and nonpreapproved proprietary walls generally take more time and effort to incorporate into a PS&E because a complete wall design needs to be developed. Some nonstandard walls (such as state-designed geosynthetic walls) can be designed relatively quickly, require minimal plan preparation effort, and only involve the region and the Geotechnical Office. Other nonstandard walls such as soil nail and anchored wall systems require complex designs, involve both the HQ Bridge and Structures Office and Geotechnical Office, and require a significant number of plan sheets and considerable design effort. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office maintains a list of the proprietary retaining walls that are preapproved. The region consults the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for the latest list. The region consults the HQ Geotechnical Office for the latest geosynthetic reinforcement list to determine which geosynthetic products are acceptable if a critical geosynthetic wall or reinforced slope application is anticipated.
730.06(1)(b) Experimental Wall Systems Some proprietary retaining wall systems are classified as experimental by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The HQ Bridge and Structures Office maintains a list of walls that are classified as experimental. If the wall intended for use is classified as experimental, a work plan is to be prepared by WSDOT and approved by the FHWA. An approved public interest finding, signed by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, is required for the use of a sole source proprietary wall.
730.06(1)(c) Gabion Walls Gabion walls are nonstandard walls that are to be designed for overturning, sliding, overall slope stability, settlement, and bearing capacity. A full design for gabion walls is not provided in the Standard Plans. Gabion baskets are typically 3 feet high by 3 feet wide, and it is typically safe to build gabions two baskets high (6 feet) but only one basket deep. This results in a wall base width of 50% of the wall height, provided soil conditions are reasonably good (medium-dense to dense granular soils are present below and behind the wall).
730.06(2) Responsibility and Process for Design A flow chart illustrating the process and responsibility for retaining wall/reinforced slope design is provided in Exhibit 730-13. As shown in the exhibit, the region initiates the process except for walls developed as part of a preliminary bridge plan. These are initiated by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. In general, it is the responsibility of the design office initiating the design process to coordinate with other groups in the department to identify all wall/slope systems that are appropriate for the project in question. Coordinate with the region and the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, Geotechnical Office, and State Bridge and Structures Architect as early in the process as feasible. Headquarters or region consultants, if used, are considered an extension of the Headquarters staff and must follow the process summarized in Exhibit 730-13. All consultant designs, from development of the scope of work to the final product, are to be reviewed and approved by the appropriate Headquarters offices.

Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
730.06(2)(a) Standard Walls The regions are responsible for detailing retaining walls for which standard designs are available. For standard walls greater than 10 feet in height, and for all standard walls where soft or unstable soil is present beneath or behind the wall, a geotechnical investigation will be conducted, or reviewed and approved, by the HQ Geotechnical Office. Through this investigation, provide the foundation design, including bearing capacity requirements and settlement determination, overall stability, and the selection of the wall types most feasible for the site. For standard walls 10 feet in height or less where soft or unstable soils are not present, it is the responsibility of the region Materials Laboratory to perform the geotechnical investigation. If it has been verified that soil conditions are adequate for the proposed standard wall that is less than or equal to 10 feet in height, the region establishes the wall footing location based on the embedment criteria in the Bridge Design Manual, or places the bottom of the wall footing below any surficial loose soils. During this process, the region also evaluates other wall types that may be feasible for the site in question. The Standard Plans provides design charts and details for standard reinforced concrete cantilever walls. The Standard Plans are used to size the walls and determine the factored bearing pressure to compare with the factored bearing resistance determined from the geotechnical investigation. The charts provide maximum soil pressure for the LRFD service, strength, and extreme event limit states. Factored bearing resistance for the LRFD service, strength, and extreme event limit states can be obtained from the HQ Geotechnical Office for standard walls over 10 feet in height and from the region Materials Laboratory for standard walls less than or equal to 10 feet in height. The Standard Plans can be used for the wall design if the factored bearing resistance exceeds the maximum soil pressure shown in the Standard Plans for the respective LRFD limit states. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office if the factored bearing resistance provided by the geotechnical investigation does not exceed the maximum soil pressure shown in the Standard Plans for one or all of the LRFD limit states. The wall is considered a nonstandard wall design and the Standard Plans cannot be used. If the standard wall must support surcharge loads from bridge or building foundations, other retaining walls, noise walls, or other types of surcharge loads, a special wall design is required. The wall is considered to be supporting the surcharge load and is treated as a nonstandard wall if the surcharge load is located within a 1H:1V slope projected up from the bottom of the back of the wall. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for assistance The Standard Plans provides eight types of reinforced concrete cantilever walls (which represent eight loading cases). Reinforced concrete retaining walls Types 5 through 8 are not designed to withstand western Washington earthquake forces and are not to be used in western Washington (west of the Cascade crest). Once the geotechnical and architectural assessments have been completed, the region completes the PS&E for the standard wall option(s) selected, including a generalized wall profile and plan, a typical cross section as appropriate, and details for desired wall appurtenances, drainage details, and other details as needed. Metal bin walls, Types 1 and 2, have been deleted from the Standard Plans and are therefore no longer standard walls. Metal bin walls are seldom used due to cost and undesirable aesthetics. If this type of wall is proposed, contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for plan details and toe bearing pressures. The applied toe bearing pressure will then have to be evaluated by the HQ Geotechnical Office to determine whether the site soil conditions are appropriate for the applied load and anticipated settlement.

Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
730.06(2)(b) Preapproved Proprietary Walls Final approval of preapproved proprietary wall design, with the exception of geosynthetic walls, is the responsibility of the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. Final approval of the design of preapproved proprietary geosynthetic walls is the responsibility of the HQ Geotechnical Office. It is the region’s responsibility to coordinate the design effort for all preapproved wall systems. The region Materials Laboratory performs the geotechnical investigation for preapproved proprietary walls 10 feet in height or less that are not bearing on soft or unstable soils. In all other cases, it is the responsibility of the HQ Geotechnical Office to conduct, or review and approve, the geotechnical investigation for the wall. The region also coordinates with the State Bridge and Structures Architect to ensure that the wall options selected meet the aesthetic requirements for the site. Once the geotechnical and architectural assessments have been completed and the desired wall alternatives selected, it is the responsibility of the region to contact the suppliers of the selected preapproved systems to confirm in writing the adequacy and availability of the systems for the proposed use. Include a minimum of three different wall systems in the PS&E for any project with federal participation that includes a proprietary wall system unless specific justification is provided. Standard walls can be alternatives. Once confirmation of adequacy and availability has been received, the region contacts the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for special provisions for the selected wall systems and proceeds to finalize the contract PS&E in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual. Provide the allowable bearing capacity and foundation embedment criteria for the wall, as well as backfill and foundation soil properties, in the Special Provisions. In general, assume that gravel borrow or better-quality backfill material will be used for the walls when assessing soil parameters. Complete wall plans and designs for the proprietary wall options will not be developed until after the contract is awarded, but will be developed by the proprietary wall supplier as shop drawings after the contract is awarded. Therefore, include a general wall plan; a profile showing neat line top and bottom of the wall; a final ground line in front of and in back of the wall; a typical cross-section; and the generic details for the desired appurtenances and drainage requirements in the contract PS&E for the proprietary walls. Estimate the ground line in back of the wall based on a nominal 1.5-foot facing thickness (and state this on the wall plan sheets). Include load or other design acceptance requirements for these appurtenances in the PS&E. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for assistance. It is best to locate catch basins, grate inlets, signal foundations, and the like outside the reinforced backfill zone of MSE walls to avoid interference with the soil reinforcement. In those cases where conflict with these reinforcement obstructions cannot be avoided, indicate the location(s) and dimensions of the reinforcement obstruction(s) relative to the wall on the plans. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for preapproved wall details and designs for size and location of obstructions and to obtain the generic details that are to be provided in the plans. If the obstruction is too large or too close to the wall face, a special design may be required to accommodate the obstruction, and the wall is treated as a nonpreapproved proprietary wall. A special design is required if the wall will support structure foundations, other retaining walls, noise walls, signs or sign bridges, luminaires, or other types of surcharge loads. The wall is considered to be supporting the surcharge load if the surcharge is located within a 1H:1V slope projected from the bottom of the back of the wall. For MSE walls, the back of the wall is considered to be the back of the soil reinforcement layers. If this situation occurs, the wall is treated as a nonpreapproved proprietary wall.

Chapter 730
Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
For those alternative wall systems that have the same face embedment criteria, the wall face quantities depicted in the plans for each alternative are to be identical. To provide an equal basis for competition, the region determines wall face quantities based on neat lines. Once the detailed wall plans and designs are available as shop drawings after contract award, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office will review and approve the wall shop drawings and calculations, with the exception of geosynthetic walls. They are reviewed and approved by the HQ Geotechnical Office.
730.06(2)(c) Nonpreapproved Proprietary Walls Final approval authority for nonpreapproved proprietary wall design is the same as for preapproved proprietary walls. The region initiates the design effort for all nonpreapproved wall systems by submitting wall plan, profile, cross section, and other information for the proposed wall to the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, with copies to the HQ Geotechnical Office and the State Bridge and Structures Architect. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office coordinates the wall design effort. Once the geotechnical and architectural assessments have been completed and the desired wall types selected, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office contacts suppliers of the selected nonpreapproved wall systems to obtain and review detailed wall designs and plans to be included in the contract PS&E. To ensure fair competition between all wall alternatives included in the PS&E, make the wall face quantities identical for those wall systems subject to the same face embedment requirements. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office develops the special provisions and cost estimates for the nonpreapproved proprietary walls and sends the wall PS&E to the region for inclusion in the final PS&E in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual.
730.06(2)(d) Nonstandard Nonproprietary Walls With the exception of rockeries over 5 feet high, nonproprietary geosynthetic walls and reinforced slopes, and soil nail walls, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office coordinates with the HQ Geotechnical Office and the State Bridge and Structures Architect to carry out the design of all nonstandard, nonproprietary walls. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office develops the wall preliminary plan from site data provided by the region, completes the wall design, and develops the nonstandard nonproprietary wall PS&E package for inclusion in the contract. For rockeries over 5 feet high, nonproprietary geosynthetic walls and reinforced slopes, and soil nail walls, the region develops wall/slope profiles, plans, and cross sections and submits them to the HQ Geotechnical Office to complete a detailed wall/slope design. For geosynthetic walls and slopes and for rockeries, the region provides overall coordination of the wall/slope design effort, including coordination with the State Bridge and Structures Architect regarding aesthetics and finishes, and the region or HQ Landscape Architect if the wall uses vegetation on the face. The HQ Geotechnical Office has overall approval authority for the wall design. Once the wall design has been completed, the HQ Geotechnical Office, and in some cases the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, provides geotechnical and structural plan details to be included in the region plan sheets and special provisions for the PS&E. The region then completes the PS&E package. For soil nail walls, once the HQ Geotechnical Office has performed the geotechnical design, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, in cooperation with the HQ Geotechnical Office, coordinates the design effort and completes the PS&E package.

730.06(3) Guidelines for Wall/Slope Data Submission for Design 730.06(3)(a) Standard Walls, Proprietary Walls, Geosynthetic Walls/Slopes, and Soil Nail Walls Where Headquarters involvement in retaining wall/slope design is required (as it is for standard walls and preapproved proprietary walls over 10 feet in height, gabions over 6 feet in height, rockeries over 5 feet in height, all nonpreapproved proprietary walls, geosynthetic walls/slopes, and all soil nail walls), the region submits the following information to the HQ Geotechnical Office or HQ Bridge and Structures Office as appropriate:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Wall/slope plans. Profiles showing the existing and final grades in front of and behind the wall. Wall/slope cross sections (typically every 50 feet) or InRoads files that define the existing and new ground line above and below the wall/slope and show stations and offsets. Location of right of way lines and other constraints to wall/slope construction. Location of adjacent existing and/or proposed structures, utilities, and obstructions. Desired aesthetics. Date design must be completed. Key region contacts for the project.
Note that for the purpose of defining the final wall geometry, it is best to base existing ground measurements on physical survey data rather than solely on photogrammetry. In addition, the region is to complete a Retaining Wall/ Reinforced Slope Site Data Check List, DOT Form 351-009 EF, for each wall or group of walls submitted.
730.06(3)(b) Nonstandard Walls, Except Geosynthetic Walls/Slopes and Soil Nail Walls In this case, the region is to submit site data in accordance with Chapter 710. Additionally, the region is to complete a Retaining Wall/Reinforced Slope Site Data Check List, DOT Form 351-009 EF, for each wall or group of walls.

Noise Barriers Exhibit 740-1 Standard Noise Wall Types
740.01 General The function of a noise barrier is to reduce traffic noise levels in adjoining areas. The noise abatement decisions are made during the environmental stage of project development, which is a highly interactive process. Before a noise barrier is designed, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) needs to be confident that there is significant need, a cost-effective and environmentally acceptable noise barrier, a source of funds, and acceptance by adjacent property owners, local governmental agencies, and the general public. Preliminary design information that may be found in the noise report includes:
•
•
•
•
•
Sources of noise. Noise receiver locations. Predicted level of noise reduction. Locations of existing and future noise ¬impacts along the project corridor. Barrier location and height recommendations based on what is feasible and reasonable.
Design of a noise barrier project is the result of a team effort coordinated by the Project Engineer. This chapter addresses the factors that are considered when designing a noise barrier and the associated procedures and documentation requirements.
740.02 Design The two basic types of noise barriers are the earth berm and the noise wall. An earth berm can be constructed to the full height required for noise abatement or to partial height in conjunction with a noise wall to reach the required height. A noise wall can be made of concrete, masonry, metal, wood, or other approved innovative products, and can be supported by spread, pile, shaft, or trench footings. Consideration of the noise report and the visual characteristics of adjacent land forms, vegetation, and structural elements (such as buildings, bridges, and retaining walls) will determine whether a proposed noise barrier might be berm, wall, or both. An earth berm is the primary alternative if the visual and environmental quality of the corridor will be preserved or enhanced and materials and right of way widths are available. (See the Roadside Manual for criteria for determining whether a vegetated earth berm is appropriate.) The region uses the noise report and other environmental documents (see the Environmental Manual) to help determine the location, exposure conditions, length, and height of the proposed noise barrier.

740.02(1) Earth Berm Berm slopes are a function of the material used, the attainable right of way width, and the desired visual quality. Slopes steeper than 2H:1V (3H:1V for mowing) are not recommended. Design the end of the berm with a lead-in slope of 10H:1V and curve it toward the right of way line. Refer to the Roadside Manual for guidance regarding vegetation on berms.
740.02(2) Noise Wall When feasible, to encourage competitive bidding, include several alternate noise wall designs in the contract and permit the contractor to submit alternate designs under the value engineering specification. There are noise wall designs in the Standard Plans. Additional designs are in various stages of development to become standard plans. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 740-2
Chapter 740
Noise Barriers
The draft-standard design sheets and other preapproved plans are available from the Headquarters (HQ) Bridge and Structures Office. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office also works with the regions to facilitate the use of other designs as bidding options. When a noise wall has ground elevations that are independent of the roadway elevations, a survey of ground breaks (or cross sections at 25 foot intervals) along the entire length of the wall is needed for evaluation of constructability and to assure accurate determination of panel heights. Size of openings (whether lapped, door, or gated) depends on the intended users. Agencies such as the local fire department can provide the necessary requirements. Unless an appropriate standard plan is available, such openings are designed and detailed for the project. When a noise wall is inside the Design Clear Zone, design its horizontal and vertical (ground elevation) alignment as if it were a rigid concrete traffic barrier. (See Chapter 1610 for maximum flare rates.) See Chapter 1600 for more information about Design Clear Zone. Provide a traffic barrier when a new noise wall is constructed within the Design Clear Zone. Installation of a traffic barrier is optional for a new wall when an existing wall is being extended (or the existing wall may be retrofitted with a barrier for continuity). For flare rates and approach slopes for concrete barriers, see Chapter 1610. Noise walls that provide a traffic barrier integrated in the design are available. Contact HQ Design for more information. To designate a standard noise wall, select the appropriate general special provisions (GSPs) and state the standard plan number, type, and foundation type. Wall type is a function of exposure and wind speed (see Exhibit 740-1). A geotechnical report identifying the angle of internal friction “f” and the allowable bearing pressure is needed for selection of a standard foundation. The standard spread footing designs require an allowable bearing pressure of 1 Tsf (Ton per square foot). The standard trench and shaft footing designs require an “f” of at least 32° for D1 and 38° for D2. A special design of the substructure is required for noise walls on substandard soil, where winds exceed 90 mph, and for exposures other than B1 and B2 as defined in Exhibit 740-1. For maintenance of the surface of a tall wall (10 feet or more), consider harness tie offs for the fall protection required by the Department of Labor and Industries. Exhibit 740-1 Standard Noise Wall Types

Wind speed is according to Figure 1-2.1.2.A of the (AASHTO) Guide Specifications for Structural Design of Sound Barriers. Assume the wind to be perpendicular to the wall on both sides and design for the most exposed side.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 740-3
Chapter 740
Noise Barriers
Exposure is determined by the nature of the immediately adjacent ground surface and the extension of a plane at the adjacent ground surface elevation for 1500 feet to either side of the noise wall:
•
•
•
Exposure B1 = Urban and suburban areas with numerous closely spaced obstructions having the size of single-family or larger dwellings that prevail in the upwind direction from the noise barrier for a distance of at least 1,500 feet. Exposure B2 = Urban and suburban areas with more open terrain not meeting the requirements of Exposure B1. Exposure C = Open terrain with scattered obstructions that includes flat, open country, grasslands, and elevated terrain.
*For a noise wall with Exposure C, on a bridge or overpass or at the top of a slope, consult the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, as a special design will probably be necessary.
740.03 Procedures The noise unit notifies the Project Engineer’s Office when a noise barrier is recommended in the noise report. The Project Engineer’s Office is responsible for interdisciplinary teams, consultation, and coordination with the public, noise specialists, maintenance, construction, region Landscape Architecture Office (or the HQ Roadside and Site Development Section), right of way personnel, Materials Laboratory, State Bridge and Structures Architect, HQ Bridge and Structures Office, CAE Support Team, HQ Development Services & Access Manager, consultants, and many others. If a noise wall is contemplated, the region evaluates the soils (see Chapter 610 and Chapter 710) and obtains a list of acceptable wall design options. The list is obtained by sending information pertaining to soils and drainage conditions, alignment, and height of the proposed wall to the State Bridge and Structures Architect. If a vegetated earth berm is considered, see the Roadside Manual for procedures. The State Bridge and Structures Architect coordinates with the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, HQ Hydraulics Section, HQ Geotechnical Office, and the region to provide a list of acceptable standard, draft-standard, and preapproved proprietary noise wall designs, materials, and finishes that are compatible with existing visual elements of the corridor. Only wall designs from this list may be considered as alternatives. Limit design visualizations of the highway side of proposed walls (available from the CAE Support Team in Olympia) to options from this list. The visual elements of the private property side of a wall are the responsibility of the region unless addressed in the environmental documents. After the noise report is completed, any changes to the ¬dimensions or location of a noise barrier must be reviewed by the appropriate noise unit to determine the impacts of the changes on noise abatement. On limited access highways, coordinate any opening in a wall or fence (for pedestrians or vehicles) with the HQ Development Services & Access Manager and obtain approval from the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division. On nonlimited access highways, an access connection permit is required for any opening (approach) in a wall or fence. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office provides special substructure designs to the regions upon request; reviews contract design data related to standard, draft-standard, and preapproved designs; and reviews plans and calculations that have been prepared by others (see Chapter 710).

Noise Barriers
Approval by the State Bridge and Structures Architect is required for any attachment or modification to a noise wall and for the design, appearance, and finish of door and gate-type openings. Approval by the State Bridge and Structures Architect is also required for the final selection of noise wall appearance, finish, materials, and configuration.

800.01 General This chapter is intended to serve as a guide to highway designers so they can identify and consider hydraulicrelated factors that impact design. Detailed criteria and methods that govern highway hydraulic design are in the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Hydraulics Manual and Highway Runoff Manual. Some drainage, flood, and water quality problems can be easily recognized and resolved; others might require extensive investigation before a solution is developed. The Project Engineer’s Office (PEO) should use good engineering judgment and be mindful of WSDOT’s legal and ethical obligations concerning hydraulic issues. The Hydraulics Manual explains WSDOT policy regarding hydraulic design and hydraulic reports; this chapter also includes roles and responsibilities and required documentation for hydraulic reports. Below is a summary of roles and responsibilities:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
PEO – responsible for the preparation of correct and adequate stormwater and drainage design. The work may be performed by WSDOT or a private consultant engineer but is overseen by the PEO. The PEO is also responsible for initiating the application for required hydraulic-related permits. Region Hydraulic Engineer (RHE) provide technical assistance to Scoping teams, Pre-Design teams, PEOs, WSDOT consultants, Maintenance, Developer Services and Local Programs. The roles and responsibilities of the RHE and HQ Hydraulics Section are outlined in the Hydraulics Manual. WSDOT Headquarters (HQ) Hydraulics Section – responsible for the preparation or oversight of all hydraulics Specialty reports as described in the Hydraulics Manual. While the PEO is responsible for preparation of reports, plans, specs, and estimate for all drainage facilities except bridges, assistance from the RHE and the HQ Hydraulics Section may be requested for any drainage facility design. Geotechnical – responsible for understanding the characteristics of the soil and rock materials that support or are adjacent to a transportation facility so that, when designed, constructed, and maintained, the facility will be adequate to safely carry the estimated traffic and to support hydraulic structures for stormwater and stream crossing designs, as set forth in the Geotechnical Design Manual. Bridge – responsible for delivering or coordinating bridge design calculation and plans per WSDOT Bridge Design Procedure and the Bridge Design Manual; review consultant and contractor designed structures; acts as the subject matter expert for structural issues; assure that the most cost-effective and appropriate structure type is selected for a particular bridge site. Pre-Design Team – consists of engineering, environmental, utilities, real estate, geotechnical, bridge and structures staff for coordination prior to beginning preliminary design. The Pre-Design Guidance for Fish Passage Projects document contains helpful links and provides guidance for pre-design. Design Team – the team of designers, checkers, engineers, and architects responsible for design and preparation of the contract documents for construction.

800.02 Coordination with Other Specialty Groups For the design and construction of structures, walls, and roadway embankments in the vicinity of waterbodies, early and often coordination with specialty groups, along with coordination at key check-in points throughout the project delivery process is critical for the efficient delivery of a project. In Exhibit 800-1 through Exhibit 800-3, the pre-design team/project engineering office (PEO) includes, environmental, survey, utilities, right of way and other groups to support the project. The coordination for the design and construction of structures, walls, and roadway embankments in the vicinity of waterbodies is only one component of many that the delivery team needs to consider within the entire PS&E process. Exhibit 800-1 through Exhibit 800-3 provide a series of flow charts to illustrate the process and timing throughout the project delivery process (e.g., pre-design through construction) for the minimum level of coordination between the following groups: pre-design team, design team, bridge, geotechnical, hydraulics, WSDOT maintenance office, and the WSDOT construction office. Exhibit 800-1 is a flow chart for specialty group coordination during pre-design, resulting in a structure free zone (SFZ) determined collaboratively by the pre-design team, hydraulics, geotechnical, and bridge. This SFZ shall be used for the next steps in design or development of design-build documentation. To determine the SFZ, early coordination between the pre-design team, geotechnical, and hydraulics for identifying potential risks such as total scour, seismic conditions, and unstable slopes is important to reduce the potential for unaccounted costs later in design or construction. Coordination between the geotechnical and hydraulic engineers is necessary to obtain data as part of the geotechnical scoping memo/package for determining total scour and the need for scour countermeasures, which may affect the SFZ at the pre-design phase. For design-build, the information determined during the pre-design phase is used to assist in preparing the design-build documentation. For a design-bid-build, the design team determines if the structure and walls will be contractor supplied design (Exhibit 800-2) or designed by a bridge and geotechnical engineer as part of the PS&E (Exhibit 800-3). Exhibit 800-2 is a flow chart when the design team determines the crossing structure will be designed through a contractor supplied design method. The starting point for Exhibit 800-2 is after the SFZ is determined during predesign. Since the structure will be designed by the contractor, the design team shall provide preliminary structures plans. The geotechnical engineer completes the geotechnical data required for the substructure design and coordinates with the hydraulic engineer to make sure there will be sufficient geotechnical data to assess preliminary total scour. After completion of the geotechnical substructure design, the design team, geotechnical engineer, and hydraulic engineer coordinate to determine if the preliminary structure span and substructure types are feasible for the calculated scour depths. If the structure span is feasible, a final geotechnical report and final hydraulic design report (FHD) are completed. If the structure span is not feasible, additional structure types and sizes are evaluated. Coordination continues through PS&E to make sure the contract is in compliance with the design. Once a contract is awarded, the Region construction office coordinates with the design team, geotechnical engineer, and hydraulic engineer for review of Type 3E working drawings and other various submittals. The Region construction office shall coordinate with the HQ Hydraulics office for all stream and restoration construction components of the design. Exhibit 800-3 is a flow chart is for the structure design process. The starting point for Exhibit 800-3 is after the SFZ is determined during pre-design. The design team coordinates with the bridge engineer, geotechnical engineer, and hydraulic engineer to complete the various Bridge Design Manual (BDM) forms for site data, stream crossing, and other various geotechnical and hydraulics information. This information will be part of the bridge site data packet. After structure preliminary plans are completed, the geotechnical engineer completes the geotechnical data required for the substructure design and coordinates with the hydraulic engineer to make sure there will be sufficient geotechnical data to assess preliminary total scour.

Chapter 800
Hydraulic Design
After completion of the geotechnical substructure design, the design team, bridge engineer, geotechnical engineer, and hydraulic engineer coordinate to determine if the preliminary structure span and substructure types are feasible. If feasible, a final geotechnical report and final hydraulic design (FHD) are completed. If not feasible, alternative structure types are evaluated. Coordination continues through PS&E to make sure the contract is compliant with the design. The Region construction office coordinates with the PEO, HQ Geotechnical office, HQ Hydraulics office, and the HQ Bridge and Structures office for review of various submittals. The Region construction office shall coordinate with the HQ Hydraulics office for all stream construction and restoration.
800.03 Hydraulic Design Process The overall Hydraulic Design Process includes Scoping, Pre-Design, and Design. To allow the most efficient hydraulic report review and assessment, PEOs shall follow the hydraulic review process outlined in Section 1-5 and Figure 1-1 of the Hydraulics Manual. Figure 1-1 has been revised for this Design Manual Chapter and is shown here in Exhibit 800-4. All projects are required to complete a hydraulic assessment. During the Scoping phase, all WSDOT projects shall complete a stormwater and hydraulic assessment. Scoping instructions can be found online under Tools, Templates, and Links on the HQ Hydraulics website. This assessment’s goal is to discuss the following:
•
•
•
•
Does the project have existing stormwater and hydraulic deficiencies within the project limits? If so, assess and discuss the risk of the project not addressing these deficiencies. Does the project’s impacts or modifications make existing stormwater and hydraulic conditions worse? Does the project’s impacts or modifications create new stormwater and hydraulic issues that need to be addressed? Are there any stormwater retrofit opportunities within the project limits?
In many cases, the stormwater assessment may lead the project to create a hydraulic report. On certain types of projects, the stormwater and hydraulic assessment may be very brief if the impacts are minor, there are not any existing stormwater and hydraulic deficiencies within the project limits, and there are not any stormwater retrofit opportunities within the project limits. For example, a “paver” project may have a very brief stormwater and hydraulic assessment since the work is typically limited to just replacing the existing pavement. The Region Hydraulics Engineer shall review each stormwater and hydraulic assessment to determine the appropriate action and documentation necessary to support the project. There are three types of Hydraulic Reports: Specialty Report, Hydraulic Report Type A, and Hydraulic Report Type B. All reports developed for WSDOT must be reviewed and receive concurrence; Specialty Reports and Type A Hydraulic Reports require concurrence by the HQ Hydraulics Section, while a Type B Hydraulic Report only requires concurrence by the RHE. For some regions, HQ Hydraulics has delegated concurrence authority for Type A Hydraulic Report to the RHE. For design-bid-build projects, concurrence is required prior to the project advertisement date. For design-build projects, the identified concurring RHE or HQ Hydraulics Section engineer shall be involved in developing the scope and the Request for Proposal and reviewing conceptual hydraulics reports. The Hydraulics Manual discusses Hydraulic Reports, including a definition of the report types, descriptions, and respective concurrence requirements by RHE and/or HQ Hydraulics Section. PEOs shall contact the RHE to determine the hydraulic report review process. For more info regarding milestones and scheduling, see the Hydraulics Manual.

Hydraulic Design
800.04 Floodplain Management Encroachment of a highway or highway facility into a floodplain might present significant problems and requires an investigation for further action. A thorough investigation includes the following:
•
•
•
•
•
The effect of the design flood on the highway or highway facility and the required protective measures. The effect of the highway or highway facility on the upstream and downstream reaches of the stream and the adjacent property. Compliance with hydraulic-related environmental concerns and hydraulic aspects of permits from other governmental agencies per Chapter 225 of the Design Manual. Addressing requirements in Chapter 432 of the Environmental Manual. Compliance with floodplain requirements for non water-crossing projects per the Hydraulics Manual.
A Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) is required for all water crossing projects. WSDOT has developed a template for completing an FRA which serves as communication tool for identifying potential risks of meeting (1) FEMA, (2) local jurisdiction, and (3) public health and safety in the preliminary stages of design. The FRA helps to identify subsequent deliverables that may be needed for the permitting process. Once the Preliminary Hydraulic Design (PHD) is complete (or near completion) an FRA shall be completed and reviewed by HQ Hydraulics Section. The FRA is then provided to the PEO to be used to communicate with local communities and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) about potential flood risks associated with the proposed project. The FRA will also help determine the likelihood of needing to complete a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) based on the selected alternative documented in the PHD. The FRA is intended to help determine if the project may require a CLOMR, easements, right-of-way acquisition (or other critical path tasks) early in the project delivery process; these critical path items can have large impacts on the project schedule and should thus be coordinated early in the process. It is also intended that the FRA, along with the PHD, be used as reference documents for design build. The FRA is further discussed in the Hydraulics Manual. Projects proposed within a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) and other floodplain management additional requirements are found in Chapter 432 of the Environmental Manual.
800.05 Water Crossings Chapter 7 of the Hydraulics Manual covers the design requirements for water crossings on state highways. All fish-bearing water crossings within Washington State must meet the requirements of WAC’s Hydraulic Code Rules and the requirements of the Hydraulics Manual. WSDOT and WDFW have cooperated in a Fish Passage Barrier Removal program since 1991. To determine if a water crossing is within a fish bearing stream, PEOs can check the WSDOT fish barrier database or contact the HQ Environmental Services Office to determine if there are fish barriers within the limits of the proposed project. New water crossings (e.g., bridges and culverts) must be designed to meet current fish passage standards and WAC to ensure they do not hinder fish use or migration. HQ Hydraulics oversees the preparation of Preliminary and Final Hydraulic Design (PHD and FHD) for fish passage projects. Refer to Exhibit 800-5 for a flow chart describing the PHD Stream Design Process.
800.06 Safety Considerations Locate culvert ends outside the Design Clear Zone when feasible. (See Section 1600.03(2)(c) for roadside safety and hydraulic considerations with the design clear zone.)

Roadsides
900.01 General 900.02 Project Development 900.03 Documentation 900.04 References
900.01 General The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) recognizes roadsides as an asset. WSDOT is committed to highway designs that meet the transportation needs in a way that reduces the potential for fatal and injury crashes, is cost-effective, ecologically appropriate, context appropriate, and maintainable by managing roadsides that balance the natural and environmental functions within the right of way. The roadside integrates natural processes and visual continuity into the built (roadway) environment, preserving and promoting these natural and environmental functions. Highway projects achieve this integration through introduction and configuration of specific design elements such as structures, vegetation, signs, pedestrian and bicycle movement, erosion control, stormwater treatment facilities, etc. Develop highway designs in accordance with the criteria provided in the current version of WSDOT Roadside Policy Manual (RPM). Use guidance provided in the WSDOT Roadside Manual (RM), where appropriate, when implementing the provisions of the RPM. Provide coordination and engagement with WSDOT partners when designing roadsides. Also refer to the RM when addressing design issues such as law and policy, soil bioengineering, contour grading, vegetation, irrigation, etc. These manuals can be found at: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/roadside-development-facilities. On non-limited access highways in incorporated cities and towns having a population greater than 30,000 certain requirements of the WSDOT Roadside Policy Manual and Roadside Manuals apply. In these cases, the city or town has responsibility for and provides maintenance of those areas beyond the curb (including a median area if present), and if no curb is installed, beyond that portion of the highway used for highway purposes. Early communication and roadside plan reviews between WSDOT region landscape architects and the City is essential to document impacts to existing assets like established trees and to determine tree replacement based on impacts per Chapter 2 of the Roadside Policy Manual. Early WSDOT review of restoration plans enable local agencies to design and maintain roadsides consistent with surrounding corridor aesthetics and context. For areas located behind the curb or beyond that portion used for highway purposes, the City shall provide a signed maintenance agreement and/or public art plan (See Section 950.06) showing the exact design and the planned maintenance items and timing of work per Chapter 5 and 6 of the Roadside Policy Manual, that the City is responsible for.
900.02 Project Development 900.02(1) Region Landscape Architect The region Landscape Architect is responsible for the following:
•
•
•
Designs, supervises, has approval authority over, and stamps plans for wetland mitigation, roadside restoration, and revegetation. Coordinates the visual elements within highway corridors, in conjunction with the State Bridge and Structures Architect. Designs and supervises other roadside work, such as site design for park & ride lots or safety rest areas, to ensure roadside restoration is designed and constructed to WSDOT guidelines and standards.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 900-1
Chapter 900
•
•
Roadsides
Provides visual discipline reports for environmental documentation. Assists the region in completing the plant establishment phase of projects.
The Headquarters (HQ) Roadside and Site Development Section will provide roadside and mitigation design, visual impact assessment, and construction inspection work for the project offices in regions without a Landscape Architect. Refer to the Project Management Guide for further descriptions of the roles and responsibilities of project teams.
900.02(2) Roadside Restoration Projects There are typically two types of roadside restoration projects pertaining to vegetation-related roadway construction projects: regulatory and restoration.
900.02(2)(a) Regulatory The first type of project is work related to regulatory or permit requirements. Examples are wetland mitigation work or Hydraulic Permit Approvals (HPAs). This work typically must occur by the time the impacting project is complete.
900.02(2)(b) Restoration The second type of project is the restoration of construction impacts to roadside functions to meet the WSDOT policy requirements outlined in the Roadside Policy Manual.
900.02(3) Stand-Alone Project or Part of Roadway Construction? Roadside restoration work should be evaluated by the design team to determine whether it will be most efficient as part of the roadway construction contract or as a separate stage contract.
900.02(3)(a) Roadway Construction Contract The benefits of roadside restoration during roadway construction include the following:
•
•
•
All work can be done under one contract. The restoration can be completed without waiting for a new contract to be let and administered. Plant establishment can often begin sooner.
900.02(3)(b) Separate Stage Project A separate stage contract provides the following opportunities because it would be done when road construction is completed:
•
•
•
If construction impacts are different than originally anticipated, the restoration contract can be changed. For example, if disturbance is minimized, fewer plants and soil amendments may be needed. The site can be watched to see how the grading and hydrology interact before plants are planted. The prime contractor can be someone who specializes in roadside work.
900.02(4) Plant Establishment Plant establishment periods are included as part of roadside restoration and on all environmental mitigation projects.
•
A minimum of three years of plant establishment work is required for all planted areas in western Washington and planted and/or seeded areas in eastern Washington.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 900-2
Chapter 900

•
•
Roadsides
In situations where it is important to provide a full cover of vegetation to achieve the environmental or operational functions, five years of plant establishment may be needed. If the plant establishment period will last longer than three years on a roadside restoration contract, discussion should occur with Program Management to request and justify additional funding. In an environment that uses woody plants, plant establishment may take up to 10 years for the woody vegetation to exclude weeds and reach a condition with the lowest life cycle cost. Regulatory aspects of projects can require 10 years of plant establishment to ensure the standards of success outlined in the permit, although aggressive weed control and favorable weather can allow sites to close out early.
The goal is to give WSDOT Maintenance a site that is nearly self-sustaining after the plant establishment period is complete.

950.01 General Public art is an enhancement to a functional element, feature, or place within a transportation corridor to provide visual interest. The enhancement could be an addition to a functional element, integrated into a design, implemented as a form of community-identified mitigation or for purely aesthetic purposes. An element is considered “public art” if it is beyond WSDOT standard practice for architectural treatment. There has been a growing interest on the part of communities to use art within the transportation facilities of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). While public art can be a form of communityidentified mitigation for a project’s impacts, it can also be implemented as a standalone element. Public art can be used to provide visual interest along roadsides, make unique statements about community character, and create a positive public response that will last over time. Proponents for public art might be local agencies, engaged citizens’ groups, and representatives of impacted overburdened and vulnerable populations with interest in the outcome of a WSDOT project. The environmental and Community Engagement processes offer opportunities for community partnership on the visual and aesthetic qualities of a corridor. These processes also provide an opportunity to identify the need and form of potential community-identified mitigation measures (as required by federal and state law) that can address a project’s potential negative impacts to local communities, including environmental justice communities. Any potential community-identified mitigation must be reasonable, relative to the project’s impact and negotiated in good faith with the affected community. The public art policy in this chapter is intended to: provide guidance for managing public art on WSDOT facilities and within its rights of way; reinforce the existing policy in the Roadside Policy Manual; designate appropriate locations for the incorporation of public art features; and provide for the consistent use of statewide development, review, and approval processes on new and existing features. The community-identified mitigation elements within this chapter are intended to provide broader understanding of obligations under Federal and State law to mitigate for project impacts to communities and possible forms of mitigation for these impacts. The appropriateness of public art is frequently dependent upon its location and composition. For example, an art piece or feature chosen for the back side of a noise wall, at a safety rest area, or along a bike path may not be suitable at the end of a freeway ramp or along the main line of a highway. In addition to appropriate placement, WSDOT must balance the requests for proposed public art projects with the need to provide corridor continuity, improve the unity of highway elements, and provide roadsides that do not divert motorists’ attention from driving. While some local jurisdictions dedicate a percentage of their project budgets for art, WSDOT has no such dedicated funding.

Public Art
Section 40 of the State Constitution specifies that gas tax money must be used for a “highway purpose.” Therefore, public art beyond WSDOT standard design is typically funded by communities or other entities outside of WSDOT. However, public art as community-identified mitigation or other forms of communitymitigation outlined below, associated with project impacts are identified through NEPA/SEPA processes and may be funded by WSDOT. When city or community entrance markers are proposed, this policy should be used in conjunction with the guidance contained in Chapter 1600, Roadside Safety, the Traffic Manual, and the Roadside Policy Manual.

Limited to existing structures. No new overhead structures will be added to allow city entrance markers. Cannot be placed on structures with existing traffic control devices such as signals, guide signs, warning signs, regulatory signs, or variable message signs. The requesting agency enters into an airspace lease for use of WSDOT right-of-way. The airspace lease must include the removal of the item after its useful life and indicate the requesting agency is responsible for all cost for plan review, design, construction, maintenance, repair (including vandalism or damage), and damage to WSDOT property as the result of construction, maintenance, or repair. The proposed design meets Bridge & Structure Office design criteria on loading and clearance and is consistent with current WSDOT structural design details. The Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for review and approved of the design prior to installation. Display the name of a city only. Must be near or inside city limits. No phone numbers or web links can be displayed on the entrance marker. The entrance marker cannot be made of a material that has a short lifespan (such as a fabric or canvas banner) or requires routine maintenance. Maintenance of lighting is allowed during the lifespan. Should be centered on the direction of travel side of the structure. Distance from other existing traffic control signs both upstream and downstream must be at least 500 feet. Sight distance is not restricted. WSDOT will inspect the entrance marker as part of the bridge inspection program. The requesting agency is also responsible for all cost associated with addressing items found during the inspection. Once the need for maintenance is determined, the items must be addressed within 90 days of notification. Otherwise, the entrance marker will be repaired or removed by the WSDOT at the cost of the requesting agency. Must be relocated or removed by WSDOT at the cost of the requesting agency if the WSDOT structure is removed, rebuilt, needed for traffic control signing, or relocated, as directed by WSDOT. Requesting agency is also responsible for damages to the structure due to placement or maintenance of the city marker. No additional items may be attached to or hung from the display after approval. Any such items must be removed by the requesting agency. Does not obstruct pedestrian or cyclist’s clearance, visibility, and/or stopping sight distance. The city entrance marker has no moving parts, lights, design, or materials that may create glare or distraction. Decorative accents may be allowed but cannot be distracting to drivers per Section 950.04(2). Muted, non-MUTCD sign related colors may be used. Approval of the entrance marker is granted through the Public Art Plan process.

950.05 Community-Identified Mitigation Community-identified mitigation measures that address direct transportation impacts (as required by Federal and State laws) are commitments developed through the NEPA/SEPA process. These types of mitigation measures are different from proposals that go through the public art process. Community-identified mitigation measures are developed through extensive community engagement where the Department determines reasonable project related mitigation through good faith negotiations with the affected community. These reasonable mitigation measures5 must be appropriate relative to the project’s level of impact on the affected community. Refer to the Environmental Manual Chapters 458, 459 and 460 for policy direction that support mitigating project impacts to the human environment (community) and natural environment through the NEPA/SEPA process.
950.06 Process and Project Delivery Timing Begin the development and review of public art or community-identified mitigation early in the design process and conduct subsequent reviews during the course of its development. Do not include public art as a change order or addendum to a project without first having gone through the process described in this policy. A public art plan is developed to incorporate public art into projects on state highways. Include the review of the public art plan by the Public Art Specialty Services Team in project reviews (See 950.06(2)).

1010.01 General Addressing work zone impacts to all road users is an important component in the design of a project and needs to be given adequate consideration early in the design process. Most work zones create some level of traffic impacts and require additional safety features; therefore, identify and address all work areas and operations needed for construction during the project design. Planners, designers, construction engineers, maintenance personnel, and others all play a role in developing a comprehensive work zone design. There is no “cookbook” solution to work zone design. Work zone design is based on general guidance and best practices; however, effective work zone design requires innovation, adaptation, and ingenuity and is as much art as science. This chapter provides the designer with guidance to develop comprehensive work zone strategies and plans to address a project’s safety and mobility benefits/improvements for all modes, as well as constructability. A systematic process for addressing work zone impacts is required by federal regulations and state policy.
1010.02 Work Zone Design Strategy Meeting & Statement (New Section 2023) In the Scoping phase, a Work Zone Design Strategy Meeting shall be held with Region Transportation Operations (“Region Traffic”) and other critical attendees including, but not limited to: Bridge, Construction, Maintenance, Rail, Freight and Ports, Public Transportation, Active Transportation, Local Agencies, and Law Enforcement as appropriate. Participation in the conference will help develop work zone mitigation strategies that address the needs of the various divisions and road users while establishing an understanding for the project’s initial work zone direction. A Work Zone Strategy Statement shall be developed by Project Development and submitted to Region Transportation Operations Office for acceptance early in design (30% to 60%). The accepted Work Zone Strategy Statement shall be included in the Project Development’s Project Summary. It is meant to be a high-level, concise overview of the projects proposed overall work zone mitigation and shall include the following information as a minimum:
•
•
•
•
Whether the project is classified as significant or non-significant Anticipated work zone traffic control strategies, closures, and staging configurations Concurrence from Region Transportation Operations on any anticipated proposed regulatory speed limit reduction and/or advisory speeds An explanation/justification for any proposed high-impact closures or restrictions.

1010.03 Transportation Management Plans and Significant Projects 1010.03(1) Transportation Management Plan (TMP) A transportation management plan is a set of strategies such as Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) strategies (such as dynamic lane merge, dynamic speed control, or Smart Work Zone Systems) for managing the corridor-wide work zone impacts of a project. A TMP is required for all projects and is the key element in addressing known work zone safety and mobility impacts. The TMP development begins in the scoping phase of a project by assessing impacts known at the time and then selecting mitigating strategies and design solutions to manage those impacts. It is very important to continue the development of the TMP throughout the project development process. Not all work zone impacts have to be addressed with traffic control plans only. Many work zone impacts can be reduced or eliminated through project design elements like alignment choice, materials selection, structure types, overbuilding, and phased construction. Work zone impacts related to work duration may be resolved or reduced through innovative bidding and contract administration. For design-bid-build projects, the TMP is developed by Design and reviewed/approved by Region Transportation Operations Office. For design-build projects, WSDOT may begin a preliminary TMP during Scoping and Project Development, but the TMP is completed by the Design-Builder and approved per the requirements of the RFP. A TMP may include temporary modification to design elements outside the ranges discussed in the Design Manual. For example, a work zone may temporarily reduce lane and shoulder widths. These temporary design elements are justified and documented in the TMP. They do not require a Design Analysis. The three major components of a TMP are described in Section 1010.04(4).
1010.03(1)(a) Temporary Traffic Control Temporary Traffic Control (TTC) components are those strategies for directing traffic through the work zone and minimizing the duration of the impacts. These components are to be included in the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) as Traffic Control Plans (TCPs) and contract provisions. The TTC components may include but are not limited to the following strategies:
•
•
•
TTC strategies such as lane closures or shifts, one-lane two-way operations (flagging and or pilot car), staged construction, or full road closures and detours. Traffic Control Devices such as temporary signing, channelizing devices (cones, drums), changeable message signs, arrow boards, temporary signals, and temporary pavement markings. Corridor Project Coordination, Contracting Strategies, and Innovative Construction Strategies such as A+B bidding, incentives/disincentives, and precast members or rapid cure materials.
1010.03(1)(b) Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) The TSMO components are those strategies for improving traffic flow and safety through the work zone. Some of these strategies may be included in the PS&E but could also be WSDOT-managed elements outside the contract. The TSMO components may include but are not limited to the following strategies:
•
•
Transportation demand management strategies such as Transit service improvements, transit incentives, and park & ride promotion. Corridor/Network Management (traffic operations) Strategies such as Signal timing/coordination improvements, temporary signals, bus pullouts, reversible lanes, and truck/heavy-vehicle restrictions.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
Work Zone Safety Management Strategies such as using positive protective devices, speed limit reductions, automated flagger assistance devices, radar speed display signs. Traffic/Incident Management and Enforcement Strategies such as Traffic Management Centers (TMCs) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Washington State Patrol, tow service, WSDOT Incident Response Team vehicle(s), traffic screens, and emergency pullouts in long work zones with narrowed shoulders. Smart Work Zone Systems and simpler version, Queue Warning Systems are dedicated specialized smart systems to provide more rapid information to drivers and to optimize the safety and efficiency of traffic through the work zone. For more information on TSMO, see Home | TSMO | WSDOT (tsmowa.org)
1010.03(1)(c) Public Information The Public Information (PI) components are those strategies for raising awareness of the upcoming project impacts or current restrictions. Public awareness strategies may be developed and implemented by WSDOT through the region or Headquarters (HQ) Communications offices and implemented before and during construction. Motorist information strategies may be WSDOT-managed elements with state equipment outside the contract or identified on plans in the PS&E. The PI components may include, but are not limited to, the following strategies:
•
•
Public Awareness Strategies such as Brochures or mailers, press releases, paid advertisements, and project website (consider providing information in other languages if appropriate). Motorist Information Strategies such as Highway advisory radio (HAR), changeable message signs, and transportation management center (TMC).
It is very important to continue the development of the TMP throughout the project development process. Not all work zone impacts have to be addressed with traffic control plans only. Many work zone impacts can be reduced or eliminated through project design elements like alignment choice, materials selection, structure types, overbuilding, and phased construction. Work zone impacts related to work duration may be resolved or reduced through innovative bidding and contract administration. The TMP Checklist in Exhibit 1010-2 will help identify and organize TMP components. Include the completed checklist in the Project File. For significant projects, develop this checklist and the supporting plans, data, impacts assessment, strategies, capacity/delay analysis and endorsements into a formal TMP document to be included in the Project File. For TMP examples, see: http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/wz/resources/final_rule/tmp_examples/sample_tmps.htm http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/wz/resources/publications/trans_mgmt_plans/trans_mgmt_plans.pdf

1010.03(2) TMP Requirements for Significant & Non-Significant Projects Transportation Management Plan components for design-bid-build and design-build projects are as follows: Non-Significant Projects Temporary Traffic Control Plans Contract Special Provisions Request for Proposal Section 2.22 TMP Document Not Required + Temporary Modification to Design Element Explanations
Significant Projects Temporary Traffic Control Plans Contract Special Provisions Request for Proposal Section 2.22 TMP Document Required 1. Temporary Traffic Control (TTC) Strategies 2. Transportation Systems Management & Operation (TSMO) Strategies 3. Public Information (PI) Strategies + Agreements with Other Agencies & Stakeholders + Temporary Modification to Design Element Explanations + TMP Roles & Responsibilities, Contact Information
Significant projects, as defined in 23 CFR Part 630 J, are defined as: 1. A project that, alone or in combination with other concurrent projects nearby, is anticipated to cause sustained work zone impacts that are greater than what is considered tolerable based on state policy and/or engineering judgement. 2. All Interstate system projects within the boundaries of a designated Transportation Management Area that occupy a location for more than three days with either intermittent or continuous lane closures shall be considered as significant projects unless FHWA grants an exception request based on the State’s ability to show the project does not cause sustained work zone impacts. For Significant Projects: A TMP Document is required per federal law (23 CFR Part 630 J) in addition to the temporary traffic control plan and contract provisions. The TMP Document’s size and scale depends on the project’s complexity and extent of adverse road user impacts but should be expanded to include agreements with other agencies/stakeholders, WSDOT commitments, and project contact information as appropriate. The TMP Checklist in Exhibit 1010-2 will help identify and organize TMP components. In addition, Significant Projects may require a Value Engineering (VE) study (see Chapter 310) and a Cost Risk Assessment (CRA) or Cost Estimate Validation Process (CEVP) that could help define strategies or identify risks: Cost risk assessment | WSDOT (wa.gov) For additional TMP Document information, see:

Hold a Work Zone Design Strategy Meeting during Scoping. Afterwards, create the Work Zone Design Strategy Statement and submit to Region Transportation Operations Office for acceptance. Integrate work zone impacts strategies during Scoping and early in Project Development to develop an accurate scoping estimate and integrate project constructability, work efficiency, and cost efficiency. Designers need to possess a good understanding of project constructability (work methods, needed work area, and reasonable work durations to complete the work). Contact the Construction Project Engineering Offices when making decisions on assessing and addressing constructability impacts. Designers need to possess a strong understanding of work zone traffic control strategies. Contact Region Transportation Operations Office to discuss WZTC strategies and obtain preliminary closure hours used to develop traffic control plans, determine project duration, and estimate project costs. Designers need to circle back with Construction to assess the project’s constructability with the WZTC strategies and preliminary closure hours. This may be an iterative process involving both Construction, Region Transportation Operations Office, and others as appropriate to arrive to the final WZTC strategies and project’s permitted closures and closure hours. Identify work zone safety and mobility impacts accounting for all needed work areas, operations, and possible staging areas. Implement appropriate safety strategies based on Work Zone Safety Management in Traffic Manual Chapter 5. Address traffic impacts extending beyond the project limits and impacting other roads and consider seasonal/special event/business impacts. Region Transportation Operations Office can help determine an impact assessment via work zone traffic analysis and develop mitigation strategies. Continue developing the Transportation Management Plan throughout Design, refer to the TMP Checklist in Exhibit 1010-2 to help identify and organize TMP components. Take work zone training to better understand requirements, standard practices, and expectations including the legally adopted Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) with Washington State modifications per WAC 468-95 as the minimum standard to develop adequate traffic control plans Approach work zone design from the road user’s perspective. Except when required, consider positive protection devices when practical. Use established design criteria in work zone roadway and roadside design. A TMP will justify temporary design elements; a Design Analysis is not required. Address work vehicle ingress and egress to each work area. Consider impacts to freight based on Commercial Vehicle Considerations in Traffic Manual Chapter 5 Accommodate pedestrian access (including ADA requirements) and bicycle access through or around the work zone. Consider the maintenance of existing transit stops. Consider school, hospital, emergency services, and postal delivery impacts. Consider maintenance issues and needs through the duration of the project. Consider law enforcement assistance and enforcement.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.04(2) Impacts Assessment One of the most important tasks in developing a TMP is assessing the mobility impacts and safety performance. Careful consideration is needed when assessing the scope of the TMP. A designer needs to possess a clear understanding of how project features will be constructed, including work methods, equipment, materials, and duration, to complete the work. Involve the construction PE when making decisions on assessing and addressing impacts. A complete and accurate impacts assessment will allow for the development of an effective TMP that should only need minor modifications to address construction considerations. The Traffic Manual provides information on how to determine expected work zone congestion along with mobility management strategies. An early and ongoing impacts assessment allows time to:
•
•
•
Develop Temporary Traffic Control (see Section 1010.04(5)), Transportation Systems Management Operations (see Section 1010.04(6)), and Public Information (see Section 1010.04(7)) Resolve potential work zone impacts within the design features of the project. Decisions that consider work zone impacts during bridge type selection, materials selection, advertisement dates, and others have the potential to resolve or minimize work zone impacts. Consider innovative mitigation strategies that may involve many stakeholders.
Some impacts may be difficult to completely solve and may ultimately need a management decision to determine the level of mitigation or impact that is acceptable. These types of impacts need to be clearly addressed in the TMP with documentation supporting and explaining the decision. The following are some examples of impacts that need to be managed during the design of a project: 1. Bridge construction sequence or falsework opening plans need to match the TTC staging or channelization plans. Coordination with the HQ Bridge and Structures Office is essential as the bridge design schedule may differ than the project schedule. Maintain the legal height of 16 feet 6 inches as the minimum falsework opening whenever possible; if this height cannot be maintained, then consider overheight vehicle impacts, possible additional signing needs, and temporary bypass routes. Reduction in shoulder widths due to barrier or bridge staging may affect active transportation access and mobility and are to be addressed in TTC plans. Refer to Chapter 720 for additional requirements and approvals. Coordination with the Permits Office may be needed. 2. If existing signal and illumination systems are not able to be maintained during the construction phases, plans for temporary systems or connections need to be included in the project. 3. Temporary relocation of existing signing (including overhead signing) may be required and shall be detailed in the plans. 4. Permanent traffic loop installation (such as advance loops, turn pockets, and stop bars, and ITS loops) and pavement marking installations (crosswalks, arrows, and so on) may require specific TTC plans. 5. Maintenance of pavement markings. The type of temporary markings to be used based on work duration, pavement surface and reducing the potential for a “ghost stripe” on the final pavement surface need to be considered. 6. Lane shifts onto existing shoulders: o The depth of the existing shoulder pavement must be adequate to carry traffic and rumble stripes need to be removed for long-term temporary roadway configurations. For short/intermediate-term durations, a single open lane can be shifted onto the paved
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
shoulder with a variable regulatory speed limit reduction on freeways per Traffic Manual Chapter 5 Speed Limit Reductions in Work Zones. o Any existing catch basins or junction boxes located in the shoulder need to be addressed. o The existing clear zone needs to be reevaluated with when the edge of traveled way is temporarily shifted. o Shifting of more than one lane in a direction is only allowed with temporary pavement markings. Shifting lanes by using channelizing devices is not allowed due to the high probability that devices used to separate the traffic will be displaced. o Signal head alignment may need to be adjusted when lanes are shifted approaching an intersection. 7. Roundabout construction at an existing intersection requires site-specific staging plans to address the unique site-specific design features. 8. Evaluate impacts to the existing drainage system as discussed in Chapter 5 of the Hydraulics Manual, particularly for narrowed shoulders, superelevation and/or widening transitions.
1010.04(3) Work Duration The duration of work is a major factor in determining a strategy and the amount and types of devices to use for work zone traffic control. A project may have work operations with durations that meet several or all of the following conditions:
1010.04(3)(a) Long-Term Stationary Work Zone This is work that occupies a location continuously for more than three days. Construction signs should be postmounted and larger; more stable channelizing devices should be used for increased visibility. Temporary barriers, pavement markings, illumination, and other considerations may be required for long-term stationary work. Staged construction or temporary alignment/channelization plans are required with this type of work.
1010.04(3)(b) Intermediate-Term Stationary Work Zone This is work that occupies a location for up to three days. Construction signs may still be post-mounted if in place continuously but are typically tripod or barrier mounted. Conflicting overhead guide signs do not need to be modified. In addition to channelization devices, temporary pavement markings lane lines may be required where multiple lanes are laterally shifted in the same travel direction. Temporary barrier and temporary illumination would normally not be used in this work zone duration.
1010.04(3)(c) Short-Term Stationary Work Zone This is work that occupies a location for more than one hour within a single day. At these locations, all devices are placed and removed during the single period.
1010.04(3)(d) Short-Duration Work Zone This is work that occupies a location for up to one hour. Because the work time is short, simplified traffic control set-ups are allowed, to reduce worker exposure to traffic as the time it may take to set up a full complement of signs and devices could exceed the amount of time required to perform the work. Short-duration work zones usually apply to maintenance or some utility work and are not used on construction projects. (See Work Zone Traffic Control Guidelines for Maintenance Operations, M54-44 for more information.)

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.04(3)(e) Mobile Work Zone This is work that moves intermittently or continuously where workers are inside vehicles, except for a few minutes infrequently. Mobile operations include activities such as sweeping, paint striping, and raised pavement marker installation. Truck-mounted attenuators with truck-mounted Portable Changeable Message Signs or warning signs provide advance warning and shadow and protect the work vehicles with flashing lights as they move along at low speeds with infrequent stopping. Channelization devices are typically not used. Mobile closures are not appropriate for work operations such as pavement milling and paving activities where workers are on foot for significant durations. Instead, stationary work zone traffic control closures are required.
1010.04(4) Transportation Management Plan Strategies With a completed impacts assessment, strategy development can begin. There are often several strategies to address a work zone impact, and engineering judgment will be needed in selecting the best option. Constructability, along with addressing safety and mobility, is the goal. Selecting a strategy is often a compromise and involves many engineering and non-engineering factors. Work closely with bridge, construction, maintenance, and transportation operations office personnel when selecting and developing strategies for the Transportation Management Plan (TMP) and PS&E. Do not assume that strategies chosen for past projects will adequately address the impacts for similar current projects. There may be similarities with the type of work, but each project is unique and is to be approached in that manner. Always look for other options or innovative approaches; many projects have unique features that can be turned to an advantage if carefully considered. Even a basic paving project on a rural two-lane highway may have opportunities for detours, shifting traffic, or other strategies. The Traffic Manual Chapter 5 Work Zone Traffic Analysis contains comprehensive information regarding work zone traffic analysis to determine expected delay and queuing.
1010.04(5) Temporary Traffic Control Strategies (Section Rewritten 2023) 1010.04(5)(a) Work Near Traveled Way (Section Rewritten 2023) If all work and work vehicles remain outside of the work zone clear zone, or behind barrier or guardrail when within the work zone clear zone, then no advanced warning signage is required. If workers enter the work zone clear zone not protected by barrier and guardrail, add appropriate warning signs. See Section 1010.06(3).
1010.04(5)(b) Shoulder Closure (Section Rewritten 2023) For active work operations when workers or work vehicles are on the paved shoulder or within the work zone clear zone not protected by barrier and guardrail, a shoulder closure should be used. Shoulder closures are not required for TTC device installation and removal activities. On roadways 40 mph or less, channelization devices may encroach into the adjacent open lane if a 10-foot minimum lane width is maintained. On roadways 45 mph and higher, channelization devices shall not encroach the adjacent open lane (instead close the adjacent open lane). Do not use sequential arrow sign at shoulder closures. Avoid using PCMSs only for shoulder closures. See Section 1010.06(3).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1010-8
Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.04(5)(c) Lane Shift (Section Rewritten 2023) On undivided roadways with three or more lanes, a single open lane can be shifted laterally into the closed twoway left turn lane (which maintains the thru lane in both direction) or into a closed oncoming travel lane. Do not use a sequential arrow sign at the lane shifts. PCMSs are optional.
1010.04(5)(d) Alternating One-Lane Two-Way Traffic (Section Rewritten 2023) This strategy alternates all directions of traffic in a single open lane under the control of flagger, Automated Flagger Assistance Devices (AFADs), or temporary traffic signals where shown in traffic control plans. It is recommended to use AFADs on roadways 55 mph or higher, except near signalized intersections. Use temporary traffic signals for long-duration closures to alternate traffic during nonworking hours, but flaggers can control traffic during working hours (turn off the temporary signals and adjust signing as appropriate). Temporary rumble strips may be added in advance to increase driver alertness. These stations shall be illuminated at night with either temporary illumination or existing illumination, except in emergencies. Pilot cars should be used to guide motorists between flaggers or AFADs for lane closures exceeding 1000 feet or having multiple intersecting roadways, driveways, or business accesses. Refer to WAC 296-155-305 for flagging requirements. At least four advanced warning signs required on roadways 45 mph and higher and at least three advanced warning signs on roadways 40 mph or less. Flaggers are not to be used on freeways or expressways. Using flaggers solely to instruct motorists to proceed slowly is an unacceptable practice. When flaggers are used at an intersection, a flagger is required for each leg of the intersection. Close lanes and turn pockets so only one lane of traffic approaches a flagger station on multilane roadways. When a signal is present, it shall be turned off or set to red flash mode when flagging. An additional flagger may be added at the center of an intersection provided each intersection leg is controlled by a flagger. Only uniform police officers (UPOs) may flag from the center of an intersection without each intersection leg being controlled by a flagger. It is optional to close lanes and turn pockets approaching UPO-controlled intersections; however, two UPOs should be used on multilane roadways (2 or more thru lanes approaching the intersection in any direction). When a signal is present, it shall be turned off or set to red flash mode when UPOs are flagging. See Traffic Manual Chapter 5 for more information on the use of law enforcement personnel at work zones.
1010.04(5)(e) Lane Closure on Multilane Roadways (Section Rewritten 2023) On multilane roadways with two or more travel lanes in a direction, closing lanes and adjacent shoulders is a common strategy. Additional lanes shall be closed if encroachment is necessary. A separate sequential arrow sign shall be used at each lane closure taper. On multilane roadways 45 mph and above, a 2-foot lateral buffer is provided between traffic and the work area. Consider closing additional lanes to increase the lateral buffer space for enhanced safety if practical. Except at closure and shift tapers, channelization devices shall not encroach on the open lanes except when a single open lane is shifted onto the paved shoulder. Additional lanes shall be closed if encroachment is necessary whenever two or more lanes are open.

Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.04(5)(f) Single Open Lane Shifted onto Shoulder on Multilane Roadways (Section Rewritten 2023) For multilane roadways requiring channelization devices to encroach into the only remaining open lane, that single open lane must be shifted over onto either the left or right paved shoulder. This shoulder shift configuration is necessitated by work operations including but not limited to:
•
•
Two-lane freeway or divided highway with the work area extending up to the lane line adjacent to traffic for work including HMA pavement, concrete pavement, and/or expansion joint rehabilitation. Three-lane freeway with the work area including both lanes and extending up to the lane line adjacent to traffic for work including HMA pavement, concrete pavement, and/or expansion joint rehabilitation.
Reduced speed limits are required for this strategy on freeways and divided multilane highways with existing speed limits 60 mph or higher. See Speed Limit Reductions in Work Zones in Traffic Manual Chapter 5. For travel widths less than 16 feet, see Commercial Vehicle Considerations in Traffic Manual Chapter 5.
1010.04(5)(g) Rolling Slowdown (Section Rewritten 2023) This strategy involves using a slow-moving blockade of traffic control vehicles and/or law enforcement vehicles to create a large traffic gap enabling the completion of work activities requiring exclusive access across or over a directional roadway, including freeways, that otherwise presents a significant risk to motorists and workers. Rolling slowdowns are not to be used for routine work that can be addressed by lane closures or other stationary traffic control strategies. Rolling slowdowns are intended for work operations needing up to 10 minutes of clear time. For longer durations, use directional freeway or roadway closure. See Rolling Slowdowns in Traffic Manual Chapter 5 for detailed information. A Rolling Slowdown typical traffic control plan is now available in the WSDOT Typical Traffic Control Plan Library; however, a site-specific traffic control plan is required for complex rolling slowdown scenarios.
1010.04(5)(h) Traffic Holds (Section Rewritten 2023) This strategy involves using flaggers and/or uniform police officers to stop traffic in all directions to enable completion of work activities requiring exclusive access across or over the roadway that otherwise presents significant risks to motorists and/or workers. On multilane highways, reduce each direction of traffic down to a single open lane. Traffic holds are not to be used on freeways. See Traffic Holds in Traffic Manual Chapter 5. These traffic holds may be implemented with shoulder or lane closures, including alternating one-lane two-way traffic control. Traffic hold durations typically range from a few minutes up to 15 minutes. For unique situations needing longer traffic holds, contact Region Transportation Operations Office. Traffic holds are used for work operations including but not limited to:
•
•
•
Rock scaling and/or tree clearing operations Bridge painting/rehabilitation projects to install containment/falsework across roadway Heavy truck ingress/egress
Equipment crossing across roadway
1010.04(5)(i) Temporary Alignment and Channelization Temporary alignments and/or channelization may be an option for long-duration work zones or staged traffic control. The following are guiding principles for the design of temporary alignment and channelization plans:
•
Use site-specific base data to develop site-specific staged traffic plans.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
For all temporary design elements, use Design Manual guidance for permanent features to the extent practical and feasible. When use of permanent guidance is not feasible, justify any variance in the TMP. Provide beginning and ending station ties and curve data. Include lane and shoulder widths. Provide temporary roadway sections, including lateral clearance and temporary barrier deflection distances. To avoid confusion, do not show unnecessary details on the plan. Do not use straight line tapers through curves; use circular alignment. Consider existing crown points, lane/shoulder cross slope breaks, and super-elevation transitions that may affect a driver’s ability to maintain control of a vehicle. If the project has multiple stages, from one stage to the next, show features constructed in previous stages as existing elements. Consider the time needed for removal of existing markings and placement of the new markings and possibly placement of barriers and attenuators. In urban areas where work hours for lane closures are limited, special consideration may be necessary to allow time to implement the plan, or an interim stage may be necessary. Use shoulder closure signing and channelizing devices to close a shoulder prior to a temporary impact attenuator/sloped terminal and run of temporary barrier. Existing signing may need to be covered or revised, and additional construction warning signs may be needed for the new alignment. Temporary pavement marking type (short-duration or long-duration) and colors shall be specified. For better guidance through shifting or taper areas, consider solid lane lines. Return to broken lane lines between shift areas. Provide a list of the approved temporary impact attenuators that may be used for the plan, if applicable. The plans are to provide all the layout information for all the temporary features just as a permanent pavement marking plan would.
i Staged Construction Staged construction requires combining multiple work operations into a logical order to provide large, protected work areas and separate traffic spaces for long durations, which maximizes work operations and minimizes daily impacts to traffic. Design temporary alignment and channelization plans to place traffic in these semi-permanent locations. Permanent geometric design criteria are to be used when developing these plans to the extent practical and feasible; otherwise, the TMP will justify temporary design elements and a Design Analysis is not required. Design strategies such as overbuilding for future stages, or the use of temporary structures are often part of staged construction on significant impact projects. Request Region Transportation Operations to perform detailed work zone traffic analysis for each stage.
ii Lane Shift/Reduced Lane Width Traffic lanes may be shifted and/or width reduced in order to accommodate a long-duration work area when it is not practicable, for capacity reasons, to reduce the number of available lanes. Shifting lanes of traffic requires the removal of existing conflicting pavement markings and the installation of temporary markings. Use advanced warning signs and solid lane lines through L/2 lane shifts but consider more gradual shifting tapers for shifting multiple lanes on a freeway.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1010-11
Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
Utilizing the existing shoulder may be necessary to accommodate the shifting movement. First, determine the structural capacity of the shoulder to ensure its ability to carry the proposed traffic. Remove and inlay existing shoulder rumble strips prior to routing traffic onto the shoulder for long durations.
iii Traffic Split or Island Work Zone This strategy separates lanes of traffic traveling in one direction around a work area. Some drivers have difficulty understanding the "“lane split"” configuration resulting in braking or unnecessary late lane changes. Braking and erratic lane changes decrease the traffic capacity through the work zone, which results in an unstable traffic flow approaching the lane split. This strategy should be avoided in urban areas due to frequency of ramps. Evaluate other strategies to keep traffic on one side of the work area to avoid a traffic split if possible, such as a median crossover that utilizing a moveable barrier system to transfer the temporary center lane back and forth to the direction of heaviest traffic volumes. Consider the following guidance for traffic split operations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
If used, limit the duration the traffic split can be in place. Consider incentives and disincentives to encourage the contractor to be as efficient as possible. A higher level of traffic impacts may be acceptable if offset with fewer impacted days. Advance warning signs advising drivers of the approaching roadway condition are required. Consider the use of Portable Changeable Message Signs (PCMS), portable Highway Advisory Radio (HAR), and other dynamic devices. Overhead signing and in-lane pavement markings also may be necessary to give additional driver notice of the traffic split. Consider how the traffic split will impact truck traffic. If the truck volumes are high, restricted truck lanes approaching and through the traffic split may be appropriate. For questions concerning truck operations, contact the HQ Freight Systems Division. To discourage lane changing, consider the use of solid lane line markings to delineate traffic approaching the split or island. Refer to the MUTCD for additional details. Consider the use of STAY IN LANE (black on white) signs or set up a "“no pass"” zone approaching the lane split and coordinate with the Washington State Patrol (WSP). Supplement the existing roadway lighting with additional temporary lighting to improve the visibility of the island work area (see Chapter 1040). Coordinate with the region Transportation Operations Office for signing and pavement marking details when designing island work zones.
Work area ingress and egress should be through and adjacent lane closure.
iv Temporary Bypass This strategy involves total closure of one or both directions of travel on the roadway. Traffic is routed to a temporary bypass usually constructed within the highway right of way. An example of this is the replacement of an existing bridge by building an adjacent temporary structure and shifting traffic onto the temporary structure. A temporary channelization plan will show pavement markings, temporary barrier with impact attenuators/sloped terminals, sign, and device placement.
v Median Crossover This strategy involves placing both directions of traffic on one side of a multilane divided highway. The number of lanes is usually reduced in both directions and one direction is routed across the median. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1010-12
Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
Existing even-lane configurations may be converted to temporary odd-lane configurations with a moveable barrier system to transfer the temporary center lane back and forth to the direction of heaviest traffic volumes. The design for elements of temporary crossovers needs to follow the same guidance as permanent design for alignment, barriers, delineation, and illumination. Permanent geometric design criteria are to be used when developing these plans to the extent practical and feasible; otherwise, the TMP will justify temporary design elements and a Design Analysis is not required.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The goal is to design crossovers not less than 10 mph below the posted speed limit unless site conditions require a lower design speed. Warning signs with an advisory speed plaque, based on the median crossover design speed, shall be used at median crossovers. The continuous regulatory work zone speed limit is based on the geometric configuration of temporary roadway outside of isolated restrictive features, such as lane and shoulder widths. Median paving may be required to create crossover locations (consider drainage for the added pavement). When feasible, use temporary barrier on freeways to separate the two directions of traffic and evaluate the need for a glare screen. It is acceptable to separate two directions of traffic with a double yellow centerline or an 18-inch yellow barrier line. Pavement-mounted tubular markers may be added but consider the frequency of Oversize/Superload commercial vehicle freight and impacts to snow plowing operations. Provide temporary illumination at the crossover locations (see Chapter 1040) Straight line crossover tapers work best for highways with narrow paved medians. Temporary pavement markings, removal of conflicting existing markings, and construction signs are also required. Channelizing devices shall be used to supplement temporary markings at the crossover locations. Provide a design clear zone adjacent to the crossover and avoid placing crossover detours near structures. For traffic that is crossed over (going against the normal traffic flow direction) existing bridge rail ends, barriers, guardrails or other objects may require temporary barrier/impact attenuators for protection.
1010.04(5)(j) Total Closures and Detours Total closures may be for the project duration or for a critical work operation because of major constructability considerations or safety performance. The main requirement for total closures is the availability of a detour route and if the route can accommodate the increased traffic volumes and truck turning movements. Local roads may have lower geometric criteria than state facilities. Placing additional and new types of traffic on a local road may influence safety performance, especially when drivers are accustomed to the geometrics associated with state highways. Pavement integrity and rehabilitation may need to be addressed when traffic is detoured to specific local roadways. For the traveling public, closing the road for a short time might be less of an inconvenience than driving through a work zone for an extended period of time (see the Traffic Manual and RCW 47.48). Advance notification of the closure is required, and a signed detour route may be required. Consider the following road closure elements:

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
Communication with all stakeholders, including road users, adjoining property owners, local agencies, transit agencies, the freight industry, emergency services, schools, and others, is required when considering a total closure strategy. This helps determine the level of support for a closure and development of an acceptable closure. Include the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison, Rail, Freight, and Ports; Commercial Vehicle Services; and Public Transportation Divisions to help coordinate. Analyze a closure strategy and compare it to other strategies, such as staged work zones, to determine which is overall more beneficial. This information helps stakeholders understand the impacts if a closure is not selected. A closure decision (other than short-term, minor-impact closures) will require stakeholder acceptance and Regional management approval once impacts and benefits have been analyzed. Closures that reopen to a new, completed roadway or other noticeable improvements are generally more accepted by the public. Route-to-route connections and other strategic access points may have to be maintained or a reasonable alternative provided. Material selection, production rates, and work operation efficiencies have a direct tie to the feasibility of the closure strategy. A strong emphasis has been placed on this area and several successful strategies have been implemented, such as weekend-long closures or extended-duration single-shift closures. These strategies use specific materials such as quick-curing concrete, accelerated work schedules, prefabricated structure components, on-site mix plants, and so on, and are based on actual production rates. The WSDOT Materials Laboratory and the HQ Construction Office are good resources for more information on constructability as a component of an effective work zone strategy. Interstate or interstate ramp closures (including interstate closures with interchange ramps as detours) lasting more than 7 days require FHWA 60-day advance notice. See the Stewardship and Oversight Agreement for closure notification requirements. Short-duration closures of ramps or intersecting streets during off-peak hours do not require extensive approval if advance notice is provided and reasonable alternate routes are available. Detailed, project-specific traffic control plans, traffic operation plans, and public information plans are required. Depending on the duration of the closure/detour and the anticipated amount and type of traffic that will use the route, consider upgrades to the route such as signal timing, intersection turning radius for large vehicle, structural pavement enhancements, or shoulder widening. An approved detour agreement with the appropriate local agency is required for detour routes using local roadways and are to be completed prior to project advertisement. Document road closure decisions and agreements in the Project File.
Roadway closures, detours, and alternate routes must be analyzed by for disproportionate impacts to EJ and LEP communities. If an EJ or LEP community is identified along a proposed route and will be disproportionately impacted, appropriate mitigation must be coordinated between WSDOT Communications and the Contractor. When additional changes are made to the route, it should be evaluated to determine if the detour adds congestion, noise or creates safety issues for adjacent residences and businesses and/or adds considerably longer distance to access residences/businesses that may affect low income and minority population. WSDOT will work with local agencies and conduct public outreach as necessary, to ensure that the proposed route will not have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on EJ or LEP populations. A Communications Plan must include appropriate accommodations for identified populations and businesses.

•
•
Overbuild beyond normal project needs to maintain additional traffic or facilitate staged construction. Replace bridges using new alignments so they can be built with minimal impacts. Bring adjacent lifts of hot mix asphalt (HMA) to match the latest lifts (lag up) and require a tapered wedge joint to eliminate drop-off and abrupt lane edges. Require permanent pavement markings at intervals during multi-season projects to limit the duration temporary markings are needed and to support pavement marking visibility during winter shutdown.
1010.04(6) Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) Strategies The following are operational strategies to consider based on project specific needs:
1010.04(6)(a) Transportation Demand Management
•
•
•
•
•
Provide transit service improvements and possible incentives to help reduce demand. For long-term freeway projects, consider ramp metering. Provide a shuttle service for pedestrians and bicyclists. Provide local road improvements (signals modifications, widening, and so on) to improve capacity for use as alternate routes. Provide traffic screens to reduce driver distraction.
1010.04(6)(b) Corridor/Network Management
•
•
•
•
Provide a temporary express lane with no access through the project. Consider signal timing or coordination modifications. Provide emergency pullouts for disabled vehicles on projects with long stretches of narrow shoulders and no other access points. Use heavy-vehicle restrictions and provide alternate routes or lane use restrictions.
1010.04(6)(c) Work Zone Safety Management
•
•
•
•
•
•
Provide temporary access road approaches for work zone access. Use positive protective devices (barrier) for long-term work zones to improve the environment for workers and road users. Consider including temporary portable transverse rumbles strips and/or automated flagger assistance devices (AFADs) for flagging operation plans. Use temporary portable traffic control systems for long duration one-lane two-way traffic control. Refer to the Traffic Manual Chapter 5 for additional information, guidance, and approval requirements for speed limit reductions in work zones. Use advanced queue mitigation systems depending on the extent of expected work zone congestion on high-speed roadways. Refer to the Traffic Manual Chapter 5 for additional information and guidance for Smart Work Zone Systems, Queue Warning Systems, and other simpler PCMS versions.
1010.04(6)(d) Traffic/Incident Management and Enforcement
•
•
•
Provide law enforcement patrols to reduce speeding and aggressive drivers. Provide incident response patrols during construction to reduce delays due to crashes in the work zone. Provide a dedicated tow service to clear incidents.

Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.04(6)(e) Smart Work Zone System (SWZS)
•
•
•
Deploy roadway monitoring technology such as queue length detection, mobile surveillance, and overdimension vehicle detection. Deploy dynamic traffic control technology such as temporary ramp metering, variable speed control, and dynamic lane merge. Deploy driver information systems such as portable changeable message signs (PCMS), travel time and congestion information, and integration with third-party trip planning applications.
See Section 1010.09(5) for more information on SWZS and potential integration with TMCs and broader ITS operations.
1010.04(7) Public Information The Public Information (PI) strategies help raise awareness of the upcoming project impacts and/or current restrictions. Typical public awareness strategies planned during Design and performed during Construction typically include:
•
Advanced closure notification via R11-1501 signage or using portable changeable message signs
•
Schematics detailing maps of the closure along with detour/alternative route information
•
Oversize/overweight and vertical clearance restrictions via WSDOT Commercial Vehicle Services and construction warning signs. Coordinate freight travel information and restrictions with Rail, Freight, and Ports Division.
•
Coordinate transit travel information and restrictions with the Public Transportation Division
•
Pedestrian and bicycle access information and alternative routes via information signing and alternative route maps/brochures
Public awareness strategies are typically developed by WSDOT Region Communications offices and implemented before and during construction closures by utilizing different public outreach tools such as news coverage via press releases, WSDOT social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube), WSDOT Construction Projects webpage, and WSDOT Blog. Consider providing information in other languages when appropriate. Maintain effective public relations throughout both design and construction phases for projects with highimpact closures. Avoid surprising stakeholders and the public by informing them answers to “What is closed and when?”, “How do you get to where you need to go?”, and “What are the anticipated delays and times to avoid traveling through the work zone?” Be sure to explain the benefits of high-impact closures: Why is the inconvenience worth it and what work will be/was completed?
1010.04(7)(a) Public Awareness One PI strategy is a public awareness campaign using the media, project websites, public meetings, e-mail updates, and mailed brochures. This gives regular road users advance notice of impacts they can expect and time to plan for alternate routes or other options to avoid project impacts. Involve the region or HQ Communications Office in developing and implementing these strategies. Coordinate transit travel information and restrictions with the Public Transportation Division. wwwi.wsdot.wa.gov/PubTran/ Coordinate freight travel information and restrictions with the Rail, Freight, and Ports Division. https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/WSDOT::wsdot-freight-data-truck-freight-economic-corridors/about

Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.04(7)(b) Driver Information In addition to work zone signs, provide driver information using highway advisory radio (HAR) and changeable message signs (existing or portable). Include a Smart Work Zone System to provide drivers with real time information on queuing and delays. Involve the region TMC in the development and implementation of these strategies. Additional information on smart work zone systems can be found on the Work Zone Safety web page: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/traffic-work-zone-traffic-control-wztc The Freight Alert system should be used to communicate information with freight industry on work zones. Each region has the capability to send alerts with this system. https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/WSDOT::wsdot-freight-data-truck-freight-economic-corridors/about Work zone strategy development is a fluid process and may be ongoing as project information and design features are developed during the design process. There may be many factors involved with strategy development, and it is necessary to be well organized to make sure all the relative factors are identified and evaluated.
1010.04(7)(c) Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Include pedestrian and bicycle access information and alternate routes in the public awareness plans. Pedestrian and bicyclist information signing, including alternate route maps specifically for these road users, could be considered.
1010.05 Work Zone Traffic Analysis Work zone congestion and delay is a significant consideration for many highway projects. At high-volume locations with existing capacity problems, even shoulder closures will increase congestion. All work zone traffic restrictions need to be analyzed to determine the level of impacts and the appropriate queue mitigation system and public information outreach. See Chapter 5 in the Traffic Manual for additional information. Include a Work Zone & Traffic Analysis in the TMP. Work zone mobility impacts can have the following effects:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Crashes: Most work zone crashes are congestion-related, usually in the form of rear-end crashes due to traffic queues. Traffic queues extending beyond the advance warning signs may increase potential for crashes. Driver Frustration: Drivers expect to travel to their destinations in a timely manner. If delays are excessive, driver frustration can lead to aggressive or inappropriate driving actions. Constructability: Constructing a project efficiently relies on the ability to pursue work operations while maintaining traffic flow. Delays in material delivery, work hour restrictions, and constant installation and removal of traffic control devices all detract from constructability. Local Road Impacts: Projects that reduce capacity can sometimes cause traffic to divert to local roadways, which may impact the surrounding local roadway system and community. Public Credibility: Unanticipated work zone congestion and delay can create poor credibility for WSDOT with drivers and the surrounding community without sufficient public outreach in advance. Restricted Access: Severe congestion can effectively gridlock a road system, preventing access to important route connections, businesses, schools, hospitals, and so on. User Cost Impacts: Traffic delays have an economic impact on road users and the surrounding community. Calculated user costs are part of a work zone capacity analysis and may be used to determine liquidated damages specifications.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
While maintaining the optimum carrying capacity of an existing facility during construction may not be possible, but efforts should be made to maintain existing traffic mobility through and/or around the work zone. Maintaining mobility does not rule out innovative strategies such as roadway closures. Planned closures can accelerate work operations, reducing overall impacts to road users. These types of traffic control strategies are to include transportation demand management and public information plans to notify road users and mitigate and manage the impacts as much as possible. A work zone capacity analysis helps determine whether a work zone strategy is feasible. Mitigation measures that provide the right combination of good public information, advance signing and notification, alternate routes, detours, and work hour restrictions, as well as innovations such as strategic closures, accelerated construction schedules, or parallel roadway system capacity improvements, can be very effective in managing mobility impacts. Many projects will have several potential work zone strategies, while other projects may only have one obvious work zone strategy. It is possible that a significant mobility impact strategy may be the only option. There is no policy on the acceptable level of work-zone-created congestion and delay allowed on a project. In conjunction with the region traffic engineers, the designer uses engineering judgement along with knowledge of the projects traffic conditions, alternate routes, and more to determine an acceptable level of congestion and delays. This level of impact anticipated by the work zone strategy are to be in concurrence with region management. The traffi1010-19rafficc analysis process helps shape the TMP as the work zone strategies are evaluated and refined into traffic control plans and specifications. Maintain work zone traffic analysis documents in the Project File. Current volume data in the project vicinity is required for accurate work zone traffic analysis results. Seasonal adjustment factors may be needed depending on the data was collected and when the proposed traffic restrictions may be in place. Assess existing data as early as possible to determine whether additional data collection may be required. The region Transportation Operations Office and the HQ Transportation Data & GIS Office can assist with collecting traffic volume data. Coordination with local agencies may be needed to obtain data on affected local roads. Refer to Chapter 5 in the Traffic Manual for comprehensive work zone mobility management, work zone capacity information, and work zone queue and delay estimation calculations.

1010.06 Work Zone Design Part 6 of the MUTCD mostly addresses short-duration temporary traffic control standards. Some long-duration work zones may require temporary alignments and channelization, including barrier and attenuator use, temporary illumination and signals, and temporary pedestrian and bicycle routes. Use Design Manual guidance for permanent features to the extent practical and feasible with temporary modification to design elements may be modified as justified in the TMP; a Design Analysis is not required.

1010.06(1) Lane Widths While it is desirable to maintain existing lane widths during work zone operations whenever practical, often temporary lane width reductions are necessary. For projects that require lane shifts or lane width reductions due to work area limits and staging, consider the following before determining the work zone lane configurations to be implemented:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Overall roadway width available Posted speed limit Traffic volumes through the project limits Number of lanes Existing lane and shoulder widths Crown points and shoulder slope breaks Treat lane lines and construction joints to provide a smooth flow Length and duration of lane width reduction (if in place) Roadway geometry (cross slope, vertical and horizontal curves) Vertical clearances Transit and freight vehicles, including over-sized vehicles
Abrupt geometric transitions in the work zone shall be minimized or avoided if possible. When necessary, such transitions should be made as smoothly as the space available allows. Maintain approach lane width, if possible, throughout the connection. Design lane width reductions prior to any lane shifts within the transition area. Do not reduce curve radii and lane widths simultaneously. Work with Region Transportation Operations to determine appropriate lane widths. The objective is to use lane geometrics that will be clear to the driver and keep the vehicle in the intended lane. In order to maintain the minimum lane widths, temporary widening may be needed.
1010.06(2) Buffer Space Buffer spaces separate road users from the workspace or other areas off limits to travel. Buffer spaces also might provide some recovery space for an errant vehicle.
•
•
A lateral buffer provides space between the vehicles and adjacent workspace, traffic control device, or a condition such as an abrupt lane edge or drop-off. A 2-foot lateral buffer space is recommended on roadways 45 mph or higher. Consider positive protection devices for long-duration closures (2 weeks or more) when workers are substantially exposed to vehicular traffic on roadways 45 mph or higher. When temporary barriers are used, place a temporary edge line (typically 2-foot laterally from the barrier, but may be reduced). When feasible, a longitudinal buffer space is used immediately downstream of a closed or shifted traffic lane or shoulder. This space provides a recovery area for errant vehicles as they approach the workspace.
The body of any channelization devices used to separate the road user from the workspace shall not encroach into adjacent lanes except where a single open lane is laterally shifted onto the shoulder. If encroachment is necessary, the adjacent lane must be closed to maintain the lateral buffer space except for shoulder closures on roadways 40 mph or less.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1010-20
Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
To achieve the minimum lateral buffer, there may be instances where pavement widening or a revision to a stage may be necessary. In the case of short-term lane closure operations, the adjacent lane may need to be closed or traffic may need to be temporarily shifted onto a shoulder to maintain a lateral buffer space. During the design of the traffic control plan, the lateral buffer needs to be identified on the plan so that additional width is available; use temporary roadway cross sections to show the space in relation to the traffic and work area.
1010.06(3) Work Zone Clear Zone The contractor’s operations present opportunities for errant vehicles to impact the clear area adjacent to the traveled way. The work zone clear zone(s) (WZCZ) in a project are determined by the posted speeds of the roadways in the project using Exhibit 1010-1. The WZCZ applies only to roadside objects introduced by the contractor’s operations (vehicles, equipment, and materials). It is not intended to resolve existing objects in the Design Clear Zone or clear zone values established at the completion of the project. During nonworking hours, vehicles, equipment, or materials shall not be within the WZCZ unless they are protected by permanent guardrail or temporary barrier. The use of temporary concrete barrier shall be permitted only if the engineer approves the installation and location. During actual hours of work, unless protected as described above, only equipment and materials absolutely necessary to construction shall be within the WZCZ, and only construction vehicles absolutely necessary to construction shall be allowed within the WZCZ or allowed to stop or park on the shoulder of the roadway.

1010.06(4) Abrupt Lane Edges and Drop-offs Minimize, mitigate, or eliminate abrupt lane edges and drop-offs whenever practicable. When unavoidable, traffic control plans should provide a protection method. Consider temporary barriers for long duration drop off protection and contract provisions limiting the duration of edges from daily paving operations consistent with Standard Specification section 1-07.23(1). When a temporary barrier is used to protect a drop-off, provide a lateral offset from the drop-off to the back side of the barrier with an offset distance equal-to or greater than the distance listed in DM Exhibit 1610-3. Provide an edge line on the traffic side of the temporary barrier (typically 2-feet from the face of the barrier). Provide a barrier end treatment; such as an impact attenuator, or end terminal, when the barrier end is located inside the Design Clear Zone.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
Unless behind guardrail or barrier, open trenches are prohibited within the Traveled Way, Auxiliary Lanes, Shoulders, or other areas in the work zone clear zone. Backfilling and paving operations are required to reopen to vehicular traffic. Steel plates are allowed for open and closed Pathways, provided the walking surface is painted with either a non-slip paint, anti-slip tape, or rolled roofing surface and transverse edges are beveled at 2:1 with a maximum ¼” vertical lip. When backfilling is not possible, steel plates may be used. Detailed steel plate drawings and Special Provisions (including steel plate dimensions, maximum allowable span and overlap dimensions, and nonskid surface, anchorage/shoring, and material requirements) shall be included in the PS&E in collaboration with Bridge & Structures and Region Transportation Operations. Steel plate shall be anchored and either embedded flush with the existing road surface or a wedge of suitable material provided for a smooth transition between the pavement and the steel plate. Abrupt lane edges, and drop-offs and steel plates require additional warning and considerations for motorcyclists, bicyclists, and pedestrians, including pedestrians with disabilities. Signing to warn the motorcycle rider, bicyclists and pedestrians, including pedestrians with disabilities of these conditions is required. (See RCW 47.36.200 and WAC 468-95-305). See Design Manual Chapter 1510 for work zone pedestrian accommodation guidance. See Standard Specifications section 1-07.23(1) for the contract requirements for drop off protection and address project specific protection if necessary.
1010.06(5) Vertical Clearance In accordance with Chapter 720, the minimum vertical clearance over new highways is 16.5 feet. For locations where this minimum cannot be met, follow the reduced clearance criteria discussed in Chapter 720 and include it in the traffic control plans. Maintain legal height on temporary falsework for bridge construction projects. If legal height on temporary falsework cannot be provided, consider over-height vehicle impacts and possible additional signing needs and coordination with permit offices. Widening of existing structures can prove challenging when the existing height is at or less than legal height, so extra care is required in the consideration of over-height vehicles when temporary falsework is necessary. Coordination with the HQ Bridge and Structures Office is essential to ensure traffic needs have been accommodated. Vertical clearance requirements associated with local road networks may be different than what is shown in Chapter 720. Coordinate with the local agency.
1010.06(6) Speed Limit Reductions & Advisory Speeds in Work Zones (Section Rewritten 2023) All work zone speed limit reduction and/or advisory speed requests must be submitted through Region Transportation Operations for review. Designers shall collaborate with Region Transportation Operations and obtain their concurrence early in project development in the Work Zone Designer Strategy Meeting. Refer to the Traffic Manual Chapter 5 for additional information, guidance and approval requirements for speed limit reductions in work zones. Include approval documents in the Project File. Speed reduction for work zones is categorized as follows:
•
•
Continuous Regulatory Speed Limit Reduction: In place 24 hours a day during both active work operations and nonworking hours for a stage of work lasting 4 or more calendar days. Variable/Intermittent Regulatory Speed Limit Reduction: In place only during active work operations when temporary lane closures are in place lasting 3 calendar days or less but typically used during
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1010
•
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
daily/nightly lane closures. When the lane closure is removed, the existing speed limit or continuous regulatory work zone speed limit is restored. Advisory Speed: Associated with a warning sign for an isolated work zone condition or roadway restriction up to ½ mile in length based on the reduced design speed or ball banking measurement. Advisory speeds may be in place continuously or variably.
Drivers tend to reduce their speed only if they perceive a need to do so. Unless Region Transportation Operations accepts otherwise, continuous regulatory speed limit reductions will only be considered for restrictive temporary roadway configurations that exceed ½ mile in length that cannot be designed for the existing speed limit; warning signs with advisory speeds, matching the reduced design speed, shall be used at restrictive features up to ½ mile in length provided it is within 10 mph of the regulatory speed limit. In addition, continuous regulatory speed limit reductions are also considered during bituminous surface treatment (BST) operations, alternating traffic under temporary portable traffic signal control, and emergency situations. Variable/intermittent regulatory speed limit reductions will be considered during lane closures utilizing active work operations with workers, equipment, or materials adjacent to traffic on roadways posted 45 mph or higher without positive protection devices. Variable/intermittent regulatory speed limit reductions may be considered as part of an overall safety strategy and shall be in compliance with Traffic Manual Chapter 5. Advisory speeds are associated with a warning sign for an isolated work zone condition or restricted roadway features up to ½ mile in length and posted based on the reduced design work zone speed or ball banking measurement provided it is within 10 mph of the regulatory speed limit, unless approved otherwise by Region Transportation Operations. Advisory speeds are used for restricted sight distance, median crossover, roadway realignment where the feature’s design speed does not match the regulatory speed limit.
1010.06(7) Accommodation for Pedestrians and Bicyclists Many public highways and streets accommodate pedestrians and bicyclists, predominately in urban areas. During construction, access must be maintained through or around the work zones. When existing pedestrian routes are closed, design and construct the alternate routes to be detectable and to meet or exceed the existing level of accessibility. When existing accessible routes are closed, temporary pedestrian facilities within the work zone are required to meet ADA accessibility criteria to the maximum extent feasible. Covered walkways are to be provided where there is a potential for falling objects. Shared bicycle-vehicle lanes are prohibited on freeways and multilane roadways 45 mph and higher. On these routes, bicyclists will need either a 4-foot shoulder, detour/alternate route (via sidewalk, shared path, or another roadway), shuttle, or some other reasonable accommodation through or around the work zone. When existing separated bicycle lanes are closed during construction, bicycles are to be detoured onto the adjacent sidewalk. If that sidewalk is also closed, then a combined bicycle-pedestrian detour route, free shuttle, or another reasonable accommodation is to be provided. On highways 30 mph or less without separated bicycle lanes, a shared vehicle-bicycle lane may be used with a R4-11 sign (Bicycles MAY USE FULL ROADWAY). On highways 35 mph or higher without separated bicycle lanes, a shared-bicycle lane may be used with additional W11-15 MOD (Bicycles SHARE THE ROAD) warning signs placed in advance and along the route except when existing separated/protected bicycle lanes are present.

Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
Bicycles may be combined with vehicular traffic when alternating traffic is controlled via flagger, AFAD, or temporary signal on all roadways regardless of the posted speed limit. It may be possible to make other provisions to transport pedestrians and bicyclists through a work zone or with a walking escort around the active work area. Roadway surfaces that are reasonably smooth provide for greater accessibility for those walking, biking and rolling. Conditions such as loose gravel, uneven surfaces, milled pavement, or asphalt tack coats restrict access and may increase the potential for falling or tripping. It is recognized that construction may create these temporary conditions and to the extent feasible should be avoided or signs shall indicate the conditions. Information can be gathered on considerations for bicyclists by contacting local bike clubs and local agencies. Coordination with local bike clubs increases the likelihood that their members are notified of work zone impacts, and it helps maintain good public relations. (See Chapter 1510 for more pedestrian and bicyclist design requirements and MUTCD Chapter 6D for pedestrian work zone design requirements.)
1010.06(8) Warning Signs for Motorcyclists The roadway surface condition requires additional warning signs to alert the motorcyclist of work zone conditions. Per RCW 47.36.200 paragraph 2, “(2) If the construction, repair, or maintenance work includes or uses grooved pavement, abrupt lane edges, steel plates, or gravel or earth surfaces, the construction, repair, or maintenance zone must be posted with signs stating the condition, as required by current law, and in addition, must warn motorcyclists of the potential hazard only if the hazard or condition exists on a paved public highway, county road, street, bridge, or other thoroughfare commonly traveled. For the purposes of this subsection, the department shall adopt by rule a uniform sign or signs for this purpose, including at least the following language, "MOTORCYCLES USE EXTREME CAUTION."
1010.06(9) Oversized Vehicles The region Maintenance offices and the HQ Commercial Vehicle Services Office issue permits to allow vehicles that exceed the legal width, height, or weight limits to use certain routes. If a proposed work zone will reduce roadway width or vertical clearance, or have weight restrictions, adequate warning signs and notification to the HQ Commercial Vehicle Services Office and the appropriate region Maintenance Office is required as a minimum. When the total width of a roadway is to be reduced to less than 16 feet for more than three days, communication with these offices and any other stakeholders is required; include documentation in the Project File. The contract documents shall include provisions requiring the contractor to provide a 30-calendar-day notice prior to placing the restriction. In the permit notification, identify the type of restriction (height, weight, or width) and specify the maximum size that can be accommodated. On some projects, it may be necessary to designate a detour route for oversized vehicles. Oversized vehicles can sometimes be unexpected in work zones, even though warning and restriction or prohibition signs may be in place. Some oversized loads can overhang the temporary barrier or channelization devices and encroach on areas where workers are present. Assess the exposure of those within the work zone. Routes with high volumes of oversized loads or routes that are already strategic oversized load routes may not be able to rely only on warning or prohibition signs. Protective features or active early warning devices may be needed. Consider bridge height restrictions, signage of conditions or other bridge strike mitigation measures in cases where an oversized load has the potential to cause significant damage to structures or expose workers to injury. The structure design, staging, and falsework openings may need to be reconsidered to accommodate oversized loads passing through these structures without striking them.

1010.07 Temporary Traffic Control Devices FHWA regulations require that temporary traffic control devices be compliant with the 2016 edition of the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH) crash test requirements. In some cases, either the 2009 MASH or the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 350 compliant devices may be used. See Standard Specification 1-10.2(3) for more information.
1010.07(1) Channelizing Devices (Section Rewritten 2023)
Channelizing devices warn and guide road users through the work zone. They are used to channelize traffic away from the work area, pavement drop-offs, or opposing directions of traffic. Typical channelization devices and their dimensions are as follows: On freeways and multilane roadways 45 mph or higher, traffic safety drums are required on lane closure and lane shift tapers and recommended on the tangents. For restricted areas, 42-inch tall channelization devices may be used on tangents. When a single open lane is shifted onto the shoulder, the edge of the shoulder pavement shall be delineated with 28-inch traffic cones during hours of darkness. For one-lane, two-way traffic configurations using 28-inch traffic cones is recommended. Portable tubular markers are not a recommended device unless they are being used to separate 40 mph or less traffic and are located near or on existing pavement markings. Pavement-mounted tubular markers may be added to supplement long-term temporary pavement markings (such a double yellow centerline for two-lane, two-way traffic) but its color shall match the adjacent lane line. Longitudinal channelizing devices are interconnected devices that provide channelization with no gaps but are not approved positive protection devices. Barricades are a channelization device mostly used to supplement other channelization devices in traffic control operations involving road and ramp closures. Avoid using barricades to delineate sidewalk closure limits. Pedestrian channelization devices shall be used to delineate sidewalk closure limits and may be used to delineate pedestrian detour routes.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.07(2) Construction Signs Construction signs are used to regulate, warn or guide road users through a work zone. Class A construction signs are signs that remain in service throughout the construction or during a major phase of the work. They are mounted on posts, existing fixed structures, or substantial supports of a semi-permanent nature. Class A signs will be designated as such on the traffic control plan. Class B construction signs are those signs that are placed and removed daily/nightly or are used continuously in one location for durations extending up to 7 calendar days and are mounted on portable or temporary crashworthy mountings with a minimum mounting height of 1 foot. Temporary sign supports with 5-foot minimum mounting heights should be used when temporary signs are mounted behind channelizing device or in urban areas with roadside parking that may obstruct sign visibility. Construction signs need to be placed such that they do not obstruct active transportation facilities. See Chapter 1020 and the Standard Plans for signing details. Sign messages, color, configuration, and usage are shown in the MUTCD and the Sign Fabrication Manual. Existing signs may need to be covered, removed, or modified during construction.
1010.07(3) Warning Lights Warning lights are either flashing or steady burn and can be mounted on channelizing devices, barriers, and signs. Secure crashworthy mounting of warning lights is required. Except for special circumstances permitted by Region Transportation Operations, warning lights will be phased out completely by January 1, 2027.
•
•
•
Type A: Low-intensity flashing warning light used on a sign or barricade to warn road users during nighttime hours that they are approaching a work zone. Type B: High-intensity flashing warning light used on a sign or barricade to warn road users during both daytime and nighttime hours. Type C and Type D 360 degree: Steady-burn warning lights designed to operate 24 hours a day to delineate the edge of the roadway.
1010.07(4) Arrow Board (Sequential Arrow Sign) An arrow board is a sign with a matrix electronic display elements capable of either flashing or sequential displays. They are usually trailer mounted with solar power and batteries to energize the electronic displays. An arrow board with merge displays are required for lane closures on multilane roadways. When closing more than one lane, use an arrow board for each lane reduction. Place the arrow board at the beginning of the transition taper and out of the traveled way. The caution display (four corner lights) is only used for shoulder work or when within lane closures away from the merge tapers. Arrow boards are not used on two-lane, two-way roadways at flagger tapers or lateral shifts. These devices are not crashworthy and shall be removed when not in use or placed behind barrier or guardrail.
1010.07(5) Portable Changeable Message Signs (PCMS) PCMS have electronic displays that can be modified and programmed with specific messages and may be used to supplement other warning signs. These signs are usually trailer mounted with solar power and batteries to energize the electronic displays. A two-second display of two messages is the recommended method to provide time to motorists to read the sign’s message twice. These devices are not crashworthy and shall be removed when not in use or placed behind barrier or guardrail. PCMS are best used to provide notice of unexpected situations like the potential for traffic delays or queuing and to provide a notice of future closures or restrictions. PCMSs shall not be used in place of required signs.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.07(6) Portable Temporary Traffic Control Signals These versatile trailer-mounted portable signals are battery powered, with the ability to be connected to AC power. They can operate on fixed timing or be traffic actuated. They are typically used on two-lane two-way highways to alternate traffic in a single lane for extended durations. Portable signals work best when the length between signals are 1,500 feet maximum and no accesses lie between the temporary signals. Temporary stop bars, and lighting at the stop bars is required for signal use. For assistance on using these devices, contact Region Transportation Operations.
1010.07(7) Portable Highway Advisory Radio Highway Advisory Radio (HAR) can be used to broadcast AM radio messages about work zone traffic and travelrelated information. The system may be a permanently located transmitter or a portable trailer-mounted system that can be moved from location to location as necessary. Contact the region Transportation Operations Office for specific guidance and advice on the use of these systems.
1010.07(8) Automated Flagger Assistance Device An Automated Flagger Assistance Device (AFAD) is a flagging machine that is operated remotely by a flagger located off the roadway and away from traffic. This device is recommended on 45 MPH routes to support flagger safety especially on highways with reduced sight distance or limited escape routes. A traffic control plan is required for use of the AFAD and a flagger is required to operate each device. If used, a Red/Yellow lens AFAD is required, see the MUTCD for additional guidance on temporary traffic control zone devices.
1010.07(9) Radar Speed Display Sign RSDS are a work zone speed management device that display motorist’s speed in real time along with a regulatory speed limit sign or advisory speed sign mounted above the speed display. RSDS work best when a single lane of traffic remains open but may be used when multiple lanes are open. When multiple lanes are open in heavy traffic volume conditions, it may be unclear which vehicle’s speed is actually displayed. RSDS are not an automated speed enforcement speed, but a passive feedback system to drivers. Modest speed reductions of 3 to 6 mph have been recorded when used within an active work zone.
1010.08 Positive Protection Devices Channelizing devices will not provide worker and road user protection in some work zones. Positive protection devices such as temporary barriers, impact attenuators, transportable attenuators, and protective vehicles shall be considered per federal law (23 CFR Part 630 K). Unless Region Transportation Operations decides otherwise, situations when positive protection devices are required include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
In advance of work areas within shoulder and lane closures that are adjacent to vehicular traffic To separate opposing traffic traveling 45 mph and faster normally separated by a median or existing median barrier. Where existing traffic barriers or bridge railings are to be removed. For drop-off protection during widening or excavations (see Standard Specification 1-07.23(1)). When temporary slopes change clear zone requirements. For bridge falsework protection.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
When equipment or materials are to remain in the work zone clear zone. When newly constructed features in the clear zone will not have permanent protection until later in the project. Where temporary signs or light standards are not crashworthy. To separate workers from motorized traffic when work zone offers no means of escape for the worker, such as tunnels, bridges, and retaining walls, or for long-duration worker exposure within one lanewidth of high-volume traffic with speeds of 45 mph and faster.
1010.08(1) Temporary Barriers (Section Rewritten 2023) Temporary barriers are meant to reduce the overall severity of crashes, but do not prevent crashes or injuries from occurring nor will they restrain or redirect all vehicles in all conditions. Consequently, barriers should not be used unless a reduced crash severity potential is likely as barrier itself is a potential hazard. To use temporary barriers effectively and economically, it usually requires a long-duration (2 week or longer) stationary work zone to be cost effective as it will increase the traffic control costs of a project. The safety benefit versus the cost of using barrier requires careful consideration, and cost should not be the only or primary factor determining the use of barrier. Temporary barrier should be anchored or pinned per the standard plans when the lateral deflection space is reduced. Narrow base barrier shall always be anchored. When anchoring temporary barrier across existing bridge expansion joints, a special steel plate spanning a barrier opening over the expansion joint may be required to avoid damaging the structure; contact Bridge & Structures Office. The lateral deflection space (“slide distance”) of the traffic barrier must be shown on the staged traffic control plan, desirably using a cross-section. F-shape concrete barrier with scuppers (holes at the base of barrier to allow for storm water drainage off the roadway) may be needed depending on roadway hydraulics due to pooling water. See Chapter 5 in Hydraulics Manual. Temporary barrier should typically begin with a temporary impact attenuator and be laterally offset from the traveled way as far as feasible, then the barrier will be tapered toward the traveled way to the proposed lateral offset from the edge of traveled way. Consideration must be given to construction vehicles access to the work area (provide 10-foot wide construction access where feasible), location of existing barriers or guardrails and placement space for the temporary impact attenuator. It should begin a minimum 4 feet laterally from any retaining wall or existing barrier. When flared temporary barrier begins at the existing guardrail or existing barrier, a transition section is needed to connect them. Use Chapter 1610 for guidance and design criteria on traffic barriers. For temporary barrier, the permanent barrier design criteria apply to the extent practical and feasible with temporary modification to design elements may be modified as justified in the TMP. For example, an unanchored temporary precast concrete barrier deflection distance could be reduced to 1 foot (from 3 feet) for a temporary bypass with a 25-mph regulatory speed limit.
1010.08(1)(a) Concrete Barriers Concrete barriers are the safety-shape barriers (Type F, Type 2) shown in the Standard Plans. Safety-shape barriers can be unanchored or anchored. See Chapter 1610 for more detailed information on these barriers and their deflection characteristics.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.08(1)(b) Movable Barrier Systems Movable barriers are specially designed segmental barriers that can be moved laterally one lane width or more as a unit with specialized equipment. This allows strategies with frequent or daily relocation of a barrier. The ends of the barrier must be located out of the design clear zone or fitted with a temporary impact attenuator and storage sites at both ends of the barrier will be needed for the barrier-moving machine. WSDOT owns a limited quantity of this type of barrier for project use; however, the barrier moving machine must be leased. Contact HQworkzone@wsdot.wa.gov for additional information.
1010.08(1)(c) Portable Steel Barriers Portable steel barriers have a lightweight stackable design. They have options for gate-type openings and relocation without heavy equipment. Steel barriers can be unanchored or anchored per the manufacturer’s specifications. The lateral displacement of unanchored steel barriers from vehicle impacts typically ranges from 5 to 8 feet depending on manufacturer. The lateral displacement of anchored steel barriers from vehicle impacts typically ranges from 1 to 3 feet depending on manufacturer and anchor pinning arrangement. Steel barriers are proprietary items. See manufacturer website for more information.
1010.08(2) Temporary Impact Attenuators Within the Design Clear Zone, the approach ends of temporary barriers shall be fitted with impact attenuators on roadways 30 mph or faster. On roadways 25 mph or slower, a sloped concrete terminal is permitted. The information in Chapter 1620 provides all the necessary temporary impact attenuator performance and selection information. In addition to the guidance in Chapter 1620, consider the characteristics of the work zone when selecting an attenuator. Selection should consider site specific conditions and the dynamic nature of work zones throughout the project. Contract plans showing temporary impact attenuator placement need to include a list of the approved attenuators that a contractor may use for that installation. See the Attenuator Selection Template at: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/design/ProductFolder/Impact_attenuator_selection_template.xlsx
1010.08(3) Transportable Attenuators A transportable attenuator is a positive protection device attached to the rear of a large truck or as a trailer that can be positioned to provide protection for a work area just in front of the device after a proper roll ahead distance is provided in case of an impact. A transportable attenuator shall be used for active work areas when speeds are 45 mph and greater (except for alternating traffic controlled via flagger, AFAD, or temporary signal) when other positive protection devices are not in place.
1010.08(4) Protective Vehicles (New section 2023) A protective vehicle is typically a work truck (without an attenuator) that can be positioned to provide protection for a work area just in front of the vehicle after a proper roll ahead distance is provided in case of an impact. A protective vehicle is suitable for active work areas when speeds are 40 mph or less but may be used for any speed when alternating traffic is controlled via flagger, AFAD, or temporary signal. Protective vehicles may be used behind channelizing devices to block closed on-ramps.

1010.09 Other Traffic Control Devices or Features 1010.09(1) Delineation Temporary pavement markings will be required when permanent pavement markings are obliterated due to construction operations or temporary reconfigurations needed for long-term work zone strategies. Temporary pavement markings can be made using paint, preformed tape, or raised pavement markers. Complex projects will most likely require both long- and short-duration temporary markings. All temporary pavement markings are to be retroreflective and match permanent pavement marking colors. All conflicting pavement markings are to be completely removed. Temporary pavement markings are installed in accordance with the Standard Plans and Standard Specifications. Short-duration temporary pavement markings are made with materials intended for short-duration (up to two months) until permanent markings can be installed on paving and BST projects, or for short durations between construction stages. Short-duration temporary pavement markings are abbreviated patterns. Broken line patterns typically consist of a 4-foot line with a 36-foot gap for paint and tape markings but may be increased to a 10-foot line with a 30-foot gap when specified in the Contract. Short-duration broken line patterns consist of a grouping of three raised pavement markings at 3-foot spacing with a 34-foot gap. Short-duration traffic arrows, HOV symbols, and other markings mimic permanent marking standards. Edge lines and gore lines are not installed unless otherwise specified in the Contract. Flexible raised pavement markers are required for bituminous surface treatments but typically are not allowed on other pavement types. Temporary edge lines are installed only when specified in the plans. When specified, temporary edge lines are either solid lines or raised pavement markers at 5-foot spacing. Long-duration temporary pavement markings layouts will match permanent pavement marking standards and shall be used on projects spanning multiple seasons and/or wintering over. To enhance wet-weather visibility, long-duration temporary pavement markings should be supplemented with reflective Type 2 Raised Pavement Markers. Long-duration markings need to be detailed in the contract plans for installation and material type. Pre-formed tapes should be used on the final pavement surface to avoid leaving scars when removed. Lateral clearance markers are used at the angle points of barriers where they encroach on or otherwise restrict the adjacent shoulder. Barrier delineation is necessary where the barrier is less than 4 feet from the edge of traveled way and shall match the color of the adjacent edge line. Guideposts may be considered to aid nighttime driving through temporary alignments or diversions. (See Chapter 1030 for delineation requirements.)
1010.09(2) Screening Screening devices can be used to reduce motorists’ distraction due to construction activities adjacent to the traveled way. Consider screening when a highway operates near capacity during most of the day. Screening should be positioned behind traffic barriers to prevent impacts by errant vehicles and should be anchored or braced to resist overturning when buffeted by wind. Commercially available screening or contractor-built screening can be used, provided the device meets crashworthy criteria if exposed to traffic and is approved by the Engineer prior to installation. Glare screening may be required on concrete barriers separating two-way traffic to reduce headlight glare from oncoming traffic. Woven wire and vertical blade-type screens are commonly used in this installation. This screening also reduces the potential for motorist confusion at nighttime by shielding construction equipment and the headlights of other vehicles on adjacent roadways.

Make sure that motorists’ sight distance is not impaired by these glare screens. Contact the HQ Design Office and refer to AASHTO’s Roadside Design Guide for additional information on screening.
1010.09(3) Illumination Illumination might be justified if construction activities take place on the roadway at night for an extended period of time. Illumination might also be justified for long-term construction projects at the following locations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Road closures with detours or diversions. Median crossovers on freeways. Complex or temporary alignment or channelization. Haul road crossings (if operational at night). Temporary traffic signals. Temporary ramp connections. Projects with lane shifts and restricted geometrics. Projects with existing illumination that needs to be removed as part of the construction process.
Illumination is required when:
•
•
Traffic flow is split around or near an obstruction. Flaggers are necessary for nighttime construction activities (supplemental lighting of the flagger stations by use of portable light plants or other approved methods). Refer to Standard Specification 1-10.3(1)A.
For information on light levels and other electrical design requirements, see Chapter 1040.
1010.09(4) Signals A permanent signal system can be modified for a temporary configuration such as temporary pole locations during intersection construction, span wire systems, and adjustment of signal heads and alternative detection systems to accommodate a construction stage (see Chapter 1330).
1010.09(5) Smart Work Zone Systems (SWZS) A Smart Work Zone System (SWZS) uses real time information to optimize the safety and efficiency of traffic through the work zone and should be considered on long term closures with recurring work zone queuing exceeding 3 miles. SWZS can provide information such as queue detection for “slowed or stopped traffic ahead” messaging before motorists sees brake lights, merging instructions (zipper merging where motorists are instructed to use all open lanes up to the merge point and take turns merging) to reduce the queue lengths, or travel time information so drivers can choose alternate routes. A SWZS may be limited to the highway approaching the work area or a more complex highway network system to manage regional impacts from the projects mobility impacts. Portable equipment used in a SWZS may include portable changeable message signs, portable roadside traffic sensors and cameras that communicate wirelessly through a web-based central management platform. Predetermined messages will be displayed on the changeable message signs approaching a work area based on traffic data from the portable sensors also placed approaching the work area. A SWZS technician will install, program, and monitor the system. A simplified version of a SWZS, A Queue Warning System (QWS) should be considered for daily, nightly, or weekend long closures for warning of non-recurring work zone queuing up to 3 miles.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
As a minimum, A PCMS should be positioned in advance of a lane closure with messages about queuing when they are present and relocated as needed by a traffic control supervisor. Refer to the Traffic Manual for additional information and guidance on work zone queuing mitigation.
1010.10 Traffic Control Plan Development and PS&E WSDOT projects need to include plans and payment items for controlling traffic based on a strategy that is consistent with the project construction elements, even though there may be more than one workable strategy. A constructible and biddable method of temporary traffic control is the goal. The contractor has the option of adopting the contract plans or proposing an alternative method.
1010.10(1) Traffic Control Plans “Typical” traffic control plans are generic in nature and are not intended to address all site conditions. They are intended for use at multiple work locations when they can be applied with little or no modifications to address site conditions. They include spacing tables to address different roadway speeds. Typical plans may be all that are needed for basic paving projects. Some typical plans are located at: Design - Work Zone Typical Traffic Control Plans | WSDOT (wa.gov) “Project-specific” traffic control plans are typical-type plans that have been modified to fit a specific project or roadway condition. Dimension lines for signs and device placement provide the distances based on the regulatory speed limit, and only minimal spacing tables should remain; the lane and roadway configuration may also be modified to match the project conditions. “Site-specific” traffic control plans are drawn for a specific location. Scaled base data drawn plans will be the most accurate as device placement and layout considerations can be resolved by the designer; however, schematic plans are also permitted. Making a “project-specific” plan applicable for a site-specific location is another option if the device layout will match the site-specific location since the plan is usually not to scale. “Staged Traffic” plan should be used for temporary alignment and channelization for long-duration traffic control. For additional information, see Division 4 of the Plans Preparation Manual. The following plans, in addition to the TCP types above addressing the TTC strategies, may be included in the PS&E.
1010.10(1)(a) Construction Sign Plan Show Class A Construction Signs that will remain in place for the duration of the project located by either station or milepost. Verify the locations to avoid conflicts with existing signing or other roadway features. These locations may still be subject to movement in the field to fit specific conditions. For simple projects these signs are often shown on the vicinity map sheet.
1010.10(1)(b) Construction Sign Specification Sheet Provide a Class A Construction Sign Specifications sheet on complex or staged projects. Include location, post information, and notes for Standard Plans or other specific sign information and sign details.
1010.10(1)(c) Quantity Tabulation Sheets Quantity Tabulation sheets are recommended for barrier and attenuator items and temporary pavement markings on projects with large quantities of these items or for staged construction projects.

Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.10(1)(d) Traffic Control Plan Index An Index sheet is a useful tool for projects that contain a large quantity of traffic control plans and multiple work operations at various locations throughout the project. The Index sheet provides the contractor a quick referencing tool indicating the applicable traffic control plan for the specific work operation.
1010.10(1)(e) Construction Sequence Plans Sequence plans are placed early in the plan set and are intended to show the proposed construction stages and the work required for each stage. They should refer to the corresponding TCPs for the traffic control details of each stage.
1010.10(1)(f) Temporary Signal Plan The temporary signal plan will follow conventions used to develop permanent signals (as described in Chapter 1330) but will be designed to accommodate temporary needs and work operations in order to prevent conflicts with construction operations. If channelization has been temporarily revised then opposing left-turn clearances should be maintained as described in Chapter 1310, or signal timing should be adjusted to accommodate the revision. Some existing systems can be maintained using temporary span wires for signal heads and video, microwave actuation, or timed control.
1010.10(1)(g) Temporary Illumination Plan Full lighting is normally provided through traffic control areas where power is available. The temporary illumination plan will follow conventions used to develop permanent illumination (as described in Chapter 1040) but will be designed to accommodate temporary needs and work operations so that there will be no conflicts with construction operations.
1010.10(2) Contract Specifications Work hour restrictions for lane closure operations are to be specifically identified for each project where traffic impacts are expected and liquidated damages need to be applied to the contract. Refer to the Plans Preparation Manual for additional information on writing traffic control specifications.
1010.10(3) Cost Estimating Temporary traffic control devices and traffic control labor can be difficult to estimate. There is no way of knowing how many operations a contractor may implement at the same time. The best method is to follow the working day estimate schedule and the TCPs that will be used for each operation. Temporary signs and devices will be used on many plans, but the estimated quantity reflects the most used at any one time. A lump sum item can be used to pay for temporary traffic control when an assessment of the cost risk associated with that approach indicates that the traffic control operation is sufficiently well defined. Criteria to use in the assessment include the number and complexity of planned intersection, interchange, mainline, transit, bicycle, pedestrian, and other high impact closures; rolling slowdowns; multiple work shifts; and roadway detours. A template for assessing risk is available at the design support webpage www.wsdot.wa.gov/design/support/.
1010.11 Training and Resources Temporary traffic control-related training is an important component in an effective work zone safety and mobility program. Federal regulations require that those involved in the development, design, implementation, operation, inspection, and enforcement be trained at a level consistent with their responsibilities. Contact the State Work Zone Engineer at HQWorkZone@wsdot.wa.gov for training options. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Signing Exhibit 1020-1 Reflective Sheeting Requirements for Overhead Signs Exhibit 1020-2 Timber Posts Exhibit 1020-3 Wide Flange Steel Posts Exhibit 1020-4 Square Steel Posts
1020.01 General The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) uses signing as the primary mechanism for regulating, warning, and guiding traffic. Signing must be in place when any section of highway is open to the motoring public. Each highway project has unique and specific signing requirements. For statewide signing uniformity and continuity, it is sometimes necessary to provide signing beyond the project limits. Design characteristics of the facility determine the size and legend for a sign. As the design speed increases, larger sign sizes are necessary to provide adequate message comprehension time. The MUTCD, the Traffic Manual, and the Sign Fabrication Manual contain standard sign dimensions, specific legends, and reflective sheeting types for all new signs. Guide signing provides the motorist with directional information to destinations. This information is always presented in a consistent manner. In some cases, there are specific laws, regulations, and policies governing the content of the messages on these signs. All proposed guide signs for a project require the approval of the region Traffic Engineer. The use of nonstandard signs is strongly discouraged and their use requires the approval of the State Traffic Engineer. Apply the following criteria when determining whether to replace or modify existing signs:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Current sign’s service life is reached Lack of nighttime retroreflectivity Substantial damage, vandalism, or deterioration Replace existing signs with either Type I or Type II sheeting Change in sign use policy Improper location Message or destination changes necessary to satisfy commitments to public or local agencies Substandard mounting height Change in jurisdiction (for example, a county road becomes a state route)
Address sign support breakaway features in accordance with Chapter 1600.
1020.02 Design Components 1020.02(1) Location The MUTCD contains the guidelines for positioning signs. Check sign locations to ensure the motorist’s view of the sign is not obscured by other roadside appurtenances. Also, determine whether the proposed sign will obstruct the view of other signs or limit the motorist’s sight distance of the roadway. Reposition existing signs, when necessary, to satisfy these visibility requirements. Where possible, locate signs behind existing traffic barriers, on grade separation structures, or where terrain features will minimize their exposure to errant vehicles.

Signing
Longitudinal Placement
The MUTCD and the Traffic Manual provide guidelines for the longitudinal placement of signs that are dependent on the type of sign. Select a location to fit the existing conditions to provide for visibility and adequate response time. In most cases, signs can be shifted longitudinally to enhance safety without compromising their intended purpose.
1020.02(3) Lateral Clearance The Standard Plans and the MUTCD contain minimum requirements for the lateral placement of signs. Where possible, position the signs at the maximum feasible lateral clearance for safety and reduced maintenance costs. Locate large guide signs and motorist information signs beyond the Design Clear Zone (see Chapter 1600) where limited right of way or other physical constraints are not a factor. On steep fill slopes, an errant vehicle is likely to be partially airborne from the slope break near the edge of shoulder to a point 12 feet down the slope. When signs are placed on fill slopes steeper than 6H:1V, locate the support at least 12 feet beyond the slope break. Use breakaway sign support features, when required, for signs located within the Design Clear Zone and for signs located beyond this zone where there is a possibility they might be struck by an errant vehicle. Breakaway features are not necessary on signposts located behind traffic barriers. Install longitudinal barriers to shield signs without breakaway features within the Design Clear Zone when no other options are available. Sign bridges and cantilever sign structures have limited span lengths. Locate the vertical components of these structures as far from the traveled way as possible and, where appropriate, install traffic barriers (see Chapter 1610). Do not locate signposts in the bottom of a ditch or where the posts will straddle the ditch. The preferred location is beyond the ditch or on the ditch backslope (see the Standard Plans). In high-fill areas where conditions require placement of a sign behind a traffic barrier, consider adding embankment material to reduce the length of the sign supports.
1020.02(4) Sign Heights For ground-mounted signs installed at the side of the road, provide a mounting height of at least 7 feet, measured from the bottom of the sign to the edge of traveled way. Supplemental plaques, when used, are mounted directly below the primary sign. At these locations, the minimum mounting height of the plaque is 5 feet. Do not attach supplemental guide signs to the posts below the hinge mechanism or the saw cut notch on multiple-post installations. The location of these hinges or saw cuts on the sign supports are shown in the Standard Plans. A minimum 7-foot vertical height from the bottom of the sign to the ground directly below the sign is necessary for the breakaway features of the sign support to function properly when struck by a vehicle. The minimum mounting height for new signs located behind longitudinal barriers is 7 feet, measured from the bottom of the sign to the edge of traveled way. A lower mounting height of 5 feet may be used when replacing a sign panel on an existing sign assembly located behind the longitudinal barrier. The Standard Plans shows typical sign installations.

Page 1020-2
Chapter 1020
Signing
For ground-mounted signs installed on multiple posts that are a minimum of 12 feet from the edge of traveled way in cut sections, the minimum height clearance between the sign and the ground for the post farther from the edge of traveled way is as follows:
•
•
For slopes 2H:1V and steeper, the minimum height clearance is 2 feet. For slopes 3H:1V or flatter, the minimum height clearance is 7 feet.
Signs used to reserve parking for people with disabilities are installed at each designated parking stall and are mounted 7 feet above the surface at the sign location.
1020.02(5) Foundations Foundation details for timber and steel ground-mounted sign supports are shown in the Standard Plans, which also contains foundation designs for truss-type sign bridges and cantilever sign structures. Three designs, Types 1, 2, and 3, are shown for each structure. An investigation of the foundation material is necessary to determine the appropriate foundation design. Use the data obtained from the geotechnical report to select the foundation type.
•
•
•
The Type 1 foundation design uses a large concrete shaft and is the preferred installation when the lateral bearing pressure of the soil is 2,500 psf or greater. The Type 2 foundation design has a large rectangular footing design and is an alternative to the Type 1 foundation when the concrete shaft is not suitable. The Type 3 foundation design is used in poorer soil conditions where the lateral bearing pressure of the soil is between 1,500 psf and 2,500 psf.
If a nonstandard foundation or monotube structure design is planned, forward the report to the Headquarters (HQ) Bridge and Structures Office for use in developing a suitable foundation design (see Chapter 610).
1020.02(6) Signposts Ground-mounted signs are installed on either timber posts or steel posts. The size and number of posts required for a sign installation are based on the height and surface area of the sign, or signs, being supported. Use the information in Exhibit 1020-2, Exhibit 1020-3, and Exhibit 1020-4 and the Standard Plans to determine the posts required for each installation. Coordinate with the region Maintenance Office concerning signpost installation. Use steel posts with breakaway supports that are multidirectional if the support is likely to be hit from more than one direction. For any wide flange multiple-steel post installations located within the Design Clear Zone, the total weight of all the posts in a 7-foot-wide path is not to exceed a combined post weight of 34 lbs/foot. Use the Wide Flange Beam Weights table in Exhibit 1020-3 to determine wide flange steel post weights. If the proposed sign configuration does not meet the weight criterion, relocate, resize, or provide barrier protection for the proposed installation. All signposts are to be designed to 90 mph wind loads. Design features of breakaway supports are shown in the Standard Plans. Steel signposts commonly used are: Perforated Square Steel Tube (PSST); Square Steel Tube (SST); Round Pipe (RP); and Wide Flange "H-Beam." Steel posts with Type TP-A, TP-B, PL, PL-T, PL-U, AS, AP, SB-1, and SB-2 bases have multidirectional breakaway features.

Signing
1020.03 Overhead Installation Guidance on the use of overhead sign installations is provided in the MUTCD. Where possible, mount overhead signs on grade separation structures rather than sign bridges or cantilever supports. Details for the construction of truss-type sign bridges and cantilever sign supports are shown in the Standard Plans. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office designs structure-mounted sign mountings, monotube sign bridges, and monotube cantilever sign supports. For overhead sign installation designs, provide sign dimensions, horizontal location in relation to the roadway, and location of the lighting fixtures to facilitate design of the mounting components by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. Provide existing and proposed sign dimensions to the Bridge Preservation Office for review when replacing or modifying any overhead sign.
1020.03(1) Illumination The retroreflectivity of currently approved sign sheeting removes the need to provide illumination for sign installations. Sign lights for existing illuminated overhead and ground-mounted signs can be de-energized and removed when the retroreflective sheeting is adequate for nighttime legibility, or the existing sign is replaced with a new sign (see Exhibit 1020-1 for sheeting requirements). A nighttime assessment of all nonilluminated overhead signs within the project limits is required (contact the Region Traffic Office). Replace all signs that have inadequate retroreflectivity. In situations where a nonhighway light source interferes with a sign’s legibility, consider relocating the sign. Where a new overhead sign is being installed adjacent to an existing sign with sign lights, all other signs on the structure shall be replaced unless they meet current sheeting requirements (see Exhibit 1020-1). The existing sign lights shall then be de-energized by physical disconnection of the sign lighting wiring from the circuit or service cabinet, by maintenance as part of the project. On projects where there is additional electrical work, deenergized sign lights shall be removed and wiring shall be removed back to the point where the sign lighting circuit connects to any part of the lighting circuit to remain, or to the service cabinet, as appropriate. Replace any splices where a circuit branch is removed from the splice point. Overhead sign lights shall not be used. Where overhead sign visibility is less than 800 feet due to intervening sight obstructions such as highway structures or roadside features, roadside illumination may be considered to supplement reduced retroreflectivity from headlights. Overhead signs located within an area of continuous highway illumination are considered sufficiently illuminated. New overhead sign structures shall not be installed where a light standard (pole) will be within 50 feet of the front of the sign. New overhead sign structures may be installed where a light standard will be within 50 feet of the back of the sign only if a lighting analysis has been conducted to show that the light obstruction from the sign will not result in light levels outside of the requirements of Chapter 1040 for the applicable lighting design area type.

1020.03(2) Vertical Clearance The minimum vertical clearance from the roadway surface to the lowest point of an overhead sign assembly is 17 feet 6 inches. The minimum vertical clearance from the roadway surface to the lowest point of an overhead sign assembly without sign light(s) is 19 feet 6 inches. The maximum clearance is 21 feet. Vertically unbalanced mountings should be avoided on all overhead sign structures. Provide existing and proposed sign dimensions to the Bridge Preservation Office for review when replacing or modifying existing overhead signs. Contact the HQ Traffic Office regarding signs under bridges and in tunnels.
1020.03(3) Horizontal Placement Consider roadway geometrics and anticipated traffic characteristics when locating signs above the lane(s) to which they apply. Install advance guide signs/exit direction signs that require an EXIT ONLY and “down arrow” panel directly above the drop lanes. To reduce driver confusion about which lane is being dropped, avoid locating a sign with an EXIT ONLY panel on a horizontal curve.
1020.03(4) Service Walkways Walkways are provided on structure-mounted signs, truss-type sign bridges, and truss-type cantilever sign supports where roadway and traffic conditions prohibit normal sign maintenance activities. Monotube sign bridges/cantilever sign supports normally do not have service walkways. Vandalism of signs, particularly in the form of graffiti, can be a major problem in some areas. Vandals sometimes use the service walkways and vandalize the signs. Maintenance costs for cleaning or replacing the vandalized signs at these locations can exceed the benefit of providing the service walkway.
1020.04 State Highway Route Numbers For state routes, RCW 47.36.095 authorizes WSDOT to sign state highways using a system of state route numbers assigned to eliminate duplication of numbers. This numbering system follows the system employed by the federal government in the assignment of Interstate and U.S. routes: odd numbers indicate general northsouth routes and even numbers indicate general east-west routes.
1020.05 Mileposts Milepost markers are a part of a statewide system for all state highways and are installed in accordance with Executive Order E 1064, “State Route Mileposts,” and Chapter 2 of the Traffic Manual. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Signing
1020.06 Guide Sign Plan A preliminary guide sign plan is developed to identify existing and proposed guide signing on state highways and is reviewed by the region Traffic Engineer. Preliminary guide signs for Interstate routes are to be furnished to the HQ Traffic Office for review and concurrence. The plan provides an easily understood graphic representation of the signing and its continuity to motorist destinations, activities, and services. It is also used to identify deficiencies or poorly defined routes of travel. A guide sign plan for safety and mobility Improvement projects is desirable. When proposed highway work affects signing to a city or town, the guide sign plan can be furnished to the official governing body for review and consideration. The guide sign plan is reviewed and approved by the region Traffic Engineer.

1030.01 General The primary function of delineation is to provide the visual information needed by a driver to operate a vehicle in a variety of situations. Delineation includes the marking of highways with painted or more durable pavement marking lines and symbols, guideposts, and other devices such as curbs. These devices can use retroreflectance, which is the reflecting of light from a vehicle’s headlights back to the driver, to enhance an object’s visibility at nighttime. Delineation is a required design element (see Chapter 1105) on most projects. A decision to omit delineation is possible if the existing delineation is unaffected by construction and a safety performance evaluation (see Chapter 321) clearly shows that delineation is not a contributing factor to crashes. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) uses the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) as a guide for the design, location, and application of delineation. Consult with the region Traffic Office early in the design process to ensure the proposed delineation is compatible with current WSDOT policy and guidance regarding types of markings and material selection.

1030.03 Pavement Markings 1030.03(1) Pavement Marking Types Pavement markings have specific functions: they guide the movement of traffic, and they promote increased safety performance. In some cases, they are used to supplement the messages of other traffic control devices. In other cases, markings are the only way to convey a message without distracting the driver. Pavement markings are intended to provide adequate performance year-round. Guidelines for the application of various pavement markings are provided in the Standard Plans Section M and the MUTCD.

1030.03(1)(a) Longitudinal Pavement Markings Longitudinal pavement markings define the boundary between opposing traffic flows, and they identify the edges of traveled way, multiple traffic lanes, turn lanes, and special-use lanes. The Standard Plans Section M shows the dimensions of longitudinal pavement markings. Longitudinal pavement markings are as follows: Barrier Centerline: A very wide—18 inches minimum, usually 20 inches: five 4-inch lines—solid yellow line or a combination of two single 4-inch solid yellow lines with yellow crosshatching between the lines, with a total width not less than 18 inches, used to separate opposing traffic movements where all movements over the line are prohibited. Barrier centerline locations require the approval of the region Traffic Engineer and Access Engineer. Centerline: A broken yellow line used to separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions, where passing in the opposing lane is allowed. Dotted Extension Line: A broken white or yellow line that is an extension of an edge line or centerline used at exit ramps, intersections on horizontal curves, multiple turn lanes, and other locations where the direction of travel for through or turning traffic is unclear. Double Centerline: Two parallel solid yellow lines used to separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions where passing in the opposing lane is prohibited. Double Lane Line: Two solid white lines used to separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction where crossing the lane line marking is prohibited. Double Wide Lane Line: Two solid wide white lines used to separate a concurrent preferential lane of traffic where crossing is prohibited. Drop Lane Line: A wide broken white line used in advance of a wide line to delineate a lane that ends at an offramp or intersection. Edge Line: A solid white or yellow line used to define the outer edges of the traveled way. Edge lines are not required where curbs or sidewalks are 4 feet or less from the traveled way. Lane Line: A broken white line used to separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. No-Pass Line: A solid yellow line used in conjunction with a centerline where passing in the opposing lane is prohibited. Reversible Lane Line: Two broken yellow lines used to delineate a lane where traffic direction is periodically reversed. Solid Lane Line: A solid white line used to separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction where crossing the lane line marking is discouraged. Two-Way Left-Turn Centerline: Two yellow lines, one solid and one broken, used to delineate each side of a two-way left-turn lane. Wide Broken Lane Line: A wide broken white line used to designate a portion of a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane located on a divided highway where general-purpose vehicles may enter to make an exit. Wide Dotted Lane Line: A wide broken white line used to designate a portion of a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV), or business access and transit (BAT) lane located on an arterial highway where general-purpose vehicles may enter to make a turn at an intersection.

Delineation
Wide Lane Line: A wide solid white line used to separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction, at ramp connections, storage lanes at intersections, and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, or at business access and transit (BAT) lanes, bike lanes, and other preferential lanes where crossing is discouraged. See MUTCD Chapter 3B for further information for these markings.
1030.03(1)(b) Transverse Pavement Markings Transverse pavement markings define pedestrian crossings and vehicle stopping points at intersections. They are also used to warn motorists of approaching conditions, required vehicular maneuvers, or lane usage. See the Standard Plans Section M for details of some of these pavement markings. Typical transverse pavement markings are as follows: Access Parking Space Symbol: A white marking used to designate parking stalls provided for motorists with disabilities. The marking may have an optional blue background and white border. Aerial Surveillance Marker: White markings used at one-mile and one-half-mile intervals on sections of highways where the State Patrol uses airplanes to enforce speed limits. Bicycle Lane Symbol: A white marking consisting of a symbol of a bicyclist and an arrow used in a marked bike lane. The bicycle lane symbol is to be placed immediately after an intersection and at other locations as needed (see the MUTCD). Typical spacing is 500 feet, with a maximum distance of 1,500 feet. Crosswalk Line: A series of parallel solid white lines used to define a pedestrian crossing. Drainage Marking: A white line used to denote the location of a catch basin, grate inlet, or other drainage feature in the shoulder of a roadway. HOV Symbol: A white diamond marking used for high-occupancy vehicle lanes. The spacing of the markings is an engineering judgment based on the conditions of use. Typical spacing is 1000 feet for divided highways and 500 feet for arterial highways. Railroad Crossing Symbol: A white marking used in advance of a railroad crossing where grade crossing signals or gates are located or where the posted speed of the highway is 40 mph or higher. Stop Line: A solid white line used to indicate the stopping point at an intersection or railroad crossing. Traffic Arrow: A white marking used in storage lanes and two-way left-turn lanes to denote the direction of turning movement. Arrows are also used at ramp terminals and intersections on divided highways to discourage wrong-way movements. Traffic Letters: White markings forming word messages, such as “ONLY,” used in conjunction with a traffic arrow at drop-lane situations. Traffic letters are not required for left- and right-turn storage lanes where the intended use of the lane is obvious. Wide Line: A wide solid line used for traffic islands, hash marks, chevrons, and other applications. A wide line used in conjunction with a centerline marking shall be yellow. A wide line used in conjunction with a lane line or right edge line marking shall be white. Yield Line Markings: A series of white triangular markings indicating that the lane yields.
1030.03(2) Pavement Marking Materials Pavement markings are applied using various materials. These materials are divided into two categories: paint and plastic. When selecting the pavement marking material to use in a project, consider the initial cost of the material and its durability; the location; the traffic conditions; the snow and ice removal practices of the particular maintenance area; and the region’s ability to maintain the markings.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1030-3
Chapter 1030
Delineation
Both painted and plastic pavement markings can accomplish the goal of providing a visible (daytime) and retroreflective (nighttime) pavement marking at the completion of a contract. The difference between the two marking materials is the projected durability of the markings. Paint used on sections of highway subjected to high traffic volumes and/or snow-removal operations might have a durability of only two to three months. Maintenance crews cannot restripe a highway during winter months; therefore, if a painted marking wears out prematurely, the highway will not have a stripe until maintenance crews can restripe in April or May. When these conditions are encountered in a highway project, consider a more durable plastic marking material and application type that will provide the desired durability for the marking. Check with your region Traffic Office for any specific pavement marking policy. For the recommended pavement marking material for different highway types and snow-removal practices, see Exhibit 1030-1. Consult with the region’s Traffic and Maintenance offices to select the best material for the project.
1030.03(2)(a) Paint Paint is the most common pavement marking material. It is relatively easy to apply and dries quickly (30–90 seconds in warm, dry weather) after application. This allows the application to be a moving operation, which minimizes traffic control costs and delays to the roadway users. On construction contracts, paint is applied with two coats: the first coat is 10 mils thick, followed by a second coat 15 mils thick. The disadvantage of using paint as a pavement marking material is its limited durability when subjected to traffic abrasion, sanding, or snowremoval activities. Specify paint only where it will have a durability that will provide a retroreflective stripe until maintenance crews can repaint the line and extend its usefulness until the next repainting. Paint is one of two material types dependent upon the solids carrier: solvent or water. The designer is encouraged to specify waterborne paint. Solvent paint is subject to a monetary penalty because it contains a high level of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). There is an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act penalty assessed on solvent paint that is passed on to those who purchase solvent paint in quantity. Durable waterborne paint or high-build waterborne paint is formulated to allow application thicknesses greater than 15 mils. It is more durable than standard waterborne paint and provides additional service life. The additional thickness permits the use of larger beads that enhance wet night retroreflectivity. Low-temperature waterborne paint is intended to extend the paint season later into the fall, although it may also be used earlier in the spring. The paint is formulated for application temperatures of 35° Fahrenheit and rising, though durability can be affected when applied during conditions where standard waterborne paint could have been used.
1030.03(2)(b) Plastic Plastic markings have a higher installation cost than paint. They can, however, be a more cost-effective measure than paint because of their longer service life. Plastic marking materials may provide a year-round retroreflective pavement marking, while paint may not last until the next restriping. Plastic marking materials currently listed in the Standard Specifications include the following:
i Type A: Liquid Hot Applied Thermoplastic Thermoplastic material consists of resins and filler materials in solid form at room temperature. The material is heated to a semiliquid, molten state (400° Fahrenheit) and is then applied to the roadway by spray or extrusion methods. This material can be used for both transverse and longitudinal line applications. Special equipment is required for both the initial application and subsequent maintenance renewal. Sprayed material can be applied at a thickness of 30 mils and dries in 30 to 60 seconds.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1030-4
Chapter 1030
Delineation
The durability of material applied in this manner is slightly longer than that of paint. Extruded material is applied at a thickness of 125 mils and has a drying time of 15 minutes. This material can be applied as a flat line or applied with ridges or profiles (bumps) that enhance wet night visibility. These profiles produce a rumble effect similar to raised pavement markers when a vehicle crosses over the marking. (Profiles come in the shape of a raised bar at set intervals and are formed simultaneously with the extruded baseline.)
ii Type B: Preformed Fused Thermoplastic This material consists of a mixture of pigment, fillers, resins, and beads that are factory produced in sheet form, 125 mils thick. The material is applied by heating (drying) the pavement and top heating the material. The heating process fuses the preformed thermoplastic material to the pavement surface. These materials, which are used for transverse markings, are available in white, red, blue, and other colors.
iii Type C: Cold Applied Preformed Tape Preformed tape is composed of thermoplastic or other materials that are fabricated under factory conditions. After curing, the material is cut to size and shipped to the work site in rolls or in flat pieces. The material is then applied to the roadway with an adhesive on the underside of the tape. Preformed tape is available in 60, 90, or 125 mils (WSDOT does not currently specify 125 mil tape.) The most durable application of preformed tape is achieved when the tape is either inlaid (rolled) into hot asphalt with the top of the tape flush with the surface of the pavement or placed in a groove cut into the pavement surface with the top of the tape slightly below the surface of the pavement. ASTM has classified preformed tape into two categories: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 tape has a profiled surface and a requirement to have a retroreflectivity of over 500 mcd/m2/lux. Type 1 tape has proven to be very durable. It is used on high-volume, high-speed highways. Type 2 tape has a flat surface and a requirement to have a retroreflectivity of over 250 mcd/ m2/lux. Field tests show that Type 2 tape has a shorter durability than Type 1 tape.
iv Type D: Liquid Cold Applied Methyl Methacrylate (MMA) Methyl methacrylate can be applied by either spraying or extrusion. Sprayed applications can be one or two coats, 30 to 45 mils thick. Extruded applications are 90 mils thick for asphalt concrete pavement or Portland cement concrete pavement, or 120 mils thick for open-graded asphalt pavement. MMA can also be extruded using specialized equipment to produce a textured line 150 mils thick. The material is not heated and can be applied within an approximate temperature range of 40° to 105° Fahrenheit, provided the pavement surface is dry. The material can be used for both transverse and longitudinal applications. The material can also be applied with profiles (bumps) that slightly enhance wet night retroreflectivity. The profiles also produce a rumble effect similar to raised pavement markers.
1030.03(2)(c) Beads Glass beads are small glass spheres used in highway markings to provide the necessary retroreflectivity. The beads are dropped onto the wet marking material immediately after it is applied (drop-on beads) or premixed into the wet marking material. Proper installation of glass beads is critical to achieving good pavement marking retroreflectivity. Each glass bead works like a light-focusing lens, reflecting light back to the driver. Glass beads are embedded into the pavement marking material; for optimum performance, the bead is embedded between 55% and 60% of its diameter. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1030-5
Chapter 1030
Delineation
Large glass and composite beads are effective when roads are wet. Large glass or composite beads are not appropriate for standard mil paint as the paint is too thin to properly embed the large glass or composite beads; therefore, WSDOT specifies small glass or composite beads for such paint applications. The use of large glass or composite beads is limited to high-build waterborne paint and other materials with a thickness of at least 22 mils.
1030.03(3) Pavement Marking Application Types There are five application types used for pavement markings. Most pavement marking applications are applied directly to the pavement surface. In steel bit snow plowing areas, the pavement markings may be inlaid or grooved to protect the markings. Because they are higher than the surrounding pavement surface, pavement markings are subject to rapid wear caused by traffic and snowplows. As they wear, they lose visibility and retroreflectivity, particularly in wet weather. Wear on the stripes can be greatly reduced and their durability considerably increased by placing them in a shallow groove in the surface of the pavement.
1030.03(3)(a) Application Types The five application types for pavement markings are:
i Flat Lines Flat lines are pavement marking lines with a flat surface.
ii Profiled Marking A profiled pavement marking consists of a baseline thickness and a profiled thickness, which is a portion of the pavement marking line that is applied at a greater thickness than the baseline thickness. Profiles are applied using the extruded method in the same application as the baseline. The profiles may be slightly rounded if the minimum profile thickness is provided for the entire length of the profile. (See the Standard Plans M-20.20 for the construction details.)
iii Embossed Plastic Line Embossed plastic lines consist of a flat line with transverse grooves. An embossed plastic line may also have profiles. (See the Standard Plans M-20.20 for the construction details.)
iv Inlaid Plastic Line Inlaid plastic line is constructed by rolling Type C tape into hot mix asphalt (HMA) with the finish roller. This application is used infrequently by WSDOT and is not in the Standard Specifications.
v Grooved Plastic Line Grooved plastic line is constructed by cutting a groove into the pavement surface and spraying, extruding, or gluing pavement marking material into the groove. The groove depth is dependent upon the material used, the pavement surface, and the location. The groove is typically in the range of 20 to 250 mils deep and 4 inches wide. Coordinate with the region Traffic Office on the use and dimensions of grooved plastic line marking.

1030.03(4) Raised Pavement Markers Raised pavement markers (RPMs) are installed as positioning guides with long line pavement markings. They can also be installed as a complete substitution for certain long line markings. RPMs have a durability of two years, and they provide good wet night visibility and a rumble effect. RPMs are made from plastic materials and are available in three different types:
•
•
•
Type 1 markers are 4 inches in diameter, ¾ inch high, and non-reflectorized. Type 2 markers are 4 inches wide, 4 inches long, ¾ inch high, and reflectorized. Type 3 markers are 6, 8, 10, or 12 inches wide, 4 inches long, ¾ inch high, and non-reflectorized.
Type 2 RPMs are not used as a substitute for right edge lines. They may be used to supplement the right edge line markings at lane reductions, at sections with reduced lane widths such as narrow structures, and at the gore of exit ramps. All other applications supplementing right edge line markings require the approval of the region Traffic Engineer. Red-backed RPMs are not desired and thus are only used at the discretion of the Region Traffic Engineer for specific locations. Research regarding their effectiveness for addressing wrong-way driving has been inconclusive to date. Type 3 RPMs are used in locations where additional emphasis is desired, including vehicle separations and islands. Obtain approval by the region Traffic Engineer for all installations of Type 3 RPMs. Retain approval in the Design Documentation Package. Reflectorized RPMs are not required for centerline and lane line applications in continuously illuminated sections of highway. However, if illumination policies (see Chapter 1040) affect a section of limited access roadway, coordinate with the region Traffic Engineer for RPM placement details. If reflectorized RPMs are used at an intersection within an illuminated section, they are also to be used throughout that section. For raised pavement marker application details, see the Standard Plans.
1030.03(5) Recessed Raised Pavement Markers Recessed raised pavement markers (RRPMs) are raised pavement markers (RPMs) installed in a groove ground into the pavement in accordance with the Standard Plans. RRPMs provide guidance similar to RPMs in ice chisel and steel blade snow-removal areas. RRPMs can also be used in rubber or Cooper-style blade snow-removal areas in accordance with region policy. Designers should be aware that the performance of RRPMs can be compromised, especially on curves, because the groove can block motorists’ view of the markers. Also, the groove for RRPMs installed on flat grades can fill with water during rain events and cause the RRPM to be non-reflective. RRPMs, when specified, are installed at the locations shown in the Standard Plans for Type 2W RPMs on multilane one-way roadways and Type 2YY RPMs on two-lane two-way roadways. Do not recess side-to-side RPMs on wide dotted lane lines. For recessed pavement marker application details, see the Standard Plans.

1030.04 Guideposts 1030.04(1) General Guideposts are retroreflective devices installed at the side of the roadway to indicate alignment. They are guidance devices rather than warning devices. Guideposts are used as an aid to nighttime driving primarily on horizontal curves; multilane divided highways; ramps; tangent sections where they can be justified due to snow, fog, or other reduced-visibility conditions; and at intersections without illumination.
1030.04(1)(a) Types of Guideposts The retroreflective device may be mounted on either a white or brown post. The types of guideposts and their application are as follows:
i Type W Type W guideposts have silver-white reflective sheeting, are facing traffic, and are used on the right side of divided highways, ramps, right-hand acceleration and deceleration lanes, intersections, and ramp terminals.
ii Type WW Type WW guideposts have silver-white reflective sheeting on both sides and are used on the outside of horizontal curves on two-way undivided highways.
iii Type Y Type Y guideposts have yellow reflective sheeting, are facing traffic, and are used on the left side of ramps, left-hand acceleration and deceleration lanes, ramp terminals, intersections on divided highways, median crossovers, and horizontal curves on divided highways.
iv Type YY Type YY guideposts have yellow reflective sheeting on both sides and are used in the median on divided highways.
v Type IC1 Type IC1 guideposts have silver-white reflective sheeting on both sides and an additional silver-white piece of reflective sheeting below the standard silver-white sheeting on the side facing traffic. They are used at intersections of undivided highways without illumination.
vi Type IC2 Type IC2 guideposts have silver-white reflective sheeting on both sides and an additional silver-white piece of reflective sheeting below the standard silver-white reflective sheeting on the back side. They are used at intersections of undivided highways without illumination.
1030.04(2) Placement and Spacing Guideposts are placed not less than 2 feet and not more than 8 feet outside the outer edge of the shoulder. Place guideposts at a constant distance from the edge of the roadway. When an obstruction intrudes into this space, position the guideposts to smoothly transition to the inside of the obstruction.

Delineation
Guideposts are not required along continuously illuminated divided or undivided highways. (See Exhibit 1030-2 for guidepost placement requirements and the Standard Plans for information on the different types and placement of guideposts.)
1030.05 Barrier Delineation Traffic barriers are delineated where guideposts are required, such as bridge approaches, ramps, and other locations on non-illuminated roadways (see Exhibit 1030-2). At these locations, the barrier delineation has the same spacing distance as guideposts or less if approved by the Region Traffic Engineer. Barrier delineation is also required when the traffic barrier is 4 feet or less from the traveled way. Use a delineator spacing of no more than 40 feet at these locations. For linear delineation panels, use no more than one unit per 12 foot 5 inch section of barrier unless the curve radius is less than 1,500 feet where two devices 12 foot 5 inch section of barrier can be used on the inside of the curve. The Region Traffic Engineer can approve an even tighter spacing where needed. Beam guardrail can be delineated by either mounting flexible guideposts behind the rail or by attaching shorter flexible guideposts to the wood guardrail posts. Concrete barrier can be delineated by placing linear or non-linear retroreflective devices on the face of the barrier about 6 inches down from the top. Consider mounting non-linear delineation devices on the top of the barrier at locations where mud or snow accumulates against the face of the barrier.
Example of linear delineation
1030.06 Object Markers Object markers are used to mark obstructions within or adjacent to the roadway. The MUTCD details three types of object markers. The Type 3 object marker with yellow and black sloping stripes is the most commonly used object marker. The MUTCD contains criteria for the use of object markers to mark objects in and/or adjacent to the roadway. Follow these criteria in project design. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1030-9
Chapter 1030
Delineation
The terminal ends of impact attenuators are delineated with modified Type 3 object markers. These are the impact attenuator markers in the Sign Fabrication Manual. When the impact attenuator is used in a roadside condition, the marker with diagonal stripes pointing downward toward the roadway is used. When the attenuator is used in a gore where traffic will pass on either side, the marker with chevron stripes is used. End of Roadway markers are similar to Type 1 object markers and are detailed in the MUTCD. They are used to alert users about the end of the roadway. Follow the MUTCD criteria in project design.

1040.01 General Illumination serves multiple functions along highways, in parking lots, and at other facilities, such as improving safety and enhancing security during hours of darkness. Lighting can highlight objects or locations that would not be illuminated by headlights, draw attention to a specific location or feature, or improve the visibility of approaching people or objects. Lighting design needs to balance the function of the lighting with its potential adverse effects, including light pollution and other environmental effects, energy consumption, maintenance impacts, and potentially less cautious user behavior. Lighting is not required to be addressed for WSDOT Q Program Low-Cost Enhancement projects (Q2/QE projects) unless the project is specifically to address lighting.

Chapter 1040
Illumination
1040.01(1) System Ownership and Management The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is generally responsible for illumination on state highways except within the limits of an incorporated city or town. Ownership and maintenance responsibility for highway lighting is defined by RCW 47.24.020, with clarification provided by WAC 468-18-050 (commonly referred to as the “City Streets as Part of State Highways Guidelines”). In unincorporated areas, WSDOT is responsible for all highway lighting. In incorporated areas, WSDOT is responsible for the lighting on limited access facilities (typically freeways and expressways) and interchanges, but not for local crossroads or nonlimited-access state highways. Local roadway lighting shall be designed to local agency standards and use local agency standard equipment such as luminaires and poles. For design and construction, the agency responsible for the construction project will provide the required illumination as part of the project, regardless of which agency will own any particular illumination system upon project completion. Systems shall be electrically separated by owning jurisdiction, starting from the electrical service cabinet and metering point. Two jurisdictions cannot jointly own, operate, and maintain separate parts of the same electrical system.
1040.01(1)(a) Conventional Roadways For the purposes of this Chapter, all state highways that are not freeways or expressways are considered Conventional Roadways. Lighting responsibility for conventional state highways depends on the type of access control. WSDOT is responsible for lighting the following types of state highways:
•
•
Any state highway outside of city limits. Any segment of state highway within city limits that is designated limited access. This does not include the cross street at a freeway interchange unless the cross street is still designated as limited access outside of the freeway limited access limits.
Cities are responsible for the lighting of state highways within city limits that are not designated limited access, including state highways that are cross-streets at freeway interchanges except those noted above. Refer to the WSDOT Highway Access Requests and Training web page to determine the access control level for any segment of state highway. Ownership of lighting for conventional (non-freeway) state highways may be different if a formal agreement is established between WSDOT and the local agency. Where WSDOT is responsible for lighting, provide basic lighting as required by the lighting design areas described in this chapter, with the lighting designed and constructed to WSDOT standards. If additional lighting is desired, the requesting local agency will need to take responsibility for any additional lighting beyond the basic required, at a minimum, and may choose to take responsibility for all lighting within the area of interest. WSDOT may agree to maintain colored (powder-coated) poles. If any other decorative pole features (arm style, base covers, etc.) or non-WSDOT-standard luminaires are desired, the agency requesting the decorative features must take responsibility for the lighting system.

Chapter 1040
Illumination
1040.01(1)(b) Freeways and Expressways WSDOT is responsible for the illumination of all freeways and their interchanges. At interchanges, WSDOT is responsible for the lighting of the ramp itself and the ramp intersection outside of cities, and the city is responsible for the lighting at the ramp intersection (see Exhibit 1040-1 and Exhibit 1040-2) inside cities. Where a ramp intersection is within city limits, but there is no additional city lighting in the area, WSDOT may take ownership of the ramp intersection lighting, particularly if the intersection includes a traffic signal. Exhibit 1040-1 Interchange Lighting Responsibility – Basic Interchange
Exhibit 1040-2 Interchange Lighting Responsibility – Complex Interchange
If a ramp is a continuation of a street (ramp becomes a street or street becomes a ramp, no intersection), then WSDOT’s responsibility for lighting stops at the WSDOT right-of-way line (see Exhibit 1040-3). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1040-3
Chapter 1040
Illumination
Exhibit 1040-3 Ramp to Street Transition Lighting Responsibility
Where a ramp terminal ends at a roundabout, and the cross street is within city limits, WSDOT responsibility for lighting stops at the end of each ramp where it meets the circulating roadway (see Exhibit 1040-5). When there is a right-turn slip lane for a corner of the roundabout, lighting of the right-turn slip lane is divided dependent on the type of right-turn slip lane:
•
•
If the right-turn slip lane stops near the edge of the circulating roadway (short slip lane), responsibility for lighting the right-turn slip lane falls under the same jurisdiction as the approach roadway that the right-turn slip lane is connected to. If the right-turn slip lane connects two approach roadways (long slip lane), responsibility for lighting the right-turn slip lane is split between the owners of the two connected approach roadways. The split point is approximately along a line from the center of the roundabout and perpendicular to the outside edge line of the right-turn slip lane.
For a roundabout ramp terminal in particular, it is expected that lighting from both WSDOT and City systems will be needed to meet required intersection light levels. The ownership limits shown in Exhibit 1040-5 are more applicable to which poles will belong to which agency, with the orientation of the luminaire arm and the roadway over which the luminaire is placed determining ownership of the luminaire (and related equipment). For example, poles along the ramp lanes would belong to WSDOT, even though some of the light output will contribute to the lighting of the circulating roadway if they are close enough to the intersection.

Exhibit 1040-4 Roundabout Ramp Terminal Street Lighting Responsibility
Where a local street goes over or under a freeway or expressway, the local agency (city or county) is responsible for any local street lighting – even when attached to a WSDOT owned structure (see Exhibit 1040-5). Structure mounted local agency lighting may be attached to traffic barrier (local street above freeway), suspended underneath the bridge, or attached to bridge pier columns or crossbeams.

1040.02 Conventional Roadways – Required Illumination Lighting for conventional roadways is typically focused around interaction areas such as intersections and pedestrian crossings. Local agency lighting design areas or pole placement standards may be different. For curved roadways, measurements for lighting design areas are always taken from the inside lane edge of a curve. Lighting design areas extend to the roadway edge line or face of curb unless otherwise noted here.
1040.02(1) Stop and Signal Controlled Intersections A minimum of two lights are required at all stop and signal-controlled highway intersections where any of the following are true:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
A left or right turn lane (channelization) is present on the highway The intersection has sidewalks and curb ramps The intersection has a marked crosswalk The intersection has a traffic signal The intersection has paired transit stops nearby – pedestrians will cross the roadway to reach the stop for the opposite direction. Applies only to the intersection that is part of the shortest path between opposing stops. The intersection has raised channelization or traffic barrier The intersection is on a divided highway
For intersections where none of these items are present, it may still be desirable to provide lighting as either a wayfinding device or in response to nighttime collisions where lighting may have a positive impact. This may be accomplished by requesting a single roadway luminaire be installed by a local electrical utility on a utility pole in the immediate vicinity of the intersection.

Lighting Design Area Lighting is required for the entirety of the intersection area, including paved shoulders, extending back to one of the following on each approach, in order of precedence (see Exhibit 1040-6): 1. To the stop line for the approach. 2. To 25 feet before the outside edge (edge away from intersection core) of the marked crosswalk. 3. To the leading end of the edge line radius return. Exhibit 1040-6 Basic Intersection Lighting Design Area
Where there is raised channelization, the lighting design area extends to 25 feet before the beginning of the raised channelization area. Where the raised channelization extends beyond the intersection channelization, or there is median traffic barrier, only the first 100 feet of the raised channelization or median barrier needs to be included (see Exhibit 1040-7). Paved shoulders do not need to be included outside the intersection core area. Exhibit 1040-7 Basic Intersection with Raised Channelization Lighting Design Area

Where there is a traffic island for a turning movement (see Section 1310.02(14)), the entire traffic island must be included. The lighting design area extends 25 feet in advance of the island (painted gore point) on the entry approach and extends 25 feet beyond where the right edge line meets the exit approach roadway edge line (see Exhibit 1040-8). Exhibit 1040-8 Basic Intersection with Traffic Island
1040.02(2) Roundabouts Roundabout lighting is dependent on the configuration of the roundabout. Roundabout lighting needs to address conflict areas, raised channelization, and pedestrian interaction points. A minimum of two lights are required for all roundabouts.
Lighting Design Areas Roundabout lighting covers the intersection core, not including the central island and central island truck apron (see Exhibit 1040-9), and out each approach. The area where lighting is required on the approach depends on the features of the approach. Light standards shall not be placed within 20 feet of the centerline of any crosswalk, if possible, to avoid placing lighting directly above a pedestrian (see Exhibit 1040-10 for an example pole/luminaire exclusion area).

For simple approaches, lighting is required to extend out to one of the following – whichever extends the design area farthest away from the intersection:
•
•
•
50 feet before the outside edge of the crosswalk 25 feet before the start of raised channelization (does not apply when raised channelization continues beyond the intersection area, such as continuous raised medians) 50 feet away from the edge of the circulating roadway
Exhibit 1040-11 Roundabout Approach Lighting Design Areas – Reverse Curves
For single direction approaches (entry only or exit only), the lighting design areas are the same as those required for simple approaches described above. For exit only approaches, the start of raised channelization is at the circulating roadway rather than at the end of the approach. Where a crosswalk is present, the lighting only needs to extend 25 feet beyond the outside edge of the crosswalk (see Exhibit 1040-12).

1040.02(3) Midblock Crossings Midblock crossings include any marked crossing not at an intersection, regardless of control type (such as uncontrolled, flashing beacon controlled, or traffic signal controlled). A minimum of two lights are required.
Lighting Design Areas (Exhibit 1040-13) Midblock crossings require lighting out to 50 feet in advance of the stop line for the crosswalk and 10 feet beyond the downstream edge of the crosswalk for each approach direction. Where any type of median is present, the full width of the median shall be illuminated out to the upstream limits for each approach direction. The lighting design area should be extended to the nose of the splitter island for islands specifically installed for the midblock crossing. Shoulders and sidewalks shall be included in the lighting design area. Lights shall be installed upstream of the crossing on each side of the roadway, such that there is positive lighting of any pedestrian in the crosswalk. Light standards shall not be placed within 20 feet of the centerline of any crosswalk, if possible, to avoid placing lighting directly above a pedestrian. Type III Signal Standards (mast arm with luminaire arm) should not be used for midblock crossing lighting since they are required to be downstream of the crosswalk.

1040.02(4) Railroad Crossings A minimum of two light standards are required for any railroad crossing where rail crossing warning lights or gates are operational. Lighting should be considered at any railroad crossing without rail crossing warning lights or signals and there is a high volume of nighttime rail activity, a known nighttime crash history involving any mode of transportation (rail, vehicle, bicycle, or pedestrian), or the crossing is blocked by trains for extended periods of time during hours of darkness.
Lighting Design Area (Exhibit 1040-7) Railroad crossings require lighting out to 50 feet in advance of the stop line for the approach for the full roadway width in both directions. For a one-way roadway, lighting may stop at the downstream rail dynamic envelope marking (10 feet beyond the center of the far rail, where no markings are provided). Shoulders and sidewalks shall be included in the lighting design area. Exhibit 1040-14 Railroad Crossing Lighting Design Areas
1040.02(5) Non-Freeway Weigh Sites Truck weighing and inspection sites (weigh stations) involve both slow moving large vehicles trying to maneuver and users on foot either inspecting vehicles or walking to and from the scale facility. To improve the safety of all users of the site, weigh sites are illuminated during hours of darkness when operational or open for nighttime truck parking.

Lighting is required for the entrance and exit ramps for the weigh station, and for the entirety of the weigh station itself. Entrances and exits shall be illuminated as required for freeway off-ramps and on-ramps as described in Section 1040.04(1). Where a weigh station serves both directions of traffic, the stop controlled entrances and exits shall be illuminated with design areas as shown in Section 1040.02(1) and ramp type entrances and exits shall be illuminated as shown for on-ramp areas at both ends. The remainder of the weigh station shall be illuminated from the end of the entrance area to the start of the exit area, using a minimum of two lights, and include any parking areas (see Exhibit 1040-15).

1040.03 Conventional Roadways – Additional Illumination Lighting of the following locations may be appropriate or required under certain conditions, such as utilization or collision history. Where collision history is used for justification of a lighting system, all the following must be true:
•
•
•
During the last five full calendar years, the site has experienced nighttime collisions that are correctable with illumination. The benefit-cost analysis for the proposed illumination exceeds 1. Alternative lower-cost countermeasures have been evaluated and did not address the particular nighttime collision history issue.
Nighttime collisions are defined as collisions occurring between one-half hour after sunset and one-half hour before sunrise. Correctible nighttime collisions are collisions that:
•
•
•
Meet the nighttime definition of this chapter Have contributing factors related to a lack of lighting Where lighting, if installed, would directly address the contributing factors to the collisions
Collision reporting forms and the collision data are not sufficient to distinguish between daytime and nighttime conditions; the collision location, reported time, and hours of darkness for the date of the collision are also needed to determine which collisions are nighttime collisions. Additionally, for sites where the number of nighttime collisions is equal to or greater than the number of daytime collisions, the above-mentioned collision and benefit-cost ratio analysis should be performed. For locations where nighttime vehicle-pedestrian collisions occur, the type of collision and the pedestrian utilization needs to be considered. A location where a pedestrian is not normally expected to be present or crossing a roadway may not be correctable with lighting, while a location with regular nighttime pedestrian activity such as an unmarked crosswalk may be an appropriate location for lighting.
1040.03(1) Transit Stops Lighting of a transit stop depends on the type of stop and facilities provided. Transit stops with a dedicated bus pullout lane, serving a large number of routes, or serving as a transfer point should be illuminated. Transit stops with shelters should be considered for illumination as a shelter typically indicates heavier use. Smaller transit stops may be appropriate to illuminate when there is significant use. Lighting of transit stops is the responsibility of the transit agency. Early engagement with the transit agency is required to determine funding, maintenance, and operation of the lighting system. It is recommended that a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) be established with each transit agency across their entire system, rather than location by location negotiations. Normally, two lights shall be provided for transit stops with a dedicated bus pullout. Where a bus is required to stop in the travel lane, a single light may be provided at the loading area. Where a transit agency is unable or unwilling to participate in funding and maintenance of transit stop lighting, and there is no other adjacent or overlapping lighting system (such as for an intersection), consider requesting a utility owned and maintained light installed on a nearby utility pole for minimum utility lighting of the transit stop.

Lighting Design Area For all transit stop types, an overlapping area shall be evaluated on the sidewalk or shoulder at the loading area for the front 20 feet of the bus. This smaller area has a higher light level requirement to accommodate loading and unloading of passengers. For transit stops with a dedicated bus pullout, lighting shall extend for the full length of the full-width pullout lane and include the adjacent lane and sidewalk (see Exhibit 1040-16). Exhibit 1040-16 Pullout Transit Stop Lighting Design Areas
For transit stops in a dedicated bus lane, lighting shall cover the lane for 60 feet (single bus stop) or 120 feet (articulated or two bus stop) as measured from the head of the stop (usually where the route sign is located) and include the adjacent lane and sidewalk (see Exhibit 1040-17). Exhibit 1040-17 In-Lane Transit Stop Lighting Design Areas
For rural or limited service transit stops where only one light will be provided (does not apply to utility provided lighting), lighting is only required for the loading area – extend to include any waiting area or pad (see Exhibit 1040-18).

1040.03(2) Continuous Lighting Continuous lighting is the illumination of the entirety of the roadway outside of required lighting design areas, usually connecting multiple lighting design areas together. WSDOT does not provide continuous lighting of conventional highways. Continuous lighting may be desirable in areas with regular nighttime pedestrian or other non-motorized use, such as commercial areas, residential areas, or connections between the two. Where continuous lighting is desired by the local agency, the local agency is required to take ownership of the additional lighting beyond any required lighting required unless an agreement is established with WSDOT. Continuous lighting shall be installed at the back of sidewalk to ensure adequate sidewalk lighting and minimize off-roadway light pollution. Continuous lighting areas are evaluated separately from required lighting areas, such that the lighting analysis areas overlap when being evaluated.
1040.04 Freeways and Expressways Lighting for freeways and expressways focuses primarily on decision points, conflict points, and unusual highway features that may not be adequately illuminated by headlights. For curved roadways, measurements for lighting design areas are always taken from the inside lane edge of a curve. Lighting design areas extend to the roadway edge line unless otherwise described here.
1040.04(1) Interchanges Lighting is required for the following locations at all interchanges:
•
•
•
•
Where an off-ramp departs the freeway Where an on-ramp connects to the freeway Ramp terminal intersections Loop ramps
A minimum of two lights are required for each lighting design area, with the exception of ramp terminal intersections where none of the items listed in Section 1040.02(1) are listed are present, in which case only one light needs to be provided.

Exhibit 1040-19 Single Lane Off-Ramp Lighting Design Area
Where a multi-lane off-ramp departs the freeway, lighting is required for 400 feet. The area starts 200 feet in advance of the painted gore point and continues 200 feet beyond this point as measured along the mainline freeway, including all off-ramp lanes and the two adjacent freeway lanes (see Exhibit 1040-20). Exhibit 1040-20 Multi-Lane Off-Ramp Lighting Design Area
Lighting design areas for off-ramps may be shifted up to 100 feet downstream, provided that the shifted design area starts at least 100 feet in advance of the physical gore point or impact attenuator (see Exhibit 1040-21). The design area may only be shifted to avoid light foundation obstructions or to avoid the need to add new light poles to existing bridges.

This length is measured along the mainline freeway, and the area includes the two adjacent continuing freeway lanes. Exhibit 1040-22 Single Lane On-Ramp Merge Lighting Design Area
Where an on-ramp (one or more lanes) connects to a freeway as additional lanes (add lanes), lighting is required for 200 feet starting from the start of the new lane (end of ramp wide line) (see Exhibit 1040-23). This length is measured along the mainline freeway, and the area includes the two adjacent continuing freeway lanes.

Lighting design areas for on-ramps may be shifted up to 100 feet downstream. The design area may only be shifted to avoid light foundation obstructions or to avoid the need to add new light poles to existing bridges.
1040.04(1)(c) Metered On-Ramps On-ramps with ramp meters require lighting of all lanes, including any HOV lanes or shoulders used as lanes during metering, from 150 feet before to 50 feet after the stop line for the ramp meter (see Exhibit 1040-25). Lighting is also required for any lane merges for general purpose lanes, HOV lanes, and HOV shoulders (metered or unmetered) as shown in Exhibit 1040-24.

1040.04(1)(e) Ramp Terminals Ramp terminals are where the freeway ramp connects to the secondary roadway. This secondary roadway may be a local roadway, a state highway, or another freeway. The ramp terminal lighting design area will depend on the type of connection. Ramp terminal intersections shall follow the requirements for intersections defined for Stop or Signal Controlled Intersections (Section 1040.02(1)) or Roundabouts (Section 1040.02(2)). Stop controlled ramp terminal intersections may use a single luminaire if none of the items listed in Section 1040.02(1) are present. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

1040.04(3) Special Use Lane Access Zones Certain freeway lanes may be designated for special use, such as High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes, or Express Toll Lanes (ETL). As part of these lane use designations, there may be limited zones for exit from and entry to these lanes. A minimum of two lights are required for each lighting design area. Where a special use lane is separated by a barrier or barrier line (extra wide line our double wide lane line), and the access zone is provided by changing the barrier line to a standard lane line (basic access zone), lighting is required for the first 200 feet after the line changes to a lane line, and for 200 feet before and 50 feet after the barrier or barrier line is restored (see Exhibit 1040-30). The design area includes the special use lane and the two adjacent freeway general purpose lanes. Exhibit 1040-30 Special Use Lane – Basic Access Zone Lighting Design Area
Where the special use lane is separated by barrier, and an access zone is provided by using a dedicated weaving transition lane, lighting is required at the start and the end of the access zone. The lighting area covers all of the special use lanes and the two adjacent general-purpose lanes. The area at the start of the access zone starts 200 feet before the start of the weave lane and extends to 200 feet after the start of the weave lane (see Exhibit 1040-31). The area at the end of the access zone starts 200 feet before the end of the weave lane and ends 200 feet after the merging weave lane reduces to 10 feet in width (see Exhibit 1040-32).

1040.04(4) Freeway Transit Stations Freeway transit stations consist of an off-ramp, a conventional roadway transit stop, and an on-ramp. On and off-ramp lighting shall be in accordance with Section 1040.04(1). Transit stop lighting is required and shall be in accordance with Section 1040.03(1) covering the entire length of the loading area curb and sidewalk using a minimum of two lights.
1040.04(5) Safety Rest Areas On and off-ramps for safety rest areas require lighting in accordance with Section 1040.04(1). Within the rest area, there are four types of areas that require lighting:
•
•
•
•
Lane merge and diverge points, connecting to the different parking areas (usually separated into cars and large trucks) Parking areas Pedestrian walkways Recreational Vehicle (RV) sanitary disposal facilities

Lighting coverage for each of these areas is as follows (see Exhibit 1040-33):
•
•
•
•
Merge and diverge areas from 50 feet before to after the merge or diverge point (minimum 100 feet total). Parking areas for the full area of each parking area, from the entry lane connection to the exit lane connection, including sidewalks. Where parking areas are divided into separate sections and connected with a single lane, lighting is not required for the connecting single lane. Each pedestrian walkway connecting the services buildings to the parking lots. Each lane for RV sanitary disposal facilities, from 25 feet before the start of the station pad to 25 feet beyond the end of the station pad. Where there are multiple pads, such as if there is a separate water station, the area starts before the first pad and ends after the last pad.
Parking areas and RV sanitary disposal facilities shall use a minimum of two lights. Interior merge and diverge areas may use a single light if light levels can be met.

1040.04(6) Chain-Up and Chain-off Areas Chain-up and chain-off (chaining) areas present a unique situation on a freeway where drivers are expected to be out of their vehicles and walking around while other vehicles are moving. Providing lighting both to highlight users on foot and to provide visibility for Exhibit 1040-34 the installation or removal of chains is particularly important. Lighting may be omitted if power is not available within one-half mile of either end of the chaining area. Lighting is required from the start of the chaining area shoulder widening taper to the end of the chaining area shoulder narrowing taper and shall include the two adjacent freeway lanes (see Exhibit 1040-34). Lighting is required on both the left and right side of the freeway to help illuminate users on foot, using a minimum of two lights on each side of the freeway (a minimum of four total). Lighting shall only be operational when chains are required for any vehicle type. Exhibit 1040-34 Chain-Up and Chain-Off Area Lighting Design Area
1040.04(7) Freeway Weigh Sites Truck weighing and inspection sites (weigh stations) involve both slow moving large vehicles trying to maneuver and users on foot either inspecting vehicles or walking to and from the scale facility. To improve the safety of all users of the site, weigh sites are illuminated during hours of darkness when operational or open for nighttime truck parking. There are two basic types of weigh sites – standard and Port of Entry. Standard weigh sites include one or two scales and truck parking. Ports of Entry also include additional inspection buildings and usually a larger scale building. Lighting is required for the entirety of the weigh station paved areas, starting from 50 feet before the first internal diverge point to 50 feet beyond the last merge point, and all paved areas in between including the scale area, truck parking area, officer parking area, inspection building access, and all connecting roadways and walkways (see Exhibit 1040-35). On and off-ramp connections to the weigh station shall include illumination in accordance with Section 1040.04(1).

1040.04(8) Lane Splits Lane splits are locations where same direction lanes split around an obstruction or onto different alignments. These could be general purpose lanes splitting around an obstruction, or a special use lane (such as an HOV lane) splitting from the general-purpose lanes. Lighting is required where the lanes split and where the lanes come back together (see Exhibit 1040-36), with a minimum of two lights required for each area, covering all lanes of traffic to the right of the split and at least two lanes to the left of the split. Lighting at the split point starts 100 feet before the painted diverge point and extends to 50 feet beyond the start of the obstruction or traffic barrier (such as concrete barrier, guardrail, or similar protective barrier). Lighting at the merge point starts 100 feet before the painted merge point and extends 200 feet beyond the painted merge point. Exhibit 1040-36 Lane Split Lighting Design Area
1040.04(9) Continuous Lighting Freeway continuous lighting is limited to areas designated by the WSDOT HQ Traffic Office. Continuous lighting is typically limited to urban core areas with significant interchange density and weaving movements. Continuous lighting of open freeways away from interchanges provides minimal benefits, increases energy use and light pollution, increases maintenance and operations costs, and can encourage riskier driver behavior such as speeding during low volume nighttime hours. Where continuous lighting is installed, lighting shall be split into separate circuits for minimum required lighting and all additional lighting. This allows for any lighting not required to cover a basic design area to be controlled separately as part of operational and energy use management. Direction specific continuous lighting may be appropriate in areas where significant weaving between on and off-ramps occurs in one direction of the freeway. The lighting design area for this application extends from the start of the upstream on-ramp lighting design area to the end of the downstream off-ramp lighting design area and includes the entirety of the two right-most freeway lanes, as well as any auxiliary (add-drop) lanes. This limited application of continuous lighting is not considered general continuous illumination, and only requires approval from the Region Traffic Engineer.

1040.05 Bridges and Tunnels Bridges and tunnels have special lighting considerations due to the complex nature of the structure and impacts of the structure regarding both daytime and nighttime visibility.
1040.05(1) Bridge Lighting Bridges do not specifically require lighting by themselves. The need for lighting on a bridge is determined by the presence of another lighting design area. If any of the lighting design areas described in this chapter are present on or under a bridge, then lighting for that area may be attached to the bridge. Decorative illumination such as lighting of architectural features of a bridge structure requires the approval of the State Traffic Engineer. Decorative lighting may not include light sources that are visible to drivers (drivers can see the bulb or LED source itself), lighting that is cast above horizontal (night sky light pollution), or lighting that is cast off the structure (environmental light pollution).
1040.05(2) Bridge Inspection Lighting and Receptacles Bridges where the interior of the structure is accessible, such as floating bridges or box girders, require inspection lighting and receptacles for use by inspection and maintenance staff. Lighting and receptacles shall be powered from separate circuits. Receptacles shall use two-gang boxes with two 20A duplex GFCI receptacles, where each duplex receptacle is powered from a separate circuit. There shall be no less than three circuits in use for bridge inspection lighting and receptacles. See Exhibit 1040-37 for typical lighting and receptacle circuit arrangements. Exhibit 1040-37 Bridge Inspection Lighting and Receptacle Circuit Layout
Bridge inspection lighting shall be ceiling mounted and uses vapor-tight bulb enclosures. Bulbs are LED type A19 bulbs with E26/Medium sockets. Bulbs have an output of 1600-2000 lumens (100W equivalent), and a color temperature of 4000K or higher. Each girder shall be supplied by two lighting circuits such that every other light is on a separate circuit. Bridge inspection lighting does not need to be analyzed for a target light level as it uses a set spacing arrangement instead. Lights are evenly spaced within each girder section as separated by diaphragms, with the end lights of each girder section no more than 12.5 feet from the ends of the girder section (pier centerline) as measured perpendicular from the diaphragm face. For steel box girder bridges, lights are spaced at either 25foot centers or four times the web depth, whichever is shorter. For concrete box girder bridges, lights are spaced at either 50-foot centers or eight times the web depth, whichever is shorter. Receptacles shall be evenly spaced within each girder section, spaced at 50-foot centers for all girder types, and no more than 25 feet from the ends of the girder section (pier centerline). See Exhibit 1040-37 for typical spacing arrangements. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Exhibit 1040-38 Bridge Inspection Lighting and Receptacle Layout
Lighting shall be operable from any external access point to the girders, with switches located adjacent to the access point. If there are only two access points, then a three-way light switch is required at each access point and the switches may be integrated into the lighting circuit. If there are three or more access points, such as with an intermediate access point or multiple girders are accessed from common access points, then two threeway and one or more four-way switches are required, and these switches shall operate a lighting contactor for the lighting circuit. Circuits with four-way switches cannot have the switches installed in-line with the rest of the lighting circuit. See Exhibit 1040-39 for lighting circuit design examples.

1040.05(3) Tunnels, Lids, and Underpasses For the purposes of this chapter, a tunnel is defined as any structure that restricts the normal daytime illumination of a roadway such that driver visibility is substantially diminished. This includes tunnels, highway lids, and roadways under bridges where the structure over the roadway is covered for more than 80 feet. Where tunnel lighting is required, tunnel lighting shall be designed in accordance with ANSI/IES RP-8-18. Short tunnels are tunnels where the exit portal is visible from the entrance portal, and the tunnel length is less than or equal to the design stopping sight distance as defined in Chapter 1260. Some short tunnels may not require daytime lighting, depending on tunnel characteristics and the requirements of ANSI/IES RP-8-18. Where daytime lighting is not required, nighttime lighting is also not required unless it is part of another required design area or within a designated continuous lighting area. Short tunnels in urban areas where a non-state highway roadway passes through the tunnel may require lighting by the local agency, even if not required by ANSI/IES RP-8-18. Consult with the local agency for tunnel lighting requirements for local roadways.

1040.05(3)(a) Daytime Light Levels for Tunnels Tunnels long enough to warrant daytime lighting present a difficult situation for users. Without daytime tunnel lighting, users would be required to have their eyes adjust from a high light level (daylight) to a much lower light level (near darkness) within the tunnel very quickly. Where users’ eyes cannot adjust fast enough, they may not be able to see a hazard or obstruction in front of them in time to avoid a collision and may slow down significantly because they cannot see far enough ahead. Transitional lighting allows for a more gradual adjustment and can minimize the “black hole” effect of a rapid transition from a bright space to a dark space, reducing the risk of a collision and the likelihood of users to slow down upon entering a tunnel. Depending on the length and direction of the tunnel, the opposite condition may be true for exiting the tunnel resulting in daylight blindness at the exit. ANSI/IES RP-8-18 provides detailed lighting requirements for tunnels. In support of those requirements:
•
•
•
•
•
•
All tunnel lighting designs are required to be reviewed and approved by the State Traffic Engineer. Long tunnels are divided into zones in accordance with ANSI/IES RP-8-18, using the calculations methods described there. Long tunnel lighting designs are required to use the Lseq (Equivalent Veiling Luminance) calculation method. Lseq values obtained from this calculation shall be used to adjust the Suggested Daytime Maintained Average Pavement Luminance Levels where indicated. Lighting analysis shall include the required portions of the tunnel walls. Additional lighting is required outside the tunnel on the roadway approaching and exiting the tunnel. This area shall be illuminated at night for a distance no less than the stopping sight distance as defined in Chapter 1260. The light levels for these areas shall be no less than one third of the tunnel interior nighttime light level. Fire protection and safety equipment, such as fire alarm pull stations, phones, and emergency exits, shall be illuminated (see NFPA 502 for additional information).
1040.06 Work Zone and Construction Lighting Lighting is required within Work Zones and construction areas, both to illuminate standard lighting design areas and unusual conditions or features within the project limits. Lighting of existing required design areas is required to be maintained operational at all times. This may require temporary (timber) light poles in place of permanent equipment. If a new or temporary required design area is created as part of the project, such as a temporary ramp relocation or a new temporary intersection, lighting shall be provided for the new or temporary lighting design area as required for a permanent location in accordance with this Chapter. This includes traffic splits around obstructions, even if they are on non-freeway roadways.
1040.06(1) Roadways Constrained by Barrier Where the roadway will have barrier protection (guardrail or concrete barrier) along the roadway shoulder, temporary lighting is required if any of the following conditions apply:
•
•
The distance from the edge of the active lane to the roadside edge of the attenuator is less than 4 feet and the roadway has a posted speed of 45 MPH or higher, is a freeway on-ramp, or is within the first 500 feet from the gore nose (see Exhibit 1360-13) of an off-ramp. The distance from the edge of the active lane to the roadside edge of the attenuator is less than 2 feet and the roadway has a posted speed of 30 MPH to 40 MPH (inclusive).

Where none of these conditions apply, lighting for the barrier protected section of roadway is not required if reflective barrier mounted delineators are provided for the entire length of the barrier. Where temporary lighting for barrier protection is required, the roadway shall be illuminated for a 200-foot distance starting from 100 feet before the start of the barrier to 100 feet after the start of the barrier. Where barrier is present on both sides of the roadway, such that barrier on the left side of the roadway is within clear zone of the leftmost side of any lanes in that direction of travel, lighting of the start of this barrier is also required. See Exhibit 1040-40 for basic barrier constrained roadway lighting requirements. For multilane roadways, at a minimum the two lanes adjacent to the barrier must be illuminated.
Exhibit 1040-40 Barrier Constrained Roadway Lighting Design Areas
1040.06(2) Two-Way One-Lane Signal Controlled Roadways For two-way, one lane traffic control using a temporary or portable signal system, lighting is required from 50 feet before the stop line for the temporary traffic signal to a point 25 feet beyond the temporary signal displays. Lighting is required at each end of the signal system. Where there is an intermediate signal-controlled access point to the one lane section, such as a cross-street or commercial driveway, at least one 200W class light is required at the stop line for the cross-street. An additional 200W class light shall be provided at the intersection. The same light can be used for both locations if the stop line for the cross-street is no more than 75 feet from the edge line of the main roadway. See Exhibit 1040-41.

1040.06(3) Other Temporary Lighting Conditions Flagging stations are normally illuminated by temporary light plants. Flagging station lighting can be provided by other required temporary lighting, if the flagging station is within a required lighting design area, or by a single 250W class luminaire installed at a 30-foot mounting height and 20 feet in advance of the flagging station. Temporary lighting should be considered for other non-standard or unexpected roadway conditions, such as substandard lane widths, corners, lane shifts, or vertical alignment changes. Where high-mast temporary lighting is used, it is generally beneficial to try and illuminate as much of the work area as possible along with any required lighting design areas. For freeway applications with multiple stages of traffic control where required design areas may shift multiple times, it may be preferable to illuminate the entirety of the potential roadway limits to allow for required design areas to move multiple times without having to add, remove, or relocate lighting to ensure that required areas remain covered in all stages.
1040.07 Parking Lots Parking lots are illuminated to support both user safety and security. Parking lots involve significant interaction between multiple modes of travel, such as vehicles and pedestrians, and present unique challenges in relation to potential criminal activity. Parking lots are divided into two classifications: major and minor. Major parking lots are locations with usage exceeding 50 vehicles during hours of darkness, such as larger park and ride lots. Lighting for major parking lots covers the entirety of the lot, including all parking stalls and interior sidewalks and walkways (see Exhibit 1040-42). Transit stop areas shall be illuminated in accordance with Section 1040.04(4). Lighting for the parking lot shall be designed to allow for the overall light level to be reduced to approximately 25% of required light levels during hours of darkness outside of normal usage, such as from one-half hour after the last bus of the evening to onehalf hour before the first bus of the following morning. This lighting reduction shall be accomplished through the selective shut off of lights around the parking lot, through the use of separated circuits, to simplify circuit design and operation.

Minor parking lots are the remaining parking lots with significantly less general use. Lighting for minor parking lots is only required to cover the entrance and exit areas of the parking lot but should also cover as much of the lot as possible (see Exhibit 1040-43). Lighting of the entire parking lot may be desirable for safety or security purposes and will often not significantly increase the size of the lighting system.

1040.08 Pedestrian Facility Lighting Lighting provided specifically for pedestrian type modes of transportation (walking and rolling) is dependent on the type and features of the facility. Lighting of sidewalks and shoulders is required for any location listed in Section 1040.02, with the exception of weigh sites. The required design area shall be expanded to include the full width of the adjacent sidewalk, or the full width of the roadway shoulder where sidewalk is not present. Where lighting is provided in accordance with Section 1040.03(2), include the full width of the sidewalk or shoulder in the lighting design area. Separate pedestrian level light poles (standards) may be required or requested by a local agency requesting continuous lighting of a non-freeway state highway. WSDOT does not provide illumination for separated pedestrian facilities such as isolated sidewalks or shared use paths with the exception of specific tunnels. If illumination of a separated pedestrian facility is desired, a local agency must be engaged to take responsibility for the pedestrian level lighting system. Dedicated pedestrian facilities adjacent to state highways, such as shared use paths along freeways, may be illuminated by roadway lighting. Where a shared use path is on a bridge that does not have roadway lighting, approved embedded concrete barrier lighting may be used. Tunnels specifically for shared use paths shall use flush ceiling mounted luminaires with vandal resistant and other protective features to minimize the risk of damage to the fixtures or any part of the supporting electrical system. Additional protective measures are necessary for isolated pedestrian facility lighting, as these areas are more susceptible to vandalism and wire theft.

Illumination
1040.09 Adjacent Lighting Areas In some cases, multiple required lighting design areas may be close together but not touching or overlapping. If these areas are addressed independently, they create a light-dark-light transition that makes it difficult for users’ eyes to adjust back and forth quickly, with the dark section between the two light areas being hardest to see in. This is aggravated by traveling speed and the increased brightness of LED luminaires. Where two lighting design areas are within 500 feet of each other, the two lighting design areas shall be combined into a single area. If different light levels are required for the merged areas, the higher light levels shall be used. This may result in multiple lighting design areas combined into a single large analysis area. In general, a gap of up to 500 feet between lighting design areas is usually able to be covered by no more than two additional lights.
1040.10 Light Level Criteria Light levels vary slightly with the type of highway, the functional classification of the highway, development of the adjacent area, and nighttime levels of vehicle and pedestrian activity. Light level activity classifications fall into three categories:
•
•
•
High Activity. These are areas where more than 100 pedestrian crossings occur over a one-hour period during hours of darkness at any time of the year. These are typically urban core retail or event areas such as shopping districts, stadiums, concert venues, major transit centers, and their associated parking areas. This classification corresponds with ANSI/IES RP-8-18 High Pedestrian Conflict Areas. Medium Activity. These are areas where 11 to 100 pedestrian crossings occur over a one-hour period during hours of darkness at any time of the year. Most basic urban and suburban areas with less dense commercial districts fall into this category. This category is the default standard unless justification can be provided for using the High or Low Activity classifications. This classification corresponds with ANSI/IES RP-8-18 Medium Pedestrian Conflict Areas. Low Activity. These areas are where 10 or fewer pedestrian crossings occur over a one-hour period during hours of darkness at any time of the year. These are typically low density suburban or rural areas with low housing density, little retail activity, or farms. This classification corresponds with ANSI/IES RP8-18 Low Pedestrian Conflict Areas. Lighting design areas with sidewalks or marked crosswalks cannot be classified as Low Activity Areas.
Four light levels are measured for each design area:
•
•
•
•
Minimum light level, in footcandles (fc). For any lighting design area, no point within the calculation area may be less than 0.2 footcandles (fc). Minimum average light level, in fc. This is the average light level over the entirety of the design area. Uniformity ratio (no units). This is how even the light levels are over the entirety of the design area and is calculated by dividing the average light level by the minimum light level. Uniformity ratio requirements only apply to locations with more than one light. Maximum veiling luminance ratio (no units). This is a measurement of disability glare resulting from the lighting system and is calculated by dividing the maximum veiling luminance by the average luminance. Veiling luminance calculations are only required in locations that are tangent for at least 322 feet and have little to no change in grade and can only be calculated for points starting 272 feet after the start of the tangent section. Veiling luminance is not calculated on sidewalks or roadway shoulders.

Illumination
Requirements for minimum average light levels, uniformity ratios, and maximum veiling luminance ratios are dependent on the roadway type and activity classification and are provided in Exhibit 1040-44 through Exhibit 1040-46. Crosswalks at roundabouts and midblock crossings (without intersection lighting) shall also have a vertical average light level of 0.9 footcandles (fc) at a height of 5 ft above the roadway, evaluated at 1.5 ft intervals and oriented relative to oncoming traffic for each lane.

Light levels for local agencies shall be in accordance with local agency requirements. Some local agencies do not use lighting analysis but instead use a set spacing criterion. Confirm placement and light level requirements with the local agency. Where the local agency does not have light level or spacing requirements, WSDOT light level requirements are used.

1040.11 Basic System Design When working on an existing illumination system, address items based on the following:
•
•
•
•
•
Existing wiring that is not being affected by the work can remain. Additional circuits may be affected beyond those for the circuit where work is planned in cases where there is a conduit failure or wiring needs to be removed and reinstalled. Grounding and bonding must be addressed from the equipment being worked on back to the service cabinet. Any junction boxes within the project limits that are part of a system included in the contract work must be replaced if they do not have locking lids as shown in the Standard Plans and defined in the Standard Specifications, and if they have locking lids but are damaged or are no longer able to be secured. ADA projects require replacement of all junction boxes in sidewalks with new boxes with slip-resistant lids and frames. Poles and foundations only need to be addressed if the pole is included in the work, or the required grading is not present for a slip-base luminaire. Luminaires only need to be addressed where poles are being relocated or if they are contributing to a project lighting design area.

Illumination
Service cabinets within the project limits that are part of a system being worked on are required to be replaced if they do not meet current standards as shown in the Standard Plans and defined in the Standard Specifications. Service cabinets that meet these requirements are not required to be replaced unless they require modifications that cannot be supported by the existing service cabinet (such as not enough room for additional circuits).
New system construction is usually simple and straight-forward. New construction still requires coordination with other design disciplines to manage systems in near proximity that are in the ground, as well as tracking any changes to roadway geometrics which may affect design area locations. Additional widening is required to support slip-bases for light standards and must be included in any roadway section plans. Early and regular coordination with drainage, earthwork, roadway design, work zone traffic control, among others, is critical to development of a buildable and maintainable system. Modifications of existing systems are more complex. Any existing system that is worked on is required to be updated to current system design and NEC requirements. This may require modifications such as adding ground wires to conduits, replacing junction boxes and/or conduits, modifying light standard foundations and grading to support proper slip base function, or replacing wiring and splices. The following items need to be addressed when working on an existing system:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Bring existing circuits into compliance with current NEC. Bring materials into compliance with current material standards. Bring service cabinets up to current standards. Replace existing junction that do not meet current standards, including thicker bolt-down lids. Boxes in sidewalks must have slip-resistant surfacing to be compliant. Replace conductors that are no longer in serviceable condition. Bring grounding and bonding system up to current standards, including adding ground conductors where missing, bonding junction box lids, etc. Replace conduits where conduits have failed (existing conductors will not move) or are too small to support necessary system updates (adding new wires). Update light standard foundations and grading to current standards for slip-base luminaires, to support proper breakaway function. Replace non-standard foundations, anchor bolt sizes, and anchor bolt patterns (ex: 4-bolt ground installations) with foundations and anchor bolt arrangements meeting current standards. Replace light standards not meeting current pole standards, such as 4-bolt bases, aluminum poles, or poles with overbrace or underbrace supported arms. Replace non-LED luminaires with LED luminaires meeting current standards.

Existing wiring that is not being affected by the work can remain. Additional circuits may be affected beyond those for the circuit where work is planned in cases where there is a conduit failure or wiring needs to be removed and reinstalled. Grounding and bonding only needs to be addressed from the equipment being worked on back to the service cabinet. Only junction boxes where work is being performed within (new conduit and/or wiring) need to be replaced unless the project includes ADA work. ADA projects require replacement of all junction boxes in sidewalks with new boxes with slip-resistant lids and frames.

Poles and foundations only need to be addressed if the pole is included in the work, or the required grading is not present for a slip-base luminaire. Luminaires only need to be addressed where poles are being relocated or if they are contributing to a project lighting design area. Service cabinets are only required to be replaced when being modified new equipment is being installed (such as new wiring, new conduit, new circuit/breaker, etc.), as directed by the Region Signal Maintenance Manager. Older service cabinets do not have full coverage dead front panels and do not meet current safety requirements.
Coordinate with HQ and Region illumination design and maintenance staff starting with project scoping to ensure that the project is addressing any deficiencies in affected equipment and the project can support the necessary work. Lighting design areas are required to be illuminated at all times, even during a project, unless a shutdown has been approved for modification or final removal of an existing system.
1040.11(1) Light Standards Light standards are the poles that support luminaires above the roadway. For new construction, WSDOT only uses Type 1 davit arm light standards as shown in Standard Plan J-28.10. WSDOT does not use any decorative pole types for new construction but may use poles powder-coated in a corridor specific color or when located within National Forests or similar natural areas. Existing non-standard poles may remain in service until their end of useful life. High-mast lighting using high-mast type poles shall not be used for new construction. High-mast systems place poles in locations that are inaccessible to maintenance, require significantly more resources to operate and maintain, require barrier protection, and in many cases cast half or more of their light off the roadway where it affects locations like natural areas and private residences. Existing high-mast lighting may remain in service until their end of useful life but may not be relocated or replaced. Where the roadway geometry is changing such that the high-mast lighting is not covering a required design area, it shall be replaced with conventional light standards. Light standards may be incorporated into signal standards for traffic signals and ramp meters (Type III signal standards). Where a Type III signal standard is used for a ramp meter, the light must be powered from the same direct source – service cabinet or transformer cabinet – as the ramp meter signals, such that the entire signal standard can be shut off from the same breaker panel. Slip bases are always required unless a fixed base is justified as described in Chapter 1610. Light standards that are 50 feet or taller with double mast arms, Type III signal standards, and high-mast type light standards cannot be made breakaway and require barrier protection, with the sole exception of Type III signal standards at intersections (see Chapter 1330).
1040.11(1)(a) Light Standard Sizes WSDOT light standards are available in standard heights of 20, 30, 40, and 50 feet. 20-foot heights are restricted to special cases and require approval from the HQ Traffic Office. Luminaire arms are available in lengths of 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 feet, and both single and double (180-degree offset) arm configurations. Slip bases cannot be used on 50-foot poles with double arms longer than 8 feet (each) in length. Starting configurations are 30-, 40-, or 50-foot-tall poles with 12- or 16-foot luminaire arms. Custom heights may only be used where a light standard is attached to the top of a wall, in order to provide the correct height above roadway for the luminaire. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1040-43
Chapter 1040
Illumination
Barrier mounted light standards use standard heights, with adjustments made in the lighting analysis to account for additional luminaire height above the roadway.
1040.11(1)(b) Light Standard Placement Light standards hall be placed as far away from the traveled way as possible to minimize the risk of a collision or other damage. Light standards shall be placed such that the luminaire is directly over the roadway edge line, plus or minus 4 feet maximum. This offset distance may be exceeded with approval from the HQ Traffic Office, provided that required light levels are met. Type III signal standards may be placed where luminaires will be more than 4 feet from the roadway edge line. WSDOT light standards shall be placed on the right shoulder of the roadway. Light standards may be placed on traffic barrier separating two roadways, provided that the barrier is on the right shoulder of at least one of the roadways. Light standards may be placed on the left shoulder of a single lane roadway or ramp with approval from the HQ Traffic Office. Light standards shall not be placed in medians, on median traffic barrier, or in traffic islands. Type III signal standard locations shall be in accordance with Chapter 1330 or ramp meter system design requirements as applicable. Where light standards are placed along roadways with curb and sidewalk, light standards shall be placed at the back of the sidewalk to provide adequate lighting of the sidewalk and improve visibility of pedestrians. Light standards shall not be placed in planter or similar strips between the sidewalk and the roadway, as they place the lights too close to the roadway and increase the risk of even minor collisions or sideswipes. Where pole bases encroach on the sidewalk, the available sidewalk width passing the pole baseplate shall be in accordance with Chapter 1510. Where light standards will be placed on a bridge, coordination is required with the WSDOT Bridge office to ensure that the structure can support the light standard and that an adequate anchorage can be provided. Standard bridge mounting uses elbow mounts as shown in the Standard Plans. Light standards shall not be placed such that a luminaire will be within 50 feet of a bridge if the luminaire will be above the top of the solid concrete bridge barrier, or above the top of the bridge deck where open barrier is used. Placement of new light standards near overhead sign structures is subject to the following requirements:
•
•
•
New light standards shall not be placed between 5 and 50 feet in front of any overhead sign, due to the higher reflectivity of newer overhead sign faces. New light standards may be placed between 5 and 50 feet of the back of an existing overhead sign if lighting analysis includes the sign as an obstruction and shows that required light levels are met. New light standards may be placed within 5 feet of an overhead sign structure (in front of or behind) without analyzing the sign structure or addressing reflectivity of the sign face. The light is too directly above the sign to reflect into users’ eyes or for the sign to provide a significant lighting obstruction.
Existing light standards within 50 feet of an overhead sign are not required to be relocated unless there is a known problem caused by the proximity of the light and the sign, or the light is being relocated for other reasons. Light standard placement must be a minimum of 10 feet horizontally from any overhead power line, including neutrals and aerial service connections. Even if a location may be more than 10 feet from the wire, 10 feet of horizontal clearance is required for crane operations to place the pole. Depending on the line voltage of the power line, the horizontal clearance distance may be greater than 10 feet, such as in cases of high voltage transmission lines.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1040-44
Chapter 1040
Illumination
For overhead line voltages in excess of 50,000 volts (50 kV), the minimum required offset distance from the lines shall be increased by 0.4 inches for every additional 1 kV in accordance with WAC 296-24-960. Consideration should also be given to crane clearances as described in WAC 296-155-53408 Table 4.
1040.11(1)(c) Light Standards for Local Agencies Light standards for local agency owned and maintained systems shall meet local agency requirements, including pole types. Local agency pole types may be of a different material such as aluminum, fiberglass, or concrete, may include decorative features such as fluted poles, decorative mast arms, or banner arms, and may be powder coated a specific color. Local agency light standards may be placed in accordance with local agency requirements, provided that they meet clear zone requirements for the roadway. Some local agency clear zone requirements differ from WSDOT requirements and shall be verified before placing light standards. Local agencies may place poles within medians or shoulder planter strips at their discretion.
1040.11(1)(d) Temporary Light Standards Temporary light standards are normally timber pole light standards used to provide lighting during a temporary condition or until permanent lighting can be placed in operation. The most common uses of temporary lighting include:
•
•
Conditions where the roadway geometrics are temporarily changed to support construction work but will be restored to the original condition upon project completion. Conditions where the roadway geometrics are being permanently modified, but the permanent lighting will not cover temporary locations of required design areas or cannot be made operational early enough to cover required design areas.
Timber light standards are available in any mounting height from 20 to 90 feet in height. The type of luminaire and arm depends on the mounting height used. Both types of arrangements are shown in Standard Plan J-15.10. Timber light standards with mounting heights up to 60 feet can support up to three luminaire arms, with lengths of 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16 feet. Longer arm lengths of 18 and 20 feet may also be available, but they are less common and should be avoided if possible. Multiple luminaire arms are normally installed at increments of 90degrees from each other, with a standard 180-degree double-arm configuration being most common. Timber light standards with mounting heights of 60 feet and higher use high-mast type luminaires and arms. These luminaire arms are a “wagon wheel” type design with six 3-foot arms arranged at 60-degree intervals. Up to six luminaires may be installed in any configuration, but typical arrangements use 2, 3, 4, or 6 luminaires. Where three or four luminaires are used, it is recommended that they all be on the same side of the pole when shielding is necessary or only one side of the pole requires lighting, rather than evenly spread around the pole. See Exhibit 1040-47 for typical high-mast light arrangements.

Chapter 1040
Illumination
Exhibit 1040-47 Typical Temporary High Mast Light Arrangements
Timber light standards require a crane for installation, so overhead clearances are critical. Timber light standards are normally installed in the ground using direct burial, at a depth of 10% of total pole height plus 2 feet. For example, a 60-foot timber pole requires a burial depth of 8 feet (10% of 60 feet = 6 feet, plus 2 feet). Specify the mounting height rather than the pole height, to allow for contractors to determine the length of pole needed. Where the ground has a lateral bearing pressure of less than 1000 psf or a friction angle of less than 26 degrees, standard direct burial installation cannot be used. Contact the HQ Traffic Office for design support where poor soil conditions are present. Timber light standards do not require guy wires by themselves, but they may be necessary when aerial circuits are used depending on how they are attached to the pole.
1040.11(2) Luminaires WSDOT standard luminaires are Light-Emitting Diode (LED) type cobra-head type fixtures with IESNA Type III distribution patterns. These luminaires are classified by their High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) equivalent wattage, even though they are LED. The standard wattage classifications are 200W, 250W, 310W, and 400W. Lighting analysis is done using a standard benchmark luminaire for each wattage class, which allows for any approved LED luminaire of that class to be used. WSDOT uses high-mast type luminaires for Type V distribution applications, where more of an area light may be needed instead of a roadway (more rectangular) light pattern. These luminaires may be used where lights may be installed between roadways or are required to light a longer distance across the roadway. Type V distribution lights are only available in 400W and 750W classes for permanent systems, and 1000W class is available for temporary installations.

Illumination
Wall mount and ceiling mount (tunnel) type fixtures are available as well, but their use has become more complicated as manufacturers have moved from HPS light sources to LED. Contact the HQ Traffic Office for assistance with wall and ceiling mount type luminaires. Wall mount luminaires may be installed on the faces of walls, on bridge piers, or on bridge pier crossbeams. Ceiling mount luminaires may be attached to ceilings, the underside of bridge decks, or supported on metal hanger systems. No luminaire may be attached directly to a bridge girder, with the exception of box girders with pre-approval from the WSDOT Bridge Office. Any attachment to a structure requires coordination with the WSDOT Bridge Office. No WSDOT lighting system may include decorative luminaires. Decorative luminaires may be used at the discretion of local agencies on systems that they will own and maintain.
