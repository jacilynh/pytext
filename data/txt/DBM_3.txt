Design Analyses Include in all projects. All Pre-Approved Design Analyses are listed in this section and must be included in the appendix for reference. Any Design-Builder proposed revisions to existing design analyses or new proposed design analyses must be reviewed and approved in accordance with this section. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01, Chapter 300 provides the necessary guidance on developing a Design Analysis. Maximum Extent Feasible Include this section in all projects where existing pedestrian facilities may be altered and it may not be feasible to meet WSDOT design criteria for pedestrian facility design elements. If only new pedestrian facilities are proposed on a project, WSDOT design criteria for pedestrian facilities must be met and MEF documentation is not allowed. The design-build team must coordinate with the Regional ADA Coordinator on all proposed MEFs prior to preparing and submitting the MEF document. Final Design Documents Include in all projects. The project team should encourage the Design-Builder to develop and complete the final Design Documents as the design is being developed and Released for Construction. The project team should review and verify the final Design Documents depict the final constructed design by the Design-Builder. Section 2.13: Bridges and Structures Introduction Section 2.13, Bridges and Structures, defines the requirements for bridges, retaining walls, noise walls, buried structures, , illumination/ITS/sign structures, and other structures. The WSDOT Bridge Design Manual (BDM) sets the standard for bridge and structure design within WSDOT right of way. The BDM outlines WSDOT’s design details and methods, incorporating standard practices that are based on years of experience and historical performance. All mandatory requirements for design-build contracts are in Chapter 15 of the BDM. If the RFP or a Mandatory Standard references a specific section in the BDM, the Design-Builder shall first review the applicable portions of Chapter 15. All other chapters in the BDM shall be considered a Reference Document. All active BDM Design Memorandum shall be included as Mandatory Standards. The template is meant to provide general design requirements. It may be necessary to augment, or add to, the current 2.13 template language to provide project specific technical requirements for work not covered in the base template document. Modifications to the template require the involvement of the WSDOT Bridge & Structures Office and the HQ Construction Office.

Usage The Bridge and Structures Office will work with the Project Office to add project specific requirements into the RFP language is needed. The WSDOT Bridge Design Manual (BDM) Chapter 15 contains additional technical requirements that may not be contained in the RFP. Coordination with the Bridge & Structures Office is necessary to ensure any fill-ins do not create conflicts. Design Criteria ***$$1$$*** Provide required minimum clearances for each overwater structure. Required minimum vertical clearances may vary at each location and shall be defined for freeboard and maintenance access. If site specific clearances are not defined in the RFP, the default clearances shall control. a. Freeboard - above the 100 year Mean Recurrence Interval (MRI) and maintained across the width of the hydraulic opening This dimension is defined in the Preliminary/Final Hydraulic Design Report. b. Maintenance - above the channel thalweg to the Controlling Top Elevation. This should be determined in accordance with the WSDOT Design Manual. ***$$2$$*** Test level requirements for all bridge barrier for the project. Typically will Be TL-4, for most bridge. TL-5 shall be used for bridges as described in the BDM 10.2.1. Bridge Seismic Design Criteria ***$$1$$*** Each bridge on the project shall be classified as Critical, Essential or Normal for purposes of seismic design. See WSDOT Bridge Design Manual Section 4.1. Temporary Structures ***$$1$$*** List the structures(s) where the foundations need to be located outside the ordinary high water. Contact the Hydraulics Office for recommendations on identifying locations. Conceptual Design Development Requirements The design development by WSDOT should be advanced as necessary to identify the conceptual type, size, and location of all major structures, such as bridges and buried structures with a span length 20 feet or greater. Retaining walls with an exposed face height at any location of more than 10 feet that have significant surcharge loads, subsurface soil reinforcing conflicts, or utility conflicts shall be identified as high risk and may benefit from a conceptual type, size, and location. The Geotechnical Office may provide global stability analysis for high risk walls to increase the confidence of constructability prior to RFP release. Structures design and construction is an opportunity to recognize both the cost and schedule advantages of design-build. Design-Builders have different areas of expertise, resources, and subcontractors, which can be most efficiently utilized in Design-Build Manual M 3126.05

design-build if they have flexibility in determining structure types. To facilitate the process, it is best to not prescribe structure types in the Technical Requirements. The structure conceptual plan is part of RFP Appendix M. The purpose of the structure conceptual plan is to present a baseline structural concept where bridges or buried structures are assumed by those preparing the RFP to be appropriate based on the criteria and requirements specified in the RFP. When determining the structure type, size and location for the structure conceptual plan, constructability shall be considered which may require construction staging diagrams, evaluation of potential crane placement locations, girder launching, girder shipping, and potential capacity of existing adjacent structure. The structure conceptual plan is developed to be consistent with the overall baseline civil roadway concept of RFP Appendix M. The content of the structure conceptual plan for a bridge or buried structure includes the items listed in the Conceptual Plan Checklist of WSDOT Bridge Design Manual (BDM) Appendix 15.2-A1. Structure conceptual plans for retaining walls should include plan location, elevation view, and a cross section taken at the critical wall locations to demonstrate surcharge locations, utility conflicts, or maximum soil reinforcing lengths. Section 2.14: Stormwater Introduction Section 2.14, Stormwater specifies requirements for design and construction of the stormwater drainage system. The WSDOT Highway Runoff Manual M 31-16 directs the planning and design of stormwater management facilities for new and redeveloped Washington State highways, rest areas, park and ride lots, ferry terminals, and highway maintenance facilities statewide. The WSDOT Highway Runoff Manual frequently references the WSDOT Hydraulics Manual M 23-03 to address the analysis and design of hydraulic features. The two manuals are used in tandem to complete the analysis and design of stormwater drainage systems within the Project. Usage Section 2.14, Stormwater is applicable whenever there is stormwater or drainage work within the Project. Section 2.14, Stormwater is created to supplement the WSDOT Highway Runoff Manual , the WSDOT Hydraulics Manual , and other documents included in the Mandatory Standards. The WSDOT Highway Runoff Manual and WSDOT Hydraulics Manual cannot provide the solutions for all possible stormwater and hydraulic design scenarios. As WSDOT gains more experience with the designbuild process, Section 2.14, Stormwater will be updated with lessons learned from stormwater and drainage designs that may help future design-build projects. Any supplemental stormwater and hydraulic policies and requirements in Section 2.14, Stormwater may eventually be incorporated into the WSDOT Highway Runoff Manual or WSDOT Hydraulics Manual . When tailoring Section 2.14, Stormwater to the Project and creating the Conceptual Hydraulic Report, the Project Engineering Office (PEO) should work closely with the Region Hydraulics office.

This section provides guidance on how to add to or edit Section 2.14, Stormwater, including guidance on how to complete the fill-ins. The person who prepares Section 2.14, Stormwater must have detailed knowledge about the Project and have experience in stormwater and hydraulic design. Looking through the scope of work, the designer should identify which work would need additional clarification, guidance, or project specific requirements. For example: The Conceptual Hydraulic Report calls for a cross culvert to be installed along an interstate highway. It has been determined that using an open cut method to install the culvert is not allowed. However, this requirement is not mentioned anywhere in the Mandatory Standards. To enforce this requirement, it must be written in Section 2.14, Stormwater. This type of issue is normally a project-specific decision. The language added to Section 2.14, Stormwater for the new requirement could be, “Using an open cut method along the highway ***$$1$$*** at milepost ***$$2$$*** to install the culvert is not allowed.” Without this written requirement in the 2.14, Stormwater, the Design- Builder can open cut the highway to install the culvert, and legally WSDOT cannot stop the Design-Builder from doing it. Another example is where the WSDOT PEO creating the RFP has determined that only steel pipes can be installed on the WSDOT bridge even though other pipe materials may meet the requirements. Section 2.14, Stormwater should provide the detailed specifications for the acceptable pipe material to be installed on the WSDOT bridge. The language added to Section 2.14, Stormwater, for the new project-specific requirement could be, “Only steel pipes are allowed to be installed on WSDOT Bridge ***$$1$$***/***$$2$$***.” General The fill-in is for any additional element of Work that needs to be added to the Section 2.14, Stormwater.

Conceptual Level Hydraulic Report and the Design Builder’s Hydraulic Reports and Intermediate Drainage Designs Typically, the conceptual designs are about 15 percent to 30 percent complete. The Conceptual Hydraulic Report should document all assumptions and show all calculations made. The Conceptual Hydraulic Report should follow the Hydraulic Report Outline and Checklist posted on the website https://wsdot.wa.gov/ Design/hydraulics All deviations and adjustments from the WSDOT Highway Runoff Manual and the WSDOT Hydraulics Manual should be identified and documented in the Conceptual Hydraulic Report. Approval of deviations and adjustment should be obtained prior to the RFP. Existing soil infiltration rates and seasonal high groundwater surface elevations at potential BMP locations may take a long time to obtain. Completing and having this type of information in the Conceptual Hydraulic Report is recommended to help reduce questions about the project site. All the commitments should be identified and documented in the Conceptual Hydraulic Report. Drainage Conveyance System This section sets the default requirements for dealing with the existing drainage conveyance system that is impacted or modified by the Project. The PEO creating the RFP can change the requirements in this section if the PEO does a lot of up-front work determining the condition of the existing drainage conveyance system. If any section of the existing drainage conveyance system is determined by the PEO to be in good condition and does not need to be replaced by the Project, the PEO, in close coordination with the Region Hydraulics office, will list that part of the existing drainage conveyance system in Appendix H of the RFP.

Infiltration Existing soil infiltration rates and/or seasonal high groundwater surfaces elevation need to be determined for the designs of infiltration type detention and treatment BMPs. It is best to obtain the infiltration rates and groundwater surface elevations prior to the RFP.

Section 2.15: Roadside Restoration Introduction Section 2.15, Roadside Restoration, covers all work necessary to provide aesthetic guidance for structures and for the restoration of the roadsides. Environmental mitigation may also be included. Roadside work in design-build is an important part of any project and should comply with WSDOT policy as well as environmental requirements for Sensitive Areas. The Design- Build process allows the Design-Builder latitude in developing a design that varies from the Conceptual Plans or guidance included in Appendix L, providing the Design-Builder the opportunity to develop the most efficient or innovative design. However, these variations require review and concurrence by the WSDOT Landscape Architect or as delegated to the region Landscape Architect (LA), which could affect the project schedule. As a result, early and continued involvement from LA staff is necessary to identify how the design can be flexible and innovative while ensuring the project scope and RFP are consistent with the regulatory requirements for the project and the statewide Roadside Policy. The RFP Coordinator/Procurement Manager should contact the Bridge & Structures Architecture Services for support with architectural aspects of roadside structures such as retaining walls, noise walls, bridges, barriers, sign structures, and fencing. If Chapter 2.15 is written by a consultant, Bridge & Structures Architecture Services should be provided opportunity for review of the RFP text and of the Bridge and Landscape Architectural Standards appendix document. The requirements included in Section 2.15 must clearly identify aesthetic requirements, roadside restoration requirements, and mitigation responsibilities to be managed by the Design-Builder. This section (as do all the DB template documents) includes fill-in locations that allow the project team to incorporate project-specific information. Please note that some entire sections may need modification to accurately describe project requirements. Furthermore, a project team may need to add a subsection(s) to address unique project requirements (e.g., the LA and the Bridge Architect work together to define structure aesthetics, Environmental staff work with LA staff on Sensitive Area restoration, hydraulics engineers work with LA staff on stream restoration, etc.)

A critical step in the development of Section 2.15 is the determination of the structural needs, environmental mitigation needs, the potential impacts of the project, and Right of Way expected to be available for restoration. This list identifies all of the commitments that the Design-Builder is responsible for implementing during design and construction of the project. These project requirements are conceptually defined and become contract documents in the RFP and in Appendix L. Additional guidance for policy requirements can be found in the WSDOT Roadside Policy Manual M 31-10. Appendix L contains all the restoration and aesthetics guidance related to the project. Examples include the Project Aesthetic Guidelines document, a Roadside Restoration Conceptual Plan, Conceptual Mitigation Plans, or other guidance documents to aid in preparation of the contract plans. In addition, other studies that support environmental requirements may be found in Appendix E, Environmental Documents. These documents should provide clear enough guidance to help the Proposers prepare an accurate Proposal. Section 2.15 should also make the Proposer aware of the expectation for community involvement in developing plans to meet their expectations. While adhering to the standards in the guidance in Appendix L is mandatory, the public expectations must also be met, so engaging the public early on is a necessary component in eliminating surprises to the community. The RFP Coordinator/Procurement Manager should contact the Bridge & Structures Architecture Services for support with architectural aspects of roadside structures such as retaining walls, noise walls, bridges, barriers, sign structures, and fencing. If Chapter 2.15 is written by a consultant, Bridge & Structures Architecture Services should be provided opportunity for review of the RFP text and of the Bridge and Landscape Architectural Standards appendix document. Usage Application of template: This template is to be used as a starting place. Each project has its own particular needs and constraints, which require careful consideration when reviewing the section for retention, deletion, or addition. This template applies to most roadway projects, but does not include complete guidance for environmental mitigation or fish passage projects. Those sections must be developed to represent the unique needs and requirements. For further fish passage project guidance, please refer to in the Design-Build Resources folder in SharePoint. It is critical to review several other sections when preparing the requirements for Section 2.15. Check sections on geotechnical, erosion control, environmental, and structures to be certain that aesthetic, environmental, roadside, and mitigation requirements are consistent from section to section. This consistency may require meeting with other groups to develop consensus for approach and adaptation of the various sections to be consistent. Examples where consistency may be an issue:
• Aesthetic guidance for roadside restoration does not allow quarry spalls as final ground treatment but Erosion Control or Geotechnical section allows it. Design-Build Manual M 3126.05 
Page 4-55
Chapter 4
Structure and Content of the Procurement
• Aesthetic guidance allows limited wall types while structure or geotechnical sections allow more types than desirable from an aesthetic standpoint.
• WSDOT Roadside Policy Manual M 31-10 stresses retention of existing vegetation while staging areas are being offered to the contractor, which may be detrimental to the existing vegetation and require tree mitigation depending on impact type.
• Erosion control materials or maximum slopes allowed by geotechnical section can be inconsistent with the ability to replace trees on the roadsides as required in Section 2.15.
• Soil depth requirements for growing trees on lids require structural ability of the bridge to withstand the weight, while structural engineers or project engineering may not want to make specific requirements of the contractor.

Section 2.17: Traffic Signals Introduction Section 2.17, Traffic Signals, applies to work related to modifying existing or installing new Traffic Signal systems. In addition to vehicle traffic signal systems, this section would also include work involving pedestrian traffic signal systems, bicycle signal systems, ramp meter traffic signals (although ramp meters are typically included in Section 2.18, ITS), flashing beacons used to control vehicle traffic, warning signals (usually flashing beacons with signs) and emergency vehicle traffic signals. All are considered different types of Traffic Signal Systems. Traffic Signals, as a system, may include, but are not limited to the following items:
• Traffic signal standards and mast arms
• Strain poles
• Span wire
• Vehicle and ADA-compliant pedestrian signal heads
• Vehicle detection (typically either induction loops or video cameras)
• Pedestrian detection
• Emergency vehicle detection
• Traffic signal controllers and cabinets
• Traffic signal interconnects Additional electrical equipment used to support the traffic signal system are also included as work items with the effected traffic signal systems. These additional electrical equipment items could include conduit, conductors, junction boxes, pull boxes, cable vaults, service cabinets and transformers and uninterrupted power supply (UPS) cabinets. The technical materials and construction requirements for these items are detailed in Section 2.16, Illumination. These requirements should not be duplicated in different sections of the RFP. Information regarding these items should be referenced back to Section 2.16. Coordination in developing Sections 2.16, Illumination, and Section 2.17, Traffic Signals, in regards to these requirements is essential. Traffic Signal systems may be owned, operated, and maintained by either WSDOT, cities, or counties. When Traffic Signal systems owned by either cities or counties are effected by the project, all subsections of Section 2.17 must be evaluated for modifications to include the requirements of those other agencies.

Usage Section 2.17 Traffic Signals should be included in design-build contracts when new Traffic Signal systems will be installed or existing Traffic Signal systems will be modified or otherwise impacted or when any of the following work items are included in the project:
• Installing new or impacting existing conduit runs, junction boxes, pull boxes, cable vaults, electrical conductors or communication cable associated with Traffic signal systems
• Installing and removal of temporary Traffic Signal systems including temporary vehicle detection systems and the associated electrical equipment
• Installing or modifying a traffic signal interconnect system General (WSDOT Standard Specifications M 41-10, Section 8-20) Modify this section to include other types of traffic signal systems as they apply to the project. This may include flashing beacon signals, warning signs with flashing beacons or emergency vehicle signal systems Forward Compatibility (WSDOT Standard Specifications M 41-10, Section 8-20.1) ***$$1$$*** Add requirements to this section that would make the traffic signal system compatible with future projects or requirements. If a future project is planned to modify the channelization at the traffic signal location then the current design would want to build the traffic signal to accommodate that future expansion. For example if a future project would add lanes and widen the roadway then the current project RFP may want to ensure that the Traffic signal poles and controller cabinets were located far enough away from the roadway to accommodate that future expansion without moving the signal poles or cabinets. Mandatory Standards (WSDOT Standard Specifications M 41-10, Section 8-20.1) Modify this list of standards to reflect the work being performed. Add city and county standards references as they would apply to work being performed on their equipment. Fill-ins ***$$<Number>$$*** should reflect the WSDOT region where the project is located.

Section 2.18: Intelligent Transportation Systems Introduction The primary document driving the design of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) component of the Design-Build project is the ITS Design Requirement document. This document provides background on how and why certain ITS components are designed as well as specific requirements associated with many ITS components. Section 2.18 of the RFP is more of an overlay to the ITS Design Requirements document, adding project specific requirements as well as site-specific requirements. While a Conceptual Plan may be developed for the project, the requirements of the RFP and ITS Design Requirements document are the primary tools that guide the overall ITS design.

When developing Section 2.18 of the RFP, early and continued involvement with the regional ITS Implementation and Operations staff is required to identify specific ITS needs from the project. The ITS requirements included in Section 2.18 of the RFP need to clearly identify specific ITS features to be included by the Design-Builder. This section includes a number of fill-in locations that allow the project team to incorporate projectspecific information (such as the number of metered lanes on an on-ramp, or the approximate location where a weather station is needed). Some entire sections may need modification or deletion to accurately describe project requirements. In special situations, a subsection (or sections) may need to be added to address unique project requirements (e.g., Active Traffic Management (ATM), Part-time Use Shoulder Lane (PUSL), tolling, etc.) Appendix T contains the ITS Design Requirements document, Appendix B contains the ITS Special Provisions and Appendix T contains the ITS Standard Details. It is imperative that the latest versions of these items are obtained for inclusion in the project. All of these items are living documents that are frequently being updated by the ITS Design and ITS Implementation groups. Usage This section explains how to use the template and provides guidance for certain subsections of Section 2.18, Intelligent Transportation Systems. This includes guidance for fill-ins, GSP selection, and references to helpful examples or resources for the author. General This section contains a brief summary of the ITS elements expected to be included in the project. It should be modified for each project to only include those items that are applicable. It also contains two fill-in sections. Both fill-in items are for non-typical ITS devices as well as tolling devices. If not applicable, these fill-ins should be left blank and the sentence syntax modified accordingly. Mandatory Standards There are four fill-in locations in this section. The first fill-in is for the WSDOT Regional ITS Special Provisions; the second fill-in is for the WSDOT Intelligent Transportation System Design Requirements document if your region has adopted it; the third fill-in is for the WSDOT Regional ITS Details; and the fourth fill-in is for the WSDOT Signal, Illumination, and ITS Details. These fill-ins are required for all projects that contain ITS elements. The documents for first three fill-ins are to be provided by the Regional ITS Design team.

Section 2.19: Signing Introduction The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) uses traffic control signs as the primary mechanism for regulating, warning, and guiding traffic. The proper traffic control signs must be in place when any section of highway is open to the motoring public. Each Design-Build project has unique and specific signing requirements. For statewide signing uniformity and continuity, it is sometimes necessary to provide signing beyond the project limits. Design characteristics of the facility determine the size and legend for a sign. As the design speed increases, larger sign sizes are necessary to provide adequate message comprehension time. The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), the WSDOT Traffic Manual M 51-02 and the WSDOT Sign Fabrication Manual M 55-05 contain standard sign dimensions, specific legends, and reflective sheeting types for all new signs.

Traffic Incident Management Plan WSDOT Regions vary on how they manage incidents and the plan should reflect the Region’s specific approach. For example, the Northwest Region has a Traffic Management Center that actively monitors multiple highway/freeway systems via cameras and loop detection. Incidents can be detected via this system, monitored on the WSP Radio, or reported to the Region’s Radio Team. They will then activate Variable Messages on the permanent system. Incidents within a project can be reported to the TMC and actions taken accordingly. It is recommended that the designer be familiar with their Region’s methods of response to incidents.

An example would be a Fair, a city event such as a parade, a football game, a local race (example Seafair Rock n’ Roll) etc. ***$$2$$*** Design-Builder should work with the WSDOT Engineer on determining local venues where their arrival and departure could affect the highway system. The Traffic Office can assist in determining the venue capacity that would impact the State highway system. An example would be a local Amphitheatre, racetrack, or stadium whose combined attendance over a set number would impact the roadway. The Region Traffic Office can provide guidance on what this capacity would be based on the maximum capacity or near maximum capacity of a venue based on type of event. Lane Closures ***$$1$$*** This section should be a table listing details of the allowable closure times for each lane to be closed, and days of the week.

***$$1$$*** ***$$1$$*** This section would be developed if the designer determined that there were work elements that would be performed best under a full freeway, highway, or roadway closure. The designer should work with the Region Traffic Office on determining the best closure window and verbiage for this section. Typically the verbiage includes the section of roadway that may be closed, list any associated ramps that may be closed, and provide the allowable hours for this closure such as Friday 10:00 p.m. to Monday 5:00 a.m. If a roadway is being allowed to be closed in each direction, the designer will need to work with the Region Traffic Office on determining if both directions can be closed simultaneously or separately and that criteria addressed in this section. Each closure and their times would be listed separately. Entrance and Exit Ramp Closures ***$$1$$*** This section would be a table listing each ramp and the times they may be closed. The Designer should work with their Region Traffic Office on determining the hours. ***$$1$$*** ***$$2$$*** Additional closures that are not already covered above may be described here. Allowable Shoulder Closures ***$$1$$*** This section would be a table listing times that shoulders may be closed. If there are multiple roadways, the closures should be listed by roadway (example, SR routes, interstate routes, local streets).

Contractor’s Right of Entry Agreement Use this fill-in to provide contact information for obtaining the Contractor’s Right of Entry Agreement. Section 2.24: Right of Way Introduction WSDOT must delineate existing Right of Way (ROW) and access as part of base data collection. ROW and access are potential high-risk areas that can significantly impact the project schedule both in project development by WSDOT and contract execution by the Design-Builder. To determine if adequate ROW is available to build the project, it is necessary to accurately determine the physical boundaries of existing ROW along the route. Whenever possible, establish the ROW limits within which the DesignBuilder must work on a project. In some cases, it may be advantageous for WSDOT to delay purchasing a portion of the required ROW until the final footprint is created by the selected Design-Builder. This is important in areas with very high real estate costs where WSDOT wishes to minimize the amount of real estate purchased. It is important to relay WSDOT’s desire to minimize ROW within the RFP scoring system. When making this decision, factor the potential cost of delays associated with ROW acquisition into WSDOT’s risk cost. Under Federal and Washington State statutes and regulations, WSDOT’s ability to acquire property in a timely manner is limited. Because WSDOT is in the best position to appraise, negotiate, and purchase ROW or relocate impacted facilities associated with a design-build project, these risks will normally remain with the WSDOT. A preliminary assessment of the ROW personnel required to meet a project’s schedule is necessary in order to determine whether the project should even be considered for design-build. Usage This section explains how to use the template and provides guidance for certain subsections of Section 2.24 Right of Way. This includes guidance for fill-ins, GSP selection, and references to helpful examples or resources for the author. Available Right of Way The following are optional fill ins for this section: **(WSDOT Ownership) ** WSDOT owns existing right of way, including access rights, as shown on the Right of Way Plans (Appendix R). WSDOT has not determined the need for, nor acquired any additional ROW, for the subject project. The Design-Builder shall have access to the ROW upon Notice to Proceed (NTP).

**(WSDOT Acquire) ** WSDOT will acquire the property for this Project as shown in the Conceptual Plan or the Right of Way Plans (Appendix R), or both. The DesignBuilder shall have access to the ROW upon NTP. If the ROW is not available upon NTP, WSDOT will consider an extension of time in accordance with Section 1-08 of the General Provisions. Right of Way Use Permit If there are Right of Way Use Permits or a Haul Road/Detour Agreement with a Local Agency, fill in the appropriate agency name and include the appropriate documents in Appendix R. Additional Right of Way Acquisition Additional ROW may be necessary if the Design-Builder’s proposed design requires the acquisition of property outside the ROW. This subsection outlines all requirements by the Design-Builder to contact the WSDOT engineer to obtain an approximate amount of time that would be required for acquisition. The WSDOT Real Estate Services (RES) office shall be consulted to determine availability of existing ROW or impacts to project schedule, risks, and budget regarding acquisition of additional right of way either by WSDOT or the Design-Builder. If the Design-Builder requests additional ROW, all costs associated with the additional ROW are paid by the Design-Builder. Design Builder shall not have access to additional properties until the ROW is certified by WSDOT RES. Property Management This subsection states that the Design-Builder shall establish a Property Management Plan for all property existing, acquired or to be acquired for the project. The plan at a minimum should include temporary fencing, how often inspections for vandalism, rodent infestation and illegal dumping. The plan should also include the methods for curing any issues found during inspections. See the WSDOT Right of Way Manual for more information regarding the Property Management Plan. Demolition The Design-Builder is responsible for all demolitions to be removed by Project. This section outlines requirements for the Work. Right of Entry Right of Entries are to be used only for the sole benefit of the property owner, i.e. for driveway reconnects and slope blending of property adjacent to the highway. If there are right of entries that pertain to the project, then fill in the County Assessor’s Tax Parcel numbers.

Notice of Entry If the Design-Builder determines the need to conduct due diligence on property pursuant to RCW 47.01.170, and the property is not owned by WSDOT, the DesignBuilder shall issue a Notice of Entry. The work associated with the Notice of Entry shall not be for invasive work or ground disturbance activities. A Temporary Easement may be required for more invasive work than permitted in RCW 47.01.170. A sample of a Notice of Entry is available on the DB Program SharePoint Site here. Construction Interdisciplinary Commitments If there have been commitments made to property owners through a Construction Memo: (Form RES-344) executed by the WSDOT Engineer during the acquisition of the property that shall be fulfilled by the Design-Builder with respect to the property parcel acquired, then the copies are included in Appendix R. See Form RES-344. Notification ***$$1$$*** Provide “fill-in” number of Calendar Days required by the WSDOT Engineer for advance notification of any work within the right of entry limits for the project. Right of Way Certification Prior to the commencement of construction in any Project phase or segment, ROW must be certified in accordance with Chapter 17 of the WSDOT Right of Way Manual. If additional ROW acquisitions occur after certification, an updated certification must be submitted to the WSDOT Engineer for approval prior to commencement of construction Section 2.25: Control of Materials Section 2.25, Control of Materials, contains no fill-ins and is not typically modified. Section 2.26: Toll Infrastructure Introduction When tolling is included as part of a Design-Build project, WSDOT typically will have a civil design-build contract provide the physical civil infrastructure needed for the toll system (e.g. toll gantries, toll cabinets, toll rate signs, signing, etc.) while having a separate contract with a roadside toll vendor whom provides actual toll equipment at toll points (license plate cameras, lane controllers, readers/antennas, etc.) This Section gives requirements for toll infrastructure elements, coordination requirements with the toll vendor, and requirements for developing a toll system roll out plan in order to achieve a toll system rollout. When developing Section 2.26 of the RFP, early and continued involvement with the WSDOT Toll Division staff is required to identify specific toll infrastructure needs for the project.

The toll infrastructure requirements included in Section 2.26 of the RFP need to clearly identify specific toll features to be included by the Design-Builder. This section includes a number of fill-in locations that allow the project team to incorporate project-specific information (such as the number of toll points, or the approximate type and location where a toll rate sign is needed). Some entire sections may need modification or deletion to accurately describe project requirements. In special situations, a subsection (or sections) may need to be added to address unique project requirements (e.g., express toll lanes, single point tolling, modifications to existing toll system elements, etc.) Coordination with the authors of the following sections are critical in development of the RFP:
• Section 2.13 Bridges and Structures (toll gantries and toll rate sign structures)
• Section 2.16, Illumination (power needs for toll vendor)
• Section 2.18, Intelligent Transportation Systems (general ITS elements and toll and toll rate sign communication networks)
• Section 2.19, Signing (toll signing)
• Section 2.20, Pavement Markings (express toll lane markings and access point locations)
• Section 2.22, Maintenance of Traffic (traffic control closures to be provided by the Design-Builder to the toll vendor for their installation and testing work) Appendix Z contains toll appendices that are project specific. Usage This section explains how to use the template and provides guidance for certain subsections of Section 2.26, Toll Infrastructure. This includes additional guidance for fill-ins contained within the Section 2.26 template and references to helpful examples or resources for the author. Performance Requirements This subsection identifies the requirements for coordinating with the WSDOT Engineer and the toll vendor. It identifies the need for the Design-Builder to provide a Toll System Coordinator. The size and complexity of the tolling piece of the project will dictate the experience needed by the person for this position. It also establishes the frequency for toll task force meetings throughout the project where the DesignBuilder will coordinate their design and construction with the toll vendor. Design and Construction Requirements This subsection gives a general outline of what is required of the Design-Builder for toll related work. The type of toll facility will dictate what is needed. In general, the two types of toll facilities are either a single point full road toll system (typical for toll roads, tunnels, or bridge) or an express toll lane system (currently on I-405 and SR 167). It is critical to coordinate with the WSDOT Toll Division to determine what their toll vendor needs in order to install the toll equipment on these facilities. Page 4-88

Express Toll Lane Access Points This subsection shall include detailed information on where access points into/out of express toll lanes are to be located. These location description should be fairly detailed for beginnings, endings, and mid-point/intermediate access points. These locations shall be agreed upon by the project office and the WSDOT Toll Division using actual and project traffic pattern data during the conceptual design phase. This subsection can be omitted if the toll system is not an express toll lane facility. Toll Point A toll point is a location on the toll facility where vehicle information is collected in order to charge a user a toll. It typically consists of a toll gantry and associated toll cabinets. The Design-Builder will install these elements and the toll vendor will come later and install toll equipment on the gantry and within the toll cabinets. Depending on the corridor, these toll points can either be called out to specific locations (like on a ramp) or a general area to allow some flexibility by the DesignBuilder. The goal of a toll point location is to ensure that all vehicles using the toll facility travels through a toll point. Radio Frequency Survey When a toll point is completed, antennas and readers are installed on a toll gantry to identify transponders that are installed on vehicles as part of the Good To Go! program. This equipment uses radio frequency to read the transponders. Some toll projects will warrant a need to work with the WSDOT Radio Shop to perform a radio frequency (RF) survey to ensure that a location does not currently have existing frequencies in a the range that the toll readers use that would interfere with toll operations. Having this survey done before advertising the RFP will mitigate risk of needing to relocate a toll point. Some projects may not have flexibility to move toll points around which would not necessitate the need for an RF survey. Toll Gantry A toll gantry is typically a monotube structure over the road which looks very similar to a sign structure. They can be either cantilevers or full span structures depending on the need of the project. Currently, the toll vendor only needs one toll gantry at a toll point but this needs to be confirmed with the WSDOT Toll Division for each project. It is best practice to have a toll gantry be exclusively used for toll equipment installation and not have overhead signs installed on it. For efficiency, toll gantries can be shared for more than one toll point (e.g. a T-cantilever used for a northbound and a southbound toll point on direct access ramps) but this needs to be coordinated with the WSDOT Toll Division beforehand. Coordination with Section 2.13 Bridges and Structures is required. Vibration requirements and per lane/shoulder loads of toll equipment that will be installed by the toll vendor will be included in Section 2.13. Design-Build Manual M 3126.05

Roadside Toll Cabinets The Design-Builder will install roadside toll cabinets that are connected to the final communications network and power service before turning over the cabinets to the toll vendor for their installation of toll equipment. Generally these cabinets are double wide cabinets (four doors). This section will need to specify the type of finish the cabinet will have (either color or mill finish) based on the project needs. This subsection also discusses the needs for cabinets to be provided for uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and toll reader equipment. The Design-Builder provides these empty cabinets for the toll vendor’s use if required. Toll Rate Sign Toll rate signs are required on a toll facility to indicate the current toll a user would pay at that time. The type and locations of the toll rate sign(s) will depending on the type of facility. Express toll lane systems require toll rate signs before each access point and at direct access interchanges leading directly into the toll lanes. A single point full toll facility requires the toll rate sign to be placed near but upstream of a toll point. Please see the WSDOT Toll Signing Guidance document for more information on the type of toll rate sign needed. This section goes into great detail on the design and testing needs for toll rate signs. Coordinate with the Region on the type and manufacturer of electronic displays and signs controllers that will be installed on the toll rate signs. Toll rate signs will be completely installed by the Design-Builder and operated and maintained by WSDOT. Currently, the toll vendor will not have any involvement in the installation, testing, operations, or maintenance of toll rate signs. Communication System Each toll point will have their own dedicated toll network which typically consists of six-strands of distribution fiber that connects to a nearby communication hub. This ensures that no other data is on the toll network fiber when connected to the hub. The toll information then travels from the communication hub to the WSDOT Northwest Region TMC where the toll vendor’s host system servers are located. Details on the toll fiber network are located in Section 2.18 Intelligent Transportation System Conduit Coordinate with the WSDOT Toll Division to determine the type and quantity of conduit that is to be provided by the Design-Builder for the Toll Vendor’s use. The Design-Builder will install these conduit empty and the Toll Vendor will pull their cable for the toll equipment.

Spare Parts Due to the uniqueness of the toll infrastructure for a project, spare parts for toll rate signs and toll cabinet are typically provided by the Design-Builder and given to the WSDOT entity that will be responsible for maintaining physical infrastructure on the corridor (usually Signal Maintenance). Turnover, Operations, and Maintenance This subsection goes into detail regarding what toll infrastructure elements need to be completed before turning toll point sites over to the toll vendor for their toll equipment installation and testing activities. Coordination with the WSDOT Toll Division and overall project phases is needed as this subsection is written. Toll Infrastructure Design Concept Plan This is a deliverable by the Design-Builder that gives the general layout of toll infrastructure elements on the corridor. This enables the Design-Builder to start thinking about the toll pieces as the rest of their design progresses. This also allows WSDOT and the various departments have a better understanding of where toll points, signs, access points, etc. are proposed to be located which helps with later design reviews. Toll System Rollout Plan The Toll System Rollout Plan is more of a narrative document that gives insight on how the Design-Builder plans to meet the requirements of this section from design, through construction, and reaching Toll Commencement (start of toll collection). This document needs to include all coordination efforts, schedule, and phasing for the Design-Builder, the toll vendor, and WSDOT’s efforts. Toll Infrastructure Preliminary Design Submittal This design submittal is focused on schedule and narrative deliverables required by the Design-Builder. Since there are no “tolling” RFC drawings/sheets, the actual design of toll infrastructure, ITS, signing, pavement markings, roadway, etc. will be captured in those discipline plan sheet deliverables. Toll Infrastructure Final Design Submittal Similar to the Preliminary Design Submittal, this Final Design Submittal is focused on narrative documents, schedule, and additional supportive materials to ensure that turnover of toll points to the toll vendor is smooth. The Design-Builder will also provide traffic control to the toll vendor so this submittal includes updates to the Design-Builder’s various traffic control plans.

Given the nature and cost of maintenance work, as well as the exposure inherent in maintenance and operational activities, it is important for designers to consider maintenance and operations staff as major stakeholders in every project. It is also important for maintenance and operations staff to understand the purpose of the project and to participate in determining the best method(s) to keep it functioning as designed while maintaining their responsibilities outside of the specific project limits. This chapter provides multiple options to help improve coordination with maintenance and operations staff during project design. These “best practices” are a culmination of responses from WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01 user surveys, interviews with maintenance and operations superintendents, and various regional practices that have demonstrated potential improvement related to the coordination of design and maintenance efforts and personnel. The concepts and methods presented herein do not replace any approved communication or documentation processes that may be currently required by a WSDOT region during the project development process. Usage All sections in 2.29 are to be used and determined by the project limits if they apply or not. Section 2.30: Water Crossings General Introduction Section 2.30 should be included in any contract that builds a structure over water. It addresses the requirements for fish passage as well as hydrologic requirements such as hydraulics reports, scour analysis, long term aggradation and degradation, FEMA flooding analysis, and designer qualifications. Assumptions Section 2.30 was developed with several built in assumptions. Please be sure your project aligns with these assumptions. If they do not, changes to the Section 2.30 template will probably be needed. These assumptions are as follows: 1. The project is primarily fish passage. 2. WSDOT has not developed the JARPA. The contract assigns this to the Design-Builder. 3. Before the RFP is issued, the Design PEO and Headquarters Hydraulics and Region Environmental have developed a draft PHD through extensive discussions and negotiations with the Tribe(s) and WDFW. This is when many decisions about the final design are made. 4. As policy, WSDOT does not want to assign the Design-Builder the risk to do whatever it takes, at whatever the cost, to obtain the permits.

5. Therefore, the expectations of the Tribe and WDFW must be put in the contract as requirements, not as options. 6. We do not expect the Design-Builder to innovate the dimensions in Table 2.30-B or other commitments we have made to the Tribes. All of these must be made contract requirements. If any innovation is to occur in those dimensions, it will require an ATC. 7. ATC’s on channel, structure, restoration, or that change or affect any of the commitments made to the Tribe(s) or WDFW must be reviewed by both before we respond to the Design-Builder. ATC’s that are uncertain of approval by the Tribes or WDFW should be rejected. 8. Design-Builder innovation is expected to be limited to constructability and managing traffic. Usage

Consider using the term “Projects of Similar Scope and Complexity (Relates to fish passage Work)” in the RFQ and ITP when describing Key Personnel experience requirements or past project requirements. If doing so, this definition should be added to the RFQ and ITP. 7. Submittal requirements are necessary as a check to be sure each Proposer understands what is required and is committed to build what is required.

Consider using the Incentive spec below, 1-08.11 11. Basic Configuration – The Basic Configuration provides several functions on a design-build contract, most of which are usually not necessary on a fish passage contract. Several WSDOT DB fish passage contracts have deleted all references to the Basic Configuration and Necessary Basic Configuration Changes. The concept of Basic Configuration was created as a convenient way to address two important functions: (1) to define aspects of the design that cannot be changed (without an approved ATC or change order) and are best described in a drawing, and (2) which the owner guarantees there is an acceptable design solution using the basic configuration. Examples used in the past have been complex horizontal and vertical roadway alignments, top elevation and offsets of noise walls, and existing right of way. It was “convenient” on complex geometric contracts because the owner’s conceptual design frequently could be used with little modification. The second function flows from what is known as the Spearin Doctrine which, translated into design-build terms, is the owner’s implied warranty that the project can be designed and constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications. Most contract requirements that require a drawing can simply be stated in the technical requirements by referencing the drawing; and, owing to the relative simplicity of a fish passage contract, there are usually few if any of these needed. On the other hand, the owner’s implied duty to create a contract that is constructible meeting all contract requirements still exists in a fish passage contract. That means it is still up to the design office to verify that there is a combination of stream horizontal alignment, stream vertical alignment, right of way area, MOT constraints, utility considerations, structure type with a Maintenance Clearance, Hydraulic Length, and Hydraulic Span Width that can be designed and constructed in concert with the contract. It is recommended, therefore, that the design office carry its conceptual design to the extent needed to affirm this to be true. Other Contract Considerations - TR Utilities 12. In order to avoid a costly delay by discovering an unknown utility during construction, it is recommended that the PEO conduct a three-dimensional Subsurface Utility Exploration and include the results in the RFP documents.

General Procurement Activities
Introduction The procurement process is one of the most important milestones of Design-Build (DB) delivery. It is important to recognize that the procurement milestone is much more than selection of the Design-Builder for the project. It is a pivotal step in the development of the project. It implements a process whereby the owner and the Design-Builder advance the design of the project in a manner that both maximizes the project goals and provides the most cost-effective designs to achieve those goals. DB apparent best value selection typically utilizes a two-step procurement process. In step 1, WSDOT prepares the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) outlining the minimum and desired DB team qualifications. Interested DB teams submit Statements of Qualifications (SOQ) in response to the RFQ. An Evaluation Team evaluates the SOQs according to the criteria published in the RFQ and establishes a short list of the most highly qualified Submitters. It is best practice to select three to five Submitters for the short list. In step 2, the Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued to short listed Submitters. Proposers submit Technical and Price Proposals in response to the RFP. Prior to opening the Price Proposals, the Evaluation Team evaluates the Technical Proposals. The proposal offering the apparent best value is awarded the contract

Procurement Resources All procurement resources mentioned in this chapter are available for download on the DB Program SharePoint site in the DB Resources folder. Preparation Guide: This chapter does not go into detail on how to prepare the actual RFQ, Instructions to Proposers (ITP), and RFP documents. For suggested best practices on DB procurement document preparation, refer to the Preparation Guide. Design-Build Procurement Folder Structure: A standardized folder structure for storing and organizing DB procurement called the Design-Build Procurement Folder Structure is designed to accommodate projects of varying size and complexity and should be used for all DB projects during the procurement process. Within the Design-Build Procurement Folder Structure is a Word file with brief instructions detailing which documents should be included in each folder. SOQ/Proposal Review Checklists: After the SOQ and Proposal Due Dates, Contract Ad & Award uses these checklists to ensure Submitter and Proposers are adhering to the submission requirements of the RFQ and ITP. Each SOQ and proposal are reviewed prior to being sent to the Evaluation Team. SFTP Configuration Instructions: Instructions detailing the steps for configuring to the WSDOT SFTP are for Submitters. Contract Ad & Award will post these instructions on the online directory for the project in the folder named “Submittals”.

Design-Build to Advertisement Checklist: The tool used an all DB projects to determine the level of formal approval needed to advertise. This spreadsheet assigns level of confidence to key elements of the RFP to determine whether those key elements are on target for the advertisement date. The advertisement date represents the RFQ date. Advertisement Notice: WSDOT’s initial release of information to procure a DB project is prepared in a formal notice to the industry as an Advertisement Notice. You can find examples of past advertisement and pre-advertisement notices on the SharePoint site. Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement and No Conflicts of Interest Affidavit: To ensure confidentiality and impartiality, everyone who is involved in the procurement of a DB project in any capacity must fill out a Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement and No Conflict of Interest Affidavit. These agreements will be kept on file with the project office; and will become part of the evaluation record. The Confidentiality and NonDisclosure Agreement and No Conflict of Interest Affidavit are discussed in further detail in Chapter 6. Apparent Best Value Determination Spreadsheet: The tool that calculates the Proposal Price with the Technical Score to determine which Proposer provides WSDOT with the apparent best value. Qualitative Evaluation Forms: The forms used by Evaluators to comment and score SOQs and Proposals. Prompt Questions: A list of suggested questions for External Debriefs.

Timelines and Deliverables The procurement steps represent the process of selecting the Design-Builder. However, the procurement steps include many activities beyond just the procurement process. As can be seen from the flowchart in Exhibit 5-1, an extensive work effort is necessary to support the procurement process and to simultaneously advance the project development.

Exhibit 5-3 identifies approximately a 1-year timeline for the procurement process, which is generally appropriate for large DB projects. Though DB delivery offers a strong potential to minimize the overall projects delivery time, it does require a significant duration for the procurement step to realize its benefits. Refer to Exhibit 5-3 as you populate the procurement timeline tables in the RFQ and the ITP. Exhibit 5-3 #
