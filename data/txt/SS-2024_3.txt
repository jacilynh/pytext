Prestressing
Each stressing system shall have a pressure gauge or load cell that will measure jacking force. The gauge shall display pressure accurately and readably with a dial at least 6 inches in diameter or with a digital display. Each jack and its gauge shall be calibrated as a unit and shall be accompanied by a certified calibration chart. The Contractor shall submit a Type 1 Working Drawing consisting of one copy of this chart. The cylinder extension during calibration shall be in approximately the position it will occupy at final jacking force.
Jacks and gauges shall be recalibrated and recertified: 1.
Annually, 2.
After any repair or adjustment, and 3.
Anytime there are indications that the jack calibration is in error.
The Engineer may use load cells to check jacks, gauges, and calibration charts before and during tensioning.
All load cells shall be calibrated and shall have an indicator that shows prestressing force in the strand. The range of this cell shall be broad enough that the lowest 10 percent of the manufacturer’s rated capacity will not be used to measure jacking force.
From manufacture to encasement in concrete, prestressing strand shall be protected against dirt, oil, grease, damage, and all corrosives. Strand shall be stored in a dry, covered area and shall be kept in the manufacturer’s original packaging until placement in the forms. If prestressing strand has been damaged or pitted, it will be rejected. Prestressing strand with rust shall be spot-cleaned with a nonmetallic pad to inspect for any sign of pitting or section loss. Once the prestressing steel has been installed, no welds or grounds for welders shall be made on the forms or the steel in the girder, except as specified.
When the Plans require temporary strands, they may be pretensioned or post-tensioned.

The Contractor shall not tension the post-tensioning reinforcement until the concrete in the cast-in-place closures reaches the minimum compressive strength specified in the Plans. This strength shall be measured with concrete cylinders made of the same concrete and cured under the same conditions as the cast-in-place closures. 3.
All post-tensioning shall be completed before placing the sidewalks and barriers on the Superstructure. 6-02.3(25)C
Casting
Side forms shall be steel except that cast-in-place concrete closure forms for spliced prestressed concrete girders, interior forms of prestressed concrete tub girders, and end bulkhead forms of prestressed concrete girders may be wood. Interior voids for prestressed concrete slab girders with voids shall be formed by either wax soaked cardboard or expanded polystyrene forms. The interior void forms shall be secured in the position as shown in the Working Drawings, and shall remain in place.
All concrete mixes to be used shall be preapproved in the WSDOT plant certification process. The temperature of the concrete when placed shall be between 50°F and 90°F.
Slump shall not exceed 4 inches for normal concrete nor 7 inches with the use of a high range water-reducing admixture, nor 9 inches when both a high range water-reducing admixture is used and the water/cement ratio is less than or equal to 0.35. For selfconsolidating concrete (SCC), the slump requirements specified above do not apply, and are instead replaced by the target slump flow and slump flow range specified as part of the SCC mix design.
Air-entrainment is not required in the concrete placed into prestressed concrete girders, cast-in-place concrete closures for spliced prestressed concrete girders, and prestressed concrete partial-depth stay-in-place panels, provided that the water/cement ratio is less than or equal to 0.45. 6-02.3(25)C1 Acceptance Testing of Concrete for Prestressed Concrete Girders

Curing
During curing, the Contractor shall keep the girder in a saturated curing atmosphere until the girder concrete has reached the required release strength. If the Engineer concurs, the
Contractor may shorten curing time by heating the outside of impervious forms. Heat may be radiant, convection, conducted steam, or hot air. With steam, the arrangement shall envelop the entire surface with saturated steam. Hot air curing will not be allowed, unless the Contractor submits Type 2 Working Drawings consisting of the proposed method to envelop and maintain the girder in a saturated atmosphere. Saturated atmosphere means a relative humidity of at least 90 percent. The Contractor shall never allow dry heat to touch the girder surface at any point.
Under heat curing methods, the Contractor shall: 1.
Keep all unformed girder surfaces in a saturated atmosphere throughout the curing time; 2.
Embed a thermocouple (linked with a thermometer accurate to plus or minus 5°F)
6 to 8 inches from the top or bottom of the girder on its centerline and near its midpoint; 3.
Monitor with a recording sensor (accurate to plus or minus 5°F) arranged and calibrated to continuously record, date, and identify concrete temperature throughout the heating cycle;

4.
Make this temperature record available for the Engineer to inspect; 5.
Heat concrete to no more than 100°F during the first 2 hours after placing the concrete, and then increase no more than 25°F per hour to a maximum of 175°F; 6.
Cool concrete, after curing is complete, no more than 25°F per hour, to 100°F; and 7.
Keep the temperature of the concrete above 60°F until the girder reaches release strength.
The Contractor may strip side forms from prestressed concrete girders once the concrete has reached a minimum compressive strength of 3,000 psi. All damage from stripping is the Contractor’s responsibility.
Curing of cast-in-place concrete closures for spliced prestressed concrete girders shall conform to Section 6-02.3(11). 6-02.3(25)E
Contractors Control Strength
Concrete strength shall be measured on test cylinders cast from the same concrete as that in the girder. These cylinders shall be cured under time-temperature relationships and conditions that simulate those of the girder. If the forms are heated by steam or hot air, test cylinders will remain in the coolest zone throughout curing. If forms are heated another way, the Contractor shall provide a record of the curing time-temperature relationship for the cylinders for each girder to the Engineer. When two or more girders are cast in a continuous line and in a continuous pour, a single set of test cylinders may represent all girders provided the Contractor demonstrates uniformity of casting and curing to the satisfaction of the Engineer.
The Contractor shall mold, cure, and test enough of these cylinders to satisfy Specification requirements for measuring concrete strength. The Contractor may use 4- by 8-inch or 6- by 12-inch cylinders.
Test cylinders may be cured in a moist room or water tank in accordance with FOP for
AASHTO R 100 after the girder concrete has obtained the required release strength. If, however, the Contractor intends to ship the girder prior to the standard 28-day strength test, the design strength for shipping shall be determined from cylinders placed with the girder and cured under the same conditions as the girder. These cylinders may be placed in an unninsulated, moisture-proof envelope.

Concrete Structures
To measure concrete strength in the girder, the Contractor shall randomly select two test cylinders. The average compressive strength of the two cylinders shall be equal or greater than the specified strength and neither cylinder shall have a compressive strength that is more than 5 percent below the specified strength.
If too few cylinders were molded to carry out all required tests on the girder, the
Contractor shall sample and test cores from the girder under the surveillance of the
Engineer. Cores sampled from one girder may not be used to represent any other girder, regardless of whether the girders were cast in a continuous line or pour. Cores shall avoid all prestressing strands, steel reinforcing bars and interior voids.
For prestressed concrete slab girders, a test shall consist of four cores measuring 3 inches in diameter by 6 inches in length (for slabs) or by the thickness of the web (for ribbed and double tee sections). Two cores shall be taken from each side of the girder with one on each side of the girder span midpoint, at locations accepted by the Engineer. The core locations for prestressed concrete ribbed and double tee sections shall be immediately beneath the top flange.
For prestressed concrete tub girders, a test shall consist of four cores measuring 3 inches in diameter by the thickness of the web. Two cores shall be taken from each web approximately 3 feet to the left and to the right of the center of the girder span.
For all other prestressed concrete girders, a test shall consist of three cores measuring
3 inches in diameter by the thickness of the web and shall be removed from just below the top flange; one at the midpoint of the girder’s length and the other two approximately
3 feet to the left and approximately 3 feet to the right.
The cores shall be taken in accordance with AASHTO T 24 and shall be tested in accordance with AASHTO T 22. The Engineer may accept the girder if the average compressive strength of the all test cores from the girder are at least 85 percent of the specified compressive strength with no one core less than 75 percent of specified compressive strength. If there are more than four cored holes in a girder, the prestressing reinforcement shall not be released until the holes are patched and the patch material has attained a minimum compressive strength equal to the required release compressive strength.
All cored holes shall be patched and cured prior to shipment of the girder. The girder shall not be shipped until tests show the patch material has attained a minimum compressive strength of 4,000 psi.
If the annual plant approval includes procedures for patching cored holes, the cored holes shall be patched in accordance with this procedure. Otherwise, the Contractor shall submit a core hole patching procedure as a Type 2 Working Drawing. 6-02.3(25)F

Prestress Release
Side and flange forms that restrain deflection shall be removed before release of the prestressing reinforcement.
All strands shall be released in a way that will minimize eccentricity of the prestressing force about the centerline of the girder. This release shall not occur until tests show each girder has reached the minimum compressive strength required by the Plans.
The Contractor may request permission to release the prestressing reinforcement at a minimum concrete compressive strength less than specified in the Plans. This request shall be submitted as a Type 2E Working Drawing analyzing changes in vertical deflection, girder lateral stability and concrete stresses in accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)L2. 6-02.3(25)G
Protection of Exposed Reinforcement
When a girder is removed from its casting bed, all prestressing reinforcement strands projecting from the girder shall be cleaned and painted with a minimum dry film thickness of 1 mil of paint conforming to Section 9-08.1(2)B, and all steel reinforcing bars, including
Page 6-122
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02 welded wire fabric, projecting from the girder shall be protected in accordance with
Section 6-02.3(24)B. During handling and shipping, projecting reinforcement shall be protected from bending or breaking. Just before placing concrete around the painted projecting bars or strands, the Contractor shall remove from them all spattered concrete remaining from girder casting, dirt, oil, and other foreign matter. 6-02.3(25)H
Finishing

The Contractor shall apply a Class 1 finish, as defined in Section 6-02.3(14), to: 1.
The exterior surfaces of the outside girders; and 2.
The bottoms, sides, and tops of the lower flanges on all girders, including the top of the bottom slab between the tub girder webs.
All other girder surfaces shall receive a Class 2 finish.
The interface on girders that contact a cast-in-place concrete deck shall have a finish of dense, screeded concrete without a smooth sheen or laitance on the surface. After vibrating and screeding, and just before the concrete reaches initial set, the Contractor shall texture the interface. This texture shall be applied with a steel brooming tool that etches the surface transversely leaving grooves ⅛ to ¼ inch wide, between ⅛ and ¼ inch deep, and spaced ¼ to ½ inch apart.
On prestressed concrete wide flange deck girders, deck bulb tee girders, ribbed section girders and double tee girders, the Contractor shall test the top surface for flatness and make corrections in accordance with Section 6-02.3(10)D3 except that the straightedge need not exceed the width of the girder top flange when checking the transverse direction. The top surface shall be finished in accordance with Section 6-02.3(10)D6.
The Contractor may repair defects in prestressed concrete girders in accordance with
Section 6-01.16. 6-02.3(25)I

Erection – After girder erection and cutting temporary top strands but prior to equalization, welding ties or placement of diaphragms.
Page 6-124
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02
Horizontal alignment of the top and bottom flanges shall be checked and recorded.
Alternatively, the Contractor may check and record the horizontal alignment of the web near mid-height of the girder. Each check shall be made by measuring the maximum offset at mid-span relative to a chord that starts and stops at the girder ends. The Contractor shall check and record the alignment at a time when the girder is not influenced by temporary differences in surface temperature. Records for the initial check (item 1 above) shall be included in the Contractor’s prestressed concrete certificate of compliance.
Records for all other checks shall be submitted as a Type 1 Working Drawing.
For each check (items 1 to 3 above), the alignment shall not be offset more than ⅛ inch for each 10 feet of girder length. Girders not meeting this tolerance for the shipment check (item 2 above) shall require an analysis of girder lateral stability and stresses in accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)L2. The Contractor shall perform this analysis and submit it as a
Type 2E Working Drawing prior to shipment of the girder. Girders that exceed an offset of ⅛ inch for each 10 feet of girder length for the erection check (item 3 above) shall be corrected at the job site to the ⅛ inch maximum offset per 10 feet of girder length before concrete is placed into the diaphragms. The Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working
Drawing for required corrective action, if any.
The maximum distance between the side of a prestressed concrete slab girder, or the edge of the top flange of a wide flange deck, wide flange thin deck or deck bulb tee girder, and a chord that extends the full length of the girder shall be ± ½ inch after erection (item 3 above).
For girders taller than 3 feet, the Contractor shall check and record the plumbness at the ends of each girder after temporary bracing for erection is in place and prior to erecting subsequent girders. 6-02.3(25)K

Vertical Deflection
The Contractor shall check and record the vertical deflection (camber) of each girder at the following times: 1.
Initial – Upon removal of the girder from the casting bed; 2.
Shipment – Within 14 days prior to shipment; 3.
Erection – After girder erection and cutting temporary top strands but prior to equalization, welding ties or placement of diaphragms.
At a minimum, survey data shall be taken at each girder end and at midspan. The
Contractor shall perform and record each check at a time when the alignment of the girder is not influenced by temporary differences in surface temperature. Records for the initial check (Item 1 above) shall be included in the Contractor’s Prestressed
Concrete Certificate of Compliance. Records for all other checks shall be submitted as a
Type 1 Working Drawing.
Girders with vertical deflections not meeting the limit shown in the Plans for the shipment check (item 2 above) shall require an analysis of girder lateral stability and stresses in accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)L2. The Contractor shall perform this analysis and submit it as a Type 2E Working Drawing prior to shipment.
The “D” dimensions shown in the Plans are computed upper and lower bounds of girder vertical deflections at midspan based on a time lapse of 40 and 120 days after release of the prestressing strands. Temporary top strands are assumed to be cut 30 days prior to these elapsed times (10 and 90 days after release of the prestressing strands). Diaphragms are assumed to be placed. The “D” dimensions are intended to advise the Contractor of the expected range of girder vertical deflection at the time of deck placement. A positive (+) “D” dimension indicates upward deflection.

If the girder vertical deflection measured for the erection check (item 3 above) is not between the lower “D” dimension bound shown in the Plans and the upper “D” dimension bound shown in the Plans plus ¾ inches, the Engineer may require corrective action. The
Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working Drawing for all required corrective actions. 6-02.3(25)L
Handling and Storage
The Contractor shall be responsible for safely lifting, shipping, and erecting prestressed concrete girders.
During handling and storage, each prestressed concrete girder shall always be kept plumb and upright. It shall be lifted only by the lifting embedments (strand lift loops or highstrength threaded steel bars) at either end.
The Contract documents may provide shipping and handling details for girders including lifting embedment locations (L), shipping support locations (L1 and L2), minimum shipping support rotational spring constants (Kθ), minimum shipping support center-tocenter wheel spacings (Wcc), vertical deflections and number of temporary top strands.
These shipping and handling details have been determined in accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)L2 and are suggested only.
The Contractor shall submit a Type 2E Working Drawing analyzing girder lateral stability and concrete stresses during lifting, storage, shipping and erection in accordance with
Section 6-02.3(25)L2 in the following cases: 1.

If any of the analysis assumptions listed in Section 6-02.3(25)L2 are invalid.
Determination of validity shall be made by the Contractor, except that analysis assumptions shall be considered invalid if the actual values are outside of the provided tolerances. 2.
If the Contractor intends to use shipping and handling configurations or details different than those in the Contract documents, or if the Contractor intends to handle the girder with temporary works or appurtenances attached to the girder. If the only deviation from the listed assumptions is to the location of the shipping support points such that stability is improved, the concrete stresses shall be analyzed, but the lateral stability may be waived. 3.
If the Contract documents do not provide shipping and handling details. 6-02.3(25)L1
Lifting and Handling Devices
For strand lift loops in girders with a maximum depth of 3 feet, only ½-inch diameter or 0.6-inch diameter strand conforming to Section 9-07.10 shall be used, and a minimum 2-inch diameter straight pin of a shackle shall be used through the loops. Multiple loops shall be held level in the girder during casting in a manner that allows each loop to carry its share of the load during lifting. The minimum distance from the end of the girder to the centroid of the strand lift loops shall be 3 feet. The loops for all prestressed concrete girders shall project a minimum of 1′-6″ from the top of the girder. Loops shall extend to within 3 inches clear of the bottom of the girder, terminating with a 9-inch long 90-degree hook. Loads on individual loops shall be limited to 12 kips, and the angle between a lifting cable and the top of the girder shall not be less than 60 degrees.
For high-strength threaded steel bars, a minimum of two 1⅜-inch diameter bars conforming to Section 9-07.11 shall be used at each end of the girder. The lifting hardware that connects to the bars shall be designed, detailed, and furnished by the
Contractor. The minimum distance from the end of the girder to the centroid of the lifting bars shall be 3 feet. Lifting bars shall extend to within 3 inches of the bottom of the girder and shall be anchored in the bottom flange with steel plates and nuts. The minimum size of embedded plates for lifting bars shall be ½ inch thick by 3 inches square. Lifting forces on the lifting bars shall not exceed 58 kips on an individual bar and shall be within
10 degrees of perpendicular to the top of the girder.

The analysis shall address all effects on girder vertical deflection (camber), “A” dimensions at centerline of bearings and deck screed cambers (C).
Suggested shipping and handling details provided in the Contract documents have been determined using the following analysis assumptions, unless shown otherwise: 1.
Girder dimensions, strand locations and lifting embedment locations are within the tolerances specified in Section 6-02.3(25)I. 2.
Girder horizontal alignment (sweep) is within the tolerance specified in
Section 6-02.3(25)J. 3.
Girder vertical deflection (camber) at midspan is less than or equal to the maximum midspan vertical deflection at shipping shown in the Plans. 4.
Minimum concrete compressive strength at release (f’ci) has been reached before initial lifting from casting bed. Minimum concrete compressive strength at 28 days (f’c) has been reached before shipping.

5.
Lifting lines are plumb. 6.
Height of girder bottom above roadway at shipping supports is less than or equal to
72 inches. 7.
Height of shipping support roll center above roadway is 24 inches, ± 2 inches. 8.
Shipping support longitudinal placement (L1 and L2) tolerance is ± 6 inches. 9.
Shipping support lateral placement tolerance is ±1 inches. 10. Shipping supports provide the minimum shipping support rotational spring constant (Kθ) and minimum shipping support center-to-center wheel spacings (Wcc) shown in the Plans. 11. For shipping at highway speeds a ±20 percent dynamic load allowance (impact) is included with a typical roadway superelevation of 2 percent. 12. For turning at slow speeds, no dynamic load allowance (impact) is included with a maximum roadway superelevation of 6 percent. 13. Wind, centrifugal and seismic forces are not considered. 14. Configurations where a girder is hanging from a lifting line at one end and seated without a lifting line connected at the other end are not considered. 15. Temporary works or appurtenances are not attached to the girder. 6-02.3(25)L3
Girder Storage
If girders are to be stored, the Contractor shall place them on a stable foundation that will keep them in a vertical position. Stored girders shall be supported at the bearing recesses or, if there are no recesses, approximately 2 to 3 feet from the girder ends. After posttensioning, spliced prestressed concrete girders shall be supported at points between
2 and 5 feet from the girder ends, unless otherwise shown in the Plans. For long-term storage of girders with initial horizontal curvature, the Contractor may wedge one side of the bottom flange, tilting the girders to control curvature. If the Contractor elects to set girders out of plumb during storage, the Contractor shall have the proposed method analyzed by the Contractor’s engineer to ensure against damaging the girder. 6-02.3(25)L4

Girder Shipping
After the girder has reached its 28-day design strength, the girder and a completed
Certification of Compliance, signed by a Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute Certified
Technician or a Professional Engineer, shall be submitted to the Engineer for inspection.
If the Engineer finds the certification and the girder to be acceptable, the Engineer will stamp the girder “Approved for Shipment”.

2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02
No prestressed concrete slab girder shall be shipped for at least 3 days after concrete placement. No prestressed concrete wide flange deck, deck bulb tee or tub girder shall be shipped for at least 7 days after concrete placement, except that they may be shipped
3 days after concrete placement when L/(bd) is less than or equal to 5.0, where L equals the shipping length of the girder, b equals the girder top flange width (for prestressed concrete wide flange deck and deck bulb tee girders) or the bottom flange width (for prestressed concrete tub girders), and d equals the girder depth, all in feet. No other girder shall be shipped for at least 10 days after concrete placement.
Girder support locations during shipping shall be no closer than the girder depth to the ends of the girder at the girder centerline.
If the Contractor elects to assemble spliced prestressed concrete girders into shipping configurations not shown in the Contract documents, the Contractor shall submit a Type 2E Working Drawing analyzing girder lateral stability and concrete stresses in accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)L2 before shipping. 6-02.3(25)L5

Girder Erection
Before erecting prestressed concrete girders, the Contractor shall submit an erection plan as a Type 2E Working Drawing. The erection plan shall provide complete details of the erection process including at a minimum: 1.
Temporary falsework support, bracing, guys, gravity anchors, and attachments to other Structure components or objects; 2.
Procedure and sequence of operation; 3.
Girder stresses during progressive stages of erection in accordance with
Section 6-02.3(25)L2; 4.
Girder weights, lift points, lifting embedments and devices, spreaders, and angle of lifting cables in accordance with Section 6-02.3(25)L, etc.; 5.

8.
Plans and calculations for all temporary support and bracing systems to resist all anticipated construction loads through construction of the bridge deck. 9.
Methods for measuring and adjusting plumbness at girder ends.
The erection plan shall include drawings, notes, catalog cuts, and calculations clearly showing the above listed details, assumptions, and dimensions. Material properties and specifications, structural analysis, and all other data used shall also be included.
The concrete in piers and crossbeams shall reach at least 80 percent of design strength before girders are placed on them.
The Contractor shall hoist girders only by the lifting embedments at the ends, always keeping the girders plumb and upright. When the girders are to receive a cast-in-place concrete deck, lifting embedments shall be removed after erection to provide a minimum 2½-inch clearance to the top of the deck. When the girders are not to receive a cast-inplace concrete deck, lifting embedments shall be removed 1-inch below the girder surface and grouted with an epoxy grout conforming to Section 9-26.3(1)A.
The girders shall be braced in accordance with Sections 6-02.3(17)F4 and 6-02.3(17)F5.
When temporary strands in the top flange are used, they shall be cut after the girders are braced and before the girder deflections are equalized and the intermediate diaphragms are cast.

Assembling and Bolting
To begin bolting any field connection or splice, the Contractor shall install and tighten to snug tight enough bolts to bring all parts into full contact with each other prior to tightening these bolts to the specified minimum tension. “Snug tight” means either the tightness reached by (l) a few blows from an impact wrench or (2) the full effort of a person using a spud wrench.
As erection proceeds, all field connections and splices for each member shall be securely drift pinned and bolted in accordance with 1 or 2 below before the weight of the member can be released or the next member is added. Field erection drawings shall specify pinning and bolting requirements that meet or exceed the following minimums: 1.
Joints in Normal Structures – Fifty percent of the holes in a single field connection and 50 percent of the holes on each side of a single joint in a splice plate shall be filled with drift pins and bolts. Thirty percent of the filled holes shall be pinned.
Seventy percent of the filled holes shall be bolted and tightened to snug tight. Once all these bolts are snug tight, each bolt shall be systematically tightened to the specified minimum tension. “Systematically tightened” means beginning with bolts in the most rigid part, which is usually the center of the joint, and working out to its free edges. The fully tensioned bolts shall be located near the middle of a single field connection or a single splice plate. 2.
Joints in Cantilevered Structures – Seventy-five percent of the holes in a single field connection and 75 percent of the holes on each side of a single joint in a splice plate shall be filled with drift pins and bolts. Fifty percent of the filled holes shall be pinned.
Fifty percent of the filled holes shall be bolted and tightened to snug tight. Once all these bolts are snug tight, each bolt shall be systematically tightened to the specified minimum tension. The fully tensioned bolts shall be located near the middle of a single field connection or a single splice plate.

Cylindrical erection pins (drift pins) shall be placed throughout each field connection and each field joint with the greatest concentration in the outer edges of a splice plate or member being bolted. Drift pins shall be double-tapered barrel pins of hardened steel. The diameter of the drift pins shall be at least 1/32 inch larger than the diameter of the bolts in the connection or the full hole diameter.
To complete a joint following one of the methods listed above, the Contractor shall fill all remaining holes of the field connection or splice plate with bolts and tighten to snug tight. Once all of these bolts are snug tight, each bolt shall be systematically tightened to the specified minimum tension. After these bolts are tightened to the specified minimum tension, the Contractor shall replace the drift pins with bolts tightened to the specified minimum tension.
The Contractor shall complete the joint or connection within ten calendar days of installing the first bolt or within a duration approved by the Engineer. Any bolts inserted in an incomplete connection, either loose or tightened snug-tight, which exceed the specified duration for completing the connection, shall be subject to the following requirements: 1.
Three assemblies for each size and length shall be removed from connection(s) that are to be tensioned. Rotational capacity tests shall be performed on the removed assemblies to demonstrate the assembly has sufficient lubricant to be tensioned satisfactorily. 2.
Five assemblies shall be removed from the connection to establish the inspection torque. 3.
In the case of tension controlled bolts, three assemblies shall be removed and tested in accordance with Section 6-03.3(33)A to verify the minimum specified tension can be achieved prior to shearing of the spline.
Page 6-150
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Steel Structures 6-03
Assemblies removed for the purpose of rotational capacity testing, determination of the inspection torques, or verification of tension controlled bolt performance shall be replaced with new bolts at no additional expense to the Contracting Agency. To minimize the number of removed assemblies, the Contractor may combine rotational capacity testing and inspection torque determination as approved by the Engineer.
The Contractor may complete a field bolted connection or splice in a continuous operation before releasing the mass of the member or adding the next member. The
Contractor shall utilize drift pins to align the connection. The alignment drift pins shall fill between 15 and 30 percent of the holes in a single field connection and between 15 and
30 percent of the holes on each side of a single joint in a splice plate. Once the alignment drift pins are in place, all remaining holes shall be filled with bolts and tightened to snug tight starting from near the middle and proceeding toward the outer gage lines. Once all of these bolts are snug tight, the Contractor shall systematically tighten all these bolts to the specified minimum tension. The Contractor shall then replace the drift pins with bolts.
Each of these bolts shall be tightened to the specified minimum tension.
All bolts shall be placed with heads toward the outside and underside of the bridge. All high-strength bolts shall be installed and tightened before the falsework is removed.
The Contractor may erect metal railings as erection proceeds. But railings shall not be bolted or adjusted permanently until the falsework is released and the deck placed.
The Contractor shall not begin painting until the Engineer has inspected and accepted field bolting. 6-03.3(33)

Prior to final tightening of any bolts in a bolted connection, the connection shall be compacted to a snug tight condition. Snug tight shall include bringing all plies of the connection into firm contact and snug tightening all bolts in accordance with
Section 6-03.3(32).
Final tightening may be done by the Turn-of-Nut Method, the direct-tension indicator method, or the twist off-type tension control structural bolt/nut/washer assembly method. Preferably, the nut shall be turned tight while the bolt is prevented from rotating.
However, if required by either turn-of-nut or direct-tension-indicator methods because of bolt entering and/or wrench operational clearances, tightening may be done by turning the bolt while the nut is prevented from rotating. 1.
Turn-of-Nut Method – After all specified bolting conditions are satisfied, and before final tightening, the Contractor shall match-mark with crayon or paint the outer face of each nut and the protruding part of the bolt. Each bolt shall be final tightened to the specified minimum tension by rotating the amount specified in Table 2. To ensure this tightening method is followed, the Engineer will (1) observe as the Contractor installs, snug tightens, and final tightens all bolts and (2) inspect each match-mark.

When bolt length exceeds 12D, the rotation shall be determined by actual tests in which a suitable tension device simulates actual conditions. 2.

Direct Tension Indicator Method (DTIs). DTIs shall be placed under the bolt head with the protrusions facing the bolt head when the nut is turned. DTIs shall be placed under the nut with the protrusions facing the nut when the bolt is turned. DTIs may be placed under the turned element only if a hardened washer is used to separate the turned element from the DTI.
Gap refusal shall be measured with a 0.005 inch tapered feeler gage. After all specified bolting conditions are satisfied, the snug tightened gaps shall meet Table 3 snug tight limits.
Each bolt shall be final-tightened to meet Table 3 final-tighten limits. If the bolt is tensioned so that no visible gap in any space remains, the bolt and DTI shall be removed and replaced by a new properly tensioned bolt and DTI.
The Contractor shall tension all bolts, inspecting all DTIs with a feeler gage, in the presence of the Engineer. DTIs shall be installed by two-person (or more) crews, with one individual (1) preventing the element at the DTI from turning and (2) measuring the gap of the DTI to determine the proper tension of the bolt.
If a bolt, that has had its DTI brought to full load, loosens during the course of bolting the connection, it shall be rejected. Reuse of the bolt and nut are subject to the provisions of this section. The used DTI shall not be reinstalled.

Twist Off-Type Tension Control Structural Bolt/Nut/Washer Assembly Method (Tension Control Bolt Assembly) – Tension control bolt assemblies shall include the bolt, nut, and washer(s) packaged and shipped as a single assembly. Unless otherwise accepted by the Engineer, tension control bolt assembly components shall not be interchanged for testing or installation and shall comply with all provisions of ASTM
F3125 Grade F1852. If accepted by the Engineer, the tension control bolt assembly components may be interchanged within the same component lot for girder web splices or other locations where access to both sides of the connection is restricted.
The tension control bolts shall incorporate a design feature intended to either indirectly indicate, or to automatically provide, the minimum tension specified in
Table 1.
The Contractor shall submit Type 1 Working Drawings of the tension control bolt assembly, including bolt capacities; type of bolt, nut, and washer lubricant; method of packaging and protection of the lubricated bolt; installation equipment; calibration equipment; and installation procedures.
The tension control bolt manufacturer’s installation procedure shall be followed for installation of bolts in the verification testing device, in all calibration devices, and in all structure connections.
In some cases, proper tensioning of the bolts may require more than one cycle of systematic partial tightening prior to final yield or fracture of the tension control element of each bolt. If yield or fracture of the tension control element of a bolt occurs prior to the final tightening cycle, that bolt shall be replaced with a new one.
Additional field verification testing shall be performed as requested by the Engineer.
All bolts and connecting hardware shall be stored and handled in a manner to prevent corrosion and loss of lubricant. Bolts that are installed without the same lubricant coating as tested under the verification test will be rejected, and they shall be removed from the joint and be replaced with new lubricated bolts at no additional cost to the Contracting Agency.

ASTM F3125 Grade A490 bolts, galvanized ASTM F3125 Grade A325 bolts, and ASTM
F3125 Grade F1852 tension control bolt assemblies shall not be reused. Black ASTM
F3125 Grade A325 bolts may be reused once if accepted by the Engineer. All bolts to be reused shall have their threads inspected for distortion by reinstalling the used nut on the

2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Steel Structures 6-03 bolt and turning the nut for the full length of the bolt threads by hand. Bolts to be reused shall be relubricated in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation. Used bolts shall be subject to a rotational capacity test as specified in Section 6-03.3(33)A PreErection Testing. Touching up or retightening bolts previously tightened by the Turn-ofNut Method, which may have been loosened by the tightening of adjacent bolts shall not be considered as reuse, provided the snugging up continues from the initial position and does not require greater rotation, including the tolerance, than that required by Table 2. 6-03.3(33)A
Pre-Erection Testing
High-strength bolt assemblies (bolt, nut, direct tension indicator, and washer), both black and galvanized, shall be subjected to a field rotational capacity test, as outlined below, prior to any permanent fastener installation. For field installations, the rotational capacity test shall be conducted at the jobsite. Each combination of bolt production lot, nut production lot, washer production lot, and direct tension indicator production lot shall be tested as an assembly, except tension control bolt assemblies, which shall be tested as supplied by the manufacturer. Each rotational capacity test shall include three assemblies. Once an assembly passes the rotational capacity test, it is accepted for use for the remainder of the project unless the Engineer deems further testing is necessary. All tests shall be performed in a bolt tension calibrator by the Contractor in the presence of the Engineer. High-strength bolt assemblies used in this test shall not be reused. The bolt assemblies shall meet the following requirements after being pretensioned to 15 percent of the minimum bolt tension in Table 1. The assembly shall be considered as nonconforming if the assembly fails to pass any one of the following specified requirements: 1.
The measured torque to produce the minimum bolt tension shall not exceed the maximum allowed torque value obtained by the following equation:
Torque = 0.25 PD
Where:
Torque = Calculated Torque (foot-pounds)
P		 =

The maximum recorded tension after the two turns shall be equal to or greater than 1.15 times the minimum bolt tension listed in Table 1. b.
Each assembly shall be successfully installed to the specified number of turns. c.
The fastener components in the assembly shall not exhibit shear failure or stripping of the threads as determined by visual examination of bolt and nut threads following removal. d.
The bolts in the assembly shall not exhibit torsional or torsional/tension failure.
If any specimen fails, the assembly will be rejected. Elongation of the bolt between the bolt head and the nut is not considered to be a failure.
Bolts that are too short to test in the bolt tension calibrator shall be tested in a steel joint. The Contractor shall (1) install the high-strength bolt assemblies (bolt, nut, direct tension indicator, and washer) in a steel joint of the proper thickness; (2) tighten to the snug tight condition; (3) match-mark the outer face of each nut and the protruding part of the bolt with crayon or paint; (4) rotate to the requirements of Table 2; and (5) record the torque that is required to achieve the required amount of rotation. The assembly shall be considered as nonconforming if the assembly fails to pass any one of the following specified requirements:

Three DTIs, per lot, shall be tested in a bolt tension calibrator. The bolts shall be tensioned to 105 percent of the tension shown in Table 1. If all of the DTI protrusions are completely crushed (all five openings with zero gap), this lot of DTIs is rejected.
Three twist off-type tension controlled bolt assemblies, per assembly lot, shall be tested in a bolt tension calibrator. The bolts shall first be tensioned to a snug tight condition.
Tensioning shall then be completed by tightening the assembly nut in a continuous operation using a spline drive installation tool until the spline shears from the bolt. The bolt assembly tension shall meet the requirements of Table 1. If any specimen fails, the assembly lot is rejected. 6-03.3(33)B
Bolting Inspection
The Contractor, in the presence of the Engineer, shall inspect the tightened bolt using a calibrated inspection torque wrench, regardless of bolting method. The Contractor shall supply the inspection torque wrench. Inspection shall be performed within seven calendar days from the completion of each bolted connection or as specified by the Engineer.
If the bolts to be installed are not long enough to fit in the bolt tension calibrator, five bolts of the same grade, size, and condition as those under inspection shall be tested using Direct-Tension-Indicators (DTIs) to measure bolt tension. This tension measurement test shall be done at least once each inspection day. The Contractor shall supply the necessary DTIs. The DTI shall be placed under the bolt head. A washer shall be placed under the nut, which shall be the element turned during the performance of this tension measurement test. Each bolt shall be tightened by any convenient means to the specified minimum tension as indicated by the DTI. The inspecting wrench shall then be applied to the tightened bolt to determine the torque required to turn the nut 5 degrees (approximately 1 inch at a 12-inch radius) in the tightening direction. The job inspection torque shall be taken as the average of three values thus determined after rejecting the high and low values.
Five representative bolts/nuts/washers and DTIs if used (provided by the Contractor) of the same grade, size, and condition as those under inspection shall be placed individually in a bolt tension calibrator to measure bolt tension. This calibration operation shall be
Page 6-156

2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Steel Structures 6-03 done at least once each inspection day. There shall be a washer under the part turned in tightening each bolt if washers are used on the Structure. In the bolt tension calibrator, each bolt shall be tightened by any convenient means to the specified tension. The inspection torque wrench shall then be applied to the tightened bolt to determine the torque required to turn the nut or head 5 degrees (approximately 1 inch at a 12-inch radius) in the tightening direction. The job-inspection torque shall be taken as the average of three values thus determined after rejecting the high and low values.
Ten percent (at least two), or as specified by the Engineer, of the tightened bolts on the
Structure represented by the test bolts shall be selected at random in each connection.
The job-inspection torque shall then be applied to each with the inspecting wrench turned in the tightening direction, with no restraint applied to the opposite end of the bolt. If this torque turns no bolt head or nut, the Contracting Agency will accept the connection as being properly tightened. If the torque turns one or more bolt heads or nuts, the jobinspection torque shall then be applied to all bolts in the connection. Except for tension control bolt assemblies and DTIs with zero gap at all protrusion spaces, any bolt whose head or nut turns at this stage shall be tightened and reinspected. Any tension control bolt assemblies or DTIs that have zero gap at all protrusion spaces shall be replaced if the head or nut turns at this stage.
The Contractor shall submit Type 1 Working Drawings consisting of the manufacturer’s detailed procedure for routine observation to ensure proper use of the tension control bolt assemblies. 6-03.3(34)
Adjusting Pin Nuts
All pin nuts shall be tightened thoroughly. The pins shall be placed so that members bear fully and evenly on the nuts. The pins shall have enough thread to allow burring after the nuts are tightened. 6-03.3(35)
Setting Anchor Bolts
Anchor bolts shall be set in masonry as required in Section 6-02.3(18). Anchor bolts shall be grouted in after the shoes, masonry plates, and keeper plates have been set and the span or series of continuous spans are completely erected and adjusted to line and camber. 6-03.3(36)
Setting and Grouting Masonry Plates

The following procedure applies to masonry plates for all steel spans, including shoes, keeper plates, and turning racks on movable bridges.
To set masonry plates, the Contractor shall: 1.
Set masonry plates on the anchor bolts; 2.
Place steel shims under the masonry plates to position pin centers or bearings to line and grade and in relationship to each other. Steel shims shall be the size and be placed at the locations shown in the Plans; 3.
Level the bases of all masonry plates; 4.
Draw anchor bolt nuts down tight; 5.
Recheck pin centers or bearings for alignment; and 6.
Leave at least ¾ inch of space under each masonry plate for grout.
After the masonry plates have been set and the span or series of continuous spans are completely erected and swung free, the space between the top of the masonry and the top of the concrete bearing seat shall be filled with grout. Main masonry plates for cantilever spans shall be set and grouted in before any steel Work is erected.
Grout shall conform to Section 9-20.3(2) and placement shall be as required in
Section 6-02.3(20).

Swinging the Span
Forms weighing less than 5 pounds per square foot of bridge deck area and uniformly distributed along the steel spans may be placed before the spans swing free on their supports. Steel reinforcing bars or concrete bridge deck shall not be placed on steel spans until the spans swing free on their supports and elevations are recorded. No simple span or any series of continuous spans will be considered as swinging free until all temporary supports have been released. Reinforcing steel or concrete bridge decks shall not be placed on any simple or continuous span steel girder bridge until all its spans are adjusted and its masonry plates, shoes, and keeper plates grouted. For this specification, the structure shall be considered as continuous across hinged joints.
After the falsework is released (spans swung free), the masonry plates, shoes, and keeper plates are grouted, and before any load is applied, the Contractor (or the Engineer if the
Contracting Agency is responsible for surveying) shall survey elevations at the tenth points along the centerline on top of all girders and floorbeams. The Contractor shall calculate the theoretical top of girder or floorbeam flange elevations and compare the calculated elevations to the surveyed elevations. The theoretical pad or haunch depth shown in the Plans shall be increased or decreased by the difference between the theoretical and surveyed top of girder or floorbeam elevations. The soffit (deck formwork) shall be set based on the Plan bridge deck thickness and the adjusted pad or haunch depth.

Construction Requirements
Piling Terms
Concrete Piles – Concrete piling may be precast or precast-prestressed concrete, or steel casings driven to the ultimate bearing resistance called for in the Contract which are filled with concrete (cast-in-place) after driving.
Steel Piles – Steel piles may be open-ended or closed-ended pipe piles, or H-piles.
Overdriving – Over-driving of piles occurs when the ultimate bearing resistance calculated from the equation in Section 6-05.3(12), or the wave equation driving criteria if applicable, exceeds the ultimate bearing resistance required in the Contract in order to reach the minimum tip elevation specified in the Contract, or as required by the Engineer.
Maximum Driving Resistance – The maximum driving resistance is either the pile ultimate bearing resistance, or ultimate bearing resistance plus overdriving to reach minimum tip elevation as specified in the Contract, whichever is greater.
Wave Equation Analysis – Wave equation analysis is an analysis performed using the wave equation analysis program (WEAP) with a version dated 1987 or later. The wave equation may be used as specified herein to verify the Contractor’s proposed pile driving system. The pile driving system includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the pile, the hammer, the helmet, and cushions. The wave equation may also be used by the Engineer to determine pile driving criteria as may be required in the Contract.
Ultimate Bearing Resistance – Ultimate bearing resistance refers to the vertical load carrying resistance (in units of force) of a pile as determined by the equation in Section 6-05.3(12), the wave equation analysis, pile driving analyzer and CAPWAP, static load test, or any other means as may be required by the Contract, or the Engineer.
Allowable Bearing Resistance – Allowable bearing resistance is the ultimate bearing resistance divided by a factor of safety. The Contract may state the factor of safety to be used in calculating the allowable bearing resistance from the ultimate bearing resistance.
In the absence of a specified factor of safety, a value of three shall be used.

Piling
Rated Hammer Energy – The rated energy represents the theoretical maximum amount of gross energy that a pile driving hammer can generate. The rated energy of a pile driving hammer will be stated in the hammer manufacturer’s catalog or Specifications for that pile driving hammer.
Developed Hammer Energy – The developed hammer energy is the actual amount of gross energy produced by the hammer for a given blow. This value will never exceed the rated hammer energy. The developed energy may be calculated as the ram weight times the drop (or stroke) for drop, single acting hydraulic, single acting air/steam, and open-ended diesel hammers. For double acting hydraulic and air/steam hammers, the developed hammer energy shall be calculated from ram impact velocity measurements or other means approved by the Engineer. For closed-ended diesel hammers, the developed energy shall be calculated from the measured bounce chamber pressure for a given blow. Hammer manufacturer calibration data may be used to correlate bounce chamber pressure to developed hammer energy. For a single acting diesel hammer the developed energy is determined using the blows per minute.
Transferred Hammer Energy – The transferred hammer energy is the amount of energy transferred to the pile for a given blow. This value will never exceed the developed hammer energy. Factors that cause transferred hammer energy to be lower than the developed hammer energy include friction during the ram down stroke, energy retained in the ram and helmet during rebound, and other impact losses. The transferred energy can only be measured directly by use of sensors attached to the pile. A pile driving analyzer (PDA) may be used to measure transferred energy.
Pile Driving Analyzer – A pile driving analyzer (PDA) is a device that can measure the transferred energy of a pile driving system, the compressive and tensile stresses induced in the pile due to driving, the bending stresses induced by hammer misalignment with the pile, and estimate the ultimate resistance of a pile at a given blow.
Pile Driving System – The pile driving system includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the hammer, leads, helmet or cap, cushion and pile.
Helmet – The helmet, also termed the cap, drive cap, or driving head, is used to transmit impact forces from the hammer ram to the pile top as uniformly as possible across the pile top such that the impact force of the ram is transmitted axially to the pile. The term helmet can refer to the complete impact force transfer system, which includes the anvil or striker plate, hammer cushion and cushion block, and a pile cushion if used, or just the single piece unit into which these other components fit. The helmet does not include a follower, if one is used. For hydraulic hammers, the helmet is sometimes referred to as the anvil.
Hammer Cushion – The hammer cushion is a disk of material placed on top of the helmet but below the anvil or striker plate to relieve impact shock, thus protecting the hammer and the pile.
Pile Cushion – The pile cushion is a disk of material placed between the helmet and the pile top to relieve impact shock, primarily to protect the pile.
Follower – A follower is a structural member placed between the hammer assembly, which includes the helmet, and the pile top when the pile head is below the reach of the hammer.
Pile Driving Refusal – Pile driving refusal is defined as 15 blows per inch for the last
4 inches of driving. This is the maximum blow count allowed during overdriving.
Minimum Tip Elevation – The minimum tip elevation is the elevation to which the pile tip shall be driven. Driving deeper in order to obtain the required ultimate bearing resistance may be required.

2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Piling 6-05.3(2) 6-05
Ordering Piling
The Contractor shall order all piling (except cast-in-place concrete and steel piles) from an itemized list the Engineer will provide. This list, showing the number and lengths of piles required, will be based on test-pile driving (or other) data. The list will show lengths below the cutoff point. The Contractor shall supply (and bear the cost of supplying) all additional lengths required for handling or driving.
The Contractor shall assume all responsibility for buying more or longer piles than those shown on the list provided by the Engineer. All piles purchased on the basis of the
Engineer’s list but not used in the finished Structure shall become the property of the
Contracting Agency. The Contractor shall deliver these as the Engineer directs. The pile cutoffs that are 8 feet or under and longer ones the Contracting Agency does not require shall become the property of the Contractor.
When ordering steel casings for cast-in-place concrete and steel piling, the Contractor shall base lengths on information derived from driving test piles and from subsurface data.
The Contractor shall also select the wall thickness of steel piles or steel casings for castin-place piles which will be necessary to prevent damage during driving and handling. The selection of wall thickness for steel piles or steel casings shall also consider the effects of lateral pressures from the soil or due to driving of adjacent piles. Steel piles and steel casings must be strong and rigid enough to resist these pressures without deforming or distorting. The Contractor shall select the wall thickness based on information derived from test piles, subsurface data and/or wave equation analysis.
Wave equation analysis is required prior to ordering piling for piles with specified ultimate bearing resistances of 300 tons or greater. If a wave equation analysis is performed, the
Contractor shall base the selection of wall thickness on the maximum driving resistance identified in the Contract to reach the minimum tip elevation, if the maximum driving resistance is greater than the specified ultimate bearing resistance and if a minimum tip elevation is specified. The wave equation analysis shall be submitted by the Contractor as required in Section 6-05.3(9)A. The Engineer will not supply any list for piling of these types. 6-05.3(3)

Manufacture of Precast Concrete Piling
Precast concrete piles shall consist of concrete sections reinforced to withstand handling and driving stresses. These may be reinforced with deformed steel bars or prestressed with steel strands. The Plans show dimensions and details. If the Plans require piles with square cross-sections, the corners shall be chamfered 1 inch.
Precast or prestressed piles shall meet the requirements of the Standard Plans.
Temporary stress in the prestressing reinforcement of prestressed piles (before loss from creep and shrinkage) shall be 75 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength. (For short periods during manufacture, the reinforcement may be overstressed to 80 percent of ultimate tensile strength if stress after transfer to concrete does not exceed 75 percent of that strength.)
Prestressed concrete piles shall have a final (effective) prestress of at least 1,000 psi.
Unless the Engineer approves splices, all piles shall be full length.
The Contracting Agency intends to perform Quality Assurance Inspection. By its inspection, the Contracting Agency intends only to facilitate the Work and verify the quality of that Work. This inspection shall not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility for identifying and replacing defective material and Work.

Pile Tips and Shoes
The Contracting Agency prefers that timber piles be driven with squared ends. But if conditions require, they may be shod with metal shoes. Pile tips and shoes shall be securely attached to the piles in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
Where called for in the Contract, conical steel pile tips shall be used when driving steel casings. The tips shall be inside fit, flush-mounted such that the tip and/or weld bead does not protrude more than 1⁄16 inch beyond the nominal outside diameter of the steel casing.
If conical tips are not specified, the lower end of each casing shall have a steel driving plate that is thick enough to keep the casing watertight and free from distortion as it is driven. The diameter of the steel driving plate shall not be greater than the outside diameter of the steel casing.
Where called for in the Contract, inside-fit cutting shoes shall be used when driving openended steel piles. The cutting shoes shall be flush-mounted such that the shoe and/or weld bead does not protrude more than 1⁄16 inch beyond the nominal outside diameter of the steel pile. The cutting shoe shall be of an inside diameter at least ¾ inch less than the nominal inside diameter of the steel pile.
Pile tips or shoes shall be of a type denoted in the Qualified Products List. If pile tips or shoes other than those denoted in the Qualified Products List are proposed, the
Contractor shall submit Type 2 Working Drawings consisting of shop drawings of the proposed pile tip along with design calculations, Specifications, material chemistry and installation requirements, along with evidence of a pile driving test demonstrating suitability of the proposed pile tip. The test shall be performed in the presence of the
Engineer or an acceptable independent testing agency. The test shall consist of driving a pile fitted with the proposed tip. If the pile cannot be visually inspected (Section 6-05.3(11)F), a sacrificial pile fitted with the proposed tip shall be driven outside the proposed foundation limits. The pile shall be driven to a depth sufficient to develop the required ultimate bearing resistance as called for in the Contract, in ground conditions determined to be equivalent to the ground conditions at the project site. For closedended casings or piles, the pile need not be removed if, in the opinion of the Engineer, the pile can be inspected for evidence of damage to the pile or the tip. For open-ended steel casings or piles, timber piles or H-piles, the pile shall be removed for inspection.

Pile Driving Equipment 6-05.3(9)A
Pile Driving Equipment Approval
Prior to driving piles, the Contractor shall submit Type 2 Working Drawings consisting of details of each proposed pile driving system. The pile driving system shall meet the minimum requirements for the various combinations of hammer type and pile type specified in this section. These requirements are minimums and may need to be increased in order to ensure that the required ultimate bearing resistance can be achieved, that minimum tip elevations can be reached, and to prevent pile damage.
The Contractor shall submit Type 2E Working Drawings consisting of a wave equation analysis for all pile driving systems used to drive piling with required maximum driving resistances of greater than 300 tons. The wave equation analysis shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of this section and the user’s manual for the program.
The wave equation analysis shall verify that the pile driving system proposed does not produce stresses greater than 50,000 psi or 90 percent of the yield stress whichever is less, for steel piles, or steel casings for cast-in-place concrete piles. For prestressed concrete piles, the allowable driving stress in kips shall be plus prestress in tension, and 0.85f’c minus prestress in compression, where f’c is the concrete compressive strength in kips per square inch. For precast concrete piles that are not prestressed, the allowable driving stress shall be 70 percent of the yield stress of the steel reinforcement in tension, and 0. 85f’c in compression. The wave equation shall also verify that the pile driving system does not exceed the refusal criteria at the depth of penetration anticipated for achieving the required ultimate bearing resistance and minimum tip elevation.
Furthermore, the wave equation analysis shall verify that at the maximum driving resistance specified in the Contract, the driving resistance is 100 blows per foot or less.
Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, or directed by the Engineer, the following default values shall be used as input to the wave equation analysis program:
Output option (IOUT)
Factor of safety applied to (Rult)
Type of damping
Residual stress option

0 1.0
Smith
No
Rult is the resistance of the pile used in the wave equation analyses. If the ultimate bearing resistance equals the maximum driving resistance, a setup factor of 1.3 may be used in the wave equation analysis to account for pile setup. To use a setup factor in the wave equation analysis, Rult in the analysis is the ultimate bearing resistance divided by 1.3. If the maximum driving resistance exceeds the ultimate bearing resistance, no setup factor should be used, and Rult is equal to the maximum driving resistance of the pile.

For each drop hammer used, the Contractor shall weigh it in the Engineer’s presence or submit a Type 1 Working Drawing consisting of a certificate of its weight. The exact weight shall be stamped on the hammer. Drop hammers shall weigh not less than: 1. 3,000 pounds for piles under 50 feet long that have an ultimate bearing resistance of not more than 60 tons, and 2. 4,000 pounds for piles 50 feet and longer or that have an ultimate bearing resistance of 60 to 90 tons.
If a drop hammer is used for timber piles, it is preferable to use a heavy hammer and operate with a short drop.
For each diesel, hydraulic, steam, or air-driven hammer used, the Contractor shall submit a Type 1 Working Drawing consisting of the manufacturer’s Specifications and catalog.
These shall show all data needed to calculate the developed energy of the hammer used.
Underwater hammers may be used only with permission of the Engineer.
Drop hammers on timber piles shall have a maximum drop of 10 feet. Drop hammers shall not be used to drive timber piles that have ultimate bearing resistance of more than
60 tons.
When used on timber piles, diesel, hydraulic, steam, or air-driven hammers shall provide at least 13,000 foot-pounds of developed energy per blow. The ram of diesel hammers shall weigh at least 2,700 pounds.
Precast concrete and precast-prestressed concrete piles shall be driven with a singleacting steam, air, hydraulic, or diesel hammer with a ram weight of at least half as much as the weight of the pile, but never less than the minimums stated below. The ratio of developed hammer energy to ram weight shall not exceed 6.

These requirements for minimum hammer size may be waived if a Type 2E Working
Drawing is submitted consisting of a wave equation analysis demonstrating the ability of the hammer to obtain the required bearing resistance and minimum tip elevation without damage to the pile.
Vibratory hammers may be used to drive piles provided the location and plumbness requirements of this section are met. The required bearing resistance for all piles driven with vibratory hammers will be determined according to Section 6-05.3(12) by driving the pile at least an additional 2 feet using an impact hammer. This method of determining bearing resistance will be accepted provided the blows per inch are either constant or increasing. If the pile cannot be driven 2 feet, the pile will be considered acceptable for bearing if the pile is driven to refusal.
If water jets are used, the number of jets and water volume and pressure shall be enough to erode the material next to the pile at the tip. The equipment shall include a minimum of two water-jet pipes and two ¾ inch jet nozzles. The pump shall produce a constant pressure of at least 100 psi at each nozzle. 6-05.3(9)C
Pile Driving Leads
All piles shall be driven with fixed-lead drivers. The leads shall be fixed on the top and bottom during the pile driving operation. Leads shall be long enough to eliminate the need for followers (except for timber piles as specified in Section 6-05.3(11)E). To avoid bruising or breaking the surface of treated timber piles, the Contractor shall use spuds and chocks as little as possible. In building a trestle or foundation with inclined piles, leads shall be adapted for driving batter piles.
A helmet of the right size for the hammer shall distribute the blow and protect the top of steel piling or casings from driving damage. The helmet shall be positioned symmetrically below the hammer’s striking parts, so that the impact forces are applied concentric to the pile top.
Pile driving leads other than those fixed at the top and bottom may be used to complete driving, if permitted by the Engineer, when all of the following criteria are met: 1.
Each plumb and battered pile is located and initially driven at least 20 feet in true alignment using fixed leads or other approved means.

2.
The pile driving system (hammer, cushion and pile) will be analyzed by Pile Driving
Analyzer (PDA) to verify driving stresses in the pile are not increased due to eccentric loading during driving, and transferred hammer energy is not reduced due to eccentric loading during driving, for all test piles and at least one production pile per pier. Unless otherwise specified, the cost of PDA testing shall be incidental to the various unit Contract prices for driving piles. 6-05.3(10)

If the Contract or the Engineer call for it, the Contractor shall drive test piles to determine pile lengths required to reach the required ultimate bearing resistance, penetration, or both. Test piles shall be: 1.
Made of the same material and have the same tip diameter as the permanent piles (although test piles for treated timber piles may be either treated or untreated);
Driven with pile tips if the permanent piles will have tips; 3.
Prebored when preboring is specified for the permanent piles; 4.
Identical in cross-section and other characteristics to the permanent piles when the test piles are steel casings for cast-in-place concrete piles, precast concrete, precast‑prestressed concrete or steel pipe or H-pile; 5.
Long enough to accommodate all soil conditions;

Piling 6.
Driven with equipment and methods identical to those to be used for the permanent piles; 7.
Located as the Engineer directs; and 8.
Driven before permanent piles in a given pier.
Test piles may also be driven by the Contractor (at no cost to the Contracting Agency) as evidence that the pile driving system selected will not damage the pile or result in refusal prior to reaching the specified minimum tip elevation.
Timber test piles shall be driven outside the footing and cut off 1 foot below the finished ground line. Timber test piles shall not be used in place of permanent piles.
Steel and all types of concrete test piles shall become permanent piles. The Contracting
Agency has reduced the number of permanent piles by the number of test piles.
The Contractor shall base test pile length on test-hole data in the Contract. Test piles that prove to be too short shall be replaced (or spliced if the Contract allows splicing) at the
Contractor’s expense.
In foundations and trestles, test piles shall be driven to at least 15 percent more than the ultimate bearing resistance required for the permanent piles, except where pile driving criteria is determined by the wave equation. When pile driving criteria is specified to be determined by the wave equation, the test piles shall be driven to the same ultimate bearing resistance as the production piles. Test piles shall penetrate to a minimum tip elevation specified in the Contract. If no minimum tip elevation is specified, test piles shall extend at least 10 feet below the bottom of the concrete footing or ground line, and 15 feet below the bottom of the concrete seal.
When a test pile to be left as a permanent pile has been so damaged by handling or driving that the Engineer believes it unfit for use, the Contractor shall remove and replace the pile at no additional cost to the Contracting Agency. The Engineer may direct the
Contractor to overdrive the test pile to more than 15 percent above the ultimate bearing resistance for permanent piles, or if the wave equation is used to determine driving criteria, the Engineer may direct the Contractor to overdrive the test pile above the ultimate bearing resistance. In these cases, the overdriving shall be at the Contractor’s expense. But if pile damage results from this overdriving, removal and replacement will be at the Contracting Agency’s expense. 6-05.3(11)

Driving Piles 6-05.3(11)A
Tolerances
For elevated pier caps, the tops of piles at cut-off elevation shall be within 2 inches of the horizontal locations indicated in the Contract. For piles capped below final grade, the tops of piles at cut-off elevation shall be within 6 inches of the horizontal locations indicated in the Contract. No pile edge shall be nearer than 4 inches from the edge of a footing or cap.
Piles shall be installed such that the axial alignment of the top 10 feet of the pile is within
4 percent of the specified alignment. No misaligned steel or concrete piles shall be pulled laterally. A properly aligned section shall not be spliced onto a misaligned section for any type of pile. Unless the Contract shows otherwise, all piles shall be driven vertically. 6-05.3(11)B
Foundation Pit Preparation
The Contractor shall replace (and bear the cost of replacing) piles damaged or destroyed before or during driving.
The Contractor shall completely dig all foundation pits (and build any required cofferdams or cribs) before driving foundation piles. The Contractor shall adjust pit depths to allow for upheaval caused by pile-driving, judging the amount of adjustment by the nature of the soil. Before constructing the footing or pile cap, the Contractor shall restore the pit bottom to correct elevation by removing material or by backfilling with granular material.

Piling 6-05.3(11)C 6-05
Preparation for Driving
Treated and untreated timber piles shall be freshly cut square on the butt ends just before they are driven. If piles will be driven into hard material, caps, collars, or bands shall be placed on the butt ends to prevent crushing or brooming. If the head area of the pile is larger than that of the hammer face, the head shall be snipped or chamfered to fit the hammer. On treated piles, the heads shall be snipped or chamfered to at least the depth of the sapwood to avoid splitting the sapwood from the pile body.
The Contractor shall match timber pile sizes in any single bent to prevent sway braces from undue bending or distorting.
When driven, pile faces shall be turned as shown in the Plans or as the Engineer directs.
No precast-prestressed pile shall be driven until test cylinders poured with it reach at least the specified compressive strength shown in the Contract. On all other precast piles, the cylinders must reach a compressive strength of at least 4,000 psi before the piles are driven.
Helmets of approved design shall protect the heads of all precast concrete piles as they are driven. Each helmet shall have fitted into it a cushion next to the pile head. The bottom side of the helmet shall be recessed sufficiently to accommodate the required pile cushion and hold the pile in place during positioning and driving. The inside helmet diameter shall be determined before casting the pile, and the head of the pile shall be formed to fit loosely inside the helmet.
Steel Casing, steel pipe or H-piles shall have square-cut ends. 6-05.3(11)D
Achieving Minimum Tip Elevation and Bearing
Once pile driving has started, each pile shall be driven continuously until the required ultimate bearing resistance shown in the Contract has been achieved. Pauses during pile driving, except for splicing, mechanical breakdown, or other unforeseen events, shall not be allowed.
If the Contract specifies a minimum tip elevation, the pile shall be driven to at least the minimum tip elevation, even if the ultimate bearing resistance has been achieved, unless the Engineer directs otherwise. If a pile does not develop the required ultimate bearing resistance at the minimum tip elevation, the Contractor shall continue driving the pile until the required bearing resistance is achieved. If no minimum tip elevation is specified, then the piles shall be driven to the ultimate bearing resistance shown in the Contract and the following minimum penetrations:
Pile supporting cross-beams, bents, elevated pile caps elevation

10 feet below final top of ground
Piles supporting foundations
10 feet below bottom of foundation
Piles with a concrete seal
15 feet below bottom of seal
If overdriving is required in order to reach a specified minimum tip elevation, the
Contractor shall provide a pile driving system which will not result in damage to the pile or refusal before the minimum tip elevation is reached. The cost of overdriving shall be incidental to the various unit Contract prices for furnishing and driving piles.
So long as the pile is not damaged and the embankment or foundation material being driven through is not permanently damaged, the Contractor shall use normal means necessary to: 1.
Secure the minimum depth specified, 2.
Penetrate hard material that lies under a soft upper layer,

3.
Penetrate through hard material to obtain the specified minimum tip elevation, or 4.
Penetrate through a previously placed embankment.

Piling
Normal means refer to methods such as preboring, spudding, or jetting piles. Blasting or drilling through obstructions are not considered normal means.
Prebored holes and pile spuds shall have a diameter no larger than the least outside dimension of the pile. After the pile is driven, the Contractor shall fill all open spaces between the pile and the soil caused by the preboring or spudding with dry sand, or pea gravel, or controlled density fill as approved by the Engineer.
If water jets are used, the jets shall be withdrawn before the pile reaches its final penetration, and the pile shall then be driven to its final penetration and ultimate bearing resistance. The pile shall be driven a minimum of 2 feet to obtain the ultimate bearing resistance after the jets are withdrawn, or to refusal, whichever occurs first. If the water jets loosen a pile previously driven, it shall be redriven in place or pulled and replaced by a new pile. To check on pile loosening, the Contractor shall attempt to redrive at least one in every five piles, but no less than one pile per bent or pier.
The various unit Contract prices for driving piles shall cover all costs related to the use of water jets, preboring, or spudding. The Contracting Agency will not pay for costs the
Contractor incurs in redriving piles loosened as a result of using water jets, preboring, or spudding.
If the Engineer requires, the Contractor shall overdrive the pile beyond the ultimate bearing resistance and minimum tip elevation shown in the Contract. In this case, the
Contractor will not be required to: 1.

Use other than normal means to achieve the additional penetration, 2.
Bear the expense of removing or replacing piles damaged by overdriving, or 3.
Bear the expense of overdriving the pile more than 3 feet as specified in
Section 6-05.5.
In driving piles for footings with seals, the Contractor shall use no method (such as jetting or preboring) that might reduce friction resistance. 6-05.3(11)E
Use of Followers for Driving
Followers shall not be used to drive concrete or steel piles. On timber piles, the
Contractor may use steel (not wooden) followers if the follower fits snugly over the pile head. If a follower is used, the Contractor shall, in every group of 10 piles, drive one long pile without a follower, but no less than one pile per bent or pier, to the required ultimate bearing resistance and minimum tip elevation. This long pile shall be used to test the bearing resistance of the piles driven with a follower in the group. The tip elevation of the long pile shall be similar to the elevation of the piles driven with the follower. If the tip elevations are significantly different, as determined by the Engineer, the Contractor shall redrive the remaining piles in the group to the tip elevation of the longer pile. 6-05.3(11)F
Pile Damage
The Contractor shall remove and replace (and bear the cost of doing so) piles that are damaged as determined by the Engineer.
After driving a steel casing for a cast-in-place concrete pile, the Contractor shall leave it empty until the Engineer has inspected and accepted it. The Contractor shall make available to the Engineer a light suitable for inspecting the entire length of its interior.
The Engineer will reject casings that are improperly driven, that show partial collapse that would reduce its ultimate bearing resistance, or that has been reduced in diameter, or that will not keep out water. The Contractor shall replace (and bear the cost of replacing) all rejected casings.
Pile heads which have been broomed, rolled, or otherwise significantly damaged as determined by the Engineer shall be cut back to undamaged material before proceeding with driving as well as final acceptance of the pile.
Page 6-176

2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Piling 6-05 6-05.3(11)G
Pile Cutoff
The Contractor shall trim the tops of all piles to the true plane shown in the Contract and to the elevation the Engineer requires. If a pile is driven below cutoff elevation without the Engineer’s permission, the Contractor shall remove and replace it (and bear the costs of doing so), even if this requires a longer pile. Piles that rise as nearby piles are driven, shall be driven down again if the Engineer requires.
Piles under timber caps or grillages shall be sawed to the exact plane of the Structure above them and fit it exactly. No shimming on top of timber piles to adjust for inaccurate pile top elevations will be permitted. If a timber pile is driven out of line, it shall be straightened without damage before it is cut off or braced.
Steel casing shall be cut off at least 6 inches below the finished ground line or at the low water line if the casing will be visible as determined by the Engineer. 6-05.3(11)H
Pile Driving From or Near Adjacent Structures
The Contractor shall not drive piling from an existing Structure unless all of the following conditions are met: 1.
The existing Structure will be demolished within the Contract; 2.
The existing Structure is permanently closed to traffic; and 3.
Type 2E Working Drawings are submitted in accordance with Sections 1-05.3 and 6-02.3(16), showing the structural adequacy of the existing Structure to safely support all of the construction loads.

Freshly placed concrete in the vicinity of the pile driving operation shall be protected against vibration in accordance with Section 6-02.3(6)D. 6-05.3(12)
Determination of Bearing Values
The following formula shall be used to determine ultimate bearing resistances:
P = F × E × Ln(10N)
Where:
P
F
E
W
H
N
Ln

= ultimate bearing resistance, in tons = 1.8 for air/steam hammers = 1.2 for open ended diesel hammers and precast concrete or timber piles = 1.6 for open ended diesel hammers and steel piles = 1.2 for closed ended diesel hammers = 1.9 for hydraulic hammers = 0.9 for drop hammers = developed energy, equal to W times H1, in ft-kips = weight of ram, in kips = vertical drop of hammer or stroke of ram, in feet = average penetration resistance in blows per inch for the last
4 inches of driving = the natural logarithm, in base “e” 1For closed-end diesel hammers (double-acting), the developed hammer energy (E) is to be determined from the bounce chamber reading. Hammer manufacturer calibration data may be used to correlate bounce chamber pressure to developed hammer energy. For double acting hammer hydraulic and air/steam hammers, the developed hammer energy shall be calculated from ram impact velocity measurements or other means acceptable to the Engineer. For open ended diesel hammers (single-acting) use the blows per minute to determine the developed energy (E).
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10
Page 6-177 6-05
Piling
The above formula applies only when: 1.
The hammer is in good condition and operating in a satisfactory manner. 2.
A follower is not used. 3.
The pile top is not damaged.

4.
The pile head is free from broomed or crushed wood fiber. 5.
The penetration occurs at a reasonably quick, uniform rate; and the pile has been driven at least 2 feet after an interruption in driving greater than 1 hour in length. 6.
There is no perceptible bounce after the blow. If a significant bounce cannot be avoided, twice the height of the bounce shall be deducted from “H” to determine its true value in the formula. 7.
For timber piles, bearing resistances calculated by the formula above shall be considered effective only when it is less than the crushing strength of the piles. 8.
If “N” is greater than or equal to 1.0 blow/inch.
If “N” required to achieve the required ultimate bearing resistance using the above formula is less than 1.0 blow/inch, the pile shall be driven until the penetration resistance is a minimum of 1.0 blow/inch for the last 2 feet of driving.
The Engineer may require the Contractor to install a pressure gauge on the inboard end of the hose to check pressure at the hammer.
If water jets are used in driving, bearing resistances shall be determined either: (1) by calculating it with the driving data and the formula above after the jets have been withdrawn and the pile is driven at least 2 feet, or (2) by applying a test load. 6-05.3(13)
Treatment of Timber Pile Heads

After cutting timber piles to correct elevation, the Contractor shall thoroughly coat the heads of all untreated piles with two coats of an approved preservative that meets the requirements of Section 9-09 (except concrete-encased piles).
After cutting treated timber piles to correct elevation, the Contractor shall brush three coats of a preservative that meets the requirements of Section 9-09 on all pile heads (except those to be covered with concrete footings or concrete caps). The pile heads shall then be capped with alternate layers of an approved roofing asphalt and a waterproofing fabric that conforms to Section 9-11.1. The cap shall be made of four layers of an approved roofing asphalt and three layers of fabric. The fabric shall be cut large enough to cover the pile top and fold down at least 6 inches along all sides of the pile. After the fabric cover is bent down over the pile, its edges shall be fastened with large-head galvanized nails or with three turns of galvanized wire. The edges of the cover shall be neatly trimmed.
On a treated timber pile encased in concrete, the cut end shall receive two coats of an approved preservative that meets the requirements of Section 9-09 and then a heavy coat of an approved roofing asphalt. 6-05.3(14)
Extensions and Buildups of Precast Concrete Piles
The Contractor shall add extensions, or buildups (if necessary) on precast concrete piles after they are driven to the required ultimate bearing resistance and minimum tip elevation.
Before adding extensions or buildups to precast-prestressed piles, the Contractor shall remove all spalled concrete, leaving the pile fresh-headed and with a top surface
Page 6-178
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Piling 6-05
Before adding to non-prestressed precast concrete piles, the Contractor shall cut the pile head away to a depth 40 times the diameter of the vertical reinforcing bar. The final cut shall be perpendicular to the axis of the pile. Reinforcement of the same density and configuration as used in the pile shall be used in the buildup and shall be fastened firmly to the projecting steel. Forms shall be placed to prevent concrete from leaking along the
Just before placing the concrete for extensions or buildups to precast or precastprestressed concrete piles, the Contractor shall thoroughly wet the top of the pile. Forms shall remain in place at least 3 days. 6-05.3(15)

Completion of Cast-In-Place Concrete Piles
After acceptance by the Engineer, driven casings shall be cut off horizontally at the required elevation. They shall be clean and free of water when concrete and reinforcing steel are placed.
These piles shall consist of steel casings driven into the ground, reinforced as specified, 6-05.3(15)A
Reinforcement
All bars shall be fastened rigidly into a single unit, then lowered into the casing before the concrete is placed. Loose bars shall not be used.
Spiral hooping reinforcement shall be deformed steel bar, plain steel bar, cold-drawn wire, or deformed wire. 6-05.3(15)B
Placing Concrete
Before placing concrete, the Contractor shall remove all debris and water from the casing.
If the water cannot be removed, the casing shall be removed (or cut off 2 feet below the ground and filled with sand) and a new one driven.
The Contractor shall place concrete continuously through a 5-foot rigid conduit directing the concrete down the center of the pile casing, ensuring that every part of the pile is filled and the concrete is worked around the reinforcement. The top 5 feet of concrete shall be placed with the tip of the conduit below the top of fresh concrete. The Contractor shall vibrate, as a minimum, the top 10 feet of concrete. In all cases, the concrete shall be vibrated to a point at least 5 feet below the original ground line. 6-05.4

Measurement
Measurement for driving (type) pile will be the number of piles driven in place.
In these categories, measurement will be the longer of either the number of linear feet driven below cutoff or as shown in the Engineer’s order list: 1.
Furnishing timber piling (untreated or name of treatment). 2.
Precast concrete and precast-prestressed concrete piling.

Soil Nail Walls
If caving conditions are encountered, no further drilling will be allowed until the
Contractor selects a method to prevent ground movement. The Contractor may use temporary casing. The Contractor’s method to prevent ground movement shall be approved by the Engineer. The casings for the nail holes, if used, shall be removed as the grout is being placed.
Where necessary for stability of the excavation face, a sealing layer of shotcrete may be placed before drilling is started, or the Contractor shall have the option of drilling and grouting of nails through a stabilizing berm of native soil at the face of the excavation.
The stabilizing berm shall extend horizontally from the soil face and from the face of the shotcrete a minimum distance of 1 foot, and shall be cut down from that point at a safe slope, no steeper than 1H:1V unless approved by the Engineer. The berm shall be excavated to final grade after installation and full length grouting of the nails. Nails damaged during berm excavation shall be repaired or replaced by the Contractor, to the satisfaction of the Engineer, at no added cost to the Contracting Agency.
If sections of the wall are constructed at different times than the adjacent soil nail sections, the Contractor shall use stabilizing berms, temporary slopes, or other measures acceptable to the Engineer, to prevent sloughing or failure of the adjacent soil nail sections.
If cobbles and boulders are encountered at the soil face during excavation, the Contractor shall remove all cobbles and boulders that protrude from the soil face into the design wall section and fill the void with shotcrete. All shotcrete used to fill voids created by removal of cobbles and boulders shall be incidental to shotcrete facing.
The grout equipment shall produce a grout free of lumps and undispersed cement.
A positive displacement grout pump shall be used. The pump shall be equipped with a pressure gauge near the discharge end to monitor grout pressures. The pressure gauge shall be capable of measuring pressures of at least 150 psi or twice the actual grout pressures used by the Contractor, whichever is greater. The grouting equipment shall be sized to enable the grout to be pumped in one continuous operation. The mixer shall be capable of continuously agitating the grout.
The grout shall be injected from the lowest point of the drilled hole. The quantity of the grout and the grout pressures shall be recorded. The grout pressures and grout takes shall be controlled to prevent excessive ground heave.
The Contractor shall make and cure grout cubes once per day in accordance with WSDOT
T 813. These samples shall be retained by the Contractor until all associated verification and proof testing of the soil nails has been successfully completed. If the Contractor elects to test the grout cubes for compressive strength, testing shall be conducted by an independent laboratory and shall be in accordance with the FOP for AASHTO T106. 6-15.3(7)

Shotcrete Facing
Prior to placing shotcrete on an excavated layer, the Contractor shall vertically center prefabricated drainage mat between the columns of nails as shown in the Plans. The prefabricated drainage mat shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. The permeable drain side shall be placed against the exposed soil face. The prefabricated drainage mat shall be installed after each excavation lift and shall be hydraulically connected with the prefabricated drainage mat previously placed, such that the vertical flow of water is not impeded. The Contractor shall tape all joints in the prefabricated drainage mat to prevent shotcrete intrusion during shotcrete application.
The Contractor shall place steel reinforcing bars and welded wire fabric and apply the shotcrete facing in accordance with Section 6-18 and the details shown in the Plans.
The shotcrete shall be constructed to the minimum thickness as shown in the Plans. Costs associated with additional thickness of shotcrete due to over excavation or irregularities in the cut face shall be borne by the Contractor.
Page 6-250
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Soil Nail Walls 6-15
Each soil nail shall be secured at the shotcrete facing with a steel plate as shown in the
Plans. The plate shall be seated on a wet grout pad of a pasty consistency similar to that of mortar for bricklaying. The nut shall then be sufficiently tightened to achieve full bearing surface behind the plate. After the shotcrete and grout have had time to gain the specified strength, the nut shall be tightened with at least 100 foot-pounds of torque. After final tightening of the nut, the threads of the soil nail shall at a minimum be flush with the end of the nut. 6-15.3(8)
Soil Nail Testing and Acceptance
Both verification and proof testing of the nails is required. The Contractor shall supply all materials, equipment, and labor to perform the tests. The Contractor shall submit Type
1 Working Drawings of all test data. Soil nails used for verification tests and proof tests shall not be production soil nails, but instead shall be separate sacrificial soil nails not otherwise incorporated into the Work.
The testing equipment shall include a dial gauge or vernier scale capable of measuring to
0.001 inch of the ground anchor movement. A hydraulic jack and pump shall be used to apply the test load. The movement-measuring device shall have a minimum travel equal to the theoretical elastic elongation of the total nail length plus 1 inch. The dial gauge or vernier scale shall be aligned so that its axis is within 5 degrees from the axis of the nail and shall be monitored with a reference system that is independent of the jacking system and excavation face.
The jack and pressure gauge shall be calibrated by an independent testing Laboratory as a unit. Each load cell, test jack and pressure gauge, grout pump stroke counter, and master gauge, shall be calibrated as specified in Section 6-15.3(3), item 4b. Additionally, the Contractor shall not use load cells, test jacks and pressure gauges, grout pump stroke counters, and master gauges, greater than 60 calendar days past their most recent calibration date, until such items are re-calibrated by an independent testing Laboratory.
The pressure gauge shall be graduated in increments of either 100 psi or 2 percent of the maximum test load, whichever is less. The pressure gauge shall be selected to place the maximum test load within the middle ⅔ of the range of the gauge. The ram travel of the jack shall not be less than the theoretical elastic elongation of the total length at the maximum test load plus 1 inch. The jack shall be independently supported and centered over the nail so that the nail does not carry the weight of the jack. The Contractor shall have a second calibrated jack pressure gauge at the site. Calibration data shall provide a specific reference to the jack and the pressure gauge.
The loads on the nails during the verification and proof tests shall be monitored to verify consistency of load – defined as maintaining the test load within 5 percent of the specified value. Verification and proof test loads less than 20,000 pounds or sustained for
5 minutes or less shall be monitored by the jack pressure gauge alone. Verification and proof test loads equal to or greater than 20,000 pounds and sustained for longer than 5 minutes shall be monitored with the assistance of an electric or hydraulic load cell. The
Contractor shall provide the load cell, the readout device, and a calibration curve from the most recent calibration as specified in Section 6-15.3(3), item 4b. The load cell shall be selected to place the maximum test load within the middle ⅔ of the range of the load cell. The load cell shall be mounted between the jack and the anchor plate. The stressing equipment shall be placed over the nail in such a manner that the jack bearing plates, load cell and stressing anchorage are in alignment.
Nails to be tested shall be initially grouted no closer to the excavation face than the dimension shown in the Plans. After placing the grout, the nail shall remain undisturbed until the grout has reached strength sufficient to provide resistance during testing. Test nails shall be left in the ground after testing, with the exposed portion of the test nail cut and removed to 2 feet behind the excavated face or inside face of shotcrete. The drill holes for test nails shall be completely backfilled with grout or nonstructural filler after testing on those test nails has been completed.

Load testing shall be performed against a temporary reaction frame with bearing pads that bear directly against the existing soil or the shotcrete facing. Bearing pads shall be kept a minimum of 12 inches from the edges of the drilled hole and the load shall be distributed to prevent failure of the soil face or fracture of the shotcrete. The Contractor shall submit
Type 2E Working Drawings of the reaction frame.
The soil nail load monitoring procedure for verification and proof test load greater than 20,000 pounds and sustained for longer than 5 minutes shall be as follows: 1.
For each increment of load, attainment of the load shall be initially established and confirmed by the reading taken from the jack gauge. 2.
Once the soil nail anchor load has been stabilized, based on the jack gauge reading, the load cell readout device shall immediately be read and recorded to establish the load cell reading to be used at this load. The load cell reading is intended only as a confirmation of a stable soil nail load and shall not be taken as the actual load on the soil nail. 3.
During the time period that the load on the soil nail is held at this load increment, the Contractor shall monitor the load cell reading. The Contractor shall adjust the jack pressure as necessary to maintain the initial load cell reading. Jack pressure adjustment for any other reason will not be allowed. 4.
Soil nail elongation measurements shall be taken at each load increment as specified in Sections 6-15.3(8)A and 6-15.3(8)B.

Verification testing shall be performed on nails installed within the pattern of production nails to verify the Contractor’s procedures, hole diameter, and design assumptions. No drilling or installation of production nails will be permitted in ground/rock unit unless successful verification testing of anchors in that unit has been completed and approved by the Engineer, using the same equipment, methods, nail inclination, nail length, and hole diameter as planned for the production nails. Changes in the drilling or installation method may require additional verification testing as determined by the Engineer and shall be done at no additional expense to the Contracting Agency. Verification tests may be performed prior to excavation for the soil nail wall.
Successful verification tests are required within the limits as specified in the Special
Provisions. Test nail locations within these limits shall be at locations selected by the
Engineer.
The Contractor shall submit Type 2E Working Drawings consisting of design details of the verification testing, including the system for distributing test load pressures to the excavation surface and appropriate nail bar size and reaction plate. The intent is to stress the bond between the grout and the surrounding soil/rock to at least twice the design load transfer. Prior to beginning verification testing, the Contractor shall measure and record the length of the nonbonded zone for each verification test soil nail.
The bar shall be proportioned such that the maximum stress at 200 percent of the test load does not exceed 80 percent of the yield strength of the steel. The jack shall be positioned at the beginning of the test such that unloading and repositioning of the jack during the test will not be required. The verification tests shall be made by incrementally loading the nails in accordance with the following schedule of hold time:

The test load shall be determined by the following equation = Test Load (TL) = Bond
Length (BL) × Design Load Transfer (DLT).
The load shall be applied in increments of 25 percent of the test load. Each load increment shall be held for at least 10 minutes. Measurement of nail movement shall be obtained at each load increment. The load-hold period shall start as soon as the load is applied and the nail movement with respect to a fixed reference shall be measured and recorded at
1 minute, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes.
The Engineer will evaluate the results of each verification test and make a determination of the suitability of the test and of the Contractor’s proposed production nail design and installation system. Tests that fail to meet the design criteria will require additional verification testing or an approved revision to the Contractor’s proposed production nail design and installation system. If a nail fails in creep, retesting will not be allowed.
A verification tested nail with a 60-minute load hold at 1.50TL is acceptable if: 1.
The nail carries the test load with a creep rate that does not exceed 0.08 inch per log cycle of time and is at a linear or decreasing creep rate. 2.
The total movement at the test load exceeds 80 percent of the theoretical elastic elongation of the non-bonded length.
Furthermore, a pullout failure shall not occur for the verification test anchor at the 2.0TL maximum load. Pullout failure load is defined as the load at which attempts to increase the test load result only in continued pullout movement of the test nail without a sustainable increase in the test load. 6-15.3(8)B
Proof Testing

Proof tests shall be performed on proof test soil nails installed within the pattern of the production soil nails at the locations shown in the Plans. Proof test soil nails shall be installed using the same equipment, methods, nail inclination, nail length, and hole diameter as for adjacent production nails. The Contractor shall maintain the side-wall stability of the drill hole for the non-grouted portion during the test. The bond length shall be determined from the Nail Schedule and Test Nail Detail shown in the Plans. Prior to beginning proof testing, the Contractor shall measure and record the length of the nonbonded zone for each proof test soil nail.
Proof tests shall be performed by incrementally loading the nail in accordance with the schedule below. The anchor movement shall be measured and recorded to the nearest
0.001 inch with respect to an independent fixed reference point in the same manner as for the verification tests at the alignment load and at each increment of load. The load shall be monitored in accordance with Section 6-15.3(8). The scheduling of hold times shall be as follows:

The maximum load in a proof test shall be held for 10 minutes. The load hold period shall start as soon as the maximum load is applied and the nail movement with respect to an independent fixed reference shall be measured and recorded at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and
10 minutes. The nail movement between 1 and 10 minutes shall not exceed 0.04 inches.
If the nail movement between 1 and 10 minutes exceeds 0.04 inches, the maximum load shall be held an additional 50 minutes. If the load hold is extended, the nail movement shall be recorded at 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes. If a nail fails in creep, retesting will not be allowed.
A proof tested nail is acceptable if: 1.

The nail carries the maximum load with less than 0.04 inches of movement between
1 and 10 minutes, unless the load hold extended to 60 minutes, in which case the nail would be acceptable if the creep rate does not exceed 0.08 inches per log cycle of time. 2.
The total movement at the maximum load exceeded 80 percent of the theoretical elastic elongation of the non-bonded length. 3
The creep rate is not increasing with time during the load hold period.
If a proof test fails, the Engineer may direct the Contractor to replace some or all of the installed production nails between the failed test and an adjacent proof test nail that has met the test criteria. The Engineer may also require additional proof testing. All additional proof tests, and all installation of additional or modified nails, shall be performed at no additional expense to the Contracting Agency. 6-15.3(9)

Shaft Excavation
Shafts shall be excavated to the required depth as shown in the Plans. The minimum diameter of the shaft shall be as shown in the Plans. The excavation shall be completed in a continuous operation using equipment capable of excavating through the type of material expected to be encountered.
The Contractor may use temporary telescoping casing to construct the shafts.
If the shaft excavation is stopped the shaft shall be secured by installation of a safety cover. It shall be the Contractor’s responsibility to ensure the safety of the shaft and surrounding soil and the stability of the sidewalls. A temporary casing, slurry, or other methods specified in the shaft installation plan shall be used if necessary to ensure such safety and stability.
Where caving in conditions are encountered, no further excavation will be allowed until the Contractor has implemented the method to prevent ground caving as submitted in accordance with item 4 of the Shaft Installation Plan.
No more than 2 inches of loose or disturbed material, for soldier piles with permanent ground anchors, nor more than 12 inches of loose or disturbed material, for soldier piles without permanent ground anchors, shall be present at the bottom of the shaft just prior to beginning concrete placement.
The excavated shaft shall be inspected and receive acceptance by the Engineer prior to proceeding with construction.
When obstructions are encountered, the Contractor shall notify the Engineer promptly.
An obstruction is defined as a specific object (including, but not limited to, boulders, logs, and previously fabricated objects) encountered during the shaft excavation operation that prevents or hinders the advance of the shaft excavation. When efforts to advance past the obstruction to the design shaft tip elevation result in the rate of advance of the shaft drilling equipment being significantly reduced relative to the rate of advance for the rest of the shaft excavation, then the Contractor shall remove the obstruction under the provisions of Section 6-16.5. The method of removal of such obstructions, and the continuation of excavation shall be as proposed by the Contractor and approved by the
Engineer.
Excavation of shafts shall not commence until a minimum of 12 hours after the shaft backfill for the adjacent shafts has been placed.
The temporary casings for the shafts shall be removed. A minimum 5-foot head of concrete shall be maintained to balance the soil and water pressure at the bottom of the casing. The casing shall be smooth. 6-16.3(4)

If the Contractor’s key personnel change, or if the Contractor proposes a significant revision of the approved permanent ground anchor installation plan, an additional conference shall be held before additional permanent ground anchor operations are performed. 6-17.3(5)
Tendon Fabrication
The tendons can be either shop or field fabricated. The tendon shall be fabricated as shown in the shop plans.
The Contractor shall select the type of tendon to be used. The tendon shall be sized so the factored design load does not exceed 80 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the tendon. In addition, the tendon shall be sized so the maximum test load does not exceed 80 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the tendon.
The Contractor shall be responsible for determining the bond length and tendon bond length necessary to develop the factored design load indicated in the Plans in accordance with Sections 6-17.3(8)A, 6-17.3(8)B, and 6-17.3(8)C. The minimum bond length shall be
10 feet in rock and 15 feet in soil.
When the Plans require the tendon bond length to be encapsulated, the tendon bond length portion of the tendon shall be corrosion protected by encapsulating the tendon in a grout-filled PE or PVC tube as specified in Section 6-17.2 as supplemented in the
Special Provisions. The tendons can be grouted inside the encapsulation prior to inserting the tendon in the drill hole or after the tendon has been placed in the drill hole. Expansive admixtures can be mixed with the encapsulation grout if the tendon is grouted inside the encapsulation while outside the drill hole. The tendon shall be centralized within the bond length encapsulation with a minimum of 0.20 inches of grout cover. Spacers shall be used along the tendon bond length of multi-element tendons to separate the elements of the tendon so the prestressing steel will bond to the encapsulation grout.
Centralizers shall be used to provide a minimum of 0.5 inches of grout cover over the tendon bond length encapsulation. Centralizers shall be securely attached to the encapsulation and the center-to-center spacing shall not exceed 10 feet. In addition, the upper centralizer shall be located a maximum of 5 feet from the top of the tendon bond length and the lower centralizer shall be located a maximum of 1 foot from the bottom of the tendon bond length.
The centralizer shall be able to support the tendon in the drill hole and position the tendon so a minimum of 0.5 inches of grout cover is provided and shall permit free flow of grout.
Centralizers are not required on encapsulated, pressure-injected ground anchor tendons if the ground anchor is installed in coarse grained soils (more than 50 percent of the soil larger than the number 200 sieve) using grouting pressures greater than 150 psi.

Permanent Ground Anchors
Centralizers are not required on encapsulated, hollow-stem-augered ground anchor tendons if the ground anchor is grouted through and the hole is maintained full of a stiff grout (8-inch slump or less) during extraction of the auger.
The minimum unbonded length of the tendon shall be the greater of 15 feet or that indicated in the Plans.
Corrosion protection of the unbonded length shall be provided by a sheath completely filled with corrosion inhibiting grease or grout. If grease is used under the sheath, provisions shall be made to prevent the grease from escaping at the ends of the sheath.
The grease shall completely coat the tendon and fill the voids between the tendon and the sheath.
If the sheath is not fabricated from a smooth tube, a separate bond breaker shall be provided. The bond breaker shall prevent the tendon from bonding to the anchor grout surrounding the tendon unbonded length.
The total anchor length shall not be less than that indicated in the Plans or the approved
Working Drawing submittal.
Anchorage devices shall be capable of developing 95 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the prestressing steel tendon. The anchorage devices shall conform to the static strength requirements of Section 3.1 of the Post Tensioning Institute
Specification for Unbonded Single Strand Tendons, First Edition – 1993.
Non-restressable anchorage devices may be used except where indicated in the Plans.
Restressable anchorages shall be provided on those ground anchors that require reloading. The post-tensioning supplier shall provide a restressable anchorage compatible with the post-tensioning system provided.
The bearing plates shall be sized so the bending stresses in the plate do not exceed the yield strength of the steel when a load equal to 95 percent of the minimum guaranteed ultimate tensile strength of the tendon is applied, and the average bearing stress on the concrete does not exceed that recommended in Section 3.1.3 of the Post Tensioning
Institute Specification for Unbonded Single Strand Tendons, First Edition – 1993.
The trumpet shall have an inside diameter equal to or larger than the hole in the bearing plate. The trumpet shall be long enough to accommodate movements of the Structure during testing and stressing. For strand tendons with encapsulation over the unbonded length, the trumpet shall be long enough to enable the tendon to make a transition from the diameter or the tendon in the unbonded length to the diameter of the tendon at the anchor head without damaging the encapsulation. Trumpets filled with corrosioninhibiting grease shall have a permanent rubber seal provided between the trumpet and the tendon unbonded length corrosion protection. Trumpets filled with grout shall have a temporary seal provided between the trumpet and the tendon unbonded length corrosion protection or the trumpet shall overlap the tendon unbonded length corrosion protection. 6-17.3(6)

Tendon Storage and Handling
Tendons shall be handled and stored in such a manner as to avoid damage or corrosion.
Damage to the prestressing steel as a result of abrasions, cut, nicks, welds and weld splatter will be cause for rejection by the Engineer. The prestressing steel shall be protected if welding is to be performed in the vicinity. Grounding of welding leads to the prestressing steel is forbidden. Prestressing steel shall be protected from dirt, rust, and deleterious substances. A light coating of rust on the steel is acceptable. If heavy corrosion or pitting is noted, the Engineer will reject the affected tendons.
Page 6-268
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Permanent Ground Anchors 6-17
The Contractor shall use care in handling and storing the tendons at the site. Prior to inserting a tendon in the drill hole, the Contractor and the Engineer will examine the tendon for damage to the encapsulation and the sheathing. If, in the opinion of the
Engineer, the encapsulation is damaged, the Contractor shall repair the encapsulation in accordance with the tendon supplier’s recommendations and as approved by the Engineer.
If, in the opinion of the Engineer, the smooth sheathing has been damaged, the Contractor shall repair it with ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (PE) tape. The tape shall be spiral wound around the tendon so as to completely seal the damaged area. The pitch of the spiral shall ensure a double thickness at all points. 6-17.3(7)
Installing Permanent Ground Anchors
The Contractor shall select the drilling method, the grouting procedure, and the grouting pressure used for the installation of the ground anchor.
When caving conditions are encountered, no further drilling will be allowed until the
Contractor selects a method to prevent ground movement. The Contractor may use a temporary casing. The Contractor’s method to prevent ground movement shall be submitted as a Type 2 Working Drawing. The casings for the anchor holes, if used, shall be removed. The drill hole shall be located so the longitudinal axis of the drill hole and the longitudinal axis of the tendon are parallel. The ground anchor shall not be drilled in a location that requires the tendon to be bent in order to enable the bearing plate to be connected to the supported Structure. At the point of entry the ground anchor shall be installed within plus or minus 3 degrees of the inclination from horizontal shown in the
Plans or the Working Drawing submittal. The ground anchors shall not extend beyond the
Right of Way limits.
The tendon shall be inserted into the drill hole to the desired depth. When the tendon cannot be completely inserted without difficulty, the Contractor shall remove the tendon from the drill hole and clean or redrill the hole to permit insertion. Partially inserted tendons shall not be driven or forced into the hole.
The Contractor shall use a grout conforming to Section 6-17.2 as supplemented in the
Special Provisions.
The grout equipment shall produce a grout free of lumps and undispersed cement. A positive displacement grout pump shall be used. The pump shall be equipped with a pressure gauge near the discharge end to monitor grout pressures. The pressure gauge shall be capable of measuring pressures of at least 150 psi or twice the actual grout pressures used by the Contractor, whichever is greater. The grouting equipment shall be sized to enable the grout to be pumped in one continuous operation. The mixer shall be capable of continuously agitating the grout.
The grout shall be injected from the lowest point of the drill hole. The grout may be pumped through grout tubes, casing, or drill rods. The grout can be placed before or after insertion of the tendon. The quantity of the grout and the grout pressures shall be recorded. The grout pressures and grout takes shall be controlled to prevent excessive heave in soils or fracturing of rock formations.
The Contractor shall make and cure grout cubes once per day in accordance with WSDOT
T 813. These samples shall be retained by the Contractor until all associated verification, performance and proof testing of the permanent ground anchors has been successfully completed. If the Contractor elects to test the grout cubes for compressive strength, testing shall be conducted by an independent laboratory and shall be in accordance with the FOP for AASHTO T 106.
After grouting, the tendon shall not be loaded for a minimum of 3 days.

Permanent Ground Anchors
No grout shall be placed above the top of the bond length during the time the bond length grout is placed. The grout at the top of the drill hole shall not contact the back of the Structure or the bottom of the trumpet. Except as otherwise noted, only nonstructural filler shall be placed above the bond length grout prior to testing and acceptance of the anchor. The Contractor may place structural grout above the bond length grout prior to testing and acceptance of the anchor subject to the following conditions: 1.
The anchor unbonded length shall be increased by 8 feet minimum. 2.
The grout in the unbonded zone shall not be placed by pressure grouting methods.
The corrosion protection surrounding the unbonded length of the tendon shall extend up beyond the bottom seal of the trumpet or 1 foot into the trumpet if no trumpet seal is provided. If the protection does not extend beyond the seal or sufficiently far enough into the trumpet, the Contractor shall extend the corrosion protection or lengthen the trumpet.
The corrosion protection surrounding the no load zone length of the tendon shown in the Plans shall not contact the bearing plate or the anchor head during testing and stressing. If the protection is too long, the Contractor shall trim the corrosion protection to prevent contact.
The bearing plate and anchor head shall be placed so the axis of the tendon and the drill hole are both perpendicular to the bearing plate within plus or minus 3 degrees and the axis of the tendon passes through the center of the bearing plate at the intersection of the trumpet and the bearing plate when fully seated with the alignment load.
The trumpet shall be completely filled with corrosion inhibiting grease or grout. Trumpet grease can be placed anytime during construction. Trumpet grout shall be placed after the ground anchor has been tested. The Contractor shall demonstrate to the Engineer that the procedure selected by the Contractor for placement of either grease or grout produces a completely filled trumpet.
All anchorages permanently exposed to the atmosphere shall be covered with a corrosion inhibiting grease-filled or grout-filled cover. The Contractor shall demonstrate to the
Engineer that the procedures selected by the Contractor for placement of either grease or grout produces a completely filled cover. If the Plans require restressable anchorages, corrosion inhibiting grease shall be used to fill the anchorage cover and trumpet. 6-17.3(8)

Testing and Stressing
Each ground anchor shall be tested. The test load shall be simultaneously applied to the entire tendon. Stressing of single elements of multi-element tendons will not be permitted. The Engineer will record test data.
The testing equipment shall consist of a dial gauge or vernier scale capable of measuring to 0.001 inch and shall be used to measure the ground anchor movement. The movementmeasuring device shall have a minimum travel equal to the theoretical elastic elongation of the total anchor length plus 1 inch. The dial gauge or vernier scale shall be aligned so that its axis is within 5 degrees from the axis of the tieback. A hydraulic jack and pump shall be used to apply the test load. The jack and pressure gauge shall be calibrated by an independent testing Laboratory as a unit. Each load cell, test jack and pressure gauge, and master pressure gauge, shall be calibrated as specified in Section 6-17.3(3). Additionally, the Contractor shall not use load cells, test jacks and pressure gauges, and master pressure gauges, greater than 60 calendar days past their most recent calibration date, until such items are re-calibrated by an independent testing Laboratory.
Page 6-270
2024 Standard Specifications M 41-10 Permanent Ground Anchors 6-17
The pressure gauge shall be graduated in increments of either 100 psi or 2 percent of the maximum test load, whichever is less. The pressure gauge will be used to measure the applied load. The pressure gauge shall be selected to place the maximum test load within the middle ⅔ of the range of the gauge. The ram travel of the jack shall not be less than the theoretical elastic elongation of the total anchor length at the maximum test load plus 1 inch. The jack shall be independently supported and centered over the tendon so that the tendon does not carry the weight of the jack. The Contractor shall have a second calibrated jack pressure gauge at the site. Calibration data shall provide a specific reference to the jack and the pressure gauge.
The loads on the tiebacks during the performance and verification tests shall be monitored to verify consistency of load as defined in Section 6-17.3(1). Performance test loads, and verification test loads when specified in the Special Provisions, sustained for
5 minutes or less, and all proof test leads, shall be monitored by the jack pressure gauge alone. Performance test loads, and verification test loads when specified in the Special
Provisions, sustained for longer than 5 minutes shall be monitored with the assistance of an electric or hydraulic load cell. The Contractor shall provide the load cell and a readout device. The load cell shall be mounted between the jack and the anchor plate. The load cell shall be selected to place the maximum test load within the middle ⅔ of the range of the load cell. The stressing equipment shall be placed over the ground anchor tendon in such a manner that the jack, bearing plates, load cell and stressing anchorage are in alignment.
The permanent ground anchor load monitoring procedure for performance test loads, and verification test loads when specified in the Special Provisions, sustained for longer than 5 minutes shall be as follows: 1.

For each increment of load, attainment of the load shall be initially established and confirmed by the reading taken from the jack gauge. 2.
Once the permanent ground anchor load has been stabilized, based on the jack gauge reading, the load cell readout device shall immediately be read and recorded to establish the load cell reading to be used at this load. The load cell reading is intended only as a confirmation of a stable permanent ground anchor load, and shall not be taken as the actual load on the permanent ground anchor. 3.
During the time period that the load on the permanent ground anchor is held at this load increment, the Contractor shall monitor the load cell reading. The Contractor shall adjust the jack pressure as necessary to maintain the initial load cell reading. Jack pressure adjustment for all other reasons will not be allowed. 4.
Permanent ground anchor elongation measurements shall be taken at each load increment as specified in Sections 6-17.3(8)A and 6-17.3(8)B. 5.
Steps 1 through 4 shall be repeated at each increment of load, in accordance with the load sequence specified in Sections 6-17.3(8)A and 6-17.3(8)B. 6-17.3(8)A
Verification Testing
Verification tests will be required only when specified in the Special Provisions. 6-17.3(8)B
Performance Testing
Performance tests shall be done in accordance with the following procedures.
Five percent of the ground anchors or a minimum of three ground anchors, whichever is greater, shall be performance tested. The Engineer shall select the ground anchors to be performance tested. The first production anchor shall be performance tested.
The performance test shall be made by incrementally loading and unloading the ground anchor in accordance with the following schedule, consistent with the Load Resistance
Factor Design (LRFD) design method. The load shall be raised from one increment to another immediately after a deflection reading.
