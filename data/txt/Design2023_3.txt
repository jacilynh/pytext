ectrical Design Lighting system electrical design is part of the roadside power distribution system and may be concurrent with power supplies to other equipment such as traffic signals or intelligent transportation system (ITS) equipment. General electrical system design shall follow the requirements of the WSDOT Roadside Power Distribution Manual available from https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/traffic-illumination-trafficsignals-and-intelligent-transportation-systems-its. Electrical systems may not be owned and maintained by multiple agencies. For example, one agency cannot own the lights and poles with a second agency owning the boxes, conduit, wiring, and service cabinets. The entirety of each electrical system must be owned and maintained by a single agency and designed to that agency’s standards.
1040.11(3)(a) Basic Circuit Layout Where four or more luminaires are installed, there shall be at least two lighting circuits to provide a minimum level of system redundancy. Where circuits are split, they shall be split so that a separate circuit is on each side of the roadway. For larger systems, they shall be split into a minimum of quadrants based on the interchange or intersection configuration or based on the service cabinet location if there is not an interchange or intersection. See Exhibit 1040-48 for basic circuit arrangements. Circuits are designated starting at the lowest SRMP on the increasing MP side of the highway, continuing in the increasing MP direction on that side of the highway first, then continuing at the lowest SRMP location on the decreasing MP side of the highway and continuing in the increasing MP direction on that side. Where two highways intersect, use the higher classification highway (such as the freeway and not the crossing highway or the US Highway over the State Highway).

Exhibit 1040-48 Basic Lighting Circuit Divisions
WSDOT does not use adaptive lighting systems due to the design of the lighting systems and their typically linear nature, rather than being spread out over more of a grid system, and standard luminaires do not include photocell sockets. To allow for management of continuous lighting systems, lighting that is needed to cover basic required lighting design areas shall be installed on separate circuits from any additional lighting, such that lighting beyond the basic required may be switched off as needed without compromising minimum lighting requirements.
1040.11(3)(b) Conduits, Junction Boxes, and Vaults The basic power distribution system is composed of conduits and junction boxes or vaults. For the purposes of this section, the term box is used for all junction box types including in-ground standard duty and heavy-duty junction boxes and both surface and concrete embedded NEMA junction boxes, and the term vault is used for all closed-bottom in-ground pull boxes and cable vaults. Small cable vaults cannot be used for electrical distribution, and standard cable vaults are rarely if ever used for power distribution.

Box and vault spacing depends on the nearby equipment and the geometry of the conduit runs connected to them. Basic box and vault spacing is as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
A box or vault is required within 10 feet (5 feet is preferable) of any light standard and within 5 feet of any system connected cabinet (includes service and transformer cabinets). Boxes or vaults are required within 10 feet of a transition to or from barrier (bridge rail, cast in place barrier, etc.) on both sides of the transition. The box on the structure side of the transition may be adjusted to fit barrier joint spacing. Coordination with the WSDOT Bridge office is required. Basic spacing between boxes and vaults is 200 feet for all box types, including structure mounted and barrier embedded boxes. In-ground and surface mounted box spacing may be increased to 300 feet between boxes where the conduit path does not include more than a total of 30 degrees of bends. This does not include the 90degree conduit sweeps into the boxes themselves. This also applies to any conduit run connecting a box to a vault. Vault spacing may be increased to 750 feet between vaults where the conduit path does not include more than a total of 30 degrees of bends. Extended vault spacing of 1000 feet may not be used for power circuits. This spacing is restricted to fiber-optic or copper communications lines only.
Conduit sizes are limited to full inch sizes, with certain limited exceptions. Locations where specific conduit sizes are allowed or required include:
•
•
•
1-inch conduit is required between the light standard foundation and its supplying box or vault, due to limitations on the size of conduit entering the foundation and to ensure proper operation of the fused disconnect in slip-base light standards. ¾-inch rigid or flexible conduit may be used for the connection between a wall or ceiling mounted luminaire and its supplying box. All other conduits shall be at least 2-inch diameter or larger, unless otherwise approved by maintenance.
1040.12 Documentation Lighting design documentation includes the lighting analysis, line loss calculations, conduit fill calculations, and any associated breaker schedule calculations (for either service or transformer cabinets). Document justification for inclusion of any additional illumination, such as continuous illumination and illumination that is only recommended or to be considered. Maintenance approval, when required, may be an e-mail or memo from the Region Signal Maintenance Supervisor/Superintendent. Retain all elements in the Design File and the Design Documentation Package. Provide electronic copies (both AGI and PDF format) of the lighting analysis to the HQ Traffic office for tracking and record-keeping purposes. It is recommended that documentation be made available to the Region Signal Maintenance Office, in electronic (PDF) format, as an additional record-keeping resource. Refer to Chapter 300 for design documentation requirements.

1050.01 General Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have the potential to reduce crashes and increase mobility of transportation facilities. They also enhance productivity through the use of advanced communications technologies and their integration into vehicles and the transportation infrastructure. These systems involve a broad range of wireless and wire line communications-based information, electronics, or information processing technologies. Some of these technologies include cameras, variable message signs, ramp meters, road weather information systems, highway advisory radios, traffic management centers, and adaptive signal control technology (ASCT). ASCT is a traffic signal system that detects traffic conditions and adjusts signal timing remotely in response. More information on ASCT can be found at: www.fhwa.dot.gov/everydaycounts/technology/adsc The purpose and direction of ITS for the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) can be found in the Statewide Intelligent Transportation Systems Plan, which is available upon request from the Headquarters (HQ) Traffic Operations Office. The plan identifies the current and long-term ITS needs to meet the objectives identified in Moving Washington, WSDOT’s program to fight traffic congestion. The Statewide ITS Plan is a comprehensive document that discusses:
•
•
•
•
•
•
The history of ITS deployment in Washington. How ITS meets WSDOT’s transportation vision and goals. The current state of ITS deployment. WSDOT’s near-term ITS plans. How projects are prioritized. What long-term ITS issues WSDOT needs to begin planning for.
Due to the dynamic nature of ITS, printed guidance is soon outdated. Detailed design guidance and current practices are located on the following websites.

1050.03 Systems Engineering Systems engineering is a typical part of any ITS project development process. It is required on any federal-aid project that has an ITS work element, per 23 CFR 940.11. Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary step-by-step process for complex projects (such as ITS projects) to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Assess a system’s needs and its relationship to the regional architecture. Plan a project that meets those needs as well as stakeholder needs and expectations. Define other specific requirements for the project/system. Develop and implement the project/system. Define the operations and maintenance requirements for the system. Plan for the refinement or replacement of the system.
Using systems engineering on ITS projects has been shown to increase the likelihood of a project’s success. A successful project is one that meets the project scope and stakeholder/ project sponsor expectations, is completed on time and within budget, and is efficient and cost-effective to operate and maintain. The level of systems engineering used for a project should be on a scale commensurate with the scope, cost, and risk of the project. Complete the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Systems Engineering Analysis Worksheet in Exhibit 1050-2, or a document with the same information, for all federal-aid projects that include ITS elements. Completing the Worksheet will meet the minimum requirements in 23 CFR 940.11 for systems engineering, determine the project’s risk, and determine if a more in-depth systems engineering analysis is required. The Worksheet and the four systems engineering documents outlined below are to be completed with coordination between the project engineer and region Traffic Engineer. As shown in the Worksheet, a more in-depth analysis requires that the following four documents be completed and used to implement the project. These documents are produced as the result of the steps in the systems engineering process. 1. Concept of Operations: This document defines the problem, the project’s goals, stakeholder needs and expectations, constraints, and the way the ITS system is required to operate and be maintained. 2. System Requirements: This document contains specifications of what the system is required to do, how well it is required to do it, and under what conditions. These requirements are based on the goals, stakeholder needs and expectations, constraints, and operation and maintenance requirements documented in the Concept of Operations. 3. System Verification Plan: This document describes how the agency will verify that the system being built meets the requirements in the System Requirements document. The agency will implement the System Verification Plan to ensure all system requirements are verified before it accepts the system.

Chapter 1050
Intelligent Transportation Systems
4. System Validation Plan: This document describes how the agency will assess the system’s performance against the goals, stakeholder needs and expectations, constraints, and operation and maintenance requirements documented in the Concept of Operations. The goal is for the agency to understand and review the strengths and weaknesses of the system and identify any new opportunities and needs if appropriate. The agency will implement the System Validation Plan after it accepts the system. This evaluation sets the stage for the next time the system/project is changed or expanded.

As each phase of an ITS project is completed, a report is to be submitted by the Project Engineer to the region Traffic Engineer describing how the project is meeting the requirements outlined in the above systems engineering plans. Approvals for ITS projects are dependent upon project complexity and cost. (See Chapter 300 for ITS project approval requirements.) Systems engineering costs are to be estimated and incorporated into the construction engineering (CE) and project engineering (PE) portions of the construction estimate. For further project development guidance related to procurement and administration of Federal-Aid Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) contracts, see Section 1050.04.
1050.03(1) Systems Engineering Process “V” Diagram The systems engineering process contains a number of steps that are not included in a traditional project delivery process. The systems engineering process is often referred to as the “V” diagram (see Exhibit 1050-1). An ITS project begins on the left side of the “V” and progresses down the left side and then up the right side. Then the project is evaluated by validating and verifying the elements on the right side of the “V” with the elements on the left side. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and WSDOT are in agreement that, for project development and delivery, the most critical portions of the systems engineering process are the Concept of Operations; System Requirements; System Verification; and System Validation. As a result, the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Systems Engineering Analysis Worksheet in Exhibit 1050-2 is focused on these core areas.

1050.04 FHWA Washington Division ITS Project Contracting Guidance 1050.04(1) Purpose The purpose of this document is to provide basic guidance related to the procurement and administration of Federal-Aid ITS contracts.
1050.04(2) Scope This document is intended to be used by the FHWA Washington Division Office, WSDOT, and local agencies as a guide on the proper types of procurement methods for various types of ITS projects. This guidance is not allencompassing, as ITS projects can vary significantly in scope. However, it should provide adequate information to address a majority of situations. Specific questions about an individual ITS project should be directed to the Washington Division Office.
1050.04(3) Construction versus Non-Construction ITS improvements may be incorporated as part of a traditional federal-aid construction contract, or the contracting agency may elect to procure ITS services under a separate contract (i.e., stand-alone ITS projects). When procured as a separate contract, the scope of an ITS contract will determine the applicability of federal procurement requirements. Title 23 United States Code 101(a)(4) provides a broad definition for construction for federal-aid eligibility purposes. FHWA generally interprets the definition broadly, resulting in many types of projects being classified as construction.

Chapter 1050
Intelligent Transportation Systems
Very simply, a contract that incurs costs incidental to the construction or reconstruction of a highway, including improvements that directly facilitate and control traffic flow (e.g., traffic control systems) are by definition construction contracts. This includes rehabilitation of an existing physical ITS infrastructure. Construction contracts must follow the regulatory requirements of 23 CFR 635 or 23 CFR 636 in the case of Design-Build. Non-construction-type ITS contracts will be either Engineering Contracts or Service Contracts. Engineering is defined as professional services of an engineering nature as defined by state law. If the ITS contract primarily involves engineering, then qualifications-based selection (QBS) procedures, in compliance with the Brooks Act, must be followed. Service contracts (non-construction, non-engineering in nature) are to be procured in accordance with the Common Rule for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to States and Local Governments found at 49 CFR 18.36.
1050.04(4) Types of ITS Projects Stand-alone ITS projects can generally be categorized into one of the following types of ITS projects: (1) planning/research, (2) preliminary engineering/project development, (3) software development/system integration, (4) system deployments, (5) traditional construction, and (6) operations and maintenance. All Federal-Aid ITS projects, regardless of the type, are directed in 23 CFR 940 to follow a systems engineering process. Exhibit 1050-3 provides further information about each of these ITS project types.
1050.05 Documentation Include all ITS systems engineering documentation in the Design Documentation Package (DDP). All systems engineering documentation requires region Traffic Engineer approval.

Additional systems engineering documents (Concept of Operations, System Requirements, Verification Plan, and Validation Plan)[2] are recommended.[1]
Additional systems engineering documents (Concept of Operations, System Requirements, Verification Plan, and Validation Plan)[2] are required.
Notes: [1] A decision not to complete the additional systems engineering documents for high-risk projects that have less than $1,000,000 of ITS elements requires FHWA concurrence prior to submitting a construction authorization request. [2] See definitions in Section 1050.03. [3] Use the amount from question 4. What is the name of the regional ITS architecture and which portions of the architecture will be implemented? Is the project consistent with the architecture? Are revisions to the architecture required? Also, which user services, physical subsystem elements, information flows, and market/service packages will be completed, and how will these pieces be part of the architecture? Click here to enter text. Identify the participating agencies, their roles and responsibilities, and the concept of operations. For the elements and market/service packages to be implemented, define the high-level operations of the system. This includes where the system will be used, its performance parameters, its life cycle, and who will operate and maintain it. Discuss the established requirements or agreements on information sharing and traffic device control responsibilities. The regional ITS architecture operational concept is a good starting point for discussion. If this is a high-risk project and a more extensive Concept of Operations document is being prepared for this project (see question 7), this answer can be a simple reference to that document.

Define the system requirements. Based on the concept of operations, define the “what” and not the “how” of the system. Define the detailed requirements for eventual detailed design. The applicable high-level functional requirements from the regional architecture are a good starting point for discussion. A review of the requirements by the project stakeholders is recommended. If this is a high-risk project, and a more extensive System Requirements document is being prepared for this project (see question 7), this answer can be a simple reference to that document. Click here to enter text. Provide an analysis of alternative system configurations and technology options to meet requirements. This analysis should outline the strengths and weaknesses, technical feasibility, institutional compatibility, and life cycle costs of each alternative. The project stakeholders should have had input in choosing the preferred solution. Click here to enter text. Identify procurement/contracting options. Since there are different procurement methods for different types of projects, the decision regarding the best procurement option should consider the level of agency participation, compatibility with existing procurement methods, the role of the system integrator, and life cycle costs. Some options to consider include: consultant design/low-bid contractor, systems manager, systems integrator, task order, and design/build. If the ITS portions of the project significantly meet the definition of construction, then construction by low-bid contract would be used. Non-construction ITS portions of the project, such as services for software development, systems integration, systems deployment, systems management, or design, will be either engineering or service contracts. In these cases, a qualifications-based selection (QBS) or best value procurement may be more appropriate. For guidance on procurement options for ASCT systems, refer to Pages 15-20 of USDOT’s Model Systems Engineering Documents for Adaptive Signal Control Technology (ASCT) Systems, FHWA-HOP-11-027, . Click here to enter text. Identify the applicable ITS standards and testing procedures. Include documentation on which standards will be incorporated into the system design. Also, include justification for any applicable standards not incorporated. The standards discussion in the regional architecture is a good starting point for discussion. Click here to enter text. Outline the procedures and resources necessary for operations and management of the system. In addition to the concept of operations, document any internal policies or procedures necessary to recognize and incorporate the new system into the current operations and decision-making processes. Also, resources necessary to support continued operations, including staffing and training, must be recognized early and be provided for. Such resources must also be provided to support necessary maintenance and upkeep to ensure continued system viability. Click here to enter text.

Worker Fall Protection
1060.01 General 1060.02 Design Criteria 1060.03 Design Solutions 1060.04 Documentation 1060.05 References
1060.01 General During the design phase, evaluate worker fall protection issues related to eventual maintenance and operations activities that will be required in the final, constructed configuration, determined through consultation with responsible region and HQ maintenance, landscape restoration and/or monitoring, and other WSDOT staff that require long term access to a site (see Chapter 301). Examples of activities to include in this evaluation include routine facility upkeep, debris removal, and planting maintenance. Although it provides advantages to those engaged in maintenance activities, it is often not feasible to eliminate, through design, situations where workers will be in close proximity to the kind of drops or steep slopes described in WAC 296-880. Therefore, evaluate the need for, and the feasibility of, permanent passive systems, such as physical barriers, rails, and covers. Where installation of a passive system is not practicable, provide permanent anchors that workers can use in combination with personal fall restraint or fall arrest systems.
1060.02 Design Criteria Design and install permanent fall protection in accordance with WAC 296-880-20005 and 40005 under the following conditions:
•
•
•
along constructed features within the project limits that are a vertical face or steep slope, defined as one upon which normal footing cannot be maintained without the use of devices due to the pitch of the surface, weather conditions, or surface material (normally 3H:1V and steeper unless more detailed information can be documented), and where maintenance, operations, or environmental staff have indicated that there will be regular, periodic, or sporadic maintenance or operations activities required during the service life of the installation, and where staff are engaged in these activities and are subject to a potential fall 4 feet or more, and access to the top of the feature is intended solely for the use of maintenance, operations or environmental personnel.
Note that if the location is intended to be used by the public, provide fall protection in accordance with Chapter 1510, Pedestrian Facilities instead.
1060.02(1) Fall Protection Treatment Selection for Vertical Faces For vertical faces that meet the above conditions, install a fall protection rail (referred to as a “guardrail system” in WAC 296-880-40005). Where a fall protection rail is not feasible, or maintenance, operations, or environmental personnel have indicated that a fall protection rail is not desired because of the nature of the work or site-specific conditions, provide permanent anchorage points instead. A permanent anchorage point is defined as a secure point of attachment for lifelines, lanyards, or deceleration devices which is capable of withstanding the forces specified in WAC 296-880-40020; examples include vehicle barriers, or features designed and installed to serve specifically as anchorages.

Chapter 1060
Worker Fall Protection
In situations where it’s determined that neither fall protection rail nor permanent anchorage point(s) are feasible, then installation of permanent fall protection is not required, and instead temporary fall protection measures will be provided in the future each time worker activity is performed.
1060.02(2) Fall Protection Treatment Selection for Steep Slopes At the top of steep slopes that will require staff to perform ongoing maintenance, determine whether there are any locations for which temporary fall protection measures will be insufficient or are infeasible. If so, install permanent anchorage points (as defined above) that are located and designed to serve the ongoing maintenance activity.
1060.03 Design Solutions Allowable fall rail systems are:
•
•
•
•
Wire rope railing with top and intermediate rails of ½-inch-diameter steel wire rope, or Steel pipe railing with 1½-inch nominal outside diameter pipe as posts and top and intermediate rails, or A custom chain link fence design, or Concrete traffic barrier as an extension of the height of the retaining wall.
Design fall protection rail to be 42 inches high, plus or minus 3 inches, measured from the top of the finished grade, and capable of withstanding a 200 lb force applied at the top of the system, from any direction, while allowing no more than the maximum deflection provided in WAC 296-880-40005(g)(ii). Except for traffic barrier designs, provide an intermediate cable or rail halfway between the top rail and the finished grade, a toe board with a minimum height of 4 inches, and post spacing no more than 8 feet on center. A toe board may be omitted if persons are not expected to be working or passing below the rail. Fabricate permanent fall protection rail systems using galvanized steel and locate them no further than 3 feet from the protected edge. Where a rail system is co-located with a vehicle barrier, locate the system outside the deflection distance for the barrier shown in Exhibit 1610-3. Where it’s been established that anchorages are required, determined anchor point locations and project specific designs in consultation with region and/or landscape maintenance staff, HQ Bridge, and HQ Geotechnical Offices to develop project specific designs. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for design details for any retrofit to an existing retaining wall and for any attachments to a new retaining wall. Refer to the WSDOT Construction Manual for more information about the process for determining the need for fall protection during project construction.

1100.01 General (Section Rewritten 2023) The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is committed to context- appropriate, functional, accessible, and complete active transportation networks. WSDOT’s goal is to optimize existing system capacity and safety and reduce the environmental impacts of the transportation system by encouraging and supporting a full array of modal choices. To accomplish this goal and to meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities, WSDOT works with community partners to identify changes needed across all jurisdictions to improve safety, mobility, and connectivity for active transportation users. The design process accounts for the fact that 100% of Washingtonians use active transportation at some point during their trip whether walking to a transit hub or from a parked car to the store, bicycling to work, or rolling home from a ferry terminal. Active transportation facilities designed in alignment with industry practice contribute to the safety and mobility of all roadway users and ongoing development of a truly multimodal network. A performance-based, practical design approach is used to guide the WSDOT design process, utilizing appropriate performance metrics, stakeholder input, and agency risk management practices to establish the most effective design. This chapter provides an overview of practical solutions, practical design and the different elements that are examined and documented in design decisions.
1100.01(1) Design and Pre-design Phase (New Section 2023) Preliminary Engineering, also known as project design phase, begins after a project is scoped. In some cases, a pre-design phase may be initiated to refine or validate project scope, schedule and budget for projects identified to have, or are likely to have, design element changes. The work described in Chapter 1100 – 1106 may take place during this pre-design phase and the decisions and analyses conducted are documented in an update to the Project Summary (CPDM approval), and in the Basis of Design (See Exhibit 300-2). Once the Basis of Design has been completed and approved along with an updated estimate, the pre-design phase is concluded, and the design phase begins. Separate instructions for pre-design are available and occasionally updated to provide additional guidance to region staff. Contact HQ Design for more information. When design element(s) are expected to change and a BOD is typically required, exemptions from a pre-design phase can be approved by the ASDE.

Design Process
1100.01(2) Responsibilities (New Section 2023) The Project Engineer or region designee assigned to the project is responsible for carrying out the design process in accordance with policies and guidance in this manual. Furthermore, the Project Engineer or region designee is accountable for deliverables and decisions made during that process, and overseeing the required work in accordance with their professional responsibilities per RCW 18-43. The Project Engineer or region designee is supported by the members of their project and advisory teams (see Section 1100.04(2)), as well as other subject matter experts and administrative staff throughout the agency or under contract who contribute and participate in accordance with their own professional and legal responsibilities.
1100.02 Design Principles 1100.02(1) Practical Solutions The Practical Solutions approach prioritizes innovative, timely, and cost-effective decisions that are made in coordination with stakeholders and partners. It considers each situation and encourages incremental, flexible, and sustainable investment decisions by focusing on identified performance needs and engaging stakeholders at the right time. Practical Solutions is applicable to everything the agency does, including the way programs and services are administered, managed, planned, programmed, designed, constructed, operated, and maintained. It is a performance-based approach to transportation and organizational decision making (see Executive Order (EO) E 1090.01 for more information). It is specifically reflected in the processes and procedures described in this Chapter, and the Basis of Design documentation template. It is also a data-driven approach that uses tools, data analytics, performance measures, and stakeholder input to (1) seek lower-cost approaches and efficiencies in expanding and operating the multimodal transportation system to reduce travel demand and the need for building costly new infrastructure, (2) identify, evaluate, analyze, and manage risk to WSDOT’s strategic objectives, and (3) identify and implement agency efficiencies. Practical Solutions includes one or a combination of strategies, including, but not limited to, Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO), off-system solutions, Transportation Demand Management (TDM), and incremental strategic capital solutions. The goal is to identify and solve needs and problems as quickly and cost-effectively as possible.
1100.02(2) Safe System Approach (New Section 2023) The Safe System Approach to road safety is a holistic approach based on the following elements: safe roads, safe speeds, safe vehicles, safe road users, and post-crash care. In the Safe System Approach, WSDOT has a primary responsibility of road infrastructure planning, design, and operations. This includes speed management, multimodal context-sensitive geometric design, traffic systems management and operations, roadside features and road user actions affected by road infrastructure design and operations (such as signage, lighting, and striping), and the safety management systems that support analysis and decision making. Within these elements, the Safe System Approach applies the following principles:
•
•
Eliminate death and serious injuries: While no crashes of any type are desirable, the Safe System Approach prioritizes elimination of crashes that result in death and serious injuries. Support safe road use: Road users will inevitably make mistakes that can lead to crashes. The transportation system and vehicles can be designed and operated to reduce the injury outcomes from those errors. A forgiving system accommodates reasonable and predictable human limitations and behavior (such as diligence, perception, and attention). Roads that are developed in this manner as

•

•
Design Process
“self- enforcing and self-explaining roads” make it more difficult for errors to occur, and when the errors do occur, they result in fewer fatal and serious injuries. Reduce large crash forces: Road users have limits for tolerating crash forces before death or serious injury occurs. Therefore, it is important within the Safe System Approach to manage the transfer of kinetic energy through adoption of design and operational elements that account for and reduce crash speeds and impact angles to be within survivable limits. Responsibility is shared: All stakeholders (such as transportation system designers, managers, road users, vehicle manufacturers, and policy makers) commit to reducing fatal and serious injury crashes and to working together. The focus is placed on the larger context and network of contributing factors and characteristics from which traffic death and serious injury arise, instead of the individual road users. Strengthen all parts: All parts of the transportation system are strengthened to reinforce each other so that if one part fails, the other parts still protect road users. In this way redundancy is provided for the elements that make up the safe system. Safety is proactive: Proactive (systemic safety) approaches address context, contributing factors, and crash types and help to reduce the potential for fatal and serious injury crashes. These approaches complement traditional, reactive crash reduction programs that focus on individual sites and segments with a history of observed crashes using the methods outlined by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Highway Safety Manual.
1100.02(2)(a) Safe System Roles and Responsibilities (New Section 2023) Executive order E1085.01 directs WSDOT executives and employees to incorporate the Safe System Approach into WSDOT practices to align with the Safe System Approach to road safety. Implementing the Safe System approach includes:
•
•
•
•
•
Working collaboratively with internal and external safety stakeholders to analyze safety performance and develop strategies that move us toward zero fatal and serious injury crashes. Aligning and maintaining a quantitative approach to analysis across project development functions that complies with the intent, methods, and tools defined by the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual, where they are practicable. Incorporating an equity analysis in accordance with findings from modal crash data and the environmental justice requirements of the Healthy Environment for All (HEAL) Act. Prioritizing design and operational decisions that support safety for all users based on the context of the road, particularly in locations affected by legacy state transportation facilities and where gaps in walking and biking facilities exist, as outlined by the Active Transportation Plan. Explicitly identifying and addressing a project’s expected effects on crash exposure and network connectivity for vulnerable road users. This acts to prevent increased exposure to fatal and serious injury crashes through needed multimodal facility and operational improvements. Where prevention is not possible, provide mitigation to reduce crash severity and propose future solutions to further reduce exposure.
1100.03 Complete Streets (New Section 2023) Projects with Complete Streets are designed and operated to promote use and mobility for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, or transit riders. Complete Streets prioritizes more comfortable and equitable, context sensitive network connectivity for all roadway users through close coordination with our local partners and stakeholders. This is aligned with WSDOT’s policy and commitment to develop and maintain an interconnected and integrated multimodal transportation system that provides all Washington travelers with reasonably safe, WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1100-3
Chapter 1100
Design Process
sustainable, and equitable access. A project is determined to have complete streets need, and may incorporate complete streets elements, when identified through a screening process (see Section 1103.03(3)).
1100.03(1) Goals and Objectives (New Section 2023) WSDOT complete streets designs are developed in cooperation with the affected community through community engagement to accomplish the following:
•
•
•
•
•
Address unique Complete Streets concerns of overburdened communities. Address active transportation network gaps that have been identified through a WSDOT or local plan and/or through community engagement. Provide bicycle and pedestrian facilities that offer the required Level of Traffic Stress and Route Directness Index (See Chapter 1101 and Section 1231.05). Provide a separation from vehicular traffic that involves a vertical element when it is determined that a posted speed must be maintained at greater than 30 mph (see Chapter 1510, Chapter 1520). Provide adequate access to transit, including specific improvements for bicycles and pedestrians in High-Capacity Transit areas (refer to the WSDOT HCT Improvements Guide for more information).
Evaluate the use of Transportation System Management and Operations (or TSMO) solutions first to address project related needs, before committing to capital or constructed improvements.
1100.03(2) Complete Streets Teams (New Section 2023) Region Complete Streets (or CS) Teams provide multidisciplinary, subject matter expertise input throughout project development of Complete Streets strategies and designs through their participation in planning, scoping, pre-design, design phases. CS Teams bring together staff with active transportation expertise and other knowledge relevant to complete streets from disciplines that may include, but are not limited to, region planning, public transportation, active transportation, transportation operations, transportation safety, engineering services/project development, maintenance, programming, construction, and communications. WSDOT Headquarters (HQ) staff with appropriate expertise may be called upon to supplement region teams as needed. Region CS Teams have specific responsibilities when working as members of a project advisory team (see Section 1100.04(2))
1100.03(3) Project Screening (New Section 2023) Complete streets requirements are normally determined during a screening process that takes place in advance of project design or pre-design. New projects of all types with a total project cost of $500,000 or more are subject to this screening process to determine whether the project will be designed and developed as a complete street or deferred in alignment with established processes. This screening process accounts for whether projects are in incorporated cities, in other designated population centers (See WSDOT Population Centers Map) where active transportation gaps have been identified in WSDOT or local plans, or in population centers that are overburdened communities, designating those projects for complete streets design unless a documented justification to defer is approved by the Region Administrator or designee (see Section 1104.05. Note that complete streets screening also applies to projects on state limited access highways, on city streets that are not designated as state highway that pass through a state limited access facility (e.g., overpasses and underpasses), and on state routes within counties.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1100-4
Chapter 1100
Design Process
1100.03(4) Project Organization (New Section 2023) Once a project has met the requirements of the screening process described above, that project incorporates a Complete Streets need into the design process per Section 1101.03 unless otherwise deferred by the Regional Administrator or designee. If Complete Streets needs are incorporated into a project, a Basis of Design is developed per Section 1100.05(1) unless approved by the ASDE. Complete streets projects generally proceed using the process laid out in this chapter and the chapters that follow. Any differences in process or other requirements compared to other project types are called out in the appropriate guidance sections.
1100.04 Practical Design Practical design is the design phase component of practical solutions, addressing the transportation-related need that’s identified or evolves during the planning, scoping or design phase of a project. Practical design is data driven, employing performance metrics to seek low-cost approaches and efficiencies in expanding and operating the multimodal transportation system to reduce travel demand and the need for building costly new infrastructure that are identified in collaboration with other agencies, communities, and stakeholders. The objective is to identify low-cost solutions that meet the need(s), while considering benefits to the system as a whole and the role of incremental solutions as a way to address uncertainties identified in future scenarios. The Basis of Design (BOD) is a template for the process WSDOT uses to document the practical design approach and may be employed during the project scoping, pre-design, or design phase. The process consists of the following seven steps: 1. Assemble a project advisory team as needed (see Section 1100.04(2). 2. Clearly identify the baseline need. Define it in terms of performance, contributing factors, and underlying reasons for the baseline need (see Chapter 1101). 3. Identify the land use and transportation context (which includes environmental use and constraints) for the location (see Chapter 1102). 4. Select design controls compatible with the context (see Chapter 1103). 5. Formulate and evaluate potential alternatives, including TSMO strategies, that resolve the baseline need for the selected context and design controls (see Chapter 1104). 6. Select design elements that will be included in the alternatives (see Chapter 1105). 7. Determine design element dimensions consistent with performance needs, context, and design controls (see Chapter 1106). See Section 1100.05(1) for more information about the BOD.
1100.04(1) Community Engagement WSDOT staff engages the community affected by a project in order to inform decision-making, strengthen partnerships, increase credibility, and drive priorities. Community input informs the project development process from planning to design. Engaging with the community helps us more fully understand:

•
Performance issues and gaps Context identity Local environmental issues Modal priorities and needs

Chapter 1100
Design Process
Refer to Chapter 210 Public Engagement and the WSDOT Community Engagement Plan for more information, and document the findings of community engagement efforts (see Section 1100.05(5)).
1100.04(2) Project and Advisory Teams Collaborative decisions contribute to more successful delivery of the project. Engage external and internal stakeholders providing consent-based outcomes early in project development. Once a Project Engineer and Project Team have been identified to lead the project development, an Advisory Team is convened by them with the appropriate subject matter expertise to inform design decision-making. In the case of a Complete Streets project, also consult region Complete Streets Team.
1100.04(3) Need and Performance Identification The need for the project is the primary reason the project has been programmed at the location. Determine performance metrics and targets based on an assessment of this project’s specific need, and other contextual needs developed through external partner and community engagement. Perform a contributing factors analysis that refines the identified need so more precise performance gaps and metrics can be identified. Include the specified baseline needs and the metrics associated with Complete Streets when applicable (see Chapter 1101). Refer to Chapter 1101 and the Performance Based Design guidance document for more information: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/design/ASDE/Practical_Design.pdf
1100.04(4) Context Determination Context determination refers to the characteristics, activities, and functions within a geographical area. WSDOT’s context determination process involves two interrelated topics: land use and transportation, referencing both the existing and future conditions. Chapter 1102 provides guidance for determining context.
1100.04(5) Design Control Selection Design controls provide fundamental constraints for highway design. Five design controls are used to help guide design decisions:
•
•
•
•
•
Design Year Modal Priority (except for Complete Streets projects) Access Control Design Speed Terrain Classification
Chapter 1103 presents guidance related to choosing design controls.
1100.04(6) Alternative Formulation and Evaluation The goal during the design phase is to carry out the scope identified from pre-design or develop a solution that addresses the baseline need at the lowest cost. Other known or identified needs, termed “contextual needs”, can be addressed in these solutions as well. Chapter 1101 provides a discussion on baseline and contextual needs, and Chapter 1104 discusses using these needs to develop and evaluate alternatives, as well as the role of the CS Team in alternatives development for Complete Streets. When formulating solutions, provide alternatives that employs lower-cost approaches such as Transportation Systems Management and Operations (or TSMO). TSMO alternatives will address all or part of the baseline need
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1100-6
Chapter 1100
Design Process
and provide efficiencies that benefit multimodal transportation, reduce vehicle travel demand, while reducing the need for building costly new infrastructure. In some cases, work performed during planning will identify strategies that can help guide the development of TSMO alternative(s). The Alternative Strategies and Solutions subsection of the Guidance Documents discusses primary TSMO strategies and examples of solutions within those strategies. Direct link to the Design Support Webpage Direct link to the Guidance Documents Direct link to Transportation Systems Management and Operations
1100.04(7) Design Element Selection and Dimensions The selection of design elements is based entirely on the alternative selected to address the baseline need while balancing performance trade-offs. Chapter 1105 provides instruction for design element selection. Chapter 1106 provides information related to choosing dimensions for design elements.
1100.05 Documentation Tools Basis of Design (BOD), Basis of Estimate (BOE), Design Parameter Sheets, and Alternative Comparison Tables are all documentation tools used to record decisions and analyses needed in development of a solution that is consistent with WSDOT’s practical design approach. The tools can be found at: Design guidance & support | WSDOT (wa.gov)
1100.05(1) Basis of Design The BOD organizes information around the practical design procedural steps (see Section 1100.04) necessary to support WSDOT’s practical design approach. It provides a template for documenting each step in the process. The BOD includes the following information and sections:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Planning Document Summary General Project Information Section 1 – Project Needs Section 2 – Context Section 3 – Design Controls Section 4 – Alternatives Analysis Section 5 – Design Element Selection
Exhibit 1100-1 shows the major activities associated with WSDOT’s practical design approach and corresponding Design Manual chapters and Basis of Design sections. Start compiling the BOD as early as possible. During planning or scoping, a BOD may be only partially completed. Information documented on the BOD provides an opportunity for greater consistency between strategies developed in planning and solutions developed in scoping and design. Information documented in the BOD comes through use of consent-based recommendations (see Section 1100.04(2)). Contact the region Program Management regarding the need to initiate a BOD during the project-scoping phase. Since the BOD is ultimately a document that supports design decisions, the approval of a BOD, which ideally takes place at 30% design level or earlier, is a part of, and included in, the project Design Approval process (see
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1100-7
Chapter 1100
Design Process
Chapter 300). Note that if a BOD has been prepared for a project and no design elements were changed, ASDE approval of the BOD is not required. Basis of Design: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/design-tools-and-support#Tools
1100.05(1)(a) Basis of Design Exemptions See Section 1100.04 for guidance regarding when a BOD is required for scoping projects. For design-phase projects, a BOD supports design decisions and is required on all projects where one or more design elements are changed (see Chapter 1105). The need for a Basis of Design (BOD) may be waived, if the only design elements changed by a project are listed below, or the changed elements are described and documented in an approved intersection control evaluation (ICE) or crash analysis report (CAR), with approval of the Assistant State Design Engineer (ASDE).

In any request from the ASDE for an exemption, describe how the circumstances presented by the project make a BOD unnecessary. Only ICE or CAR documents that describe the project need(s), alternatives considered, and performance tradeoffs used in the alternative selection will be considered documentation suitable to support a BOD exemption. Each request is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Note that if the project is a preservation program project, a Basis of Design is not required if the only design elements changed are listed in Chapter 1120, and the criteria/guidance provided in Chapter 1120 is followed. This exemption does not require approval and is documented in the DDP.
1100.05(2) Basis of Estimate A Basis of Estimate is required for all project estimates and is updated throughout all phases of project development. Refer to the Cost Estimating Manual for WSDOT Projects for additional information on estimating and the Basis of Estimate.
1100.05(3) Alternatives Comparison Table The Alternative Comparison Table (ACT) provides solutions evaluated in accordance with WSDOT’s Practical Solutions approach. This table allows comparison of alternatives to identify the optimum solution. The table enables discussions of performance trade-offs. The Alternative Comparison Table is incorporated in Section 4 of the BOD form.
1100.05(4) Design Parameter Sheets When a Basis of Design has been completed, prepare Design Parameter Sheets that document the dimensions selected for the various design elements chosen, and as also noted in Section 5 of the Basis of Design.

1101.01 General Practical design starts with identification of issues associated with the performance of a transportation facility. A need is defined as a performance gap that is used to guide the development of design alternatives to be considered for the project. The process typically starts in the planning phase or during project scoping, when the needs are identified that must be addressed by the project. These needs are typically associated with larger agency objectives, such as safety, economic vitality, equitable access, state of good repair, etc., and become the baseline need(s) for the project. Other needs related to the project location will emerge in advance or during alternatives development, and these are called contextual needs. Contributing factors analysis can be used to improve the accuracy and precision of need statements that guide the development of performance metrics and targets. This chapter provides:
•
•
•
•
Instruction on the different types of needs—baseline and contextual. A method to diagnose and analyze the contributing factors of the identified need. Instruction on how to determine performance metrics and targets for each of the identified needs. How to develop project need statements.
Decisions about project related needs, metrics, targets, and related activities described in this chapter are all performed and documented as a coordinated exercise led by the Project Team in consultation with the Advisory Team (see Section 1100.04(2)).
1101.02 Baseline Needs A baseline need is the primary reason a project has been proposed at a location. The baseline need usually evolves from a WSDOT planning and/or priority programming process. There can be more than one baseline need such as when an agency partners with WSDOT on a project and the partner’s need becomes another baseline need. Example: A local agency desires to fund a revitalization project for a community bordering a state highway. The local agency’s baseline need in this case is the local land use’s economic vitality. If WSDOT also happens to have a prioritized and funded baseline need at the same location, and the two parties decide to partner in a combined project, that project will have at least two baseline needs. The two parties will work to develop solutions compatible for both baseline needs. Develop project need statements for each identified baseline need (see Section 1101.05). To determine, develop, and refine the project’s baseline need(s) and finalize the associated need statement(s), examine the conditions surrounding the original project identification, which was completed in the priority programming phase, and apply contributing factors analysis (see Section 1101.04). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1101-1
Chapter 1101
Need Identification
After developing and refining the baseline need(s), define the baseline performance metrics. See Section 1101.04) and determine the baseline need targets (see Section 1101.04(3).
1101.03 Complete Streets Needs Projects that are required to incorporate Complete Streets, following the screening process described in Section 1104.04(1), are assumed to have a “Complete Streets need” in addition to the baseline need and contextual needs.
1101.04 Baseline Performance Metrics Baseline performance metrics are those “measurables” used to check that the project satisfies the need(s). Baseline performance metrics are also used in the development of the project need statement. Project alternatives must address the identified baseline performance metric(s). Performance metrics are used in the priority programming process to screen the full state network under each performance category (for further information on performance metrics and performance categories, see the guidance document Performance-Based Decisions: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/designtopics/design-tools-and-support#Tools). The baseline performance metric for preservation category projects is predetermined and is the same as the threshold performance metrics determined by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and HQ Capital Program Development and Management (CPDM) Office. The baseline performance metrics for a mobility or economic vitality category project may be different from the threshold performance metrics. However, the baseline metric chosen is to be consistent with the priority programming performance category that identified the location to be evaluated. Example: A routinely congested corridor has been screened to identify locations with a potential mobility performance gap. Screening used a threshold performance metric of estimated operations at 70% of posted speed during the peak hour. After considering the context of the location, and the relevance of the threshold performance metric to the site-specific conditions and operations, the advisory team recommends that travel time reliability is a more appropriate metric for the location.
1101.04(1) Safety Performance WSDOT’s practical design approach is committed to multimodal safety as identified in Washington State’s Strategic Safety Plan (see www.targetzero.com/plan.htm). To meet this commitment, projects are required to include a baseline performance metric for evaluating the number of fatal and serious injury crashes in safety, mobility and economic vitality category projects. Other safety metrics to address the specific community or partnering agency needs may be included as contextual needs. Safety projects are expected to continue project development as directed by the Multimodal Safety Executive Committee (MSEC) and described in Exhibit 1101-1 Safety Scoping Flowchart and Chapter 321. Other projects are to coordinate up front with the HQ Safety Technical Group to determine the scale and scope of crash analyses appropriate for different types and sizes of projects. For additional information see Chapter 321 and the safety analysis guide.

1101.04(2) Complete Streets Performance (New Section 2023) Projects that have been identified as having a Complete Streets Need (see above) are required to apply five categories of metrics, in addition to any other baseline needs as described above, to help assess design alternative performance with respect to the Complete Streets need.
1101.04(2)(a) Bicycle and Pedestrian Movement (New Section 2023) Measure the prospective performance of biking, walking and other pedestrian movement through the project using Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) and route directness (RDI). LTS is a metric that is used during planning and design to provide an indication of the relative stress experienced by bicycle riders and pedestrians. LTS is a numeric rating from 1 to 4, where a lower number indicates lower stress for a bicyclist (expressed as BLTS) or for a pedestrian traveler (expressed as PLTS). At a minimum, the numeric LTS rating is based on Average Annual Daily Traffic (more commonly known as AADT), posted speed and the number of travel lanes of the highway segment. Other roadway characteristics can be used to refine an LTS designation. LTS can be used to summarize a highway’s essential characteristics, including design elements, features, dimensions, and configuration. Route directness refers to the amount of out of direction travel pedestrians and bicyclists must engage in to travel between destinations. It is measured in terms of a Route Directness Index (RDI). More information and requirements about LTS and RDI can be found in Sections 1310.03(1), 1510.02(5), and 1520.03(3).

1101.04(2)(b) Concerns of Overburdened Communities (New Section 2023) An overburdened community is a geographic area where vulnerable populations face combined, multiple environmental harms and health impacts and includes, but is not limited to, highly impacted communities that are designated by the department of health based on cumulative impacts analyses or a community located in census tracts that are fully or partially on "Indian country”. Vulnerable populations are groups that are more likely to be at higher risk for poor health outcomes in response to environmental harms (see Glossary). The identification and evaluation of the needs of vulnerable populations living in overburdened communities is determined by the Project Team in cooperation with the local community during community engagement. The project Advisory Team, in advance of and during community engagement, are tasked with establishing community-centered, measurable outcomes for the project that reflect the needs determined through the engagement process.
1101.04(2)(c) Active Transportation Network Gap(s) (New Section 2023) Active transportation network gaps are identified in the WSDOT Active Transportation Plan (ATP) become a design issue based on an assessment of how well design solutions address the description of the gap in the plan. This metric is based on work performed by the CS Team, who provide a specific list of identified gaps, based on their review of the ATP, that can be addressed as described above, and coincide with or are immediately adjacent to the project limits such that it is reasonable for the project to address the gap.
1101.04(2)(d) Access to Transit (New Section 2023) Designing for access to transit involves establishing the need for new or improved facilities and features that provide convenient access to transit, rail, ferries, or aviation by active travel modes. When people are able to make efficient intermodal connections using active transportation for part of their trips, they are less likely to rely solely on a personal motor vehicle. Consider the following steps to determine the presence and incorporation of access to transit facilities:
•
•
•
•
Determine the presence of modal routes, stations, and stops within the project limits. Identify routes that active transportation users will use to access these locations. Identify facilities needed to accommodate active transportation users, based on an assessment of local context, and LTS, as applicable. Incorporate those facilities into design alternatives for evaluation and selection (Chapter 1104).
Provide specific improvements when projects lie within High-Capacity Transit areas (refer to the WSDOT HCT improvements guide for more information).
1101.04(2)(e) Comfortable Roadside Environment (Street Trees) (New Section 2023) Complete Streets are intended to provide for a comfortable environment for pedestrians and bicycles. Street trees are a common treatment associated with Complete Streets used to accomplish this urban environment goal. Street trees provide shade and help indicate an appropriately-scaled urban context to travelers. Consult with the CS Team to determine the need for trees in order to establish the desired urban environment. Also consult with subject matter expert(s) to determine the appropriate locations, types, and applications, with the limitation that trees may only be placed where 6” curbing is installed between the traveled way and the trees so not to incumber traveled ways. Work in collaboration with the local jurisdiction to establish the responsible party for maintaining street trees. Note that the project documentation required for approving installation of trees that lie within the design clear zone varies depending on whether the project lies inside or outside an incorporated city (see Section 1600.02).

Need Identification
1101.04(3) Baseline Performance Target (Section Rewritten 2023) Develop custom performance targets that represent the outcome (or desired state) intended for the project with respect to each baseline need. The extent to which alternative designs meet these targets provides the primary basis for alternative development – alternatives do not move forward for evaluation unless they meet each of the specified baseline or complete streets performance targets (see Chapter 1104). Targets can be a single value, a range of values, or a performance outcome as defined by the Project Team in consultation with the Advisory Team. There may be situations where the targets cannot practicably be met by any alternative or where it’s been determined and documented that there would be unacceptable performance trade-offs in other performance categories. In these situations, it may be appropriate to identify trade-offs among the project’s baseline performance metrics to balance competing needs and outcomes. In these situations, determine and document a refined performance target to be carried forward into alternatives evaluation (see Chapter 1104).
1101.05 Contextual Needs During project development, opportunities often arise to address other needs that may be identified. These other needs are classified as “contextual needs,” as they reflect the context within which the project will take place. Potential sources of contextual needs include:
•
•
•
•
•
Performance gaps identified through the priority network screening that did not prioritize under a statewide biennial prioritization and budget exercise, but still exist at the project location. Needs identified through community engagement or identified by a partnering agency. Needs based on identified environmental regulations and constraints. Needs identified through coordination with WSDOT maintenance including life cycle operating and maintenance costs (see Chapter 301 for additional information). Needs and agency risks identified through increased knowledge of the project site and context.
Contextual needs serve a different role than baseline needs. Baseline needs primarily shape the alternatives developed, while contextual needs contribute to the analysis of performance trade-offs and comparison of alternatives (see Chapter 1104). Although metrics associated with contextual needs can be either quantitative or qualitative, use an objective statement to describe the need in a way that the outcome is measurable. By definition, there is no requirement that contextual needs be addressed by a project. Contextual needs are not expected to add significant project cost. ASDE and CPDM approval is required when a preferred alternative incorporates contextual needs that increase the project cost beyond addressing the baseline need(s) and Complete Streets needs where applicable. Develop metrics for contextual needs to compare alternatives. Interpret and translate each issue into a statement that is measurable, to the extent feasible. Contextual need metrics can be either quantitative or qualitative.
1101.06 Contributing Factors Analysis Contributing factors analysis (CFA) is a process by which subject matter experts on the advisory team evaluate the contributing factors associated with performance gaps in order to identify the root reasons for each gap. In the transportation field, contributing factors are any geometric, operational, context-based, or human factor that can reasonably be attributed to a performance need through data analysis and engineering judgment. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1101-5
Chapter 1101
Need Identification
Practical design relies on CFA to find the root reason(s) a need exists, rather than focusing on a symptom that may only temporarily or partially resolve the need. Note: It is recognized that completely solving a problem may not be possible by a single corrective action due to the number of contributing factors or because of constraints. The CFA method will:
•
•
Organize and identify multiple contributing factors and underlying root reasons. Formulate a number of potential countermeasures to solve the need as thoroughly and efficiently as possible.
Diagnosis of contributing factors yields the best results when data is available for the analysis. Comprehensive crash data, organized by travel mode, is important when considering safety performance. In other performance categories, where quantitative data is not available, qualitative analysis may be used to reveal the underlying contributing factor(s). Contributing factor analysis is only required for evaluation of baseline performance needs. However, it may be relevant to perform CFA for contextual performance metrics. Diagnosing contributing factors using CFA is not necessarily a simple linear process. It’s possible to find that a contributing factor identified by one discipline is the root cause of another discipline’s contributing factor. In some cases, mapping the contributing factors in a network or fishbone diagram can help identify these relationships more clearly (see the Guidance Document: Contributing Factors Analysis: Design guidance & support | WSDOT (wa.gov)).
1101.07 Project Need Statement A project need statement (or statement of need) uses the baseline needs (see Section 1101.02) and results of contributing factors analysis to succinctly describe the real root project need(s). The objective is to provide a clear, accurate plain talk description of the root needs that will facilitate the development of efficient, focused project alternatives. A need statement should:
•
•
•
•
Identify the objective, in simple, direct terms. Identify the performance metric(s) involved. Include one or more quantifiable statements. Exclude any description or discussion of potential solutions.
Consider other processes applicable to their projects that may require need statements such as: value engineering, NEPA/SEPA, and Access Revision Reports. Consider timing of these processes as well as integration and alignment of the need statements with the processes required for the project. For more information and examples of need statements, see the Writing Effective Needs Statement chapter in the Guidance Document: Design guidance & support | WSDOT (wa.gov)

Context Determination Exhibit 1102-1 Factors for Determining Initial Land Use Context
1102.01 General Overview Context refers to the environmental, economic, and social features that influence livability and travel characteristics. Context characteristics provide insight into the activities, functions, and performance that can be influenced by investments in the multimodal transportation system including the roadway design. Context also informs designs, including the selection of design controls, such as target speed and modal priority, and other design decisions. For the purposes of transportation planning and design, WSDOT divides context into two categories: land use and transportation. Each of these contexts is further defined and categorized in this chapter. Note that context categories, and the information pertinent to deriving them, may have been documented in a planning study. The concepts and method described in this chapter are adapted from National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 855: “An Expanded Functional Classification System for Highways and Streets.”
1102.02 Land Use Context This section describes the procedure for determining the land use context category on non-freeway facilities. The guidance in this section does not apply for freeways (see Chapter 1232 for the definition of a freeway). For freeways, Section 2 of the Basis of Design is used only to document the urban/rural designation as listed for the route on the State Route Log. On larger projects, more than one land use category may apply within project limits. Step 1. Determine an initial land use context category (current state) Land use context categories are described in detail in Section 1102.02(1). These categories represent distinctive land use environments beyond simply “rural” and “urban” to help determine a more accurate context. These categories influence roadway design, including determining appropriate operating speeds, mobility and access demands, and modal users. The land use categories are:
•
•
•
•
Rural Suburban Urban Urban Core
Use the following factors to determine your initial land use context category: 1. Land uses (primarily residential, commercial, industrial, and/or agricultural) 2. Density 3. Setbacks Quantify these factors through an assessment of the area adjacent to the existing or planned roadway (see Exhibit 1102-1).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1102-1
Chapter 1102
Context Determination
Step 2. Determine an initial land use context category (future state) Using the same factors and categories, consult with local agency staff, and review state, regional, and local planning documents to consider and document potential or anticipated changes to land use context. Sources of information include the local comprehensive plan, WSDOT Highway System Plan, WSDOT corridor sketches, and WSDOT planning studies in the corridor. Exhibit 1102-1 Factors for Determining Initial Land Use Context
Factor Land Use Density Density Density Density Setback Setback
Criteria Land uses within ½ mi of roadway Housing units / acre Jobs / acre Intersections per sq. mi. Typical building height Typical building setback Parking (on street or off street)
Specific metrics guiding the use of these criteria in determining the initial land use context category (both current and future) are provided on the WSDOT Design Office website. Step 3. Select final land use context category (current and future state) Once an initial land use category is determined, additional (primarily qualitative) considerations are used to verify that the selected category is appropriate. Because data used in the initial determination may be incomplete, conflicting, or difficult to interpret, it’s expected that professional judgment is used to confirm the context result. Even when the overall assessment is clear, discontinuities or transitions between categories may exist and require further interpretation. Confirm or make adjustments to the initial context category based on a qualitative analysis. Use information gathered from consultations with local agency staff, as well as the project’s community engagement processes, to validate a final determination about current and future context. Information about topography, soil type, land value, population density, average building square footage, visual assessments, aerial photos, zoning, and other local agency land use data and/or maps may also be used in this step. Document the process used to make this final context determination. Include the data used, interdisciplinary input, and issues encountered and resolved in the process. Conclude with a final land use context determination that confirms, or adjusts, the initial category(s) for the project, and seek the endorsement of this final determination from the project advisory team (see Chapter 1100).
1102.02(1) Land Use Categories The land use categories used to inform project design are described below.
1102.02(1)(a) Rural The rural category ranges from no development (natural environment) to some light development (structures), with sparse residential and other structures mostly associated with farms.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1102-2
Chapter 1102
Context Determination
The land is primarily used for outdoor recreation, agriculture, farms, and/or resource extraction. Occasionally non-incorporated communities will include a few residential and commercial structures. Rural characteristics also include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
No or very few pedestrians – except those locations used for outdoor recreation and modal connections, and where socioeconomic factors suggest that walking is likely to serve as an essential form of transportation. Bicycle use mostly recreational– except for tourist destinations, modal connection locations and between communities where bicycle commuters may be expected or where socioeconomic factors suggest that bicycling is likely to serve as an essential form of transportation. Low development density. Isolated residential or commercial activities. Commercial uses include general stores, restaurants, and gas stations, normally at crossroads. Setbacks for structures are usually large, except in the immediate vicinity of small settlements. Transit service availability is often absent or highly limited but varies widely depending on the jurisdiction. On-demand service is typically found to provide specialized transportation services.
1102.02(1)(b) Suburban Locations classified as suburban include a diverse range of commercial and residential uses that have a low or often, medium density. Suburban areas are usually (but not always) connected and closely integrated with an urban area. The buildings in medium density tend to be multi-story with off-street parking. Sidewalks are usually present and bicycle lanes may exist. Suburban areas include mixed use town centers, commercial corridors, and residential areas. Big box commercial and light industrial uses are also common. The range of uses encompasses health services, light industrial (and sometimes heavy industrial), quick-stop shops, gas stations, restaurants, and schools and libraries. Suburban characteristics also include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Heavy reliance on passenger vehicles. Transit may be present. Residential areas may consist of single and/or multi-family structures. Building and structure setbacks from the roadway vary from short to long. May have well planned and arranged multi-uses that encourage walking and biking. Planned multi-use clusters may integrate residential and commercial areas along with schools and parks. Some highways that fit this category may be designated by WSDOT as “Main Street Highways.” See Identification of State Highways as Main Streets: Appendix B.
1102.02(1)(c) Urban Urban locations are high density, consisting principally of multi-story and low to medium rise structures for residential and commercial use. Areas usually exist for light and sometimes heavy industrial use. Many structures accommodate mixed uses: commercial, residential, and parking. Urban areas usually include prominent destinations with specialized structures for entertainment, athletic and social events as well as conference centers.

Chapter 1102
Context Determination
Urban characteristics also include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Various government and public use structures exist that are accessed regularly. Building setbacks are both short and long. Most streets have on-street parking. Wide sidewalks and plazas accommodate more intense pedestrian traffic. Bicycle lanes and transit corridors are frequently present. Last mile delivery vehicles and drop-off/pick-up areas on some streets. Off-street parking includes multi-level structures that may be integrated with commercial or residential uses. Some highways that fit this category may be designated by WSDOT as “Main Street Highways.” See Identification of State Highways as Main Streets: Appendix B.
Due to the differences in developmental scale among urban areas as well as growth demand urban-urban core, context boundaries change over time with the urban core area expanding in high growth situations and possibly contracting in low or no growth situations.
1102.02(1)(d) Urban Core Urban core locations include the highest level of density with its mixed residential and commercial uses accommodated in high-rise structures. There is commonly on-street parking, although it is usually time restricted. Most parking is in multi-level structures attached or integrated with other structures. The area is accessible to automobiles, commercial delivery vehicles, biking, walking, and public transit. Urban Core characteristics also include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Sidewalks and pedestrian plazas are present. Bicycle facilities and transit corridors are common. Typical land uses are mixed commercial, residential, with some government or similar institutions present. Commercial uses predominate, including financial and legal. Structures (predominantly high rises) may have multiple uses. With the highest land value of any category, setbacks from the street are small. Some highways that fit this category may be designated by WSDOT as “Main Street Highways.” See Identification of State Highways as Main Streets: Appendix B.
1102.03 Transportation Context This section describes the procedure for determining the current and future transportation context for the roadway. On larger projects, more than one transportation context may apply within project limits. Network connections are also useful in understanding the transportation context. Each transportation context is to be described in terms of the following categories and considerations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Roadway type Bicycle route type Pedestrian route type Freight route type Transit use considerations Complete streets and Main Street highways
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1102
Context Determination
Seek endorsement from the project advisory team (see Chapter 1100) for determinations of these transportation context types and considerations, including input from local agency (local jurisdictions and transit agencies) and stakeholders. Document determination of each of these transportation contexts for both current and future states in Section 2 of the Basis of Design and carry these results forward into determination of modal compatibility and modal priority (Chapter 1103). Additional information supporting work described in this section is provided on the WSDOT Design Office website.
1102.03(1) Roadway Type The initial roadway type is defined by the designated functional classification on the WSDOT State Route Log for the route as listed below for non-freeway facilities. A final roadway type determination is based on an assessment of whether a different functional class description (given below) corresponds better to the current and future state of the facility, compared to the designated functional class for the facility. The future state is determined after an assessment of the future modal route types described below. Justify the selection of a final roadway type whether it is the same or different from the designated functional class. Freeways (including Interstate freeways) are defined in Chapter 1232. These routes typically are limited access facilities. The roadway type for freeways is freeway. Roadway types for non-freeway facilities are described as follows.
•
•
•
•
Principal Arterial – Corridors of regional importance connecting large centers of activity. These routes may be limited access facilities. Minor Arterial – Corridors of regional or local importance connecting centers of activity. Collector – Roadways of local importance providing connections between arterials and local roads. Local – Roads with no regional importance for local circulation and access only
1102.03(2) Bicycle Route Type Bicycle routes are categorized based on the purpose of the trip and the network connectivity a facility provides. Use quantitative and qualitative information about bicycle connections associated with the project location to determine the current and future bicycle route type using one of these four classifications:
•
•
•
•
Population Center Connector (PCC) The route connects closely spaced population centers (see Section 1101.04(3)) via a regional route or a route specific to adjacent population centers. These routes have the potential to attract a high volume of use by allowing access to housing, employment, and service options that are not otherwise available in one of the population centers. These routes are typically associated with partial limited access arterials. Citywide Connector (CC) — The route is part of a citywide network, provides a connection to major activity centers, or is a regional bike route stretching over several miles that attracts a high volume of use, serving a primary destination access, commute, or recreational purpose. These routes are typically associated with arterials and collectors. Neighborhood Connector (NC) — The route provides a neighborhood or sub-area connection, making connections to higher order facilities or more local activity centers, such as neighborhood commercial centers. These routes are typically associated with minor arterials and collectors. Local Connector (LC) — The route provides local connections of short lengths, providing internal connections within neighborhoods, or linking neighborhoods to higher order facilities. These routes are typically associated with collectors and local roads.

Chapter 1102
Context Determination
1102.03(3) Pedestrian Route Type Pedestrian use is described in terms of estimated volumes (current and potential future). The amount of pedestrian traffic impacts several factors, including pedestrian facility capacity, vehicular delays at signalized intersections, and most importantly, the level of risk associated from pedestrians in the travelled way. The four pedestrian route types are based on volume as follows:
•
•
•
•
P-1: rare or occasional use P-2: low volume – best measured in pedestrians per day P-3: medium volume - best measured in pedestrians per hour P-4: high volume - best in pedestrians per hour, where sub-hour peak periods are typical
1102.03(4) Freight Route Type Freight routes may not require significant additional facilities beyond those provided for other motorized vehicles if mobility and speeds of vehicular routes are consistent with freight movement. Special design consideration is commonly related to the Freight and Goods Transportation System classification. Document the classification for the project area. Contact Rail, Freight, and Ports Division for help identifying freight classifications, industry needs and truck operations. Truck route classifications can be found here: Freight Transportation System in WA (arcgis.com) Additional information: Freight plans | WSDOT (wa.gov)
1102.03(5) Transit Use Considerations Transit can provide service on any roadway type. The purposes of transit trips are similar to those of automobile trips and include commuting, work related business, shopping, personal errands, and social/recreational. The facilities and design considerations for transit uses depend on the type of transit service being provided. Note that special design consideration is required for projects that involve one or more of the following elements:
•
Fixed route type: there are three primary types of fixed-route transit service, operating along designated routes at set times (Local, Limited, and Express). If one of these services exists on the project, determine the route type using criteria shown in the illustration below and the following bullets:
Source: TRPC Report 165: Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual.
•
•
•
Local routes serve many stops along a route and emphasize access to transit over speed. Limited stop routes (also known as frequent routes, including bus rapid transit) balance transit access with speed. These routes run frequently and serve higher volume stops (e.g., major activity centers and transfer points). Express routes emphasize speed over transit access and are often used for longer distance trips.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1102-6
Chapter 1102
Context Determination
Note that in addition to fixed-route service, many agencies provide demand-response paratransit services that provide specialized transportation services in both rural and urban areas.
•
•
•
•
•
Bus rapid transit or light rail Transit signal priority installation Planned transit facilities and routes In lane bus stops and/or potential bus pullouts Facilities for people with specialized transportation needs (e.g., hospitals, senior centers, schools, transit-dependent communities, etc.)
When evaluating transit needs and the potential for transit to improve highway performance in the project area, document relevant information or data about current transit capacity and quality of service (as defined in the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual) and current and potential future use and travel markets. Include consideration for people walking and biking to/from transit connections. Contact the Public Transportation Division for help or for more information about identifying and coordinating with transit agencies and local jurisdictions that serve the project area (wwwi.wsdot.wa.gov/PubTran/).
1102.03(6) Complete Streets and Main Street Highways Complete Street contexts consider all transportation modes and provide equal priority to all modes during the alternative evaluation process. Projects that will be developed as Complete Streets are identified during a screening process (Section 1100.03(3)) and may be associated with any of the land use contexts described in this chapter.
1102.04 Documentation Document the following in Section 2 of the Basis of Design:
•
•
•
•
•

•
Land use category Roadway type Bicycle route type Pedestrian route type Freight route classification Transit use considerations Main Streets designation
Describe the process that was followed to reach these designations. If the work involved review and verification of previous work, document that process as well. If characteristics vary within project limits include the milepost ranges to which each of the designations apply.

1103.02 Control: Design Year Design year is the forecast year used for design. The year of opening is when the construction will be complete, and the project location is fully operational. Design year selection is dependent on a decision to design for the year of opening, or for a future year based on forecast or planned conditions. Design year has historically been associated with a 20-year vehicle traffic forecast used in development of large mobility and capacity expansion projects. This is the origin of the term horizon year. Horizon year is typically considered to be 20 years from the year construction is scheduled to begin. WSDOT policy on design year is intentionally flexible. The design year can be any interim year selected between the project year of opening year and the horizon year. Many lower-cost projects result in immediate performance improvements when construction is completed. Safety projects are an example of this where the basis of design may show design year as the year of opening. Some projects may require horizon year analysis of an alternative regardless of the selected design year. A project may be required to evaluate alternatives based on the horizon year (20 years from the scheduled beginning of construction) if the project:

1103.03 Control: Modal Priority The concepts and method described in this section are adapted from National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 855: “An Expanded Functional Classification System for Highways and Streets” (see www.trb.org/NCHRP/Blurbs/176004.aspx)
1103.03(1) Design Users “Design users” refers to the modes that are legally permitted to use a facility. The intent in identifying design users is to highlight all user needs, recognize modal interactions, and develop an integrated system for all users. Identifying the design users is the first step in determining which modes to accommodate and prioritize. On the Basis of Design, list design users with sufficient descriptive detail. Include consideration for all ages and abilities. Division III of the document Understanding Flexibility in Transportation Design – Washington is a key resource for understanding the needs and characteristics of various design users.
1103.03(2) Modal Accommodation Modal accommodation refers to the level to which a travel mode will be addressed in the design. It is expressed on a scale of low, medium, and high, where a higher accommodation level is associated with the use of design features or criteria that tend to improve the performance of that mode compared to a lower level. Once established, the modal accommodation level is used to inform the decision on modal priority (See Section 1103.03(3)). Complete Streets projects are not required to establish modal accommodation levels nor complete a Context and Modal Accommodation Report, as they are assumed to accommodate all modes. For other projects, determine the modal accommodation level for both the current year (prior to opening) and the design year. These are referred to as existing and future conditions in the guidance that follows. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Note that in many cases, the planning documentation, data, or information in the project vicinity may not be available for the project’s design year. In those cases, identify the forecast or horizon year used by the local agency or planning organization in its work and planning products, and document the use of that year as the future year for purposes of determining the modal accommodation level. 1. An initial modal accommodation determination, for both the current and design years, are made using Exhibit 1103-2. The initial determination uses the roadway type and land use contexts that were determined earlier and documented in Section 2 of the Basis of Design (See Chapter 1102). 2. A final determination for both the current and design years is made using additional information and evidence to validate or modify the initial determination. Make the final modal accommodation determination for each mode in consultation with the project advisory team and/or subject matter expert(s), as they may recommend modifications to the initial determinations (see Section 1100.04(2) for more information about working with the project advisory team). Exhibit 1103-3 provides examples of land-use and transportation characteristics that a project advisory team or subject matter expert(s) may consider in adjusting accommodation up or down for any particular travel mode. These characteristics can represent either the current suitability of a facility to accommodate a mode, or its future strategic role with respect to accommodating that mode. Note that the Context and Modal Accommodation Report provides a template for making and documenting decisions about modal accommodation. Exhibit 1103-2 Initial Modal Accommodation Level

1103.03(2)(a) Vehicle modal accommodation level Consider the vehicle modal accommodation level when making design decisions that address or affect needs associated with vehicle travel. Start with the initial modal accommodation level for motor vehicles per Exhibit 1103-2, and adjust it to establish the final level based on documented project specific conditions related to the quality of travel experience, and identified performance targets, that can be influenced by the project design, such as vehicle Level of Service, travel time, access classification, and other factors determined by subject matter experts or the project advisory team.
1103.03(2)(b) Bicycle modal accommodation level Consider the bicycle modal accommodation level when making design decisions that address or affect needs associated with bicycle travel. Start with the initial modal accommodation level for bicycles per Exhibit 1103-2, and adjust it to establish the final level based on documented project specific conditions related to the quality of travel experience, and identified performance targets, that can be influenced by the project design, such as bicycle route type, efficiency of travel, range, bicyclist safety, route spacing, bicycle volumes, and other factors determined by subject matter experts or the project advisory team.
1103.03(2)(c) Pedestrian modal accommodation level Consider the pedestrian modal accommodation level when making design decisions that address or affect needs associated with pedestrian travel. Start with the initial modal accommodation level for pedestrians per Exhibit 1103-2, and adjust it to establish the final level based on documented project specific conditions related to the quality of travel experience, and identified performance targets, that can be influenced by the project design, such as pedestrian route type, efficiency of travel, range, pedestrian safety, block length, and other factors determined by subject matter experts or the project advisory team.

1103.03(3) Modal Priority Accommodate means that the roadway will be designed so that the chosen modes can use it, while accommodation level refers to the extent to which that accommodation may be required. Priority refers to the decision to optimize the design based on the performance of one or more travel modes. Modal priority is used as input to choose the appropriate geometric cross section (see Chapter 1230). Complete Streets projects are not required to establish modal priorities, as they are assumed to accommodate all modes, with none taking priority. For other projects, determine modal priority for all modes expected to use the facility using the accommodation level results, as well as other relevant information about freight, transit, and any other modes considered and documented in the Context and Modal Accommodation Report and Basis of Design. Engage the project advisory team as provided in Section 1100.04(2). If the modal priority is inconsistent with assumptions made about the project during a planning or scoping phase, work with program management staff to consider the need for any changes to project scoping documentation, including scope, schedule, and budget. Document the modal priority on the Basis of Design for both the current and future conditions.
1103.03(4) Intersection Design Vehicle WSDOT policy provides flexibility when choosing the intersection design vehicle. The purpose for this policy is to balance user needs and avoid the unnecessary expense and increased active transportation user exposure associated with oversizing intersections. Considerations include frequency of the design vehicle and effects on other design users, specifically pedestrian crossing distance and times, and bicycle turning and through movements. Consider managing vehicle turning speeds and providing more protected intersection treatments for pedestrians and bicyclists to mitigate turning conflicts. Also consider implementing mountable truck aprons to encourage slow passenger vehicle turns while still accommodating larger vehicle. An intersection design vehicle is a specific selection made at each intersection leg. Select a design vehicle that allows the largest vehicles commonly encountered to adequately complete a required turning maneuver. The objective is not necessarily to size the specific intersection curb radius (unless there is a baseline need associated with the larger vehicles), but rather to account for a reasonable path that allows the largest vehicle commonly encountered to turn without conflicts (see Chapter 1310). Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to analyze turning movements. Select low turning speeds for turn speed simulation at locations where pedestrians and bicyclists may be present. Example: At an intersection with a pedestrian modal priority that experiences infrequent turning movements by a WB-67, a smaller curb radius would benefit pedestrians due to shorter crossing times and reduced exposure to vehicles. Using turn simulation software, a practicable path for the WB-67 can be identified, even though the vehicle’s path may intrude into the second same direction lane may be necessary. Conversely, if the crossroad was identified as being within a Freight Economic Freight and Goods Transportation System Truck Corridor, with frequent turning movements from larger vehicles, it would be appropriate to size the intersection to prevent the second lane incursion. If there are pedestrians and cyclists present or latent demand at this same location, a mountable truck apron at the intersection may slow passenger vehicle turns while still accommodating larger vehicles. Consider origins and destinations of large vehicles to understand their needs at specific intersection locations. Also, consider alternatives that may help lower turning speeds and minimize pedestrian exposure.

Work with stakeholders, businesses, and service providers to understand their needs (like transit, school bus and emergency vehicle movements) and define the frequency of use at specific intersections. Municipalities may have established truck routes or restrictions that govern local freight patterns.
1103.04 Control: Access Control Access refers to the means of entering or leaving a public road, street, or highway by travelers with respect to property that abuts the facility, or by another public road, street, or highway. The regulation or control of this access (see Chapter 520) affects accessibility to the facility, and also impacts the types of activities and functions that can occur on a facility. Highway improvement projects consider the current and/or planned access control and classification in order to determine whether a change would support project baseline or contextual needs (see Chapter 1101). During the original development of the state highway system, access management functioned to preserve the safety and efficiency of regional highways. However, the level of access management can also significantly affect accessibility to land uses, modal mobility needs and the economic vitality of a place. Unless access control has already been acquired by the purchase of access rights, it is necessary to select the appropriate type of limited access control or managed access control during planning and design. Appropriate access control should be considered so as not to hinder bicycle and pedestrian accessibility, mobility, and safety. A choice to change the current or planned access control is a major decision and is to be consistent with the context, desired performance targets, and modal priorities for a location. Example: The area around a managed access Class 2 route has incurred significant development, increasing the number of local trips on a segment of the route. Over time, additional intersections and access connection permits have been granted. In this situation, it may be appropriate to consider selecting managed access Class 4 or 5 because of the changes in functions and activities along the segment over time. Conversely, a route that does not contain bicyclist or pedestrian generators within it may have a need to improve motor vehicle travel time performance, and managed access Class 1 may be appropriate. A through route solution for active travelers, such as a shared use path, may still be needed for managed access Class 1 routes. If an alteration to current or planned access is determined necessary, consult the Headquarters Access and Hearings Manager for preliminary approval for the selection, and document on the Basis of Design (see Chapter 1100). For additional information on access control and access management, see Chapter 520, Chapter 530, and Chapter 540.
1103.05 Control: Design Speed WSDOT uses a target speed approach for determining design speed. The objective of the target speed approach is to establish the design speed at the desired operating speed. The target speed selection is derived from other design controls, as well as transportation and land use context characteristics. Exhibit 1103-4 shows possible (planning level) target speeds for the various roadway types and land use contexts discussed in Chapter 1102. The target speeds shown in the exhibit are suggestions only, and the target speed for the specific location may vary from those shown in the exhibit.

Engage the public, local agency staff and officials, and transit agencies prior to selecting the target speed. Once the target speed has been selected, it becomes the design speed for the project. The goal of the target speed approach is that the speed ultimately posted on the completed project is the same as the design, and ultimately, the operating speed. In order to achieve this outcome, consider:
•
•
•
•
•
The impact of existing or proposed contextual characteristics Modal priorities Access control selection Performance need(s) Contributing factors analyses that have been developed for the project
Lowering target speed: When selecting a target speed lower than the existing posted speed, or where excessive operating speeds were identified from contributing factors analysis of the baseline performance need, consider the use of roadway treatments that will help achieve the selected target speed (see Section 1103.05(2)) during alternatives formulation. Speed management treatments are used to achieve lower vehicle speeds. When speed management treatments are proposed to accomplish a desired target speed operation, obtain concurrence from the Region Traffic Engineer and ASDE. When a design speed is proposed for a project that is lower than the existing posted speed, the approval of the State Traffic Engineer is also required. See Section 1103.05(2) below for more on speed management. Raising target speed: When selecting a target speed in excess of the existing posted speed, measures such as greater restriction of access control and segregation of modes may be necessary to reduce conflicts in activities and modal uses. Wider cross-sectional elements like lanes and shoulders are used with higher speed facilities. Careful consideration of other modal needs should be evaluated before raising target speeds. Setting the posted speed: Use caution when basing a target speed on one or more contextual characteristics that are proposed to take place after project opening, as the goal of ending up with a posted speed equal to the design speed at opening may be jeopardized. The Region Traffic Engineer is responsible for setting the posted speed on the highway once the project is completed. Target speed is only one of the considerations used when establishing posted speed. Engage and include the Region Traffic Engineer and Traffic Office staff in key decision-making that will affect the target, design, and operating speed selection. Incorporate consideration of traffic calming measures as needed. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Design Control Selection
1103.05(1) Low, Intermediate, and High Speeds To provide a general basis of reference between target speed and geometric design, WSDOT policy provides three classifications of target speed as follows: 1. Low Speed is 35 mph and below. A low target speed is ideal for roadways with pedestrian and bicycle modal priorities. Locations that include frequent transit stops, intermodal connections, moderate to high intersection density, or moderate to high access densities may also benefit from lower speed environments. Low speed facilities in urban areas typically use narrower cross section elements. 2. Intermediate Speeds are 40 mph and 45 mph. An intermediate target speed is ideal for speed transitions between high and low target speed environments. Locations with low access densities and few at-grade intersections are also examples of where intermediate speed may be appropriate. In these locations consider a higher degree of separation between motor vehicles and bicycles and pedestrians. 3. High Speed is 50 mph and above. A high target speed is ideal for motor vehicle-oriented roadways such as freeways and highways, often serving regional or longer-distance local trips. Rural connector roadways with infrequent farm or residential accesses are also consistent with the use of high target speeds. In high target speed locations consider the highest degree of separation between motor vehicles and bicycles and pedestrians. Highways with high speeds are associated with wider cross section elements.
1103.05(2) Speed Management In order to effectively achieve a target speed, a project needs to be designed to match the intended future land use context. It is usually not enough to change the operating speed of a corridor by simply changing the speed limit signs. The design of the corridor needs to match the target speed and thus match the regulatory speed (AKA speed limit). Physical changes to the characteristics of a corridor can help manage speed. When the characteristics of the corridor match with the target speed, then operating speeds are reduced to the regulatory speed. When target, operating, and regulatory speeds align, then the corridor can realize safety performance improvements and reduce the need for enforcement. The strategies presented in this section are called speed management strategies and can be deployed on a project to achieve a roadway that matches the intended context of the corridor, reduces speeds, and gets the three speed types to align. Speed management has the potential to reduce the number and severity of crashes for all users. While there are not specific crash modification factors for every speed management strategy, it is reasonable to conclude that lower speed means less kinetic energy and that can equate to less severe injury in the event of a crash. Therefore, appropriately applying speed management strategies to encourage lower speeds, may improve safety performance of a roadway. In addition, lowering speeds will also decrease the design clear zone distance as noted in Section 1600.02. Each speed management strategy (see Exhibit 1103-5) has varied effectiveness for lowering speed, while maintaining roadway function, depending on where they are installed and how they are installed. As a result, it may not be possible to say that one strategy works better than another. In addition, speed management efforts often follow an iterative approach as corridor designs evolve and some strategies work better than others at different stages of a roadway’s progression toward achieving a target speed.

Chapter 1103
Design Control Selection
Speed management strategies applied independently, in combination, or in series may be beneficial depending on the type and use of the strategies. Many speed management strategies have demonstrated varied effectiveness for single applications, however multiple strategies in series and parallel that build upon the context are more effective. Though not fundamentally speed management devices, crosswalk enhancements and bicycle strategies can help create the desired environment to achieve lower speeds based upon the contextual cues they offer to drivers. However, the speed reduction benefits of crosswalk or bicycle improvements are secondary. It should be recognized that there are usually multiple goals for improving multimodal travel on a given corridor, with speed management being one. Other goals may involve increasing vulnerable user conspicuity, providing mode specific travel space, and reducing crash exposure. Many speed management tools can address more than one goal, and lowered speeds can reduce the complexity and cost of other safety and mobility strategies for vulnerable users. For this reason, it is important to consider the final multimodal function of each corridor. The effective use of speed management strategies requires extensive collaboration with stakeholders inside and outside the WSDOT. These may include individuals from headquarters, regions, local agencies, community group, and business groups. Changes to posted speed limits require the approval of the State Traffic Engineer. Reducing the speed of a corridor can have the side effect of diverting traffic off the street where the speed management has been deployed. As a result, many agencies apply speed management across broader areas. When deploying a strategy on a state highway, coordinate with adjacent local agencies to evaluate the traffic network as a whole and to consider the possibility of traffic diversion and ways to mitigate it. Several speed management strategies are listed in Exhibit 1103-5. Each strategy has information about the typical application. Designers should consider each strategy uniquely for their project and match the strategy with the desired context. Do not apply speed management strategies as a one-size-fits-all approach. Each corridor has unique needs and therefore will deploy different strategies. Experts in other fields of study like active transportation, traffic, and maintenance should be consulted for input. The selection of a strategy should be documented in the Basis of Design (BOD) as a baseline or contextual need. In the alternatives section of the BOD, describe the strategies considered and why they were selected for the project. Some of the most effective self-enforcing speed management strategies present concerns on roads where vehicle speeds are already high. An example is a speed hump which is highly effective at lowering speed, but can create other unintended effects, like damage to a vehicle, if used where motorists are driving at higher speeds. In those locations use an iterative approach where one speed management strategy is used to begin lowering speeds and as speeds go down other strategies are used to continue lowering speeds until eventually the desired target speed is achieved. The strategies in Exhibit 1103-5 are typically highway strategies. In areas not on the state highway system, there are other strategies that can be deployed that are not listed in this exhibit. Ideas for these locations can be found in the resources listed at the end of this chapter. The strategies in Exhibit 1103-5 are grouped into categories (e.g., delineation, horizontal deflection, pinch points) and further described by their attributes. Each strategy group is explained as follows:
•
Delineation: These speed management strategies can add or change roadway delineation. They can be paint or plastic markings and may include raised pavement markings or tubular markers/flexible bollards. These strategies do not modify the pavement. When stripes are reapplied, consider the use of a wide line to add emphasis to the strategy.

Horizontal Deflections: These strategies may be achieved with curbed features, planter strips, pavement markings, or with additional fixed delineators. These strategies are more appropriate on intermediate speed or low speed facilities. When introducing this strategy on high-speed facilities, the strategy should utilize paint striping, in addition to using other strategies preceding the deflection, rather than constructing hardscape features. Horizontal deflections are commonly installed at the entrance to roundabouts. Vertical Deflections: This speed management strategies change the roadway elevation. They are designed to meet the target speed. The Institute of Transportation Engineers have written a recommended practice on speed humps, see A Guide to Speed Reduction Techniques, Planning and Design of Speed Humps, Speed Tables, and Other Related Measures (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 2022). Raised crosswalks and intersections are where the crosswalk or the entire intersection is raised. Vertical deflections are not appropriate for high-speed segments. Pinch Points: This strategy uses striping, roadside features, or curb extensions to temporarily narrow the vehicle lane. Pinch points are commonly applied at intersections as bulb-outs. Gateways can be installed along a corridor to introduce a change in context. Circular Intersections: Roundabouts (compact, mini, and modern) are designed to a particular circulatory speed and have warning signs that indicates this speed. Because of their low circulatory speed, they can have speed management effects on the corridor in proximity of the roundabout. They can be applied in a variety of locations and a variety of speeds. Design criteria for roundabouts are contained in Chapter 1320. The neighborhood traffic circle is a small island in the center of an intersection. As the name implies, these are intended for neighborhoods and are not applicable on state highways. ITS: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) uses technology for transportation applications. Some ITS can affect drivers’ travel speed choices. They can be applied in various speed situations and in various contexts. Application of ITS for speed management should be coordinated with your Region Traffic Office. Streetscape: Streetscapes can be installed on the side of the street or in the median. Streetscapes encourage lower speeds by emphasizing a multimodal context and creating a feeling of confinement for drivers. There is a lot of variety in what constitutes a streetscape, including the nontransportation functions they perform. Streetscapes are often created in collaboration with a local agency, citizens group, or business district. They may require a lot of maintenance to remain effective. Work with the partners who help design the streetscape to determine who will be responsible for maintenance. Streetscapes are typically applied in low-speed environments. Deploying streetscapes in intermediate or high-speed roadways may require barrier protection and as such will not have as significant of a speed management effect. Roadway Reallocation: Roadway reallocation means to change the roadway surface to dedicate some of the surface to other modes, parking, or traffic movements. Each of these speed management measures repurpose the road to give less priority to the through vehicle. The action of vehicles slowing to turn, or park, causes “friction” with the through vehicles which cause the drivers to adjust their speed accordingly. The design criteria are found in other chapters of the Design Manual based upon the design elements that you are modifying. Roadway reallocation is usually done by changing the striping, however sometimes you can change curbing or install physical separation.

The list of strategies in Exhibit 1103-5 is not an all-encompassing list. There may be new and emerging strategies that can be applied on a project as a trial or pilot study. When new strategies are applied, it is important to communicate and collaborate with the fields of expertise like Active Transportation, Region Traffic, HQ Transportation Operations, HQ Design, and Maintenance. Each strategy is described with respect to a series of attributes that are the headers along the top of Exhibit 1103-5. These attributes can help a designer understand more about the strategy and whether it would be beneficial (or appropriate) on their project. These attributes are guidelines and engineering judgment must be applied when a strategy is selected for inclusion in a project. The attributes shown in the headers across the top of Exhibit 1103-5 can be described as follows:
•

•
•
Speed: These are the speeds for which the strategy is typically applied. The definition of these speeds is found in Section 1103.05(1). Land Use: The land use context describes where the strategy is typically applied and reflects the future land use context. To successfully change context requires partnering with the stakeholders. For further information on land use context, see Chapter 1102. Hard/Soft Infrastructure: Hard infrastructure is a physical change that is relatively permanent. Soft infrastructure are items that can be easily changed or removed. Some items that are listed as soft can also be hard but are usually deployed as soft due to cost. Cost: Initial cost is what the items typically cost when first installed. The ongoing cost is what it would cost on an annual basis for maintenance. Ongoing cost does not cover if the item is damaged, vandalized, or stolen. These numbers should be adjusted for your location because project specific issues can impact the cost. Partners can contribute to either initial or ongoing maintenance cost through written agreements. Maintainability: The maintainability rating is based upon a scale of easy to hard and reflects the ease to conduct maintenance such as snow plowing, weed control, sweeping, restriping, setting up traffic control, and landscaping. Some of this work can be done by local agencies or private entities through written agreement. Consult with the people who will be conducting the maintenance to determine if there are design options that can decrease the need for maintenance.

Design Control Selection
1103.06 Control: Terrain Classification Terrain may limit operational and safety performance for particular modes. While terrain impacts may be addressed at specific locations, it is not cost beneficial to modify terrain continually throughout a corridor. The type of terrain, context, and speed influence the potential operating conditions of the highway and should be a consideration when selecting mobility performance targets (See Chapter 1101). For more information on grades, see Chapter 1220. To provide a general reference between terrain and geometric design, three classifications of terrain have been established: 1. Level: Level to moderately rolling, this terrain offers few or no obstacles to the construction of a highway having continuously unrestricted horizontal and vertical alignment. 2. Rolling: Hills and foothills, with slopes that rise and fall gently; however, occasional steep slopes might offer some restriction to horizontal and vertical alignment. 3. Mountainous: Rugged foothills; high, steep drainage divides; and mountain ranges. Designate terrain as it pertains to the general character along the alignment of a corridor. Roadways in valleys or passes in mountainous areas might have the characteristics of roads traversing level or rolling terrain and are usually classified as level or rolling, rather than mountainous. See the Highway Log for terrain classification.

1104.01 General Washington State Department of Transportation practical design policy requires formulating and evaluating alternatives while considering acceptable performance trade-offs to meet the need(s) of a project at the lowest level of investment. This chapter discusses how:
•
•
Information determined from planning phases and Chapter 1101, Chapter 1102, and Chapter 1103 is utilized in alternative solution formation To evaluate the alternative solutions developed
1104.02 Environmental Documentation Considerations This chapter presents methods for developing alternatives. For projects requiring an Environmental Assessment (EA) or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), a final proposed alternative may only be determined through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process and/or the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) process (see Chapter 400 of the Environmental Manual for more information). If an EA or EIS has not been initiated under NEPA/SEPA, follow the procedures in this chapter. To help advance the project, consider and use appropriate NEPA/SEPA terminology. Perform public and agency outreach and document all information regarding alternatives development for use later in the NEPA/SEPA process, according to 23 USC 168 (d). Terminology used in this chapter assumes that NEPA/SEPA have not been initiated. In the event that the NEPA/SEPA process has been initiated and an EA or EIS will be required, coordinate with the region Environmental Office staff to make sure that this alternative formulation and evaluation is performed in accordance with NEPA/SEPA guidance.
1104.03 Alternative Solution Formulation Identify alternatives that address the baseline need while balancing the performance trade-offs identified in the process. This performance-based, data-driven approach can include analysis of multimodal trade-offs and the formulation of multimodal/intermodal solutions, potentially reducing travel demand. Reference need identification and contributing factor analysis (CFA) in the alternative solution formulation (see Chapter 1101 and Contributing Factors subsection of the Guidance Document for more information). Beyond the no-build option, conduct alternative solutions formulation according to the following principles:
•
•
•
•
Formulate alternatives that are compatible with context and design controls. Provide at least one alternative for evaluation that employs lower-cost approaches and efficiencies, such as Transportation Systems Management and Operations strategies (see Section 1100.04(6)). Consider incremental, phased solutions. Formulate alternatives that address, but do not exceed, the specific needs and problems. Consider possible forward compatible alternatives to better allow for future improvements.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1104-1
Chapter 1104
•
Alternatives Analysis
Form solutions around contributing factors or the underlying root reason(s) identified from CFA. Address the underlying root reason(s) determined from CFA in at least one alternative.
Evaluate the relative benefit between each alternative against the baseline (typically the no-build option) and contextual performance metrics to determine the optimally performing solution for the least cost. (See Section 1104.04(3) for information on calculating the benefit/cost of alternatives.) Document the multimodal, environmental, operations, safety, maintenance and other impacts of the alternatives as appropriate. Planning phase corridor sketches or studies may be used to identify WSDOT’s strategy for the corridor. If a planning phase has occurred, develop at least one alternative based on the strategy identified in the planning report. See the Alternative Strategies and Solutions subsection of the Guidance Document for more information regarding different strategies that may be considered. If a planning study has developed specific alternatives, and those alternatives are still relevant, carry those alternatives into the alternative evaluation process.
1104.03(1) Complete Streets Alternatives (New Section 2023) In addition to the preceding guidance to consider during alternatives formulation, the following additional requirements apply to Complete Streets projects and are generally the responsibility of the Project Engineer in consultation with the Complete Streets (CS) Team, with support from subject matter experts such as Region Traffic office. During the alternatives formulation process, develop and recommend several Complete Streets alternatives that specifically address and are in alignment with one or more of the following strategies:
•
•
•
•
minor investments in existing facilities that can serve in place of additional investment on the state route reallocation of existing space to active transportation modes (See NCHRP 1036 Guide for Roadway Cross Section Reallocation for more information) expanding the cross section to accommodate active transportation modes, and measures to reduce vehicle speeds increase separation in order to achieve the target level of traffic stress
Once alternatives have been developed, seek feedback from the affected community, through a specific and targeted outreach effort, on the concepts developed during the alternatives formulation process described above. Incorporate feedback as appropriate to modify and improve the alternatives. Once feedback has been considered and incorporated, capture the findings in the BOD.
1104.04 Alternative Solution Evaluation Alternative solution evaluation involves analyzing the design year performance benefits provided by a solution with respect to the amortized cost. It is the intent of the alternative solution evaluation process to:
•
•
•
•
Compare solutions that resolve the baseline need(s) in consideration with the benefits or impacts associated with the contextual needs. Analyze the relative value of each alternative, including associated performance trade-offs. Considerations should also include agency risks, resource constraints, and life cycle operating and maintenance costs. Mitigate unacceptable performance trade-offs with proven countermeasures. Refine targets if mitigation measures applied yield unacceptable performance trade-offs.

Chapter 1104
Alternatives Analysis
1104.04(1) Alternatives Comparison WSDOT’s alternatives comparison process is intended to align with performance-based decision-making. The process is complementary to a practical design approach. The process centers around achieving the basic performance need, while understanding and when necessary, mitigating for the potential effects to other performance areas. Use the Alternative Comparison Table (ACT) within the BOD to assist in evaluating alternatives with respect to the anticipated performance of each identified baseline and contextual needs, as well as other identified impacts to the project location associated with each alternative. The intent of comparing alternatives is to:
•
•
•
•
•
Obtain an alternative solution for the least cost while understanding associated performance trade-offs. Compare alternatives against their ability to accomplish the baseline need. Evaluate alternatives against their relative effects on contextual needs. Provide the opportunity to incorporate mitigation or countermeasures. Document alternative formulation and evaluation outcomes that are consistent with the environmental process and expectations.
Note that if there are a large number of contextual needs and other impacts under consideration, it may be beneficial to prioritize or use a weighted evaluation of the contextual needs in order to expedite the alternative evaluation. As discussed in Section 1104.03, at least one alternative based on the outcome of Contributing Factors Analysis should be compared against other alternatives.
1104.04(2) Performance Trade-off Decisions In performance trade-off decisions, the intent is to give priority to the project’s baseline needs. However, there will be situations where evaluations reveal that trade-offs are too significant, and there is an inability to adequately resolve them with low-cost countermeasures, phased solutions, or general acceptance of the performance trade-off. In these situations, it is appropriate to consider alternatives that still optimize the baseline performance metric, but do not necessarily obtain initial performance targets. Document refined performance targets on the Basis of Design. Whether a design alternative achieves a particular contextual performance target is a consideration during the tradeoffs analysis. When no alternative adequately balances performance, lower-cost countermeasures can be employed to help mitigate performance issues and improve the viability of alternatives. Modifications to one or more design controls are another approach that can be used to achieve performance targets (see Chapter 1103), without adding cost. If all alternatives fail to find an acceptable performance balance targets may be refined. Document changes to performance targets using the Basis of Design.
1104.04(3) Benefit/Cost Analysis The overall benefit/cost for the alternatives proposed is inherent with understanding the performance tradeoffs being considered. Although a factor for all potential alternatives, in some cases, decisions will be based on quantifiable life cycle operating and maintenance costs, as discussed in Chapter 301. Some perceived benefits are a challenge to quantify and will need analysis such as that discussed in NCHRP Report 642: Quantifying the Benefits of Context Sensitive Solutions: www.trb.org/Publications/Blurbs/162282.aspx

Alternatives Analysis
1104.05 Preferred Alternative The Project Team consults with the Advisory Team for input on the appropriate tools to employ when selecting the alternative to move forward and review the Alternatives Comparison Table and any other relevant documentation related to the alternatives evaluation. The goal is to select the alternative based on documented input from of all team members, included any changes, mitigation, tradeoffs to incorporate into the selected alternative as a result of this review. The Project Engineer provides the final approval of the selected alternative, and also assumes responsibility for the alternative selection decision. Projects identified to implement Complete Streets may develop alternatives that propose to defer scope or Complete Streets elements, in part or whole, to a future project. The decision to defer work is approved by the Region Administrator or designee (See Design Bulletin #2023-01).
1104.06 Documentation The Alternative Comparison Table (ACT) is used to assist in evaluating alternatives. Alternative formulation and evaluation will also be documented through the NEPA process. Environmental staff will help account for consistency with the environmental process, expectations and requirements throughout any alternative formulation and evaluation that occurs within project development.

Design Element Selection Exhibit 1105-1 Required Design Elements
1105.01 General Design elements are specific components associated with roadway design, such as lane widths, shoulder widths, alignments, clear zone, etc. Design controls (see Chapter 1103) are carefully chosen and used to determine the dimensions of design elements. The relative effect that a given design element will have on performance will depend on the selected design controls and context identification. For more information, see the guidance document section titled The Research Summary of Different Design Elements on Performance.
1105.02 Selecting Design Elements Design elements that are included in a project are documented in the Basis of Design. Include the design elements that are changed by the project. (See Chapter 1100 for more information about Basis of Design.) An element is changed if one of the following applies:
•
•
•
A new element is added An existing element is removed or relocated A dimension - such as a width - is modified
A design element that is not changed is not documented in the Basis of Design. The next step after selecting design elements is to choose the appropriate dimension for each element. (See Chapter 1106 for information on selecting design element dimensions.)
1105.02(1) Required Design Elements and Criteria There are also additional legal and policy-based considerations that require a decision of whether or not to include certain design elements in a project; this depends on the program or sub-program. See Exhibit 1105-1 for additional information regarding whether or not to include these design elements in a project.

Exhibit 1105-1 Notes: [1] Include the element in the project and apply policy and guidance provided in the Design Manual chapter(s) or section(s) listed in the cell. [2] Include the element in the project and apply the policy and guidance provided in the Design Manual chapter(s) or section(s) listed in the cell only when the element is changed as described in Section 1105.02. [3] Consult the Assistant State Design Engineer (ASDE), evaluate the site specific need to determine whether to apply the policy and guidance provided in the Design Manual chapter(s) or section(s) listed in the cell.* [4] Include the element in the project when it is changed as described in Section 1105.02. If the element is to be included, apply the policy and guidance provided in Chapter 1120, as well as that provided in the Design Manual chapter(s) or section(s) listed in the cell. * The ASDE is responsible for bringing in other expertise as needed from appropriate HQ units such as Traffic, Programming, Planning, etc. to collaborate in the decision to include the element in the project.
1105.03 Related Elements Design elements can be interrelated. Even if a specific design element has not changed in accordance with the definition in Section 1105.02, consider whether or not the preferred alternative has changed the conditions in a way that may affect the performance of an unchanged element, considering all modes. Example: A project team proposes to provide a left-turn lane along a portion of their project in order to address a baseline need related to safety for turning traffic, by reducing the width of each highway shoulder. By reducing the shoulder width, the traveled way will be closer to the roadside than in the existing condition. The project team determines whether the project would adversely affect safety performance due to roadside conditions such as steep slopes or objects in the clear zone along with considering impacts to bike and pedestrian use.
1105.04 Documentation Document design elements that are changed in Section 5 of the Basis of Design (BOD) form unless the exemptions listed in Section 1100.05(1) apply. As a design alternative matures over time, it is likely that design elements may be added or dropped through the iterative process inherent with design. It is important to update the Basis of Design documentation with these changes at the various documentation and approval milestones.

Design Element Dimensions Exhibit 1106-1 Dimensioning Guidance Variations Exhibit 1106-2 Mode/Function/Performance Approach
When choosing any dimension, read the guidance for the specific facility type (for example, for ramps see Chapter 1360) and also read the guidance for the specific element (for example for side slopes see Chapter 1239). When a range of dimensions is given, consider modal needs, required function, and desired performance (Section 1106.03) and, where possible, use quantitative tools to help choose a dimension within the range.
1106.01 General Practical design resolves the project need with the least investment. Flexibility in the choice of design element dimensions helps accomplish this. For guidance related to geometric cross-section elements, first see Chapter 1230. For guidance related to all other design elements, see the appropriate chapter.
1106.02 Choosing Dimensions Depending on the facility type, Design Manual guidance may come in the form of a single dimension or a range of dimensions to choose from. See Exhibit 1106-1. For some roadways, the optimum solution is very dependent on the location (context) of the roadway. In these cases, you will likely see a range of widths to choose from. For example, the geometric cross section guidance chapters for highways (Chapter 1231) and freeways (Chapter 1232) show cross-sections that list ranges to choose from for lane and shoulder widths. The mode/function/performance approach described in Section 1106.03 is the tool to be used to choose the appropriate width from the range given.

Design Element Dimensions
Exhibit 1106-1 Dimensioning Guidance Variations
Example: Exhibit 1360-21 calls out one specific dimension for the lane width of this section of a parallel off connection.
Example: Exhibit 1231-2 calls out a range of dimensions for the lane width. When a single dimension is given: If the decision is to use the dimension shown, no further evaluation is needed; just document the dimension choice on the Design Parameter Sheets. If a particular roadway warrants use of a dimension that is different than the value given, the mode/function/performance approach described in Section 1106.03 can be used to determine the appropriate dimension. Results will need to be documented in a Design Analysis. When a range of widths is given: Understand any width considerations specific to the design element (for example, lane width considerations are described in Chapter 1231). Use the mode/function/performance approach described in Section 1106.03 to choose the appropriate value within the range. If the dimension chosen is within the range given in the Design Manual, document the reasoning in the Design Parameter Sheets. If the value chosen is outside of the given range, document the decision in a Design Analysis. Some dimension choices can be complex, and involve trade-off evaluations, including comparisons of alternatives, benefit/cost analysis, etc. In these instances, it may be appropriate to record the dimension choice on the Design Parameter Sheets and reference any related documents that support the dimension choice.
1106.03 The Mode/Function/Performance Approach The mode/function/performance approach is the primary methodology to apply when a range of dimensions is given. Utilizing this approach ensures that modal needs, the function of the design element, and safety and mobility performance have all been considered. For example, lanes and shoulders have to accommodate the modes that use the roadway, provide functions that are appropriate for the specific roadway, and provide appropriate safety and mobility performance.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1106-2
Chapter 1106
Design Element Dimensions
Modes, function and performance overlap and are interrelated. These considerations are part of a tradeoffs discussion. Cost is always a consideration in a tradeoffs discussion. Engineering judgment and stakeholder involvement will be required. Exhibit 1106-2 Mode/Function/Performance Approach
Modal accommodation: It is important to understand the modal needs for a roadway. Accommodating a specific mode (or modes) may influence the dimension choice. For example, it is important to understand the vehicle mix that will be using the lanes and to understand the modes that will be using the shoulder. For lanes, a significant number of trucks and oversized vehicles may affect the lane width choice, especially if the alignment is not tangent. Read Chapter 1231 when choosing lane widths. For shoulders, it is important to understand bicyclist and pedestrian use. The width requirements that come with accommodating various modes are discussed in Chapter 1239. Function(s): Function is closely related to modal accommodation. Providing a specific function may drive the dimension choice. For example, the shoulder width requirements that come with providing various functions bring a wide range of associated widths (see Exhibit 1239-2, Shoulder Function & Modal Accommodation Width Considerations). Performance: When choosing a dimension from a range of possible choices, consider safety performance and mobility performance. Meeting safety or mobility performance targets may drive the dimension choice. When evaluating performance, the use of quantitative engineering methods and tools is encouraged whenever possible. See Section 1106.05 for more information on quantitative tools and methodology for evaluating safety and mobility performance. An important consideration of performance evaluation is whether or not the project has an identified baseline (or contextual) safety need. If safety need has been identified, performance metrics and targets may play a major role in choosing dimensions. See Chapter 1101. For some projects, modal accommodation needs may drive lane and shoulder width decisions. In other cases, the need to provide a specific function may drive width decisions. And, in some cases, meeting established performance targets may drive width decisions. Regardless of whether modal accommodation, function, or performance drives the dimension choice, the effect of the decision on mobility and safety performance has to be considered.

Design Element Dimensions
Accommodating modal needs, providing specific functions, or achieving specific performance targets may require widths that can bring significant investments. Consider the cost and associated trade-offs, and document why it is worthy of the associated investment. In addition to being the primary method to choose a dimension when a range of dimensions is given, the mode/function/performance approach can also be used in support of a Design Analysis.
1106.04 Design up Method When a range of dimensions is given, guidance may specifically require a “design up” approach. For example, Chapter 1231 requires a design up approach for state highways other than freeways. Design up means considering the smallest dimension first. Increasing dimensions are then considered until the smallest dimension is identified that accommodates modal needs, provides the desired functions, and provides appropriate safety and mobility performance. Using the mode/function/performance approach described in Section 1106.03 is an important part of design up.
1106.05 Quantitative Analysis Methods and Tools Currently, two primary tools exist to quantitatively evaluate performance; the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) for evaluating modal safety performance and the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) for evaluating traffic operational mobility performance.
1106.05(1) Highway Safety Manual and Safety Modeling Safety is and always has been a primary performance category for WSDOT. Past design policy relied on the assumption that the application of design criteria equated to a desired level of safety performance for the expenditure. This assumption may not have always been true for all locations given their operational and geometric characteristics. The strict application of criteria to achieve safety performance is known as “nominal safety.” To achieve a more reliable safety performance, scientific estimation of crashes using site conditions is necessary and is termed “substantive safety.” A new understanding of safety performance, crash modification factors, and roadway functions has led to a growing body of knowledge about the relationship between roadway characteristics and safety performance. The application of the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) and its companion tools provides an understanding of how a particular design can perform with respect to safety. This enables analysis of safety-specific performance metrics that may be more critical to address. The HSM covers multiple transportation road types and can be a valuable tool to analyze various geometric alternatives in any program type. For guidance regarding whether or not to include a baseline safety need see Chapter 1101. For more information on sustainable highway safety tools and analysis, see Chapter 321.
1106.05(2) Highway Capacity Manual and Traffic Modeling The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) provides quantitative methods for evaluating mobility operational performance. However, some quantitative outputs from some HCM methods are specific to free-flow speed operations or level of service, and may not be appropriate for use given the baseline mobility performance metric selected for a specific location. Traffic modeling software provides a more relevant method for understanding the mobility operational performance; however, the reliability of the outputs varies given the traffic forecasting for design years further in the future. Utilize traffic modeling to ascertain potential mobility operational performance whenever feasible. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Design Element Dimensions
1106.06 Documenting Dimensions While a primary function of the Basis of Design is to document the design elements selected to be included in a project, another primary function of the Design Parameter Sheets is to document the dimensions chosen for the various design elements included in a project. Important Note: If the dimension for an existing design element does not change, no documentation is required on the Design Parameter sheets. A Design Parameter Sheet entry left blank means that the element was not selected to be included in the project. (See Chapter 1105 for design element selection guidance.) A Design Parameter Sheet template can be found here: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/designtopics/design-tools-and-support#Tools.
1106.07 Design Analysis A Design Analysis is required when a dimension chosen does not meet the value, or fall within the range of values, provided for that element in the Design Manual (see Chapter 300.) The considerations described in Section 1106.03 may be useful when completing a Design Analysis.

Preservation Projects
1120.01 General 1120.02 Roadway Preservation (P1) 1120.03 Structures Preservation (P2) and Other Facilities (P3)
1120.01 General This chapter identifies those elements and features to be evaluated and potentially addressed during the course of a preservation project. The elements listed here may be in addition to the project need identified in the Project Summary or Basis of Design. See Sections 1120.02(12) for P1 projects, or 1120.03(1) for P2 and P3 Projects. Preservation projects may also provide opportunities for project partnering and retrofit options involving additional elements (for example see Section 1231.08). In addition to the guidance in this chapter, preservation projects with total costs greater than $500,000 will be analyzed and screened to determine whether the project will be required to incorporate the principles of Complete Streets. Projects requiring Complete Streets must complete a Basis of Design to address and document the Complete Street design requirements (geometric, cross section, intersection, etc.). Follow all guidance provided for that purpose (Chapter 1100 – 1106, and other relevant geometric design chapters). Preservation projects are funded in three sub-program areas: Roadway Preservation (P1) projects preserve pavement structure, extend pavement service life, and restore the roadway for reasonably safe operations of the travel modes accommodated by the facility. Structures Preservation (P2) projects preserve the state’s bridge network through cost-effective actions. There are numerous types of bridge preservation actions including: deck rehabilitation, seismic retrofit, painting steel bridges, scour repair, and others. Other Facilities (P3) projects preserve the function of guardrail and signing, major drainage, major electrical, unstable slopes, and other assets. For required design elements in these programs see Exhibit 1105-1. Existing roadside safety devices (see Section 1600.01) may remain in place unless a project scope specifically identifies it for replacement. Specific guidance for repair of certain existing devices is also provided (see Section 1120.02). When a roadside safety device replacement is required, and a policy specific to the device is not found in this chapter (or in scoping instructions for P2 and P3 projects), apply the most recent standard described in Division 16 when selecting a replacement.
1120.02 Roadway Preservation (P1) This section applies to features and design elements to be addressed on Roadway Preservation (P1) projects. See Section 1120.02(12) for instructions on using the Basis of Design to document design elements that are changed by the project.
1120.02(1) Adjust Existing Features Adjust existing features such as monuments, catch basins, drainage grates, and access covers that are affected by resurfacing. Where drainage grates and gutter pans require adjustment or replacement, replace with designs that accommodate bicycle traffic (see Drainage Grates and Manhole Covers in Chapter 1520). For guidance on existing curb see Chapter 1239. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1120-1
Chapter 1120
Preservation Projects
1120.02(2) ADA requirements Address ADA requirements according to WSDOT policy (see Chapter 1510 and any active project delivery memorandums or design memorandums).
1120.02(3) Cross slope lane Rebuild the cross slope to a minimum 1.5% when the existing cross slope is flatter than 1.5% and the steeper slope is needed to provide adequate highway runoff. See Chapter 1250 for more information about cross slope.
1120.02(4) Cross slope shoulder When rebuilding the lane cross slope, evaluate shoulder cross slope in accordance with Chapter 1250.
1120.02(5) Vertical clearance Paving projects, seismic retrofit, and other project work can change the vertical clearances of structures. For preservation projects other than bridge replacement that have no widening on or under the bridge, the minimum structure clearance is 14.5 feet. Existing structures with a vertical clearance less than 14.5 feet require a Design Analysis. If the vertical clearance of a structure will be changed by the project, use Sections 720.03(5)(c) and 1020.03(2) for vertical clearance requirements. Include vertical clearance and any other changed geometrics in the Basis of Design, the Design Parameters sheets, and the Design Documentation Package. See DM Section 720.03(5)(c) for details about bridge clearances for existing structures and Section 1020.03(2) for vertical clearance of overhead sign assemblies. Contact the Commercial Vehicle Services Office when changes to vertical clearance are planned.
1120.02(6) Delineation Install and replace delineation in accordance with Chapter 1030 (this includes pavement markings, guideposts, and barrier delineation).
1120.02(7) Barrier and Terminal Heights When the preservation project design, other than a chip seal or BST, will affect the elevation of the pavement adjacent to a guardrail, terminal, and/or transition, measure the height of those systems within the project limit and adjacent to pavement edges, curbs, or sidewalks prior to construction.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1120-2
Chapter 1120
Preservation Projects
Measure the height to the top of the rail element from the outside paved shoulder edge when no curb is present, from the gutter line when guardrail is set above a curb, or from the sidewalk elevation if set behind a sidewalk. Guidance for this situation:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
When the height of existing Type 1 guardrail, crashworthy terminals, and/or transitions will fall outside the height range from 26.5” to 31” (26.5” to 30” for terminals) in the project’s completed condition; the existing guardrail, terminals, and/or transitions must be adjusted to a minimum height of 28” up to a maximum height of 30”. This includes buried terminals that slope down such that the guardrail height is reduced to less than 26.5-inches (measured in relation to a 10H:1V line extended from the breakpoint at edge of shoulder). See Section 1610.04(3) for acceptable options to raise standard runs of guardrail, and Section 1610.04(5) for raising guardrail terminals. Replace the Type 1 guardrail system with a Type 31 guardrail system if its height cannot be adjusted to fall within the specified range. When the height of existing Type 31 guardrail, crashworthy terminals, and/or transitions will fall outside the height range from 28” to 32” in the project’s completed condition; the existing guardrail, terminals, and/or transitions must be adjusted to a height of 31”. This includes buried terminals that slope down such that the guardrail height is reduced to less than 28-inches (measured in relation to a 10H:1V line extended from the breakpoint at edge of shoulder). See Section 1610.04(3) for acceptable options to raise standard runs of guardrail, and Section 1610.04(5) for raising guardrail terminals. Replace the existing Type 31 guardrail system with a new Type 31 guardrail system if its height cannot be adjusted to fall within the specified range. When non-crashworthy terminals need to be raised, replace them with crashworthy terminals. Provide replacement terminals in accordance with Section 1610.04(5)(a or b). Non-crashworthy terminals and anchors that are effectively shielded by another barrier do not warrant replacement. When guardrail needs to be raised, evaluate the guardrail length of need in accordance with Chapter 1610. Notify Region Program Management if the length of need extension will be longer than 250 feet. Extending length of need further than 250 feet is beyond the scope of the pavement preservation. Note that removal is an option if guardrail is no longer needed based on the guidance in Chapter 1600 and Chapter 1610. Document the location of removal and the reasoning for removal in the Design Documentation Package. When adjusting terminals that are equipped with CRT posts, the top-drilled holes in the posts need to be at the surface of the ground. When designing a pavement overlay in front of concrete barriers (Type 2, Type F, Single Slope), follow policy guidance shown Section 1610.06(2) for allowable barrier minimum heights after the overlay. Contact HQ Bridge for allowable bridge barrier minimum heights resulting from a pavement overlay.
1120.02(8) Barrier Condition (New Section 2023) Remove and replace existing barrier that has been determined to not be in serviceable condition. See Section 1610.03(2). If a roadside safety device within the project limits does not meet NCHRP 350 or MASH testing standards, then replace the device with a comparable MASH device. See Section 1610.03(2).

Preservation Projects
1120.02(9) Barrier Removal or Replacement (New Section 2023) When raising barrier height or addressing barrier condition per Sections 1120.02(7) or 1120.02(8), barrier removal is also an option if the barrier is no longer needed based on the guidance provided in Chapter 1600 and Chapter 1610. In the case of a decision to remove barrier, document the location of the barrier removal and the reasoning in the Design Documentation Package.
1120.02(10) Pavement Edge Treatment Adding a pavement edge treatment is a low-cost feature to improve safety performance for errant vehicles that depart and try to reenter the roadway. A pavement edge treatment can also help maintain the structural integrity of the roadway and pavement performance at the edge of the roadway by resisting the start of pavement cracking and/or pavement raveling. Where practicable, install a pavement edge treatment at locations where asphalt concrete pavement is applied to the outside edge of the existing pavement. Examples where pavement edge treatment may not be practicable include locations with roadside barrier and/or curb. After installing the pavement edge treatment, trim shoulders with material that is graded back over the edge treatment and flush with the paved roadway surface. Where the project does not affect the existing shoulder edge condition, such as during chip seal applications or “mill and fill” activities, and there is an existing vertical drop at the outside edge of the paved shoulder, apply crushed surfacing material to eliminate the edge and provide a smooth surface. For more information about pavement edge treatment, contact the HQ Design Office, and visit the FHWA website at: www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovation/everydaycounts/edc-1/safetyedge.cfm
1120.02(11) Rumble Strips Potential new rumble strip locations are identified using a benefit cost analysis performed by HQ Design. Refer to sections 1600.05(1), 1600.05(1)(b), and 1600.05(1)(c) when notified by HQ that rumble strip installation or rehabilitation needs to be considered during scoping or design. These sections will also provide guidance on whether a low-noise design is appropriate for the location. Bituminous Surface Treatment (BST or chip seal) applications have been observed to reduce the depth of rumble strip millings by approximately 1/8” per application. Although rumble strips have a minimum depth shown on the applicable standard plan during original installation, research has shown that a rumble strip minimum depth of ¼” can still be considered functional. Therefore, only re-install rumble strips when a pavement preservation project is anticipated to reduce the depth of a rumble strip to less than ¼” during the course of project activities (such as a BST application). Existing rumble strip depth may be determined by direct measurement or through BST history (contact the region Materials Engineer). When re-installing rumble strips, contact the region Materials Engineer to review options and determine the best approach to rumble strip re-installation and sequence. Methods for determining milling depth in the field, and reliably establishing route BST history are still in development. Contact your ASDE for more information.
1120.02(12) Horizontal Chain-Link Fence Rails (New Section 2023) Replace or modify existing chain-link fence located within the Design Clear Zone per Section 1600.03(2)(i).

1120.02(13) Documentation (P1) For Roadway Preservation (P1) projects, use the Basis of Design and Design Parameter Sheets to document decisions when the project changes design elements that are not listed in Section 1120.02(1) through 1120.02(12).
1120.03 Structures Preservation (P2) and Other Facilities (P3) For Structures Preservation (P2) and Other Facilities (P3) projects see the scoping instructions specific to the sub-program and type of work to determine the likely design elements to be addressed by the project. If there are questions about project scope or policy requirements, consult your Assistant State Design Engineer (ASDE).
1120.03(1) Documentation (P2 and P3) See Chapter 300 for documentation requirements. If the project changes a geometric design element, replaces an existing bridge, or installs a new bridge additional documentation may be required; contact your ASDE to discuss appropriate documentation.

1130.01 Overview This chapter pertains to WSDOT’s Development Services involvement with land use development proposals and projects led by local jurisdictions, transit agencies, tribes, and developers. This chapter provides policy and instruction to WSDOT Region Development Services staff. It is also intended as a reference for SEPA lead agencies and developers WSDOT engages with on land use reviews and transportation mitigation. WSDOT staff engage with these partners to identify the impacts and the opportunities that come with land use changes, seeking informed, contextually balanced multimodal mitigation through the SEPA lead agency. Mitigation means to reduce significant adverse impacts, to help preserve the state multimodal transportation system. Our Development Services program is administered by Region staff who have knowledge of state highways, including maintenance and operations, infrastructure, and other needs of the multimodal transportation system. Regions have established contacts with lead agencies that permit development. Regions review land use developments for impacts to the state transportation system, process permit applications, administer state highway access connections, and have a role in mitigation for developments. WSDOT’s goal is to provide a safe, sustainable, and integrated multimodal transportation system for all Washington travelers, regardless of age, ability, income, ethnicity, or mode of transportation. Added automobile trips to and from new development often result in impacts to the transportation system which can be costly to mitigate while also inducing more auto-based travel. WSDOT encourages partners to promote solutions that better support multimodal options. Development that supports access by walking, bicycling, and transit is essential towards reaching this goal. This chapter:
•

Lists the common types of development mitigation. Describes the nexus between WSDOT’s Development Services program and state law, specifically the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and the Growth Management Act (GMA). Describes parties’ roles and responsibilities in the development process. Presents multimodal data and threshold criteria needed to conduct professional reviews and analyses of proposed developments. Guides staff and partners in the agreement-making and permit processes. Describes WSDOT policy, procedures, manuals, and forms required to successfully design and construct a mitigation project on the state highway system. Describes the construction document preparation process. Describes the construction oversight and final inspection/acceptance process. Defines requirements for documentation.

Aside from this chapter, Region Staff and partners are directed to other chapters of this Design Manual, Development Services web-based guidance, and WSDOT manuals needed to successfully carry out this work. References are provided throughout. Types of development mitigation include:
•
•
•
Developer funded and constructed transportation improvements; Financial contributions to programmed WSDOT or local agency projects; and/or Dedication of property for right of way.
Developer Community Engagement The Developer should plan and budget for leading outreach and community engagement for development mitigation projects on the state transportation system.
1130.02 WSDOT Development Services Policy Our policy is to engage with our partners during planning and project development processes, to be part of the land use and transportation decision making. Our goal is to collaborate, to review and identify traffic impacts of new development as well as opportunities to reduce vehicle miles travelled. Region Development Services is our agency’s contact for SEPA reviews. Staff exercise WSDOT’s legal authority and interest to engage local agencies, tribes, and developers on land use development proposals and seek mitigation for significant adverse impacts to the state multimodal transportation system resulting from development. SEPA is discussed in Section 1130.04. Regions have local knowledge about development trends and multimodal highway operations and performance needs, planning study recommendations, and other considerations that influence analysis and identification of mitigation alternatives. Development Services staff engage region experts including planning, maintenance, traffic, environmental, design and construction, active transportation, utilities, hydraulics, local programs, real estate, and others to support the process and to inform analysis and decision making about mitigation. WSDOT Regional Development Services staff collaborate with and support jurisdictions with land use authority and developers through these activities:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Serve as a project manager for the project’s progress through the necessary WSDOT processes to contribute to project success. Promote greater consideration of the state’s transportation systems and modal assets during local land use planning and decision-making. Review and provide technical input on various proposals (SEPA documents, Transportation Impact Assessments (TIAs), and other documents) on how development plans may affect the Highway System Plan, active transportation connectivity and crossings, comprehensive plans, operations, safety, and region surplus property reviews. Evaluate appropriate contextual mitigation strategies. Make binding decisions while negotiating with developers and local agencies to resolve issues related to land use development plans impacting state facilities proposed by private developers and land owners, local agencies, tribes, transit and human services transportation agencies, and ports. Understand application of local regulations, WSDOT policies, threshold criteria, state laws and statutes, and administrative rules related to SEPA and GMA. Explain different possible ways to mitigate effects and provide multimodal options.

Facilitate successful mitigation projects by guiding developers through our processes, explaining the data and information we need to successfully support their projects. Provide developers with WSDOT compliance and standards for design and construction; help expedite their mitigation projects on the state transportation system. Serve as WSDOT’s representative for land use related hearings and processes. Administer the state’s access management program.
1130.03 Local Agency and WSDOT Authority 1130.03(1) Local Decision-Making Authority Under SEPA and GMA, a local government makes local land use decisions. The local decision-making authority is typically delegated to a hearings officer, planning commission, city council, board of commissioners, or an administrative body such as a Variance Committee or Design Commission. Each type of land use action has prescribed procedures. Different kinds of procedures are subject to different requirements regarding public notice, participation, approval criteria, hearings, and appeal deadlines. WAC 197-11-050 specifies that the lead agency shall be the agency with main responsibility for complying with SEPA's procedural requirements and shall be the only agency responsible for:
•
•
The SEPA threshold determination; and Preparation and content of environmental impact statements.
1130.03(2) WSDOT’s Role in Development Review WSDOT’s authority to review land use proposals and request or require mitigation is founded in state law, specifically the State Environmental Policy Act, the Growth Management Act, and through our state managed and limited highway access connections laws, policies and procedures.
•
•
•
•
•
•
WAC 197-11-920 regards WSDOT as possessing special environmental expertise relating to transportation; and as an agency with expertise in the local development review process similar to local and state water, sewer, or fire protection agencies. As an agency that possesses special expertise in the state transportation system, WSDOT has established standards, policies, and mitigation thresholds for system function, safety, and performance, particularly for driving trips. These standards, policies, thresholds, and local approval criteria are applied to the applicant’s development proposal to form WSDOT’s mitigation recommendations to the local government. When developers request connections to the state system, WSDOT may require improvements to the transportation system as a condition of issuance of a highway access permit. Any such requirement must be appropriate and reasonable to mitigate the impact to the transportation system resulting from the development. In other cases, WSDOT works with the lead agency and developer to request recommended development mitigation that is appropriate and reasonable. The responsibility for a land use decision is with the local governing body. Like other interested parties, when there is legal standing, WSDOT can appeal the local land-use decision.

Development Services
1130.04 State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) The State Environmental Protection Act (SEPA) requires state agencies, counties, cities, and public corporations to evaluate and determine mitigation for the environmental impacts of land use proposals. Provisions of SEPA require the lead agency to involve other agencies, tribes, and the public in most review processes prior to a final decision being made. Region Development Services staff review and comment, when warranted, on all (non-WSDOT) SEPA proposals forwarded to WSDOT for review and comment by lead agencies. WSDOT is considered an agency with transportation expertise and reviews all proposed development projects that are not exempt and that could possibly have significant adverse impacts on the state highway system. The following is from the Department of Ecology’s SEPA FAQ: Q: What is a "significant" adverse environmental impact? A: State SEPA rules defines "significant" as "a reasonable likelihood of more than a moderate adverse impact on environmental quality." The term “reasonable likelihood” means it is not remote or speculative. The phrase “more than moderate” is based on intensity and severity; intensity depends on the magnitude and duration of an impact while severity is weighed along with the likelihood of its occurrence. An impact may be significant if its chance of occurrence is not great, but the resulting environmental impact would be severe. The transportation thresholds in this chapter are what WSDOT identifies as significant so that mitigation can be requested and provided. While these are predominantly auto-based thresholds, WSDOT is a multimodal agency, and development of new performance metrics, and thresholds is expected. When WSDOT is permitting a development access connection to a state highway or is the permitting authority for another developer purpose on WSDOT right of way, WSDOT can require developers to mitigate impacts created by their developments. Otherwise, WSDOT works through the SEPA lead agency to fashion developer mitigation requirements.
1130.04(1) SEPA Proposals Under SEPA a proposal means a proposed action. A proposal includes both actions and regulatory decisions of agencies as well as any actions proposed by applicants. Proposals can be:
•
•
Project Action, such as new construction, demolition, landfills, and exchange of natural resources. Non-Project Action, such as comprehensive plans, zoning changes, and development regulations.
WSDOT involvement and SEPA review at the non-project stage can realize more benefits to the transportation system, as this is when there is the most latitude for adjustments.
Types of SEPA Proposals While some proposals are brought to the attention of WSDOT by the proponent or by Development Services staff reviewing the DOE SEPA Register, most project proposals are submitted to WSDOT by the applicable SEPA lead agency. The following are some of the typical submittals WSDOT receives: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

SEPA Exemptions Not all proposals require a SEPA review. Some project proposals will be categorically exempted from SEPA review if their size or type of activity is deemed unlikely to cause a significant adverse impact. WSDOT does not typically review projects with a CE SEPA determination. However, the agency does work with the project lead if there are non-SEPA WSDOT approvals or other actions needed. WAC 197-11-800 Categorical Exemption provides that some proposals can be exempted from SEPA reviews because the development falls within the established minimum SEPA thresholds. See this WAC for examples of exempt proposals. For more information about SEPA and requirements, see the WACs and Department of Ecology’s SEPA website. https://ecology.wa.gov/regulations-permits/SEPA-environmental-review Note that multiple exempted projects could affect WSDOT’s ability to review impacts fairly and accurately, and in the cumulative, could create an unforeseen adverse impact on the state transportation system. Consider developing an interlocal agreement with the lead agency, or other options.
1130.04(2) SEPA Development Proposals of Interest to WSDOT The type, location, and scale of a proposed development influences how WSDOT evaluates an individual project, and if mitigation is recommended, what forms that should take. WSDOT has high interest in proposals that would impact:
•
State transportation system operations and safety for all modes, including access to and from the state system.
•
Stormwater systems within WSDOT rights of way.
•
Utilities within WSDOT rights of way.
However, other impacts to the state highway system may occur, such as noise, light and glare, fencing requirements, legal load limits, or off-premises outdoor advertising impacts. Because of potential impacts, WSDOT has interest in many types of land use developments, including but not limited to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Site adjacent to or proposes access to state highway. Site not adjacent to the state highway but would contribute a “significant” number of trips to the highway. Land divisions or lot line adjustments for property with frontage on or proposed access to a state highway. Site located in footprint of future state highway or trail alignment. Proposed noise-sensitive land uses adjacent to state highways. Site located adjacent to a railroad right of way or could affect a state highway rail crossing. Site located adjacent to a trail, shared-use path, or sidewalk, or could affect a state highway crossing for active transportation users.Airport expansions. Land use/development proposals that could affect state airport expansions, such as cell towers, or noise-sensitive land uses in the vicinity of public use airports.

Multimodal Transportation and Contexts WSDOT is interested in how development can accommodate active transportation modes. Mixed use development could have a positive effect on multimodal trip generation, meaning reduced trips by automobile and increased trips by bicycling and walking. Review the multimodal considerations presented in Section 1130.09, as well as other chapters in this manual.
1130.04(3) Land Use Appeals Contact the HQ Access and Hearing office when considering a decision to appeal a land use determination by a local agency. WSDOT should also consult with the Washington State Attorney General’s Office. There are short timelines in which to file appeals. A time delay could prejudice WSDOT’s right to appeal.
1130.05 Growth Management Act (GMA) The GMA was adopted to address ways to accommodate growth while preserving and advancing a high quality of life in Washington. It requires many cities and counties, and other jurisdictions that choose to opt in, to complete comprehensive plans and establish development regulations. WSDOT’s interest in GMA and land use is as a tool to manage demand on the transportation system to contribute to the creation of productive, equitable, and sustainable places. Below are selected points in state law that recognize WSDOT and the state transportation system. This is not all inclusive and staff should have working knowledge of laws and rules. RCW 36.70A.020 Planning goals. The following are some of the stated goals to guide development and adoption of comprehensive plans and development regulations of those counties and cities that are required or choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040.
•
•
•
Urban growth. Encourage development in urban areas where adequate public facilities and services exist or can be provided in an efficient manner. Reduce sprawl. Reduce the inappropriate conversion of undeveloped land into sprawling, low-density development. Transportation. Encourage efficient multimodal transportation systems that are based on regional priorities and coordinated with county and city comprehensive plans.
RCW 36.70A.040 Who must plan. Specifies which agencies must plan and allows others to choose to opt into the planning process. This process includes preparing and updating comprehensive plans. RCW 36.70A.070 Comprehensive plans—Mandatory elements. This state law requires certain elements to be addressed in plans, including transportation. The comprehensive plan of a county or city that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 shall address transportation. The following points about transportation elements are based on RCW 36.70A.070(6).

Development Services
A transportation element implements, and is consistent with, the land use element. A transportation element must also contain subelements:
•
•
•
Land use assumptions used in estimating travel. Estimated traffic impacts to state-owned transportation facilities resulting from land use assumptions to assist in monitoring the performance of state facilities, to plan improvements for the facilities, and to assess the impact of land-use decisions on state-owned transportation facilities. Facilities and services needs.
The Facilities and Services requirements of comprehensive plans contain multiple provisions, many of which are described here:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
An inventory of transportation facilities and services, including transit alignments, and state-owned transportation facilities within city or county jurisdictions. Level of service standards for all locally owned arterials and transit routes to serve as a gauge to judge performance of the system. These standards should be regionally coordinated. Address state-owned transportation facilities, level of service standards for highways, as prescribed in chapters 47.06 and 47.80 RCW, to gauge the performance of the system. LOS standards are used to monitor performance of the state system, to evaluate improvement strategies, and to facilitate coordination between governments. Concurrency requirements generally do not apply to transportation facilities and services of statewide significance. Specific actions and requirements apply to locally owned transportation facilities or services that are below an established LOS standard. Ten-year traffic forecasts based on the adopted land use plan are used to inform on the location, timing, and capacity needs of future growth. Identification of state and local system needs to meet current and future demands, consistent with the statewide multimodal transportation plan required under Chapter 47.06 RCW. Collaborative efforts to identify improvements for pedestrian and bicycle facilities and corridors as well as TDM solutions to transportation needs.
GMA requires concurrency for transportation facilities. For transportation, concurrency means improvements or strategies are in place at the time of development, or that commitment is in place to complete the improvements or strategies within six years. The purpose of concurrency is to ensure that the public facilities and services necessary to support development are adequate to serve that development at the time it is available for occupancy and use, without decreasing service levels below established minimum standards. Level of Service (LOS) and Local Planning. The GMA requires local agencies to include the LOS standards for highways of statewide significance (HSS) within their comprehensive plans. These LOS standards can then be used as one method to assess the need for transportation mitigation measures. The Legislature enacted RCW 47.06.140 in 1998 - the “Level of Service Bill.” The main elements of the law are: Local agencies must include transportation facilities of statewide significance (including interstate highways, interregional state principal arterials, and statewide ferry service) in their comprehensive plans consistent with the statewide transportation plan. WSDOT, in consultation with local governments, shall set level of service standards for state highways and state ferry routes of statewide significance. For regionally significant state highways (Non-HSS), the LOS is set through a collaborative process with Regional Transportation Planning Organizations (RTPOs) and local governments. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1130
Development Services
Improvements to facilities and services of statewide significance identified in the statewide multimodal plan are essential state public facilities under RCW 36.70A.200 (refer to RCW 47.06.140). No local comprehensive plan or development regulation may preclude the siting of essential public facilities (RCW 36.70A.200(5)). Note: SEPA applies to jurisdiction even if they do not plan under RCW 36.70A.040.
1130.06 Highway Access Connections When reviewing requests for access connections onto a state highway, identify the type of access control for the route and apply policy and procedures accordingly. Some main points:
•
•
•
•
If a developer seeks a highway connection, WSDOT can require mitigation. This is done when WSDOT conditions improvements to the transportation system during issuance of highway access permits. WSDOT may deny a connection due to safety, operational, or other reasons. An Intersection Control Evaluation (consult Chapter 1300) may be required for new access points, or substantial changes in traffic volume on existing access points.
1130.06(1) Managed Access Control Chapter 47.50 RCW, Chapter 468-51 WAC, and Chapter 468-52 WAC define WSDOT authority, standards, and procedures for the management of access to managed access state highways to maintain functional use, highway safety, and preservation of public investment consistent with adopted local comprehensive plans. Cities and towns permit access connections on managed access highways within their boundaries. WSDOT may provide guidance/recommendations/clarifications upon request. NOTE: A city/town is also responsible for having their own connection and must use standards that meet or exceed WSDOT standards per RCW 47.50.030(3). The WSDOT Region is the access connection permit authority for locations outside corporate limits. Connection Permits and fees vary (consult WAC 468-51-070)
•
•
•
•
Connection categories are based on projected use volumes and other characteristics. Category II and III connection proposals require a traffic analysis, signed by a professional engineer, licensed in accordance with Chapter 18.43 RCW. Connections are designed and constructed to WSDOT standards. Mitigation may be required involving construction on the state highway. WSDOT may require a Developer Agreement in addition to the connection permit (refer to Section 1130.10). The applicant completes DOT Form 224-694 Application for Access Connection Permit Managed Access Highways Only and provides the appropriate nonrefundable fee. WSDOT determines if the permit will be granted. For new connections, use Form 224-005, and for existing connections use 224-006 (internal website only).
Refer to Chapter 540 for more information.
1130.06(2) Limited Access Control Chapter 47.52 RCW, Chapter 468-54 WAC, and Chapter 468-58 WAC govern WSDOT authority, standards, and procedures for the establishments of limited access highways and the purchase of access, light, view and air rights from abutting property owners. Connections to limited access highways are administered by WSDOT HQ Access and Hearings. Refer to Chapter 520 and Chapter 530.

Development Services
1130.07 Early and Ongoing Coordination The review process begins when the Region becomes aware of a project proposal. Often this occurs when the local agency sends the land use proposal to WSDOT for review. On some occasions the proponent will contact WSDOT first before formally submitting the project to the local agency. Developer Services staff can also proactively reach out to the local agency to inquire about proposed or planned projects. Early coordination is the formal or informal process developers use to identify the potential impacts for a land use proposal and to establish expectations of the interested agency requirements. Benefits of early and ongoing coordination include:
•
•
•
•
•
Advanced knowledge and awareness of land use and transportation plans and projects. Understanding the proposal’s impact on the state highway before mitigation design has progressed too far. Early coordination helps optimize multimodal outcomes. WSDOT / developer collaborating on the TIA document and proposed mitigation. Sharing/leveraging resources among local and state agencies. Time savings up front on work that would otherwise need to be done during the comment deadlines.
Development Services staff also monitor websites and plans including:
•
•
•
Department of Ecology’s Statewide SEPA register. County and city websites. Department of Commerce’s Plan View site.
Consult local agency comprehensive plans, WSDOT planning studies and statewide plans to help inform transportation system needs and mitigation. Examples include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Community Engagement Plans. Washington State Highway System Plan. Washington State Active Transportation Plan and local agency related plans such as parks, trails, and pedestrian and/or bicyclist master plans. Washington State Public Transportation and local/regional transit agency plans. Washington State Human Services Transportation Plans. Washington State Rail, Freight, Ferries, and Aviation Plans. Corridor and area planning studies. More information on WSDOT’s Planning process is available online at: https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/planning/default.htm
1130.08 Establishing Reimbursable Accounts Reimbursable accounts are used so that WSDOT can be compensated by the developer, local government or tribe for agency time invested in their project proposal. The reimbursable account is usually established prior to plan review and often prior to TIA review.
•
•
Administration of compensation for these review charges is through a reimbursable (Jx) account. Consult Chapter 9 of the Agreements Manual (Consultants: Please contact your WSDOT Project Manager for access to the Agreements Manual) and consult with Region Financial Services office for how to set these up. The developer is billed monthly for the outstanding balance in the account.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-9
Chapter 1130
•
•
•
Development Services
Reimbursable costs include: TIA reviews, plan for approval and construction plan reviews, agreement preparation and construction inspection, and administrative overhead. These costs vary depending on the complexity of the project, the number of required revisions to plans and the amount of time required for construction inspection. Use Project Review Reimbursable Agreement Form 224-102.
A quick review of the proposal and SEPA checklist will usually indicate the likelihood of impacts to WSDOT facilities. WSDOT normally does not charge for review time when:
•
•
•
•
There are very minor review requirements. The review only deals with a simple Access Connection Permit application to a farm, single-family residence, or a short plat. If the applicant is a local, state, or federal agency, cities, counties, tribes, or FHWA, and no work is being proposed within the WSDOT highway right of way. The amount of money chargeable is not worth the cost of collection. An example of this is a project that requires a single one-hour review of a TIA.
Each region should develop an objective set of guidelines that define when a developer should open a reimbursable account. For example, a region may require reimbursable accounts only from developments that are directly adjacent to a state route and generate 10 or more peak-hour trips.
1130.09 Review Procedures and Criteria The Development Services objective for land use proposals is to determine if Region will recommend or require mitigation to the lead agency, and if so, what options or form that should take. Note: WSDOT can require mitigation when we issue connection permits, or other permits to use WSDOT right of way. Review land use proposals from many contextual, operational, and performance driven perspectives. This includes multimodal transportation planning, safety, active transportation connectivity, motor vehicle traffic operations, system operation and maintenance, multimodal access and accommodation, and existing or proposed public transportation services. Apply the criteria in this section, or as agreed upon with the lead agency and developer, to make the determination. Note: Development Services Staff and local agencies negotiate the terms of each Interlocal Agreement. In these cases, the Interlocal Agreement would specify thresholds and other expectations (refer to Section 1130.11). If mitigation will be recommended, follow the procedures in Section 1130.10 to formalize an agreement. The Review Procedure begins with a land use proposal and accompanying documents. WSDOT Development Services staff:
•
Receive a land use proposal from the lead agency. The notice accompanies the SEPA document. For a DNS, a SEPA checklist is included.
Review the document and supporting information and data for quantifiable transportation impacts. Use the questions in Exhibit 1130-1 as a test to determine if the Region has no concerns or objections or if it needs to evaluate further. Follow the next set of questions in Exhibit 1130-2 and Exhibit 1130-3 to determine if mitigation is needed.
•
Determine if enough information has been provided, like a TIA, to fully evaluate the proposal.

Y/N
If the answer is NO to all of the questions in Exhibit 1130-1, then there may be no probable significant adverse impact to the state highway system and no further WSDOT analysis or response is required. Note: WSDOT may submit an email to the local agency stating WSDOT has no comments. This confirms to the local government that WSDOT received notification and conducted a review. However, due to resourcing, WSDOT may not respond in these cases. If the answer is YES to ANY of the above questions, further review is necessary. Use the questions in Exhibit 1130-2 and Exhibit 1130-3 and the criteria in Section 1130.10 to further assess potential impacts to the state transportation system.

1130.09(1)(a) Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) When the review process concludes that a development has significant adverse impacts then mitigation is warranted. The Traffic Impact Analysis usually recommends conceptual improvements that will mitigate the impacts. A local agency will typically require that the developer satisfy WSDOT about the details of that mitigation. Such details are usually resolved in an agreement between the developer and WSDOT that permits construction of highway improvements (or traffic mitigation payment to a WSDOT project).
•
•
•
Lead agency typically requires proponent to prepare a TIA. If a TIA has not been prepared, ask that it be provided. Collaborate with the developer and lead agency on the TIA development, if possible. An Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) may be needed (refer to Chapter 1300).
Review TIA and test for Significant Adverse Impacts
•
•
•
•
A TIA should clearly describe trip generation estimation methodology, state assumptions, data collection methodology, and identify potential impacts to the transportation system, including state highways in terms of location, timing, and magnitude. Request TIA updates or additional information if needed. Assess traffic impacts on state highways and ferry routes in terms of the number of trips generated (per ITE Trip Generation Manual) as the result of a land use or policy change. In addition to motor vehicle trips, estimated traffic impacts should also include transit, bicyclist and pedestrian trips depending on context. Collaborate with multidisciplinary groups and the proponent. Consider all travel modes, needs and context including Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), network connectivity, safety, crossing treatments, and route directness considerations for active transportation users. Review available corridor planning studies. These studies and plans involved significant participation from members of local communities, so they are valuable resources for understanding what stakeholders want with respect to the state transportation system.

Refer to Chapter 320 for TIA procedures and details. Apply WSDOT Criteria below.
1130.09(2) WSDOT Threshold Criteria WSDOT’s goal is to provide a safe, sustainable, multimodal transportation system for all users. Our performance criteria will evolve as WSDOT develops new performance metrics. This section provides criteria used by WSDOT to determine if significant adverse impacts to the transportation system would be likely because of proposed land use development. Criteria include:
•
•
•
•
•
Projected number of added automobile trips to the state highway Level of service standards Channelization thresholds Safety performance for the traveling public, including active transportation and transit users. Considerations of bicyclist, pedestrian, and transit modes
When the criteria or considerations in this section indicate probable significant impacts, respond to the lead agency with request to formalize mitigation. This is the beginning of the developer mitigation agreement process presented in Section 1130.10. Development-generated motor vehicle trips are the most common cause of significant impacts. However, it is important to address all modes when establishing mitigation alternatives. Apply the criteria in the subsections below to determine 1) probable significant adverse impacts, 2) the need for additional information and analysis, and 3) potential mitigation design alternatives with all parties. WSDOT’s goal is to optimize mitigation such that all travel modes have been addressed. Interlocal agreements between WSDOT and Local Agencies may supersede some threshold criteria (consult Section 1130.11 Interlocal Agreements.)
1130.09(2)(a) Vehicular Trip Thresholds WSDOT identifies any proposal that meets or exceeds either or both of the following vehicular trip criteria to have a probable significant adverse impact to the state highway system. 1. Addition of ten (10) or more AM or PM peak-hour vehicle trips assigned to an individual approach leg to a state highway intersection. 2. Addition of twenty five (25) or more AM or PM peak-hour vehicle trips assigned to a state highway segment (2-way travel) or intersection (total 25 trips all legs).
1130.09(2)(b) Level of Service (LOS) Thresholds Level of Service Thresholds When a development would degrade a highway’s LOS below the applicable established threshold, the highway segment or intersection impacted would be identified as a probable significant adverse impact, and parties should seek to establish mitigation of the traffic impacts. Apply development-generated trips to the network volumes, to determine if an established LOS threshold would be exceeded. LOS thresholds are established per state law to gauge the performance of the system. Refer to Chapter 36.70A.070 RCW and Chapters 47.06 and 47.80 RCW for information. WSDOT cannot require mitigation when we are not permitting a connection to the state highway or providing another type of permit to use WSDOT rights of way. Work in good faith with the lead agency and developer to recommend mitigation.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-14
Chapter 1130
Development Services
General established LOS standards are as follows, however, check for exceptions or differences applicable to specific locations under consideration. Highways of Statewide Significance (HSS) including their ramp intersections:
•
•
Urban Areas: Rural Areas:
LOS “D” LOS “C”
Regionally Significant State Highways (non-HSS):
•
•
•
The LOS thresholds adopted by the local MPO/RTPO shall apply. In the absence of an adopted LOS threshold, the LOS for HSS shall apply. Where there is a specific Interlocal Agreement with WSDOT, the applicable LOS threshold levels as established by the agreement shall apply.
When LOS is already below established thresholds When a development affects a highway segment or intersection where the LOS is already degraded from the applicable threshold, any additional development related traffic would be identified as a probable significant adverse impact. The pre-development LOS is the condition to preserve through mitigation. The average vehicle time delay associated with the pre-development LOS is used rather than the otherwise applicable deficiency level. Example: If the pre-development and post-development LOS at an intersection is F, with the average vehicle time delay of 80 and 95 seconds respectively, then the appropriate mitigation is to make the necessary improvements to bring the average vehicle time delay back to 80 seconds or less. The LOS thresholds apply to intersections. The bases for evaluating LOS are the methodologies agreed upon between the developer and WSDOT. Automobile Congestion and delay can be evaluated using two different methods:
•
•
If using level of service (LOS): Are there segments of the highway that are below the LOS threshold or will fall below the LOS threshold as a result of the development? If using volume/capacity (v/c) ratio: Are there segments of the highway that already exceed or will exceed the v/c ratio-threshold as a result of the development?

1130.09(2)(c) WSDOT Channelization Thresholds Addition of twenty-five (25) or more AM or PM Peak-hour vehicular trips (2-way) to an intersection or access connection that meets or exceeds the Design Manual guidelines for channelization will be considered a probable significant adverse impact. Consider all potential users of the facility in the design of an intersection. This involves addressing the needs of a diverse mix of user groups, including passenger cars, heavy vehicles of varying classifications, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Turn channelization and especially slip lane additions make conditions more challenging for pedestrians and bicyclists. These changes increase crossing distances and intersection complexity and may increase driver turning speeds. Refer to Chapter 1310 for channelization guidance. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-15
Chapter 1130
Development Services
1130.09(2)(d) Safety Performance Thresholds Addition of ten (10) or more AM or PM peak-hour vehicular trips (2-way) to a highway location identified through an I-2 safety program will be considered a probable significant adverse impact. WSDOT primarily uses two screening methodologies to identify locations that require further safety analysis on state highways. These are the Collision Analysis Location/Collision Analysis Corridor (CAL/CAC) and the Intersection Analysis Location (IAL) programs. The regions use the CAL/CAC and IAL lists to prioritize safety improvement projects in developing their construction programs. When a development proposal impacts a CAL/CAC or an IAL, WSDOT may require reasonable mitigation even if the LOS thresholds are not exceeded or Design Manual channelization warrants are not met. Mitigation may take the form of developer-constructed improvements or traffic mitigation payment to a state project if one is programmed for the CAL/CAC or IAL location. Coordinate with Regional Traffic and Program Management staff to create a list of CAL/CAC and IAL projects from the biennial logbooks with reasonable solutions and cost estimates for improvements that would mitigate the deficiencies. This project list could provide the basis for mitigation assessments for development impacts. Refer to the WSDOT Safety Analysis Guide, Section 8.3 for guidance.
1130.09(2)(e) WSDOT Field Assessment Program WSDOT may consider other safety threshold requirements, including locations identified through the Field Assessment Program. Field assessments are a programmatic approach to review all state highways to identify safety improvement opportunities, evaluate potential benefits and risks, and develop lower cost spot safety enhancements. Safety is always considered when assessing traffic impacts. The effects of sight distance, roadway geometry, alignment, context, travel speed, turning speed, roadway width, access, and volume of turning movements should all be considered. While a TIA may conclude that the traffic impacts to a state highway will not exceed LOS thresholds or other criteria, the Region Traffic Engineer may still request reasonable intersection improvements based on safety concerns. If the Region Traffic Engineer does request a mitigation improvement that does not otherwise meet the thresholds listed in this chapter, then the Region Traffic Engineer must document the engineering basis and analyses for the improvement in an engineering study or other report that clearly justifies the reasons for requesting the mitigation improvement. Refer to the Traffic Manual Chapter 9 for more information on the Field Assessment Program.
1130.09(2)(f) Active and Public Transportation Both active transportation and transit provide essential travel options for those who do not choose to or who cannot drive themselves. Work with the developer, tribe, or lead agency to evaluate active and public transportation system impacts and needs to determine mitigation that provides safety, mobility, and accessibility for all users of the multimodal transportation system.
•
•
•
Review the TIA, SEPA document, Lead Agency and WSDOT planning documents, including the state Active Transportation Plan. Determine how needs for bicyclist and pedestrian infrastructure including network connectivity, route directness, safety, and level of traffic stress should be considered in the mitigation. Consult the WSDOT Active Transportation Plan for guidance. Consult with your Region’s Active Transportation Coordinator.

Active Transportation Facilities Active transportation refers to people engaged in human-scale and often human powered travel, such as walking or bicycling. A variety of small devices facilitate such travel, for example use of skateboards, scooters, and wheelchairs. Some devices provide low-power assistance or propulsion, such as electric bicycles. Active travel modes are more commonly employed in urban and town center contexts where distances between destinations and other factors make these modes efficient and desirable. Urban locations often make greater investment in safe and comfortable infrastructure like sidewalks, crossing enhancements and bicycle facilities. Some suburban highways also provide sidewalks, bike lanes, and shared use paths. However, as driving speeds and lane number and complexity increase, the need for lateral separation between vehicle and active modes and enhanced crossing features increases. Even in rural locations, active travelers may need to cross highways to access transit or school bus stops or travel along highways to complete trips. New developments may increase rural active travel trips or make existing trips more challenging. Refer to WSDOT Active Transportation Plan. Considerations should address:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
What is known about the current and planned state of the active transportation network in this location? Is this a context in which people walk or ride bicycles to everyday destinations like stores, schools, jobs, parks, and other places? Is the location near existing or planned transit stops, multimodal hubs, and multi-use trails? Are there person trip generators present or planned? Is there a need for certain facilities that afford access for all ages and abilities? Can people make a 15-minute walk or bike ride to nearby destinations? How can recommended mitigation improve access between destinations? Is it possible to increase the percentage of everyday short trips made by walking or bicycling? Are highway crossings safe and convenient, such that crossings provide a low level of traffic stress and adequate route directness? Do posted and design speeds provide drivers with sufficient time to see people crossing and stop?
Public Transportation Transit service helps provide travel options for those who do not choose to or cannot drive themselves. Do people in this setting have access to transit services? Is Transportation Demand Management (TDM) an option for mitigation?
•
•
If so, what is the frequency and type of service provided? In population centers consider designs and tradeoffs that provide safe and convenient access to transit enabling people to move along and cross highways to reach transit stops from new developments.

1130.10 Development Services Agreements This section provides guidance to prepare and execute agreements as well as design and construction guidance. Use the procedures and instructions in this section to formalize agreement between WSDOT, the developer, the Lead agency, or both to fulfill agreed upon mitigation to the state multimodal transportation system. The basic process overview includes WSDOT and the Developer, and sometime the local agency:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Select a WSDOT Agreement form. Document improvement mitigation using Summary of Design (SOD) Developer Prepare preliminary plans for approval. Developer prepares contract plans and other documents. Upon review and approval those become part of the agreement. A financial guarantee such as a bond is established by the developer. The agreement is signed and executed.
1130.10(1) Developer and Construction Agreements When a mitigation determination results in a requirement for transportation improvements, the agreement process begins. A developer is typically directed by the SEPA lead agency to coordinate the construction details with WSDOT. The Developer’s TIA should recommend conceptual improvements that will mitigate the impacts. The lead agency typically requires that the developer satisfy WSDOT regarding the details of that mitigation. Such details are usually resolved in an agreement between the developer and WSDOT that permits construction of transportation improvements (or a mitigation payment toward a WSDOT project). Developer Agreements are contracts between WSDOT, the developer and sometimes a local agency, stating each party’s rights and responsibilities, and describing the proposed work. Agreements typically include a standard agreement form, right of way plan sheet(s), and a complete set of specifications and engineering plans. The developer agreement may include, but is not limited to: plans; specifications; maintenance requirements; bonding requirements; inspection requirements; division of costs by the parties, where applicable; and provisions for payment by the applicant of actual costs incurred by WSDOT in the review and administration of the applicant's proposal that exceed the required base fees in Chapter 468-51-070 WAC. Development mitigation is made in the form of:
•
•
•
Developer funded and constructed transportation improvements, Financial contributions to programmed WSDOT or local agency projects, and/or Dedication of property for right of way.
Refer to the Development Service guidance document Traffic Mitigation Payments on the Development Services website for more information and examples to help determine or calculate pro rata share financial contributions by developers.

1130.10(2) Selecting the Type of Agreement Form Agreement Forms There are both standard and nonstandard agreements. WSDOT has developed standard form agreements for commonly encountered developer agreement needs. A good practice is to use a standard form agreement. These save WSDOT and the Developer time since they do not require HQ or Assistant Attorney General (AAG) review. Do not alter a standard form, or it will need to be reviewed by the AAG. Select an agreement form that best fits with the type and form of mitigation. Determine if one of the standard form agreements below will suffice and use if possible. If not, prepare a nonstandard agreement. Developer Agreement - Construction by Developer at Developer Expense (Form 224-054)
•
•
This is a two-party agreement between the developer and WSDOT. The developer constructs the improvement on WSDOT right of way.
Developer / Local Agency Agreement – Construction by Developer at Developer Expense (Form 224-063)
•
•
Like the above, but as a three-party agreement which involves the developer, the local agency and WSDOT. Use this agreement if part of the improvement to be constructed is located on local agency right-of-way in addition to state-owned right of way.
Local Agency Participating Agreement - Developer Mitigation (Form 224-015)
•
•
•
•
This agreement is a two-party contract between the Local agency and WSDOT. The Agency has collected developer mitigation payments pursuant to RCW 82.02.020 that have an expiration date of five (5) years from date of collection. The Agency desires to transmit these funds to WSDOT for use in constructing the above referenced project. WSDOT has programmed and budgeted the subject project.
Developer Agreement - Construction by State at Developer Expense (Form 224-064)
•
•
•
This is a two-party agreement between the developer and WSDOT. WSDOT agrees to build the project for the developer as a separate project. The project will have to go through the normal ad and award process. This type of agreement is required by FHWA if the improvements are constructed on the Interstate system and may impact the mainline traffic. An example would be a developer-funded signal installation on an off-ramp where it is likely the construction will impact the mainline traffic.
Construction Agreement - Construction by Local Agency on State Highway Right of Way at Local Agency Expense (Form224-032)
•
•
This is a two-party agreement between the local agency and WSDOT. The Agency agrees to and shall construct, operate and/or maintain the Improvements in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Development Services
Local Agency Participating Agreement Work by WSDOT — Actual Cost (Form 224-065)
•
•
•
This is a two-party agreement between the local agency and WSDOT. WSDOT is planning the construction or improvement of a section of the state route and the Local Agency has requested that WSDOT perform certain work for the Local Agency. It is deemed to be in the public’s best interest for WSDOT to include the requested Work in WSDOT’s construction contract for the state route improvement. The Local Agency is obligated for the cost of the work.
Developer Mitigation Agreement: Collection of Pro Rata Share for Contribution Toward a WSDOT Project.
•
•
•
This would be a non-standard agreement that establishes a contract between WSDOT and the developer whereby the developer can contribute toward a programmed WSDOT project to mitigate impacts to the state highway system. It can be modified to include a third-party when the WSDOT has a joint project with a city or county. Refer to the guidance document Traffic Mitigation Payments on the Development Services Website for more information about how to develop pro rata share developer contributions.

1130.10(3) Time to Process an Agreement The agreement process requires a technical review and concurrence or approval of all plans within WSDOT right of way that become part of the agreement, and possibly review by WSDOT HQ and the Attorney General’s Office (AGO). The length of time it takes to execute an agreement varies greatly and depends upon:
•
•
•
Complexity of the project. Number of revisions required for the plans and specifications. Quality and quantity of plans submitted by the developer.
The overall time to complete this process is primarily based on the quality and quantity of plans submitted by the developer. The closer the plans are to WSDOT standards, the more efficiently the review will proceed. Each region should develop guidance for communicating expectations for review and approval timeframes.
1130.10(4) Assembling Agreement Components A typical Developer Agreement includes a set of engineering plans and specifications prepared by the developer. These include preliminary plans for approval, construction plans, reports, and other documents. Agreements include these items as exhibits. These exhibits are reviewed and approved before the agreement is signed. These include but are not limited to:
•
•
•
Preliminary docuents, including a Plan for Approval and the Summary of Design. Construction plns, materials certifications, specifications. Hydraulics reports.

Development Services
An Intersectin Control Evaluation (ICE) may be required for new or modified intersections (refer to Chapter 1300.) Other dcuments as determined by region.
Plans Review Process Once mitigation has been determined, the development services staff will contact the developer/consultant to request submittal of required plans and specifications for WSDOT review and concurrence or approval. DS Staff determine which support offices are appropriate and route the plans to them for review and approval. The Development Services lead acts as the project engineer in the review and approval of development plans by coordinating, screening and consolidating, and resolving the review comments. When the initial reviews are complete, the Development Services lead compiles comments and returns the plans to the developer and/or consultant for revisions. When all of the review comments have been addressed and plan revisions made, the Development Services lead will obtain the necessary electronic approvals/signatures for the plans. The following sections provide details supporting preparation of:
•
•
Plans for approval, the summary of design, and construction plans, documents, and responsibilities. Descriptions and Links to additional resources and forms.
1130.10(5) Preliminary Design Documents The main preliminary documents used in the beginning of the mitigation agreement process are the Plan for Approval and the Summary of Design. These become exhibits attached to the agreement. This section provides instruction for the Summary of Design (SOD) and Plans for Approval (PFA), the two most common documents used. The SOD and the PFA should be developed concurrently. The SOD is required to be submitted by the developer prior to or with the PFA. WSDOT will support and collaborate in the development of the Plan for Approval and Summary of Design. Criteria in the WSDOT Design Manual apply to design of mitigation projects on WSDOT highways and rights of way.
Summary of Design (SOD) The SOD was developed specifically for use on non-WSDOT projects on the state transportation system. Use the SOD to record decisions about development-based transportation improvements. Provide the information needed to complete the SOD, including the proposed multimodal project elements, community engagement, and design tradeoffs. Provide enough detail on the SOD that a Plan for Approval can proceed. WSDOT and the Developer use the SOD to record decisions about development-based transportation improvements. The “Project Information” section expects consideration of all modes and documenting tradeoffs determined in the design process.
•
•
The SOD prompts for multimodal considerations; how all travel modes have been addressed in the mitigation. It also provides for documenting the design elements of the project.
Note: in some cases, the Basis of Design (BOD) may be required, but the general expectation is the SOD should suffice for most projects. Consult Section 300.04(3) Local Agency and Development Services Approvals for further guidance.

Summary of Design Resources
•
•
Download the SOD (Form 224-045), or BOD if required and provide it to the local agency / developer. Refer to Chapter 300 and the SOD/BOD for Approval requirements.
Plan for Approval (PFA) The developer/consultant prepares the PFA. Note: These are commonly called Channelization Plans, but for consistency with this Design Manual, the term Plan for Approval is used. The PFA is the basis for all the construction drawings and essentially defines the scope of the project. Review the plan for approval and support the developer in revisions needed. Review and ensure developer and local agency project plans meet WSDOT policies and procedures. WSDOT Design Controls. Design controls are specific factors that directly influence the selection of most design elements and their dimensions. Consult Chapter 1103 for the five WSDOT design controls. Checklists and Examples: Provide your Region’s checklist to help the developer prepare the PFA prior to region review. Provide example PFAs as needed. Basic content usually includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Roadway channelization and intersection configuration. Linear design elements and dimensions such as lane and shoulder widths, taper lengths, sidewalks, bicycle facilities, shared-use paths/trails, transit stops or pullouts, and other elements. Intersection design elements and dimensions such as corner radii, marked crosswalks, crossing protection islands, bike boxes, leading pedestrian intervals, protected intersection features, mixing zones, protected left turn signals, lighting, etc. Midblock and trail crossing locations and dimensions with included features such as Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons, Rectangular Rapid Flashing beacons, raised crossings, etc. Ramp junction crossing locations and dimensions with included features such as Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons, Rectangular Rapid Flashing beacons, advance signage, raised crossings, etc. The entire mitigation project limits or portion thereof on the state system All existing access connections, both public and private, on both sides of the state highway Property use each proposed new or combined access connection serves. Design data pertinent to the improvements being proposed. Plots from turn movement simulation software to verify that the turn movements for the design vehicle(s) do not have conflicts. Refer to Chapter 1103 for Design Controls policy, including selecting the intersection design vehicle.
Consult your region PFA checklist for full details. Note: Any channelization outside of the state highway right-of-way will require confirmation that the design meets the local agency’s design standards. WSDOT Review times: WSDOT’s initial review of the PFA for approval/or concurrence will generally take about three weeks before comments are returned. Subsequent reviews of this plan will require up to two additional weeks each time the plan is resubmitted. Approval: WSDOT approves or concurs the PFA by electronic signature and provides a copy to the developer. Refer to Chapter 300 for approvals. The following sections provide details along with references to other WSDOT Manuals and resources needed.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Development Services
Other Preliminary Documents Other design requirements may be triggered by the proposal, such as an approved Intersection Control Evaluation, Access Revision Report, or Design Analysis, to list a few. Consult Chapter 300 for the list of many documents and approval authorities which may be needed, particularly for intersections or for proposed freeway access revisions.
1130.10(6) Construction Plans, Specifications, and Reports Upon approval of the PFA and SOD, the developer/consultant prepares construction plans, specifications and other documents and submits them to WSDOT for review. Upon approval, these are made attachments to the agreement. The construction plans for a developer agreement are similar to those that are required for a WSDOT state contract for highway improvements. As such, the same design criteria and materials certifications apply. Use judgment in matching the level of plan complexity and review to the level of detail warranted by a developer project to ensure compliance with WSDOT standards and specifications without placing an undue burden on developers. The plans and reports in Exhibit 1130-4 are a brief listing that may be required for a developer project. This is not all inclusive. Consult region subject matter experts, region requirements, practices, and checklists. Engage region experts in plans review, construction and materials requirements, utilities, and hydraulics. The goal is to support the developer in the assemblage of the construction plans, specifications and reports required. Monitor progress and quality of developer work, give constructive feedback to developers throughout the process. Exhibit 1130-4 Common Plans and Reports

Right of Way In most cases, the required mitigation such as widening for turn lanes or shoulder improvements, installation of pedestrian protection islands, striping of bike lanes and installing bike boxes, can be accommodated within existing right of way. However, if insufficient right-of-way exists, the developer must donate the necessary land (that they own rights to) to WSDOT. The right of way must provide a wide enough corridor to include drainage facilities (such as back of the ditch), all signal and illumination facilities, utilities under franchise, and any other feature that requires access for highway maintenance. WSDOT will not exercise eminent domain authority (condemn property) to obtain right of way for a private development. WSDOT can request right of way be conveyed from a developer to mitigate developer traffic impacts to state highway based upon engineering plans, rather than approved right of way plans. The needed right of way must have a nexus to the direct impacts and be proportional to these impacts. Review additional information on Right of Way donations in Chapter 47.14 RCW and in Chapter 468-100 WAC.
Traffic Control Coordinate traffic control plans and strategies with the developer. Refer to Design Manual Chapter 1010 and links provided therein. Coordinate with Region Traffic office to handle all traffic related issues. Traffic Analysis including analysis of both existing and potential pedestrian and bicyclist movements, Channelization plans, electrical design, traffic control and signing, both public and private, are the major responsibilities of this group.
Utilities Utility Plan and Responsibilities The Utility Plan details all the existing utilities and the proposed utility relocations within the project limits. It is the Developer’s responsibility to ensure the Utility Plan and relocation strategies comply with WSDOT’s Utilities Manual and the Utilities Accommodation Policy. The Utility Plan and proposed utility relocations must be approved by the Region Utility Engineer prior to execution of the Developer Agreement. Utility plan must include, but is not limited to, the following: 1. Highway alignment and right-of-way limits. 2. Proposed roadway configuration, as shown on the channelization plan, including final location of all driveways and intersecting roads, illumination, guardrail and drainage. 3. Locations of all existing utility facilities and appurtenances, such as lines, poles, cabinets, vaults, valves, and hydrants.

Chapter 1130
Development Services
Utility Locates and Service Connections Permanent utility service connections will require a utility service agreement. A service agreement is between the Developer and the utility company. WSDOT is not responsible for obtaining this agreement. Utility service connections and any associated facilities that require water, electric power, telephone service, such as signal and illumination systems, will be the Developer’s responsibility to coordinate. The Developer establishes the new service account in his/her name, with WSDOT listed as the permanent owner, and pays the initial service connection costs and fees. After final inspection, acceptance by WSDOT, and upon project completion, the account can be transferred to either WSDOT or the appropriate city or town. The Developer will be responsible for the cost and transferring of any accounts to WSDOT and/or to the applicable city or town.
Hydraulics and Stormwater Requirements Region Development Services staff will coordinate WSDOT’s review and concurrence of requirements. Enlist support from region subject matter experts for assistance in assessing drainage and water quality compliance issues. Following are some common requirements and resource manuals. The Highway Runoff Manual states that WSDOT must provide for the passage of existing off-site flows through its right of way to maintain natural drainage paths. Private developer projects that discharge to a WSDOT right of way or storm sewer system must comply with the provisions of the Highway Runoff Manual (HRM), Ecology stormwater management manuals, or an Ecology-approved local equivalent manual. The developer must also demonstrate that WSDOT conveyance systems have adequate capacity to convey the developer’s flows in accordance with Hydraulics Manual conveyance design standards. Developer / consultant designing stormwater facilities within the WSDOT ROW shall prepare hydraulic reports in compliance with the policy outlined in the Hydraulics Manual. A hydraulic report with supporting calculations, plans and details showing proposed improvements is needed anytime storm water runoff enters state right of way from a development site, or modifications are proposed for existing facilities’ out falling to state facilities.
HRM Certification Training Requirements Designing BMPs within WSDOT right of way requires a Highway Runoff Manual certification regardless of which manual is used for the design. Visit the WSDOT Hydraulics webpage for additional information, Hydraulics & hydrology | WSDOT (wa.gov) and the WSDOT Hydraulics training webpage on available HRM classes to obtain a certification: Hydraulics & hydrology training | WSDOT (wa.gov). The Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Manual (TESCM) is intended for use during the design, permitting, and construction phases of transportation construction projects. It covers:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Applying for, transferring, and terminating Permit coverage Temporary erosion and sediment control (TESC) plan design and implementation TESC best management practice (BMP) application and installation Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure (SPCC) plans Discharge sampling, site inspections and reporting Site management and documentation Compliance related issues
A utility permit for stormwater discharge (Form 224-693) is utilized to regulate constructed facilities that discharge stormwater onto state right of way and into a highway drainage system. For more information on requirements and permits for discharging to the WSDOT ROW and/or building on the WSDOT ROW, consult the Utilities Manual. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-25
Chapter 1130
Development Services
Documentation will be reviewed for compliance with state and local requirements and more specifically checked to ensure storm water has been properly treated and detained, meeting WSDOT’s NPDES permit requirements, existing drainage systems are capable of handling the flows and no downstream impacts before issuing a permit. For Stormwater Permits, consult regional utility office for structures within WSDOT Right of Way.
1130.10(7) Establish Developer’s Financial Guarantee WSDOT requires either a surety bond, assignment of escrow account, savings account/certificate of deposit or letter of credit from the developer to ensure timely and proper construction of the project according to the Developer Agreement. WSDOT does not require this of governmental agencies or of tribes. The developer (usually his/her consultant) provides an itemized estimate of construction costs. Review the estimate to ensure that it represents typical costs for similar types of work. Base the amount of the surety bond on this cost estimate, including all utility work and may also include a surcharge to cover cost overruns. Bonding for local agency projects is at the discretion of the Department and in most cases will not be required. Bonding is usually secured through a standard WSDOT bond form (discussed below), which names the developer and the surety company. Attach the bond certificate to the form. The developer may choose to provide an “assignment of escrow account” or “assignment of savings account/certificate of deposit” in lieu of the bonding. On a case-by-case basis, WSDOT will accept a letter of credit. Download the above WSDOT standard forms here: Main page: https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/forms/pdfForms.html Direct links:
•
•
Individual Bond for Agreement (Form 224-049) Assignment of Savings Account/Certificate of Deposit (Form 224-004) internal website only.
At the discretion of regional development services staff, the bond may be required prior to the execution of the Developer Agreement or, at the latest, at the time of the pre-construction meeting. In any case, no work should be allowed on WSDOT right-of-way until the bond is secured by developer. Release the surety bond, escrow account, or savings account/certificate of deposit after final WSDOT inspection and approval of the construction. In some cases, a release of funds may be only after a specified period to ensure performance of the improvement. Make sure that the original bond, escrow account, savings account/certificate of deposit clearly states the time of release, such as 30 days after final acceptance, 12 months after final acceptance, etc. Collection of the bond, or a portion thereof, may be pursued if the work is not completed to the WSDOT’s satisfaction. WSDOT must give 30 thirty days written notice prior to any action to collect on the bond. The notice must include a detailed list of the incomplete items or outstanding payments, and the name and phone number of the appropriate WSDOT contact.
1130.10(8) Assembly, Execution, Routing and Archiving of Developer Agreements Assembly and execution When the engineering/construction plans and specifications are reviewed and approved, add them to the Agreement form along with a right of way plan and any other required exhibits, completing the agreement package.

The developer must first sign the completed Developer Agreement. If required, the developer obtains the appropriate local agency signature. The developer or local agency must return the signed agreement to the Development Services office for WSDOT region signature and final execution. Signature authority for Developer Agreements varies among the different regions.
Routing and closure Consult the Agreements Manual Chapter 3 for instruction on closing and archiving agreements (Consultants: Please contact your WSDOT Project Manager for access to the Agreements Manual).
1130.11 Using Interlocal Agreements WSDOT, counties and cities have successfully used Interlocal Agreements to provide an equitable and predictable Development Services process. Developers in high growth counties and cities may generate multiple projects a year, affecting state highways. In these situations, there is a definite long-term benefit to having an Interlocal Agreement in place. An Interlocal Agreement is highly encouraged and provides WSDOT with a basis for recovery of impact fees from the developer. It also provides a timely and predictable means of determining whether a developer project will cause significant adverse impacts to the state highway system and provides a streamlined mechanism by which mitigation measures are calculated and required as a condition of plan approval, if necessary, for all parties involved.
•
•
•
•
WSDOT benefits by being able to leverage limited funds and advance needed improvements to state highways significantly impacted by new development. Local government benefits by having needed transportation improvements constructed. Taxpayers benefit by not subsidizing the mitigation of transportation impacts caused by new development. Developers benefit by knowing up-front what type of mitigation will be required and what it will cost. Each developer will be treated equitably and the requirement for traffic analysis for smaller developments is eliminated.
1130.11(1) Interlocal Agreement Basic Elements Development Services Staff and local agencies negotiate the terms of each Interlocal Agreement. These agreements may contain elements that are unique to the local jurisdiction. However, every Interlocal Agreement contains the following framework.
Notification The local agency will notify WSDOT of all development proposals that are subject to review.
Thresholds WSDOT and the local agency will agree upon the level of impact, which will trigger WSDOT review of a development proposal. This threshold is normally based on the number of added trips, LOS, safety performance and crash history of the impacted state highway. It could consider multimodal needs assessment of the local transportation system and the impacted highway. Having frontage on a state highway also will trigger WSDOT’s review of a development plan.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-27
Chapter 1130
Development Services
Review Time The local agency will allow WSDOT an agreed upon minimum review period once a developer plan is received. Regional Development Services staff has the responsibility to thoroughly review the proposal, which may include consultation with staff such as multimodal traffic and environmental expertise. The Interlocal Agreement specifies the amount of time that the local agency and/or SEPA will allow for WSDOT review. Typically, this ranges from 14 to 21 days for SEPA DNS projects and 21 to 30 days for projects requiring an EIS.
1130.11(2) Local Jurisdiction Mitigation Commitment Provide in the Interlocal Agreement that the local jurisdiction agrees to collect traffic mitigation payments and/or impose certain channelization improvements and/or require right of way dedication conveyance on behalf of WSDOT, which is vital for WSDOT operations and finances. An Interlocal Agreement establishes city or county and WSDOT procedures for development plan review and determination of transportation impacts. It clarifies when traffic analyses are required and helps to define mitigation measures. The agreement also provides a reasonable timeline for review of development plans. Interlocal Agreements also provide the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
A list of WSDOT improvement projects for the next ten years, subject to amendment updates. Mitigation charges based on ADT or Peak-Hour Trip for developer traffic; i.e., Traffic Mitigation Payment, channelization revision, signalization, right of way dedication/conveyance, etc. A procedure for requiring traffic studies, including a checklist for those studies. How intersection LOS requirements will be met and addresses intersections with safety performance needs identified by WSDOT. A procedure for transfer of mitigation payments from local agency to WSDOT. A procedure for dedication/conveyance of right of way to WSDOT and/or provides for establishment of setbacks for future highway projects. A method for allowing credits against traffic mitigation payments for developer construction work, and/or right-of-way dedications/conveyances that benefit the highway or future highway construction projects. Reference to appeal process for developers who dispute WSDOT requirements. Unilateral termination of the agreement by WSDOT or Local Agency.
Application Interlocal Agreements can be set up to apply to: (1) all developments having frontage on, or requiring direct access onto a state highway AND/OR (2) all developments, which will be subject to SEPA review. Single family residences, duplexes, short plats and certain small commercial developments are excluded, consistent with SEPA regulations unless they are located adjacent to a state highway.
1130.11(3) Other Cost Sharing Mechanisms TBD and LID Policy In some instances, developers have agreed to participate in cost sharing as part of a Transportation Benefit District (TBD) or Local Improvement District (LID). If these contributions are wholly or partially used to mitigate developer impacts to the state highway, WSDOT will not seek further mitigation. Local Transportation Act (RCW 39.92) WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-28
Chapter 1130
Development Services
This statutory provision authorizes local governments to develop and adopt programs for the purpose of jointly funding, from public and private sources, transportation improvements necessitated in whole or in part by economic development and growth within their respective jurisdictions. This supplemental authority allows local governments to enact, if certain procedures are followed, ordinances that will set forth the procedures for calculating, assessing and spending transportation impact fees. This procedure can be used only if monies or improvements have not been collected through SEPA and/or RCW 82.02. For more information refer to RCW 39.92.
1130.12 Using Developer Permits The following are some of the permits administered by Development Services, Maintenance, or other Region entity. Note: Cities and towns issue access connection permits within their incorporated boundaries on managed access highways. Use permit forms, as well as permit applications, and provisions here: https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/forms/pdfForms.html
Access Connection Permit A WSDOT Access Connection Permit is used to grant the right to access a Managed Access State Highway, located outside of the boundaries of incorporated cities and towns, from the abutting property and, in some cases, authorize the temporary right to enter upon the right of way for the purposes of constructing the approach. Refer to Section 1130.06(2) and Chapter 540.
General permits General permits are another form of agreement for documenting terms for allowing work to be done on state right of way. This form can serve multiple uses, as identified on the form itself. Use Form 224-698 (Permit) and Form 224-698 (Provisions.)
Subterranean Monitoring Permits Use Form 224-036 to permit wells on WSDOT right of way. Show all developer wells on the alignment / ROW plan, including well ID number and coordinates. Provisions are included on the form. There are mandatory reporting requirements for well installation and decommissioning imposed by the Department of Ecology. Consult Chapter 610 and the Geotechnical Design Manual for more information.
Transit Stop Permits WSDOT may issue a Transit Stop Permit, for an agency requested facility on a state highway or Interstate under the jurisdiction of WSDOT and/or FHWA, provided the facility meets WSDOT and/or FHWA requirements. Review the requirements on the form. FHWA approval is required on all facilities located within Interstate rightof-way. WSDOT does not issue permits within incorporated cities or towns on managed access highways. Based upon the facility’s proposed location, the transit agency may apply for Transit Stop Permit to the appropriate WSDOT Region Office. The Region Development Services Office may forward the request to another regional office for processing of the permit. WSDOT Region will:
•
•
Verify WSDOT’s ownership and that the property is not currently under lease, franchise, permit, and other encumbrance that would prohibit the use of the identified property for the proposed use. Verify the property is not presently, nor in the foreseeable future, needed for highway purposes.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-29
Chapter 1130
•
Development Services
Coordinate a review of any application on Interstate property with the HQ Access and Hearings Manager.
Use Form 510-006 (permit) and Form 510-017 (application). Note these are not for use on Managed Access Highways within an incorporated City or Town. The forms include conditions and specify the need for certain plans and provisions. Issue Transit Stop Permits using the guidance of Design Manual Chapter 1730 and the Traffic Manual. This could include denial of permit for safety reasons, like sight distance. Enter the permit information into the Roadway Access Permit Management System (RAMPS) database.
Roadside Vegetation Permit Roadside Vegetation Permits are another form of agreement for documenting terms for allowing vegetation establishment and on-going vegetation maintenance by others on state right of way. Like developer agreements, Roadside Vegetation Permits use a boilerplate form with accompanying special provisions and are usually supplemented by planting and or vegetation plans. The plan development and review process are the same as for developer agreements, but greatly simplified. Consult with your Region’s Real Estate Office to ensure a lease is not required in lieu of a Roadside Vegetation Permit due to Leasehold Excise Tax and/or 18th Amendment requirements. Use Form 220-018 and Form 220-019 for the Roadside Vegetation Permit and its application.
Timber Mitigation – Removal Permits WSDOT may issue permits to residents of this state to remove specified quantities of standing or downed trees and shrubs, rock, sand, gravel, or soils that have no market value in place and that WSDOT desires to be removed from state-owned lands that are under WSDOT jurisdiction. An applicant for a permit must certify that the materials so removed are to be used by the applicant. General – RCW 47.12.140 authorizes WSDOT to issue a permit for the removal of timber having no market value in place and that the WSDOT desires to have removed. A permit to remove timber should only be issued when the total merchantable timber volume is no more than 5,000 board feet or one truck load of logs. Permits should not be issued for the removal of timber from properties located off operating right of way (removal of timber off operating right of way will require an approved Forest Practice Application). For more information refer to the WSDOT Right of Way Manual Section 11-6. Use forms 224-082 or 224-083 depending on circumstance.
1130.13 Construction Oversight After a Developer Agreement is executed, the appropriate level of attention must be given to developer projects to ensure that they are constructed to WSDOT standards and specifications common to any work performed on state highways, and that such efforts are paid for by the developers. Inspection is either performed by WSDOT or through private services agreed upon. Consult Region subject experts and the Standard Specifications and Construction Manual.
Preconstruction Conference A well-planned preconstruction conference is an important first step to a successful construction project. This meeting is required before construction can begin. The purpose of the preconstruction conference is to
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-30
Chapter 1130
Development Services
introduce the developer’s contractor to the WSDOT representative and to review the details of the project. Other recommended attendees include the prime contractor, subcontractors, the consultant engineer and, if applicable, a representative from the local agency. It is especially important to review scheduling, traffic control, outstanding materials certification issues, coordination issues, and any items that are not explicitly detailed in the Developer Agreement. If the surety bond was not secured prior to execution of the Developer Agreement, it should be required no later than the preconstruction conference. Guidelines for a pre-construction conference are found in the Construction Manual.
Materials Certification All materials incorporated into WSDOT facilities must be certified according to the Standard Specifications and the special provisions of the Developer Agreement. Materials certification is obtained through developer (or contractor) submittal of Request for Approval of Materials Source (RAMS.) Testing and approval requirements are given in Chapter 9 of the Construction Manual and in the Standard Specifications. While many materials require testing at the Headquarters Materials Lab, the Qualified Products List can streamline this process. Using materials identified in WSDOT’s Qualified Products List will save the developer costs and time. See: Materials Lab - Qualified Products List (QPL) | WSDOT (wa.gov)
•
•
•
•
•
•
Acceptance of some materials by Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance is also an acceptable practice, especially for the minor quantities associated with many developer projects. Nevertheless, all materials must be approved by WSDOT on a RAMS form (Form 350-071) and all materials must meet WSDOT specifications. It is recommended the Hot Mix Asphalt mix designs and corresponding material sources be obtained from the Qualified Products List. QPL listings eliminate the need to submit mix designs for approval along with the cost of testing and time delay. Aggregates may be approved by manufacturers’ certificate of compliance. They must be produced from a WSDOT approved source. This should be communicated, in writing, to the developer or his/her contractor early in the process. Electrical materials, including structural elements, are complex devices and may require lengthy evaluation and testing processes. The use of preapproved items (such as QPL listed items) can greatly simplify the materials approval process and potentially save a significant amount of time. For example, the use of poles that are not pre-approved requires a structural submittal package to be provided to the WSDOT Bridge & Structures Office (consult Standard Specification 9-29.6), which can take weeks to review depending on workload. For traffic signals owned, operated, and maintained by WSDOT, in accordance with RCW 47.24.020, traffic signal controllers and cabinets must be tested and configured at the WSDOT Headquarters Materials Lab and/or Regional Signal Shop (testing locations are dependent on the WSDOT region responsible for the installation location). This process typically takes 3-6 weeks.
Construction Inspection The level of field inspection required for a developer project varies with the project complexity and region policy and jurisdiction. In some regions the Development Services offices have their own inspectors. Other regions assign inspection of developer projects to a WSDOT Project Engineer. Regardless of the complexity of the
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1130
Development Services
project, the project manager must ensure that construction of all work on WSDOT facilities is adequately inspected for compliance with the Standard Specifications and special provisions. Any proposed changes in the project, after execution of the Developer Agreement, must be reviewed and concurred or approved by WSDOT. Changes may be required by WSDOT if on-site conditions do not prove to be as expected. Minor changes may be resolved in the field with adequate documentation by the WSDOT representative. For any significant design change, WSDOT must notify the developer in writing, stating the specific conditions that must be resolved before the project will be accepted. The developer must submit a written proposal, with plans and supporting documentation, showing what changes will be made to meet WSDOT’s requirements. Plan revisions and addenda will require support office review as was required for the original plan set.
Construction Documentation When WSDOT Region performs project inspection, follow procedures in the Construction Manual. Using a “Daily Diary” or the WSDOT Inspector’s Daily Report (IDR) form is recommended.
Traffic Control Management Consult Section 1-10.2 of the Standard Specifications for traffic control management and traffic control supervisor requirements.
As-Built Construction Plans Upon completion, the developer shall supply WSDOT with As-Built Construction Plans, also known as record drawings, for the work done inside WSDOT right of way. Instructions and examples for preparing and submitting As-Built Plans and Shop Drawings are provided in the Construction Manual Chapter 10.
1130.14 Final Inspection/Acceptance Upon satisfactory completion of the project, WSDOT shall write a letter of final acceptance. If the agreement is a Developer/Local Agency Agreement, then acceptance by the local agency is a prerequisite to final acceptance by WSDOT. WSDOT may hold release of the bond, escrow account, or savings account/certificate of deposit longer to ensure performance of the improvements.
1130.15 Documentation WSDOT prefers electronic signatures on documents. Guidance for digital signatures is available through your Assistant State Design Engineer or Region offices. Local agencies, tribes, and developer projects within WSDOT jurisdiction are required to follow WSDOT design documentation policy as noted in Chapter 300. Retain the following in accordance with WSDOT records retention policy.

1210.02 Horizontal Alignment 1210.02(1) General Horizontal and vertical alignments (see Chapter 1220) are the primary controlling elements for highway design. It is important to coordinate these two elements with design speed, drainage, intersection design, and aesthetic principles in the early stages of design. How horizontal alignments are designed depends largely on the context and selected design controls. Lower-speed environments can be more forgiving than higher-speed environments.
1210.02(1)(a) Low-Speed Alignments Consider the following when designing low-speed horizontal alignments: a) Determine whether sufficient contextual elements exist within the roadway cross section to indicate the desired low-speed environment (street trees, lack of building setbacks, streetside amenities, etc.). b) Determine whether horizontal geometric traffic calming treatments will be needed to maintain the selected design speed (see Chapter 1103). c) Avoid placing pedestrian midblock crossings within horizontal curves.

Page 1210-1
Chapter 1210
Geometric Plan Elements
1210.02(1)(b) High-Speed Alignments Horizontal alignments designed for high speed are likely to have modal priorities for freight and passenger vehicles, and it is necessary to strive for forgiving and predictable alignments within high-speed environments. Exhibit 1220-2 through Exhibit 1210-3 show desirable and undesirable alignment examples for use with the following considerations: a) Make the highway alignment as direct as practicable and still blend with the topography while considering developed and undeveloped properties, community boundaries, and environmental concerns. b) Make highway alignment consistent by:
•
•
•
Using gentle curves at the end of long tangents. Using a transition area of moderate curvature between the large radius curves of rural areas and the small radius curves of populated areas. Making horizontal curves visible to approaching traffic.
c) Avoid minimum radii and short curves unless:
•
•
Restrictive conditions are present and alternatives are not readily or economically avoidable. On two-lane highways, minimum radii result in tangent sections long enough for needed passing.
d) Avoid any abrupt change in alignment. Design reverse curves with an intervening tangent long enough for complete superelevation transition for both curves. See Chapter 1250 for more information on superelevation transitions. e) Avoid the use of curves in the same direction connected by short tangents (broken back curves); substitute a single larger curve. f) Avoid compound curves on open highway alignment if a simple curve can be obtained. When compound curves are used, make the shorter radius at least two-thirds the longer radius. Make the total arc length of a compound curve not less than 500 feet. g) On divided multilane highways, take advantage of independent alignment to produce a flowing alignment along natural terrain. h) The desirable locations for bridges, interchanges, intersections, and temporary connections are on tangent sections in clear view of drivers. i) On two-lane two-way highways, strive for as much passing sight distance as possible (see Chapter 1260).
1210.02(2) Horizontal Curve Radii Design speed is the governing variable of horizontal curves. For guidance regarding design speed selection, see Chapter 1103, and see Chapter 1360 for ramps. Use the following factors to determine the radius for a curve:
•
•
Low to intermediate design speed environments may need to utilize horizontal curves to maintain the desired operating speed. Horizontal curvature, more than any other design element or treatment, provides the best speed management results. See Chapter 1103 for more information on speed management. Stopping sight distance where sight obstructions are on the inside of a curve. Median barriers, bridges, walls, cut slopes, wooded areas, buildings, and guardrails are examples of sight obstructions. See Chapter 1260 to check for stopping sight distance for the selected design speed.

Geometric Plan Elements
Superelevation is the rotation or banking of the roadway cross section to overcome part of the centrifugal force that acts on a vehicle traversing a curve. Design information on the relationship between design speed, radius of curve, and superelevation is in Chapter 1250. Coordinate vertical and horizontal alignment (see Chapter 1220).
Spiral curves, although no longer used on new highway construction or major realignment, still exist on Washington’s highways. Spirals were used to transition between tangents and circular curves with the horizontal curvature rate increasing from tangent to the central curve and decreasing from curve to tangent. Spirals do not pose an operational concern and may remain in place. (See A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets for information on spirals.)
1210.02(3) Horizontal Curve Length A curve is not required for small deflection angles. Exhibit 1210-1 gives the maximum allowable angle without a curve. (See Chapter 1310 for guidance on angle points or short radii curves in the vicinity of intersections at grade.) To avoid the appearance of a kink in the road, the desirable length of curve for deflection angles larger than given in Exhibit 1210-1 is at least 500 feet. Exhibit 1210-1 Maximum Angle without Curve

1210.03 Distribution Facilities 1210.03(1) General In addition to the main highway under consideration, other facilities can be used to distribute traffic to and from the highway and to provide access. Highway flexibility can be augmented by:
•
•
•
•
•
Frontage roads Collector-distributor roads On and off connections Parallel arterial routes with connections between them and the main highway Loop highways around large metropolitan areas
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1210-3
Chapter 1210
Geometric Plan Elements
A city or county may be asked to accept a proposed distribution facility as a city street or county road. Plan and design these facilities according to the applicable design values as city streets or county roads (see Chapter 1230).
1210.03(2) Frontage Roads Frontage roads constructed as part of highway development may serve to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Reestablish continuity of an existing road severed by the highway. Provide service connections to adjacent property that would otherwise be isolated as a result of construction of the highway. Control access to the highway. Maintain circulation of traffic on each side of the highway. Segregate local traffic from the higher speed through traffic and intercept driveways of residences and commercial establishments along the highway. Relieve congestion on the arterial highway during periods of high use or in emergency situations.
Frontage roads are generally not permanent state facilities. They are usually turned back to the local jurisdiction. Plan and design frontage roads as city streets or county roads (see Chapter 1230). Initiate coordination with the local agency that will be the recipient of the facility early in the planning process, and continue through design and construction. (See Chapter 530 for additional guidance on frontage roads and turnbacks.) Outer separations function as buffers between the through traffic on the highway and the local traffic on the frontage road. The width is governed by requirements for grading, signing, barriers, aesthetics, headlight glare, and ramps. Where possible, make the separation wide enough to allow for development on both sides of the frontage road. Wider separations also move the intersection with the frontage road and a crossroad farther from the intersection with the through roadway, and they can reduce the amount of limited access control rights to be acquired (see Chapter 530). Where two-way frontage roads are provided, make the outer separation wide enough to minimize the effects of approaching traffic on the right, particularly the headlight glare. (See Chapter 1600 for information on headlight glare considerations.) With one-way same-direction frontage roads, the outer separation need not be as wide as with two-way frontage roads. Wide separations lend themselves to landscape treatment and can enhance the appearance of both the highway and the adjoining property. A substantial width of outer separation is particularly advantageous at intersections with cross streets. The wider separation reduces conflicts with pedestrians and bicycles. Where ramp connections are provided between the through roadway and the frontage road, the minimum outer separation width depends on design of the ramp termini.

1210.04 Number of Lanes and Arrangement 1210.04(1) General The basic number of lanes is designated and maintained over a length of highway. The total number of lanes is the basic number of lanes plus any auxiliary lanes provided to meet:
•
•
•
Level of service (volume-capacity) Lane balance Flexibility of operation
1210.04(2) Basic Number of Lanes In certain situations, it is appropriate to keep the basic number of lanes constant over a highway route, or a significant portion thereof, regardless of changes in traffic volume. However, this can lead to unnecessary property or environmental impacts that need to be balanced throughout a design. Consider the impacts, human factors, and traffic analysis before making decisions regarding basic number of lane consistency throughout a highway route. Change the basic number of lanes for general changes in traffic volume over a substantial length of the route. The desirable location for a reduction in the basic number of lanes is on a tangent section between interchanges or intersections. However, there can be advantages in using dedicated turn lanes at intersections as a means to reduce the number of lanes. To accommodate high traffic volumes for short distances, such as between adjacent interchanges, use auxiliary lanes. When auxiliary lanes are provided on consecutive sections between interchanges, consider increasing the basic number of lanes through the entire length.
1210.04(3) Auxiliary Lanes Auxiliary lanes are added to the basic number of lanes to allow additional traffic movements on short segments. These added lanes are based primarily on volume-to-capacity relationships (see Chapter 320). For efficient operation of auxiliary lanes, see the following:

When a lane width change does not create an angle point in an adjacent lane, a 25:1 taper is sufficient.

Geometric Plan Elements
1210.05(1)(b) Reduce Number of Lanes To reduce the number of lanes, provide a transition with the following guidelines:
•
•
•
•
Locate transitions where decision sight distance exists, desirably on a tangent section and on the approach side of any crest vertical curve, except the end of climbing lanes, which are transitioned in accordance with Chapter 1270. Supplement the transition with traffic control devices. Reduce the number of lanes by dropping only one at a time from the right side in the direction of travel. See the MUTCD when dropping more than one lane in a single direction. Use the following formula to determine the minimum length of the lane transition for speeds 45 mph or more: 𝐿 = 𝑉𝑇 Where: L = Length of transition (ft) V = Design speed (mph) T = Tangential offset width (ft)
•
Use the following formula to determine the minimum length of the lane transition for speeds less than 45 mph: 𝐿 = (𝑇𝑉^2)/60 Where: L
= Length of transition (ft)
V
= Design speed (mph)
T
= Tangential offset width (ft)
1210.05(1)(c) Increase Number of Lanes To increase the number of lanes, a tangential rate of change in the range of 1:4 to 1:15 is sufficient. Aesthetics are the main consideration.
1210.05(1)(d) Turning Roadway For turning roadway widening width transitions, see Chapter 1240.
1210.05(2) Median Width Transitions Whenever two abutting sections have different median widths, use long, smooth transitions (L = VT or flatter). When horizontal curves are present, this can be accomplished by providing the transition throughout the length of the curve. For transitions on tangent sections, the transitions may be applied symmetrically about the centerline or on only one side of the median based on whether or not the abutting existing section is programmed for the wider median in the future. For aesthetics, make the transition length as long as feasible.

1220.01 General Vertical alignment (roadway profile) consists of a series of gradients connected by vertical curves. It is mainly controlled by the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Topography Class of highway Horizontal alignment Safety Sight distance Construction costs Drainage Adjacent land use Vehicular characteristics Aesthetics

1220.02 Vertical Alignment 1220.02(1) Design Principles The following are general principles for developing vertical alignment (also see Exhibit 1220-4 through Exhibit 1220-7):
•
•
•
•
Use a smooth grade line with gradual changes, consistent with the context identification and character of terrain. Avoid numerous breaks and short grades. Avoid “roller coaster” or “hidden dip” profiles by use of gradual grades made possible by heavier cuts and fills or by introducing some horizontal curvature in conjunction with the vertical curvature. Avoid grades that affect truck speeds and, therefore, traffic operations. Avoid broken back grade lines with short tangents between two vertical curves.

Geometric Profile Elements
Use long vertical curves to flatten grades near the top of long, steep grades. Where at-grade intersections occur on roadways with moderate to steep grades, it is desirable to flatten or reduce the grade through the intersection. Establish the subgrade at least 1 foot above the high water table (real or potential), or as recommended by the Region Materials Engineer. Consider the low side of superelevated roadways. When a vertical curve takes place partly or wholly in a horizontal curve, coordinate the two as discussed in Section 1220.03.
1220.02(2) Minimum Length of Vertical Curves (Section rewritten ) The minimum length of a vertical curve is controlled by design speed, stopping sight distance, and the change in grade.
1220.02(2)(a) New Construction Projects For new construction (building a street where one does not currently exist), the minimum length of the vertical curve must meet stopping sight distance (see Chapter 1260) or have a length at least three times the design speed, whichever is greater. For aesthetics, the desirable length of a vertical curve is two to three times the length needed for stopping sight distance.
1220.02(2)(b) Reconstruction Projects On reconstruction projects, a zero-length vertical curve may be used as follows:
•
•
Intermediate and Low Speeds: Algebraic difference of 1.0% or less High Speeds: Algebraic Difference of 0.5% or less
Zero-length vertical curves are meant for spot locations to accommodate small profile changes that match into existing profiles. For example, modifying the existing profile for an overlay or adjusting the profile to accommodate a fish passage structure. Do not use a series of zero-length vertical curves as a replacement for a properly designed vertical curve. The minimum length of crest vertical curves shall be the same as new construction. The minimum length of sag vertical curves is determined using Exhibit 1220-1. There are two minimum lengths listed in Exhibit 1220-1: minimum and desired minimum. Try to meet the desired minimum as it provides more sight distance for nighttime driving. If you are unable to meet the desired minimums and must drop to the minimum, document your decision in the Design Documentation Package. A spreadsheet is available on the Design Support website to calculate the minimum and desired minimum shown in Exhibit 1220-1.

* The calculated value of L cannot be less than what is required for comfort. Use the formula for comfort shown above. In this case, the comfort equation may be used within pedestrian crossings or intersections because sight distance is not restricted by the sag vertical curve. ** The comfort equation cannot be applied when the curve is within an intersection or a pedestrian crossing. In these situations, the minimum sag vertical curve must meet stopping sight distance. *** All values for SSD used in this table must be adjusted for grade per Section 1260.03(2).
1220.02(3) Maximum Grades Analyze grades for their effect on traffic operation because they may result in undesirable truck speeds. Maximum grades are controlled by terrain type and design speed (see Exhibit 1220-4 and Section 1360.03(3) for ramp grades).
1220.02(4) Minimum Grades Minimum grades are used to meet drainage requirements. Avoid selecting a “roller coaster” or “hidden dip” profile merely to accommodate drainage. Minimum ditch gradients of 0.3% on paved materials and 0.5% on earth can be obtained independently of roadway grade. Medians, long sag vertical curves, and relatively flat terrain are examples of areas where independent ditch design may be justified. A closed drainage system may be needed as part of an independent ditch design.
1220.02(5) Length of Grade The desirable maximum length of grade is the maximum length on an upgrade at which a loaded truck will operate without a 10 mph reduction. Exhibit 1220-2 gives the desirable maximum length for a given percent of grade. When grades longer than the desirable maximum are unavoidable, consider an auxiliary climbing lane (see Chapter 1270). For grades that are not at a constant percent, use the average. When long, steep downgrades are unavoidable, consider an emergency escape ramp, and for grades longer than indicated, consider an auxiliary climbing lane (see Chapter 1270).

For grades longer than indicated, consider an auxiliary climbing lane (see Chapter 1270).
1220.02(6) Grade and Speed Considerations Grades can affect the operating performance of the vehicles negotiating them. The bicycle, transit, and freight modes are most affected by grades, while passenger cars can readily negotiate grades as steep as 5% without appreciable loss of operating speed. Steep downgrades can also impact operating speeds, particularly for heavy trucks, which display up to a 5% increase in speed on downgrades. Consider the selected performance for a location and corridor before making a determination on grade selection, to avoid unnecessary cuts or fills required for a vertical alignment. Exhibit 1220-3 provides the maximum grades based on the context, terrain classification, and targeted speed.

1220.02(7) Alignment on Structures Where practicable, avoid high skew, vertical curvature, horizontal curvature, and superelevation on structures, but do not sacrifice safe roadway alignment to achieve this.
1220.03 Coordination of Vertical and Horizontal Alignments Do not design horizontal and vertical alignments independently. Coordinate them to obtain uniform speed, pleasing appearance, and efficient traffic operation. Coordination can be achieved by plotting the location of the horizontal curves on the working profile to help visualize the highway in three dimensions. Perspective plots will also give a view of the proposed alignment. Exhibit 1220-4 and Exhibit 1220-5 show sketches of desirable and undesirable coordination of horizontal and vertical alignment. Guides for the coordination of the vertical and horizontal alignment are as follows:
•
•
Balance curvature and grades. Using steep grades to achieve long tangents and flat curves or excessive curvature to achieve flat grades are both poor designs. Vertical curvature superimposed on horizontal curvature generally results in a more pleasing facility. Successive changes in profile not in combination with horizontal curvature may result in a series of dips not visible to the driver.

Geometric Profile Elements
Do not begin or end a horizontal curve at or near the top of a crest vertical curve. A driver may not recognize the beginning or ending of the horizontal curve, especially at night. An alignment where the horizontal curve leads the vertical curve and is longer than the vertical curve in both directions is desirable. To maintain drainage, design vertical and horizontal curves so that the flat profile of a vertical curve is not located near the flat cross slope of the superelevation transition. Do not introduce a sharp horizontal curve at or near the low point of a pronounced sag vertical curve. The road ahead is foreshortened and any horizontal curve that is not flat assumes an undesirably distorted appearance. Further, vehicular speeds, particularly of trucks, often are high at the bottom of grades and erratic operation may result, especially at night. On two-lane roads, the need for passing sections (at frequent intervals and for an appreciable percentage of the length of the roadway) often supersedes the general desirability for the combination of horizontal and vertical alignment. Work toward long tangent sections to secure sufficient passing sight distance. On divided highways, consider variation in the width of medians and the use of independent alignments to derive the design and operational advantages of one-way roadways. Make the horizontal curvature and profile as flat as practicable at intersections where sight distance along both roads is important and vehicles may have to slow or stop. In residential areas, design the alignment to minimize nuisance factors to the neighborhood. Generally, a depressed facility makes a highway less visible and less noisy to adjacent residents. Minor horizontal adjustments can sometimes be made to increase the buffer zone between the highway and clusters of homes. Design the alignment to enhance attractive scenic views of the natural and constructed environment, such as rivers, rock formations, parks, and outstanding buildings.
When superelevation transitions fall within the limits of a vertical curve, plot profiles of the edges of pavement and check for smooth transitions.
1220.04 Airport Clearance Contact the airport authorities early for proposed highway construction or alteration in the vicinity of a public or military airport, so that advance planning and design work can proceed within the required Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations (see the Environmental Manual).
1220.05 Railroad Crossings When a highway crosses a railroad at grade, design the highway grade to prevent low-hung vehicles from damaging the rails or getting hung up on the tracks. Exhibit 1220-8 gives guidance on designing highway grades at railroad crossings. For more information on railroad-highway crossings, see Chapter 1350.
1220.06 Procedures When the project modifies the vertical alignment, develop vertical alignment plans for inclusion in the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) to a scale suitable for showing vertical alignment for all proposed roadways, including ground line, grades, vertical curves, and superelevation. (See the Plans Preparation Manual for guidance.) When justifying any modification to the vertical alignment, include the reasons for the change, alternatives addressed (if any) and why the selected alternative was chosen.

This combination is deficient for several reasons:
•
•
•
The curve reversal is on a crest, making the second curve less visible. The tangent is too short for the superelevation transition. The flat area of the superelevation transition will be near the flat grade in the crest.

When choosing any geometric cross section dimension, including lane or shoulder width, read the guidance that is specific to the facility type. Also, read the general guidance related to common elements such as lanes, shoulders, side slopes, etc. See Chapter 1106 for the general dimensioning guidance. This chapter also contains guidance related to jurisdiction.
1230.01 General The geometric cross section is composed of multiple lateral design elements such as lanes, shoulders, medians, bike facilities, and sidewalks. The designer’s task is to select, size, and document these elements appropriately. There is flexibility in the selection of design element dimensioning. All WSDOT routes, regardless of context, are referred to in the Design Manual as “highways.” Under this definition, freeways are a subset of highways while Interstate freeways are one specific type of freeway. Refer to the Design Manual Glossary of Terms for many of the terms used in this chapter. See Chapter 300 for design documentation requirements.
1230.02 Guidance for Specific Facility Types Guidance regarding geometric cross sections is located in various Design Manual chapters. The chapter depends on the facility type. Examples of specific facility types include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Highways (general) Freeways Ramps Auxiliary lanes Collector-Distributor lanes Service lanes Frontage roads HOV facilities

Geometric cross section guidance for other special purpose facilities is in various chapters. Examples include special use lanes, bridges, transit facilities, bus pull outs, median U-turns and crossovers, enforcement areas, truck weighing facilities, pedestrian bridges and tunnels, sidewalks & bicycle facilities
Notes: General guidance for curb design is in Chapter 1239. Guidance for curb is also found for numerous types of facilities (Chapter 1310 and others.) [1] Passing and climbing lanes, see Chapter 1270; Auxiliary lanes between interchanges see Chapter 1360. Exhibit 1230-1 is not a comprehensive list of guidance associated with either a facility or a design element.

1230.04 Jurisdiction for Design and Maintenance On all state highways in locations outside of cities or towns and within limited access design areas, geometric design is to be consistent with this Design Manual. On state highways within an incorporated city or town, develop design features in cooperation with the local agency. For NHS routes, use the Design Manual. For non-NHS routes, the Local Agency Guidelines may be used for dimensioning design elements Cross-sectional design within incorporated cities or towns can get complicated due to the joint-jurisdictional authority. WSDOT typically has jurisdiction between the backs of curbs, and cities typically have jurisdiction outside the backs of curbs (see Exhibit 1230-2). When no curb is present, the city or town holds responsibility for the roadside outside the paved shoulder. Despite the jurisdictional differences, it is extremely important to cooperatively determine a cross-sectional design. Refer to Chapter 301 for additional information on jurisdictional maintenance responsibilities and considerations for maintenance agreements.

1231.01 General Geometric cross sections for state highways are governed by the need to balance performance metrics, the context, and selected design controls. The objective is to optimize the use of available public space while avoiding an unreasonable investment in right of way acquisition. The term “highways” refers to all WSDOT roadways, including freeways; however, note that freeways have their own geometric cross section guidance. This chapter is not intended for freeway design. See Chapter 1232 for freeways.
1231.02 Design Up Unless otherwise specified, use the “design up” method described in Chapter 1106 to choose a design element width when a range of widths is given in this chapter.
1231.03 Common Elements The geometric cross sections shown in this chapter have many elements that are also common to facilities addressed in other chapters. The following chapters contain guidance related to these common geometric cross section elements:

1231.04 Cross Section Elements 1231.04(1) Vehicle Lanes There are many types of lanes that may exist in a cross section, and each has its own purpose and sizing needs. General-purpose traffic lanes need to accommodate a variety of vehicle types including buses, freight vehicles, personal automotive vehicles, and bicycles. The target speed, modal priority, balance of performance needs, and transportation context are all considerations when determining size, type, and number of lanes. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Notes: [1] The width shown is exclusive of the gutter if the gutter is a color that contrasts with the roadway. [2] See Chapter 1430 for part time shoulders and Chapter 1440 for metered shoulders. Established or common practices can be useful in determining and documenting lane width selection where a range of width values is provided. A brief list of these practices and some of their benefits is provided in Exhibit 1231-1. Engage subject matter experts in traffic operations, multimodal planning, and maintenance to establish and document the mode, function, performance, and tradeoffs involved (see DM Chapter 1106) prior to making the decision. Lane Width Considerations Roadways on curves, see Chapter 1240 Turning Roadway Widths Narrower lanes may be used as part of a speed reduction strategy
General
Two-lane, two-way rural highways: 12 ft lanes provide clearance between large vehicles traveling in opposing directions. Especially beneficial when high volumes or high truck percentages expected. On multilane facilities with width constraints, utilizing narrower inside lanes may permit wider outside lanes for bicycles, freight, and transit. Reduced lane widths allow more lanes to be provided in areas with constraints and allow shorter pedestrian crossing times because of reduced crossing distances. 12 ft lanes provide increased benefit on high speed, free-flowing principle arterials.
Intermediate to High Speed
12 ft lanes provide increased benefit where there are higher truck volumes, especially for intermediate and high-speed facilities. Safety and mobility performance difference between 11 ft and 12 ft lanes can be negligible. Work with Region Traffic Office to evaluate performance differences for the subject roadway 11 ft lanes are common on urban arterials
Low Speed
Lane widths of 10 ft may be appropriate in constrained areas with low truck and bus volume In pedestrian oriented sections, 10 ft lanes can be beneficial in minimizing crossing distance

Chapter 1231
Geometric Cross Section – Highways
1231.04(1)(b) Turn Lanes Dedicated turn lanes are separated from the through lanes and provide storage for turning vehicles waiting for a signal or gap in opposing traffic. There are a number of different types of turn lanes which are discussed in detail in Chapter 1310. Turn lanes are useful when addressing the mobility and accessibility performance of motorized and bicycle modes. Traffic analysis determines the type, storage length, and number of turn lanes that are needed to achieve the balance of multimodal performance needs. Turn lanes present potential conflicts, particularly with bicyclists and pedestrians. See Chapter 1510 and Chapter 1520 for additional discussion on ways to mitigate for these conflicts.
1231.04(1)(c) Transit-Only Lanes Transit-only lanes are ideal for improving transit mobility performance and segregating heavily used or complex intermodal connections. There are many different ways to configure these within a geometric cross section. Some configurations are limited due to passenger loading needs for both the transit vehicle type and the stop locations. Develop widths for transit-only lanes with the partnering transit agency. See Chapter 1730 for additional information on Transit Facility considerations.
1231.04(1)(d) Auxiliary lanes Auxiliary lanes enhance mobility performance for motor vehicles. See Chapter 1270 for design guidance and a detailed discussion on the types of auxiliary lanes.
1231.04(1)(e) Managed and Shared Lanes There are many different types of managed and shared lanes. Some examples include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
High occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes (see Chapter 1410) Express toll lanes (ETL) (discuss with Tolling Division and see Chapter 1410) Part-time shoulder Metered shoulder Bicycle shared lane (see Chapter 1520) Business access and transit (BAT) lane (see Chapter 1410, Arterial Street HOV)
1231.05 Bicycle and Pedestrian Elements Bicycle and pedestrian elements include sidewalks, buffers, bicycle lanes and shared-use-paths. Note that shoulders designed to accommodate bicycles or pedestrians are not considered bicycle lanes. See Chapter 1510 and Chapter 1520 for information on the design of pedestrian and bicycle facilities.
1231.06 Designing Cross Sections (Section Rewritten 2023) Select a cross section configuration that is based on the design elements and dimensions included in the project’s preferred alternative (Chapter 1104, Chapter 1105, Chapter 1106), and the applicable design controls (Chapter 1103), and in the case of Complete Streets, including the required level of traffic stress (see Chapter 1510 and Chapter 1520). Where a range of values is provided for a cross section element, either in the examples below or in the applicable chapter in this manual, use the “mode, function, performance” approach to select and document the appropriate dimensions (see Chapter 1106).

1231.07 Cross Section Examples The cross-section examples in this section are organized by modal priority based on the following primary modes:
Motor Vehicles, including freight
Bicycles
Pedestrians
Transit
The cross-section examples shown in Exhibit 1231-2 through Exhibit 1231-7 depict various combinations of elements that may be included in a cross section. The examples are intended to stimulate designer creativity and awareness of modal accommodations and are not intended to be standard cross sections to be reproduced for a given modal priority. It is expected that innovative project alternatives will result in diverse configurations that best balance baseline and contextual needs (see Chapter 1101). The intention in providing these examples is to depict combinations of elements that may be included in a cross section depending on modal priority and Level of Traffic Stress needs. These examples are not standards, but instead are intended to be a starting point in the design process, demonstrating noteworthy practices in how to accommodate a given modal priority. Note that the dimensions shown in the examples represent design policy (except where noted as optional), and decisions to depart from the value or range shown for a particular element (based on the function described for it) requires a Design Analysis (see Section 300.03(2)(a). Refer to the specific chapters referenced in the examples for more information about the configuration of individual elements, combinations of elements, and their required dimensions (or range of dimensions). Maintaining the continuity of a roadway is an important consideration, particularly for limited access and other high-speed highways. However, it is also appropriate to change continuity as context changes in order to influence driver behavior. When designing intentional changes to the continuity of the roadway cross section, consider what is needed to enable the transition. High-speed to low-speed changes will need to transition the cross section over a distance utilizing a speed transition segment (see Chapter 1103).
1231.07(1) Auto-and Freight Oriented Cross Sections Exhibit 1231-3 shows examples of motorized vehicle-oriented designs. Motorized vehicles come in a variety of types which are operated on many vehicle lanes and parking areas. The performance needs of freight and other automotive vehicle types are often similar. However, certain truck vehicle types may require additional turning roadway width for off-tracking (see Chapter 1240), or at other locations a truck climbing lane may be needed to facilitate mobility performance (see Chapter 1270). Generally, lane width within suburban and urban contexts is less critical for mobility and safety performance than in rural and high-speed contexts. Within urban areas, placement of and sizing for loading areas within the parking areas can depend on the freight vehicle type.

1231.07(2) Cross Sections Featuring Bicycle Facilities Exhibit 1231-3 Example A features bicycle facilities at an intermediate-speed location. Bike lane location within the cross section depends largely on how cyclists will interact with the land use and potential modal conflicts. Locating directional bike lanes on the outside of the motor vehicle lanes can improve accessibility for bicyclists. If cyclist mobility performance is a primary concern or intermodal conflicts (such as transit stop locations) are present, locating a two-way bike facility on one side of the roadway may be more appropriate. Whether or not a bike lane buffer is needed depends mostly on the target speed and average daily traffic (ADT) of the facility; the intent of bike buffers or other protected bike facilities is to address safety performance for cyclists. Buffers and other means of modal segregation also benefit motor vehicle drivers and bicyclists by delineating allocated spaces. Both roadway bike lane configurations and bike facility selection are discussed in more detail in Chapter 1520.

1231.07(3) Cross Sections Featuring Pedestrian Facilities Exhibit 1231-5 shows cross-section examples featuring pedestrian facilities. The pedestrian mode is a vital transportation mode since, for most people, nearly every trip at least begins and ends by walking or rolling. Roadway facilities prioritized for pedestrians emphasize streetside elements. See Chapter 1238 for guidance regarding streetside elements. The objective is to achieve the Pedestrian Circulation Path (PCP) necessary to support mobility, socioeconomic, and accessibility needs and provide access to intermodal connections. The configuration and dimension of streetside elements varies significantly depending on the performance needs being addressed. See Chapter 1510 for additional pedestrian design requirements and considerations.

1231.07(4) Cross Sections Featuring Transit Facilities Exhibit 1231-6 provides examples of different potential configurations oriented for the transit mode. Work with the transit provider to determine their ability to operate within a given cross-sectional arrangement. In general, transit configurations can be positioned toward the side or center of a roadway. Both side and center configurations can be implemented with medians or outer separations to improve safety performance for intermodal connections, or mobility performance for the transit service. Exhibit 1231-6 Example A shows a central configuration for transit service that provides a separated bus-only lane. Other transit vehicle types may require different widths and may also require other median cross section configurations for passenger loading. Exhibit 1231-6 Example B shows a side configuration where transit vehicles occupy the outside lane. This example can also be configured as business access and transit [BAT] lanes. Note the importance of streetside elements to assist with intermodal connections. Exhibit 1231-6 Example C is an example of a type of special use lane for high-speed routes that are routinely congested. In this example, the shoulder allows the restricted use for buses.

1231.07(5) Example Cross-Sections – Complete Streets Complete street configurations attempt to balance the performance needs of all users, regardless of age, ability, or mode. The general intent is to provide context-appropriate designs that enable safe access for all design users. It is always important to consider modal connectivity and conflicts that may occur with complete street configurations, particularly at intersections and/or transit stop locations. There are different potential configurations for complete streets, such as:
•
•
•
A rural two-lane highway with an adjacent shared-use path. An urban highway or street with vehicle lanes, bike lanes, bus lanes, and sidewalks. An urban highway that undergoes a “road diet” (see Section 1231.08) including installation of additional pedestrian crossings.
The low-speed examples in Exhibit 1231-7 illustrate roadway cross sections that:
•
•
•
•
Separate access lanes from through traffic lanes using curbed islands. Reduce conflicts between pedestrian, bike, transit, and auto modes by separating them. Provide transit stops integrated with raised islands. May result in improved operations for all modes.

1231.08 Roadway Cross Section Reallocation Roadway cross section reallocation (also known as road diets or road buffets) change the channelization and roadway features of an existing roadway to improve multimodal performance. At intersections and access points, a reallocation can improve sight distances, may improve access management along the road, and in some cases may also improve mobility performance for motorists. A common example is converting four-lane undivided highways to three lanes with the center lane for left turning movements and the remaining outside space repurposed for bicyclists or other functions. The center lane can consist of a two-way left-turn lane (TWLTL) or can be dedicated for directional left turns either by paint or other median treatments. The choice of how to configure the center lane depends largely on balancing the resulting safety and accessibility performance of different modes and land uses. (See Chapter 540 for additional restrictions on the use of TWLTLs)
Typical Road Diet Basic Design from FHWA Road Diet Informational Guide
Refer to “Guidebook for Roadway Cross Section Reallocation” (NCHRP 1036) for more information about developing reallocation alternatives, analyzing tradeoffs, and identifying a preferred alternative. The Region Traffic Engineer must approve reallocation applications on state highways. Retrofit options refer to the application of lower-cost treatments that utilize paint and other delineation devices rather than hardscape features. See Chapter 1238 for more information on retrofit options such as relocating the curb, parklets and plazas.

If your roadway fits the definition of a freeway, use the guidance in this chapter for geometric cross-section elements. If your roadway is not a freeway, see Chapter 1230.
1232.01 General Freeways are defined as divided highways with a minimum of two lanes in each direction for the exclusive use of vehicular traffic and with full control of access. Interstate is one type of freeway. Freeways are high-speed facilities that prioritize through travel for vehicles, freight and transit. Lanes must be wide enough for all vehicles that use them. Shoulders provide very important functions for freeways. Freeways can be thought of as a unique context. This is reflected by the fact that design controls (Chapter 1103) are fairly consistent for all freeways:
•
•
•
Modal priority: motor vehicles Access control: full control Design speed: high
Freeways do not present the challenges of accommodating the competing needs of other modes such as pedestrians. Also, adjacent land use is generally not an issue due to freeways being limited access facilities. For these reasons, choosing cross-sectional element dimensions for freeways does not have as many complexities as for some other roadway types. Note that there are locations where bicyclists are allowed use of the freeway shoulder. The geometric cross-section for interstate freeways is shown in Exhibit 1232-1. The geometric cross-section for non-interstate freeways is shown in Exhibit 1232-2. Refer to the Design Manual Glossary for terms used in this chapter. Refer to Chapter 300 for design documentation requirements.
1232.02 Lane Width For freeways, travel-through mobility and safety for motor vehicles are prioritized performance areas. Lanes must be wide enough for all vehicles that use them to travel safely at high speeds. When a range is given for lane width, use the mode/function/performance approach described in Chapter 1106 and “design up” to choose a width within the range. See Chapter 1231 for considerations for choosing a lane width.
1232.03 Shoulder Width The prioritization of travel-through mobility and safety for motor vehicles results in placing a high priority on providing some important shoulder functions (see Chapter 1239) for freeways:
•
•
Stopping out of traffic Emergency services & incidence response

Chapter 1232
•
Geometric Cross Section – Freeways
Maintenance operations
The high-speed nature of freeways reinforces the importance of providing these functions. For instance, the high speed differential between a stopped vehicle and adjacent traffic leads to a greater need to get stopped traffic out of the travelled way. Also, the limited access nature of freeways generally means that there are fewer access points to provide potential refuge. When a range is given for shoulder width, use the mode/function/performance approach described in Chapter 1106 and “design up” to choose a width within the range. See Chapter 1239 for additional considerations for choosing a shoulder width.

1232.05 Design Flexibility There are always locations that warrant special consideration. Existing freeways may have constraints (right-ofway or environmental considerations, for example) that make the cost of widening outweigh the benefits. The optimum solution may include widths different than those shown. If this is the case for your project, and you choose widths different than shown in the Design Manual, formulate alternative solutions that consider the tradeoffs associated with various lane and shoulder widths and document the decision in a Design Analysis. Where appropriate, include documentation of your consultation with the project advisory team (see Chapter 1100) in the Design Analysis. When compiling the Design Analysis, consider recent design resources that explore options, performance, functions, and mitigation associated with various lane and shoulder dimensions. One source is FHWA HOP-16060 “Use of Narrow Lanes and Narrow Shoulders on Freeways.” Another source is NCHRP 15-47, “Developing an Improved Highway Geometric Design Process”.

Exhibit 1238-1 Zones within the Streetside
1238.01 General The geometric cross section of a roadway is composed of different elements. The cross sections shown in Chapter 1231 include parking and various zones within the streetside (see Exhibit 1238-1). This chapter provides information on parking and streetside elements. The need to provide a particular element is dependent on the context and modal needs for a given section of roadway.
1238.02 Parking On-street parking is typically provided in urban and rural town center areas, but is not necessarily required. Onstreet parking can help visually narrow the street in places to assist in conveying the surrounding context for the segment. Refer to municipal codes regarding parking requirements, and coordinate with the municipality involved. Also, if on-street parking will be either delineated or metered, the ADA has requirements on the number and configuration of parking stalls for people with disabilities. Consult with a regional ADA subject matter expert. On-street parking can be either parallel or angled. However, angled parking on any state route requires approval from the State Traffic Engineer. Submit a request for angled parking approval through the region Traffic Office. Include an engineering study documenting that the parking will not unduly reduce safety and that the roadway is of sufficient width that parking will not interfere with the normal movement of traffic. Provide for vehicle overhang within the furnishing zone for all angled parking locations. Consider back-in angled parking if bike lanes are present to improve conflict management through increased visibility. When designing parking locations for freight loading areas, it is important to consider both the delivery vehicle size and how the vehicle loading/unloading is done. Consult with business owners and freight carriers to locate and configure the freight loading areas. Width considerations: Cross sections in the Design Manual generally show a range for parallel parking of 7 to 9 feet. AASHTO defines a passenger car width as 7 feet. Additional width can allow a buffer for car doors opening, a buffer for bike riders, or a stall that can accommodate delivery trucks. Work with stakeholders to determine the appropriate width to provide within the site-specific constraints.
1238.03 Streetside The area behind the curb is referred to as the “streetside” and is described in terms of “zones.” Information about each zone is provided below. Note, local agency partners may have policy containing additional streetside zones to consider.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1238-1
Chapter 1238
Geometric Cross Section – Streetside and Parking
WSDOT uses the following terminology to describe the zones found within the streetside:
•
•
•
Frontage Zone Pedestrian Zone Furnishing Zone
Exhibit 1238-1 Zones within the Streetside
The streetside is the interface between pedestrians and land use. A robust streetside can serve as both a pedestrian thoroughfare and a destination, which is desirable in many urban core and main street contexts to help promote economic vitality. The streetside can also reinforce the target speed. The pedestrian zone will always be present in streetside design, but other zones are optional and dependent on the modal and contextual needs and desired balance of performance needs within the available right of way. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires specific design element dimensions for streetside elements, depending on the configuration. In general, the pedestrian zone and frontage zone will always be part of the pedestrian circulation path (PCP). The furnishing zone may or may not be part of the PCP, depending on how it is designed. See Chapter 1510 for detailed accessibility criteria and design guidance for pedestrian facilities.
1238.03(1) Frontage Zone The frontage zone serves the retail functions, and is the portion of the sidewalk that provides the connection to the building. The frontage zone includes the building, the façade, and the space immediately adjacent to the building. The primary purpose is access to retail space without interfering with the required pedestrian access route (PAR) within the pedestrian zone. The frontage zone may also provide space for sidewalk cafes, temporary retail product displays, advertisements, and/or outdoor seating for customers. If there is no retail or residential access need adjacent to the streetside, a frontage zone may not be necessary. Width considerations: Cross sections in Design Manual generally show a range for the frontage zone width of 2 to 12 feet.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1238-2
Chapter 1238
Geometric Cross Section – Streetside and Parking
Narrow, 2-ft frontage zones provide for a clear area where protruding objects from the building can be located without compromising the pedestrian access route. Two feet also provides an offset from the building and minimal space for entering/exiting the building. Wider frontage zones, such as 12-ft can provide width for a variety of possible elements, such as sidewalk café dining with tables and chairs along the building. If a frontage zone is to be provided, work with stakeholders to determine the appropriate width to provide within the site-specific constraints.
1238.03(2) Pedestrian Zone The pedestrian zone is the space available to accommodate pedestrian travel that will:
•
•
•
•
Create interconnectivity between different land uses Provide for the transfer between modes Separate pedestrians from vehicular traffic Support walking as a transportation mode
The pedestrian zone is located within the Pedestrian Circulation Path and includes the Pedestrian Access Route (PAR) needed to meet ADA accessibility criteria (see Chapter 1510). The pedestrian zone may be considerably wider than the PAR. A generous pedestrian zone width promotes the mobility and accessibility typically anticipated within some urban and suburban contexts. Consider wider pedestrian zones when the following are present:
•
•
•
•
Transit facilities and passenger shelters Access routes to businesses School walking routes Other high pedestrian activity generators
Width considerations: The minimum pedestrian zone width of 5 feet corresponds to WSDOT’s minimum sidewalk width (see Chapter 1510). Other considerations when choosing a pedestrian zone width include:
•
•
•
•
•
In many downtown environments, the focus is on multimodal transportation and, in particular, pedestrian accessibility and use. Wider streetside zones promote a greater sense of safety, and can provide a comfortable and inviting area that can attract pedestrians. In urban/downtown environments where store fronts/businesses are located, a larger width is recommended. Consider providing wider sidewalks to increase pedestrian comfort levels and to promote walking. In places with higher pedestrian volumes, a 10 foot width allows for pedestrians walking side-by-side or in groups to pass others comfortably without changing directions or walking speed. A 10 foot width provides sufficient width for a wheelchair user to turn around and to pass another wheelchair user (5 foot width is typically adequate to perform these maneuvers). The minimum sidewalk width of 5 feet is appropriate in low pedestrian volume areas, such as where there are few stores abutting the street or in residential neighborhoods.
Work with stakeholders to determine the appropriate width to provide within site-specific constraints.

Chapter 1238
Geometric Cross Section – Streetside and Parking
1238.03(3) Furnishing Zone The furnishing zone is the key buffer component between the active pedestrian walking area (pedestrian zone) and the roadway. The furnishing zone provides area for multiple functions. The furnishing zone is not located within the Pedestrian Access Route (PAR). However, a PAR connection is required to many features that may be found in this zone (such as street furniture, parking meters, transit shelters, and transit boarding areas.) The Furnishing zone:
•
•
•
•
Promotes environmental and aesthetic features that improve people’s experience Contains street trees, street furniture, benches, planter boxes, and artwork Provides for the travel of the various modes through modal segregation or clearance to obstructions Discourages crossings at less desirable locations along the facility with use of buffers.
Traffic signs and signal cabinets; utility poles; fire hydrants; parking meters; transit boarding, queuing, and shelters; and bike racks are also generally found within the furnishing zone. Involve the local agency, regional Landscape Architect, and safety professionals to determine optimal vegetation types. Other width accommodations for on-street parking may be needed for vehicle overhang or entering/exiting movements when parking is present. Coordinate with region Program Management to understand potential funding limitations for furnishing zone features described within this section. Partnerships or grants may be necessary to complete all desired features within the furnishing zone. Width considerations: A width of 2 feet provides the minimum width to accommodate utilities and street furniture. Greater widths accommodate a larger variety of possible features within the furnishing zone. Other considerations when choosing a furnishing zone width include:
•
•
•
•
An 8-foot width or greater generally provides sufficient space to accommodate a bus transit stop (loading/unloading) and a transit shelter (see Chapter 1730 and work with the transit provider to determine needed space.) In commercial areas, a minimum furnishing zone width of 4 feet is recommended. In areas where snow accumulation can occur, the furnishing zone can provide snow storage space that does not decrease the width of the pedestrian zone. When higher vehicle speeds are present, providing a larger width to act as a buffer between vehicles and pedestrians is desirable.
If a furnishing zone is to be provided, work with stakeholders to determine the appropriate width to provide in order to accommodate the expected features within the site-specific constraints.
1238.04 Retrofit Options Retrofit options refer to the application of lower-cost treatments that utilize paint and other delineation devices rather than hardscape features. Retrofit applications are particularly useful when:
•
•
•
Construction will occur in phases over a timeline greater than one year between phases where overlapping areas of work occur, or when elements or features are funded by a partnering agency. Implementing speed management treatments (see Chapter 1103) that, after evaluating their effectiveness, may need to be reconfigured. Funding is unable to adequately accomplish the identified scope of work.

Chapter 1238
Geometric Cross Section – Streetside and Parking
Applied retrofit options may require additional maintenance over long-duration applications. Coordination with maintenance jurisdictions as described in Chapter 301 is critical to evaluating the potential maintenance outcomes for retrofit options being considered. The retrofit options discussed within the following subsections are more likely to be applied in urban context settings. Note that cities over 25,000 population will have the responsibility of maintaining any retrofit delineation, and it will be critical to ensure they have the resources to maintain striped retrofit features. The following subsections describe several common applications of retrofit options.
1238.04(1) Relocate Curbs Changes to the geometric cross section may involve relocating the existing curb. While installing a new curb may be preferred, there are a number of additional considerations (like stormwater conveyance) that make relocating curb lines cost-prohibitive. However, there are multiple retrofit solutions that can provide effective accommodation including, but not limited to:
•
•
•
Striping combined with MUTCD-approved channelization devices. Curb extensions offset from the original curb. Depending on the use of the new curbed section, retrofit designs may include slotted grates tying the existing curb and new curb together while maintaining the original stormwater conveyance system.

1238.04(2) Parklets and Plazas Parklets and plazas reuse existing right of way in urban and rural town centers, providing public space to support the economic vitality and social livability performance of a particular context. As geometric cross sections are reconfigured, spaces may become available at intersections or for repurposing a parking area into either plazas or parklets. The primary intent of presenting these treatments is for low-speed roadways or main streets with volumes at or below 20,000 ADT. However, there are many potential constraints external to the engineering design that may need resolution before application. Consult with Real Estate Services to discuss the specific property management-related concerns and any potential lease and/or economic payment considerations proportionally appropriate for utilization of the highway space in this manner, as further detailed in RCW 47.24.020(15).
A parklet specifically uses the area usually used for parking to create a space for pedestrians. A common application provides seating accommodations to support local restaurants and shops. Parklet designs will vary depending on local jurisdiction regulations, but they typically include railing and/or planter boxes to provide a separation of uses between people and traffic.

Geometric Cross Section – Streetside and Parking
Parklet design should not cover catch basins or other features that may require frequent maintenance. Parklets interact with motorized vehicle traffic best when placed on tangent alignments. Plazas can reuse right of way to define a relatively large common public space. Plazas are typically associated with a central gathering location for special events, and will likely have limited application on Washington state highways.

1239.01 Introduction This chapter provides information on geometric cross section components that are common to many facility types. Cross section elements include: shoulders, medians and outer separations, side slopes, and curbing.
1239.02 Shoulders Shoulders are typically used on high, or intermediate speed limited and non-limited access facilities, some rural contexts, as well as intermediate-speed locations that do not have streetsides (curb-sections) (see Chapter 1238). Intermediate-speed locations in suburban and urban contexts that utilize streetsides do not need to include a shoulder unless determined to be necessary by shoulder function, (where intended for bicyclists for example) or safety performance analysis, hydraulic analysis or engineering judgment. Shoulders provide space to escape potential collisions or reduce their severity. They also provide a sense of openness, contributing to driver ease at higher speeds. Shoulders also convey drainage away from the traveled way as determined by hydraulic analysis.

[3] Intermediate-speed and low-speed locations in urban and suburban contexts utilizing streetsides do not need to include a shoulder unless necessary for safety performance, hydraulic performance or engineering judgment. See Exhibit 1231-5, Exhibit 1231-6 (A & B), Exhibit 1231-7 (B & C), and Section 1239.02.
1239.02(1)(a) Shoulder Width Considerations Exhibit 1239-2 lists considerations for choosing an appropriate shoulder width from the range given. The considerations listed help one to understand the modal needs and function associated with different shoulder widths. Contact the Area Maintenance Superintendent to determine/verify the shoulder width appropriate for maintenance operations. In some cases, a continuous width is not necessary; instead, the focus is placing the shoulder width near assets with high-frequency maintenance needs. Compare the added cost of the wider shoulders to the added benefits to maintenance operations as well as other benefits that may be derived (see Chapter 301). The usable shoulder is the width necessary to provide the desired function (see Exhibit 1239-2). Usable shoulder width is less than the constructed shoulder width when vertical features (such as traffic barrier or walls) are at the edge of the shoulder. This is because roadway users tend to shy away from the vertical feature. For widening for traffic barrier, see Chapter 1600. For requirements for lateral clearance to barrier or curb, see Section 1239.06. When walls are placed adjacent to shoulders, see Chapter 730 and Chapter 740 for barrier guidance. Shoulder widths greater than 10 feet may encourage use as a travel lane. Therefore, use shoulders wider than 10 feet only to meet one of the listed functions (see Exhibit 1239-2).

(See the Standard Plans for additional details and dimensions.) [6] Consider using the same application of slope rounding on all ramps and crossroads, as well as the main roadway. Use end rounding on the crossroad just beyond the ramp terminals and at a similar location where only a grade separation is involved. [7] When widening beyond the edge of usable shoulder for curb or barrier, additional widening for slope rounding may be omitted. [8] For widening guidelines for guardrail and concrete barrier, see Chapter 1610 and Exhibit 1610-10. [9] Permanent precast unanchored barrier shown above. See Exhibit 1610-3 for other barrier deflection distances. [10]There is no minimum width between pavement and break point for side slopes 4H:1V or flatter and 1 foot minimum width between pavement and break point for side slopes steeper than 4H:1V. General: On divided multilane highways, see Exhibit 1239-15 through Exhibit 1239-17 for additional details for median shoulders.
1239.03 Fill Sections, Cut Sections, and Ditch Sections The design for side slopes can affect shoulder design, clear zone requirements, and whether or not traffic barrier is warranted. There are three basic roadway sections for side slopes. Fill sections – Roadway sections where the height of the roadway is higher than the existing natural ground. Ditch sections - Roadway sections where the height of the roadway is higher than the existing natural ground but not as high as the needed roadside ditch so that after the needed ditch is installed there is a foreslope into the ditch and a back slope out of the ditch up to where it catches the natural ground. Cut sections - Roadway sections where the height of the roadway is lower than the existing ground. This typically produces a foreslope into the ditch and a back slope out of the ditch up to where it catches the natural ground. When designing side slopes, attempt to fit the slope selected for any fill section, ditch section, or cut section into the existing terrain to give a smooth transitional blend from the construction to the existing landscape when practicable. Flatter slopes are desirable, especially with higher posted speeds and when the associated cost does not significantly exceed other design options. Fill side slopes not steeper than 4H:1V, with smooth transitions where the slope changes, will provide a reasonable opportunity to recover control of an errant vehicle. Fill side slopes designed to 4H:1V or flatter are preferred. Provide widening and slope rounding outside the usable shoulder when the foreslope is steeper than 4H:1V (see Exhibit 1239-3). Do not disturb existing stable cut slopes just to meet the 4H:1V foreslope preference.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1239-6
Chapter 1239
Geometric Cross Section – Shoulders, Side Slopes, Cross Sections, and Medians
Fill-slopes that are steeper than 4H:1V but not steeper than 3H:1V are considered traversable but not recoverable. When providing a slope that meets these characteristics, placement of a clear area extending from the toe of the slope to the outside edge of the design clear zone is needed for an errant vehicle runout and stop (see Chapter 1600 for design clear zone guidance). Consult with Region Maintenance to determine if mowing is contemplated. When providing fill-slopes steeper than 3H:1V, it is a best practice to document the reason for the decision in the design documentation package. When mowing is contemplated, provide slopes not steeper than 3H:1V. Where unusual geological features or soil conditions exist, treatment of the slopes depends upon results of a review of the location by the Region Materials Engineer. See Section 1600.03(1) for when to use traffic barrier to mitigate a side slope. Unmitigated critical slopes will require a Design Analysis. The steepest slope allowed is determined by the Region Materials Engineer based on soil conditions. If more material is needed to build the roadway, consider obtaining it by flattening cut slopes uniformly on one or both sides of the highway. Consult the Region Materials Engineer to determine what percentage of the excavated material will likely be suitable for fill material. Where considering wasting excess material on an existing fill side slope, consult the Region Materials Engineer to verify that the subgrade will support the additional material. Provide for drainage from the roadway surface and drainage in ditches (see Chapter 800). For drainage ditches, see Section 1239.03(1). At locations where vegetated filter areas or detention facilities will be established to improve highway runoff water quality, provide appropriate slope, space, and soil conditions for that purpose. (See the Highway Runoff Manual for design criteria and additional guidance.) It is desirable to plant and establish low-growing vegetation on non-paved roadsides. This type of treatment relies on the placement of a lift of compost or topsoil over base course material in the roadway cross section. Consult with the area Maintenance Superintendent and the region or HQ Landscape Architect to determine the appropriate configuration of the roadway cross section and soil and plant specifications. This kind of treatment would not be done where barrier is installed along the roadway as the lift of compost or topsoil is not a suitable barrier foundation. Flatten freeway section median cross-over foreslopes to 10H:1V (See Section 1370.03). Flatten crossroad and road approach foreslopes not steeper than 6H:1V on other highways. Grade crossroad and road approach foreslopes flatter than 6H:1V where feasible. Provide smooth transitions between the main line foreslopes and the crossroad or road approach foreslopes. Move the crossroad or road approach drainage as far away from the main line as feasible. This can locate the pipe outside the Design Clear Zone and reduce the length of pipe. Provide slope treatment as shown in the Standard Plans (Slope treatment) at the top of roadway cut slopes except for cuts in solid rock. Unless Class B slope treatment is called for, Class A slope treatment is used. Call for Class B slope treatment where space is limited, such as where right of way is restricted.
1239.03(1) Drainage Ditches Exhibit 1239-5 shows the preferred trapezoidal ditch section and the alternative V bottom ditch section. The trapezoidal ditch design is preferred as V bottom ditches tend to silt up faster than flat bottom trapezoidal ditches and Trapezoidal ditches convey more drainage than V ditches. On the other hand, Trapezoidal ditches can be more difficult to construct than V bottom ditches. The trapezoidal ditch is preferred, but a ‘V’ bottom ditch can be used where constraints, such as limited right of way or sensitive areas, preclude a trapezoidal ditch. Consult with the Region Hydraulic Engineer to determine if the chosen design meets the needed hydraulic performance. Consult with the Region Materials Engineer about the chosen ditch foreslope and backslope.

When topographic restrictions exist, consider an enclosed drainage system with appropriate inlets and outlets. Maintenance operations are also facilitated by adequate width between the toe of the slope and an adjacent drainage ditch. Where this type of facility is anticipated, provide sufficient right of way for access to the facility and place the drainage ditch as close to the right of way line as feasible.

Foreslopes 4H:1V or flatter are desirable. See Exhibit 1239-4 for requirements for slopes steeper than 4H:1V Foreslopes and backslopes 3H:1V or flatter support mowing operations. Do not design foreslopes and/or backslopes steeper than 2H:1V without Region Materials Engineer and Region Hydraulics Engineer concurrence. See Exhibit 1600-6 for foreslopes steeper than 3H:1V. See Hydraulics Manual, Section 4-3 and Figure 4-7 for ditch depth detail.
1239.03(2) Bridge End Slopes Bridge end slopes are determined by several factors, including context, fill height, depth of cut, soil stability, and horizontal and vertical alignment. Coordinate bridge end slope treatment with the HQ Bridge and Structures Office (see Chapter 720). Whenever possible, design to avoid creating environments that might be desirable to the homeless, both for their safety and the safety of maintenance staff. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

1239.04 Roadway Sections in Rock Cuts There are two basic design treatments applicable to rock excavation. Typical sections for rock cuts, illustrated in Exhibit 1239-8 and Exhibit 1239-9, are guides for the design and construction of roadways through rock cuts. Design A applies to most rock cuts. Design B is a talus slope treatment. Changes in slope or fallout area are recommended when justified. Base the selection of the appropriate sections on an engineering study and the recommendations of the region Materials Engineer and region Landscape Architect. Obtain concurrence from the Headquarters Geotechnical Office.
1239.04(1) Design A This design is shown in cases to aid the Geotech Designer in selecting an appropriate section for the site conditions in regard to the backslope, probable rockfall, hardness of rock, and so on. The following guidelines apply to the various cases shown in Exhibit 1239-8:
•
•
•
Case 1 is used where the anticipated quantity of rockfall is small, adequate fallout width can be provided, and the rock slope is ½H:1V or steeper. Controlled blasting is recommended in conjunction with Stage 1 construction. Case 2 is used when a “rocks in the road” problem exists or is anticipated. Consider it on flat slopes where rocks are apt to roll rather than fall. Cases 3, 4, and 5 represent the full implementation of all protection and safety measures applicable to rock control. Use these when extreme rockfall conditions exist. o Case 3 – Protection and safety measures applicable to rock control using guardrail. o Case 4 – Protection and safety measures applicable to rock control using concrete barrier with no rock protection fence. o Case 5 – Protection and safety measures applicable to rock control using concrete barrier and rock protection fence.
The use of Cases 2, 4, or 5 (concrete barrier) is based on the designer’s analysis of the particular site. Considerations include maintenance; size and amount of rockfall; probable velocities; availability of materials; ditch capacity; adjacent traffic volumes; distance from traveled lane; and impact severity. Incorporate removable sections in the barrier at approximately 200-foot intervals. Provide appropriate terminal treatment (see Section 1610.06(3)). Occasionally, the existing ground above the top of the cut is on a slope approximating the design cut slope. The height (H) is to include the existing slope or that portion that can logically be considered part of the cut. Select cut slopes for a project that provide stability for the existing material. Benches may be used to increase slope stability; however, the use of benches may alter the design given in Exhibit 1239-8. The necessity for benches, as well as their width and vertical spacing, is established after an evaluation of slope stability. Make benches at least 20 feet wide. Provide access for maintenance equipment to the lowest bench and to the higher benches if feasible. Greater traffic benefits in the form of added safety, increased horizontal sight distance on curves, and other desirable attributes may be realized from widening a cut rather than benching.

[3] Consult with the Region Materials Engineer to make this slope as steep as the material will allow. General: Treat cut heights less than 20 feet as a normal roadway unless otherwise determined by the Region Materials Engineer.

1239.04(2) Design B A talus slope treatment is shown in Exhibit 1239-9. The rock protection fence is placed at any one of the three positions shown, but not in more than one position at a particular location. Consult with the RME for the placement of the rock protection fence in talus slope areas.
•
•
•
•
Fence position a is used when the cliff generates boulders less than 0.25 yd3 in size and the length of the slope is greater than 350 feet. Fence position b is the preferred location for most applications. Fence position c is used when the cliff generates boulders greater than 0.25 yd3 in size regardless of the length of the slope. On short slopes, this may require placing the fence less than 100 feet from the base of the cliff. Use of gabions may be considered instead of the rock protection shown in fence position a. Because gabion treatment is considered similar to a wall, provide appropriate face and end protection (see Chapter 730 and Chapter 1610).
Use of the alternate shoulder barrier is based on the designer’s analysis of the particular site. Considerations similar to those given for Design A alternatives apply. Evaluate the need for rock protection treatments other than those described above for cut slopes that have relatively uniform spalling surfaces (consult with the RME).

•
•
Ordinarily, place fence within a zone of 100 feet to 200 feet maximum from base of cliff, measured along the slope. Rock protection fence may be used in conjunction with the Shoulder Barrier Alternate when site conditions dictate.
1239.04(3) Stepped Slopes Stepped slopes are a construction method intended to promote early establishment of vegetative cover on the slopes. They consist of a series of small horizontal steps or terraces on the face of the cut slope. Soil conditions dictate the feasibility and necessity of stepped slopes. They are to be considered on the recommendation of the RME (see Chapter 610). Consult the region landscape personnel for appropriate design and vegetative materials to be used.

1239.05 Curbs Vertical curbs with a face slope of 1H:3V or steeper that are more than 4 inches tall are not considered mountable, while vertical curbs that are 4 inches tall or shorter are considered mountable. Curbs with a sloping face (flatter than 1H:3V) that are as tall as 6 inches are mountable but using curbs 4 inches or less is recommended in order to reduce vehicle underside damage if driven over. 1239.05(1) Non-Mountable Vertical Curb Uses a) Use vertical curbs with a height of 6 inches: To delineate the traveled way with respect to other features in the roadway cross-section such as medians, sidewalks, landscaped areas, etc. To delineate separations between walkways and pedestrian refuges. To provide vertical grade separation between raised islands and the roadway surface. For expediting transfer times for transit partners on low-speed roadways in urban and suburban contexts (curb height may exceed 6 inches if needed by transit provider).

Geometric Cross Section – Shoulders, Side Slopes, Cross Sections, and Medians
b) Consider vertical curbs with a height of 6 inches: To indicate to drivers where midblock left turns are not allowed. To delineate divisional and channelizing islands. To provide a hardscape boundary for raised landscaped islands. To convey stormwater. 1239.05(2) Mountable Curb Uses a) Provide mountable curbs where a curb is needed but vertical curb is not suitable for specific design user(s). b) Use mountable curbs in roundabouts. See Chapter 1320 and Standard Plan F-10.18-01. 1239.05(3) Curb Use Based on Speed Avoid using curbs if the same objective can be attained with pavement markings. Where the highway speed is 40 mph or faster, 4-inch-high mountable curbs may be used to control drainage or for access control and 6-inchhigh mountable curbs may be considered where streetside zones are provided or where traffic movements are to be restricted. Locate mountable curb no closer to the traveled way than the outer edge of the shoulder (4’ minimum). With justification, mountable curb may be placed at the edge of traveled way for access management in urban areas. With justification, vertical curb can be used on a 40 mph or faster highway if the vertical clearance is 4 or more feet wide. All curb types are appropriate for low-speed facilities. See Exhibit 1239-11 for lateral clearance to curb for low speed and ramps. With all curb types, provide sloping end treatments where the curb is introduced and terminated. Adding curb reduces lane and/or shoulder width and may require additional documentation. 1239.05(4) Curb Used for Drainage Where curbing is provided to direct drainage, provide a design that collects the surface water at the curb and drains it without ponding in the traveled way or flowing across the roadway. In some areas, curb may be needed to control runoff water until ground cover is attained to control erosion. Document the plan to remove the curb when the ground cover becomes adequate. A best practice is to arrange for curb removal with region maintenance staff as part of the future maintenance plans (see Maintenance Owner’s Manual guidance in Chapter 301). When curb is used in conjunction with guardrail, see Chapter 1610 for guidance. For existing curb, particularly on facilities with a speed of 40 mph and faster, evaluate the continued need for the curb. Remove curbing that is no longer needed. 1239.05(5) Curb Use Considerations Curbs can provide physical guidance to drivers, but curbs are not intended to redirect errant vehicles. When an overlay will reduce the height of a curb, evaluate grinding (or replacing the curb) to maintain curb height if needed for pavement or drainage performance. (See Section 1250.02(2) for shoulder cross slope considerations.) To maintain or restore curb height, consider lowering the existing pavement level and improving cross slope by grinding before an asphalt overlay or as determined by the pavement design. The cross slope of the shoulder may be steepened to maximize curb height and minimize other related impacts. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Geometric Cross Section – Shoulders, Side Slopes, Cross Sections, and Medians
Note that grinding can cause issues with meeting ADA criteria at curb ramps for counter slope and crosswalk running slope. See Chapter 1510 for more information. Curbs can hamper snow-removal operations. In areas of heavy snowfall, ask the Area Maintenance Superintendent to review and concur with the use of curbing. For curbs at traffic islands, see Chapter 1310. For curbs at roundabouts, see Chapter 1320 and Standard Plan F10.18-01.
1239.06 Lateral Clearance to Curb and Barrier Lateral clearance to curb or barrier is the perpendicular distance from edge of traveled way to the face of a curb or a traffic barrier (guardrail, concrete barrier, etc.). Lateral clearance includes the shoulder width. The minimum lateral clearance to the face of a curb or barrier is shown in Exhibit 1239-11. See also Chapter 1310 for intersections including clearance to curb at traffic islands. Exhibit 1239-11 Minimum Lateral Clearance to Barrier and Curb [6] Posted Speed

[6] See Exhibit 1430-2 for part-time shoulders and Exhibit 1440-2 for metered shoulders.
1239.07 Chain-Up and/or Chain-Off Areas Provide chain-up areas in order to allow chains to be put on vehicles out of the through lanes at locations where traffic enters chain enforcement areas. Provide chain-off areas to remove chains out of the through lanes for traffic leaving chain enforcement areas. Chain-up or chain-off areas are widened shoulders designed as shown in Exhibit 1239-12. Locate chain-up and chain-off areas where the grade is 6% or less and desirably on a tangent section. Consider illumination for chain-up and chain-off areas on multilane highways. When deciding whether or not to install illumination, consider traffic volumes during the hours of darkness and the availability of power. See Section 1040.02(7). The wide shoulders at chain-up and chain-off areas may encourage parking. When parking is undesirable, consider parking restrictions.

1239.08 Medians and Outer Separations Medians are either restrictive or nonrestrictive. Restrictive medians physically limit motor vehicle encroachment, using raised curb, median barrier, fixed delineators, vegetative strips, or vegetative depressions. Nonrestrictive medians limit motor vehicle encroachment legally, and use pavement markings to define locations where turns are permissible. The main functions of an outer separation are to separate the main roadway from a frontage road or service lane, or to provide modal segregation. Consider medians or outer separations to optimize the desired performance objective, such as safety, throughput operations, pedestrian mobility needs, etc. Provide a median or outer separation to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Separate traffic lanes such as ETL, HOV lanes, bike lanes, etc. Separate divided highways with differing alignments. Separate opposing traffic to reduce the risk of head-on collisions. Manage speed. Provide a refuge area for emergency parking. Allow for future widening of a planned phase. Separate collector-distributor lanes, frontage roads, weigh sites, or rest areas. Accommodate drainage facilities. Accommodate bridge piers at undercrossings. Provide vehicle storage space for crossing and left-turn movements at intersections. Accommodate headlight glare screens, including planted or natural foliage. Provide recovery areas for errant or disabled vehicles. Provide a pedestrian refuge area at crossing locations. Provide storage space for snow and water away from traffic lanes. Separate modes for increased safety, comfort, and ease of operations. Control access. Provide enforcement areas.
The width of a median is measured from edge of traveled way to edge of traveled way and includes shoulders. Median widths can vary greatly based on the functional use of the median, the functional use of the shoulders, target speed, and context. Guidance for median and shoulder widths depending on their function and context is given in:
•

1239.08(1) Median Design: High and Intermediate Speed Exhibit 1239-13 lists width considerations for median functions common on high and intermediate speed facilities. When the horizontal and vertical alignments of the two roadways of a divided highway are independent of one another, determine median side slopes in conformance with Section 1239.03 and Chapter 1600 and Chapter 1610. Independent horizontal and vertical alignment, rather than parallel alignment, can allow for reduced grading or cut sections.

Geometric Cross Section – Shoulders, Side Slopes, Cross Sections, and Medians
Considerable latitude in grading treatment is intended on wide, variable-width medians, provided the minimum performance needs are met or exceeded. Unnecessary clearing, grubbing, and grading are undesirable within wide medians. Use selective thinning and limited reshaping of the natural ground when feasible. For median clear zone criteria see Chapter 1600, and for slopes between the face of traffic barriers and the traveled way see Chapter 1610. In areas where land is expensive, make an economic comparison of wide medians to narrow medians with barrier. Consider right of way, construction, maintenance, and safety performance. The widths of medians need not be uniform. Make the transition between median widths as long as practical. (See Chapter 1210 for minimum taper lengths.) When using concrete barriers in depressed medians or on the insides of curves, provide for surface drainage on both sides of the barrier or provide MASH compliant scupper barrier. At locations where the median will be used to allow vehicles to make a U-turn, provide the widths in Exhibit 1310-30. (For information on U-turns, see Section 1310.02(19)) Document the selected design vehicle and provide alternate route information for vehicles not serviced by the U-turn. Where feasible, widen medians at intersections on rural divided multilane highways. Provide sufficient width to store vehicles crossing the expressway or entering the expressway with a left turn. When the median is to be landscaped, or where fixed objects are to be placed in the median, see Chapter 1600 for traffic barrier and clear zone guidance. When the median will transition for use as a left-turn lane, see Chapter 1310 for left-turn lane design considerations.

1240.01 General The roadway on a curve may need to be widened to make the operating conditions comparable to those on tangents. There are two main reasons to do this. One is the off-tracking of vehicles such as trucks and buses. The other is the increased difficulty drivers have in keeping their vehicles in the center of the lane. Apply turning roadway widths only when there is a need to optimize the operational or safety performance of a particular segment of roadway with larger volumes of trucks or when trucks are the identified modal priority. The application of turning roadway width is not applicable on managed access low-speed roadways or managed access intermediate-speed highways in suburban or urban contexts. For additional information, see the following: Chapter 1230 Cross section design element widths Chapter 1250 Superelevation Chapter 1360 Lane and shoulder widths for ramps
1240.02 Turning Roadway Widths 1240.02(1) Two-Lane Two-Way Roadways Exhibit 1240-1 shows the traveled way width (W) for two-lane two-way roadways. For values of radius (R) between those given, interpolate W and round up to the next foot. Minimum traveled way width (W), based on the delta angle of the curve (shown in Exhibit 1240-2), may be used. Document the reasons for using the minimum width. Round W to the nearest foot. Widths given in Exhibit 1240-1 and Exhibit 1240-2 are for facilities with 12-foot lanes. When 11-foot lanes are selected, width (W) may be reduced by 2 feet.
1240.02(2) Two-Lane One-Way Roadways Exhibit 1240-3 shows the traveled way width (W) for two-lane one-way turning roadways, including two-lane ramps and four-lane highways. For values of radius (R) between those given, interpolate W and round up to the next foot. Treat each direction of travel on four-lane facilities as a one-way roadway. Minimum traveled way width (W), based on the delta angle of the curve (shown in Exhibit 1240-4), may be used. Document the reasons for using the minimum width. Round W to the nearest foot. Widths given in Exhibit 1240-3 and Exhibit 1240-4 are for facilities with 12-foot lanes. When 11-foot lanes are selected, width (W) may be reduced by 2 feet.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1240-1
Chapter 1240
Turning Roadways
To keep widths to a minimum, the traveled way widths for Exhibit 1240-3 and Exhibit 1240-4 were calculated using the WB-40 design vehicle. When volumes are high for trucks larger than the WB-40 and other traffic, consider using the widths from Exhibit 1240-1 and Exhibit 1240-2.
1240.02(3) One-Lane Roadways Exhibit 1240-5 shows the traveled way width (W) for one-lane turning roadways. For values of R between those given, interpolate W and round up to the next foot. Exhibit 1240-5 applies to one-lane ramps only when the largest vehicles present demonstrate a safety or operational need based on frequency of use and shoulder pavement depths, and when turn simulation software shows that the total roadway width cannot accommodate the turning movement within the structural pavement section. Minimum width (W), based on the delta angle of the curve for one-lane roadways, may be used. Exhibit 1240-6 gives W using the radius to the outer edge of the traveled way. Exhibit 1240-7 gives W using the radius on the inner edge of the traveled way. Document the reasons for using the minimum width. Round W to the nearest foot. Build shoulder pavements at full depth for one-lane roadways. To keep widths to a minimum, traveled way widths were calculated using the WB-40 design vehicle, which may force larger vehicles to encroach on the shoulders. This also helps to maintain the integrity of the roadway structure during partial roadway closures.
1240.02(4) Other Roadways For roadways where the traveled way is more than two lanes in any direction:
•
•
For each lane in addition to two, additional width in excess of the selected lane width dimension (see Chapter 1230 and Chapter 1106) is not needed. For three-lane ramps with HOV lanes, see Chapter 1410.
1240.02(5) Total Roadway Width Shoulder widths for the highway or ramp are added to the traveled way width to determine the total roadway width. Small amounts of widening add to the cost with little added benefit. When the traveled way width for turning roadways results in widening less than 0.5 foot per lane, or a total widening of less than 2 feet on existing roadways that are to remain in place, it may be disregarded. When widening the traveled way:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Widening may be constructed on the inside of the traveled way or divided equally between the inside and outside. Do not construct widening only on the outside of a curve. Place final marked lane lines, and any longitudinal joints, at equal spacing between the edges of the widened traveled way. Provide widening throughout the curve length. For widening on the inside, make transitions on a tangent where possible. For widening on the outside, develop the widening by extending the tangent. This avoids the appearance of a reverse curve that a taper would create. For widening of 6 feet or less, use a 1:25 taper. For widths greater than 6 feet, use a 1:15 taper.

1250.01 General Use this chapter to design roadway cross slopes and superelevation. Cross slopes function to drain water away from the roadway and 2% is a commonly used slope rate. To maintain the design speed, highway and ramp curves are usually superelevated to overcome part of the centrifugal force that acts on a vehicle.
1250.02 Roadway Cross Slope 1250.02(1) Lanes The cross slope on tangents and curves is a main element in roadway design. The cross slope or crown on tangent sections and large radius curves is complicated by the following two contradicting controls:
•
•
Reasonably steep cross slopes aid in water runoff and minimize ponding as a result of pavement imperfections and unequal settlement. Steeper cross slopes are noticeable in steering, increase the tendency for vehicles to drift to the low side of the roadway, and increase the susceptibility of vehicles to slide to the side on icy or wet pavements.
A 2% cross slope is normally used for tangents and large-radius curves on high and intermediate pavement types, although cross slopes may vary from the target 2%. The algebraic difference in cross slopes is an operational factor that can affect vehicles making a lane change across a grade-break during a passing maneuver on a two-lane two-way roadway. Its influence increases when increased traffic volumes decrease the number and size of available passing opportunities. On ramps with metering, consider how cross slopes can impact driver comfort within the queue. Additionally, larger cross slopes may present concerns about maintaining vehicle lateral position within the queue lane, depending on weather and resulting pavement conditions. A somewhat steeper cross slope may be needed to facilitate recommended drainage design, even though this might be less desirable from an operational point of view. In such areas, consider not exceeding design cross slopes of 2.5% with an algebraic difference of 5%. For a two-lane two-way roadway, provide an algebraic difference to meet the appropriate conditions stated above except when drainage design recommends otherwise.

Cross Slope and Superelevation
1250.02(2) Shoulders Shoulder cross slopes are normally the same as the cross slopes for adjacent lanes. With justification, shoulder slopes may be increased to 6%. On the high side of a roadway with a plane section, such as a turning roadway in superelevation, the shoulder may slope in the opposite direction from the adjacent lane. The maximum difference in slopes between the lane and the shoulder is 8%. Locations where it may be desirable to have a shoulder slope different than the adjacent lane are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Where curbing is used. Where shoulder surface is bituminous, gravel, or crushed rock. Where overlays are planned and it is desirable to maintain the grade at the edge of the shoulder. On divided highways with depressed medians where it is desirable to drain the runoff into the median. On the high side of the superelevation on curves where it is desirable to drain stormwater or meltwater away from the roadway. At intersections where pedestrian signal accommodations are provided within the shoulder
Where extruded curb is used, see the Standard Plans for placement (see Chapter 1239 for information on curbs). Widening is also normally provided where traffic barrier is installed (see Chapter 1610 and the Standard Plans). On ramps with metering, where the shoulder is or could be utilized for queuing, consider how the shoulder cross slope can impact driver comfort within the queue. Additionally, larger shoulder cross slopes may present concerns of maintaining vehicle lateral position within the queue lane, depending on weather and resulting pavement conditions. The remainder of this chapter provides information to design superelevation.
1250.03 Superelevation Rate Selection The maximum superelevation rate allowed is 10%. Depending on design speed, construct large-radius curves with a normal crown section. The minimum radii for normal crown sections are shown in Exhibit 1250-1. Superelevate curves with smaller radii as follows:
•
•
•
•
Exhibit 1250-4 (emax=10%) is desirable for all open highways, ramps, and long-term detours, especially when associated with a main line detour. Exhibit 1250-5 (emax =8%) may be used for freeways in urban design areas and areas where the emax =6% rate is allowed but emax =8% is preferred. Exhibit 1250-6 (emax =6%) may be used—with justification—for non-freeway highways in urban design areas, in mountainous areas, and for short-term detours, which are generally implemented and removed in one construction season. Exhibit 1250-7 may be used on low-speed streets in urban areas where speed is relatively low and variable or at intersections.
When selecting superelevation for a curve, consider the existing curves on the corridor. To maintain route continuity and driver expectance on open highways, select the chart (see Exhibit 1250-4, Exhibit 1250-5, or Exhibit 1250-6) that best matches the superelevation on the existing curves. In locations that experience regular accumulations of snow and ice, limit superelevation from the selected chart to 6% or less. In these areas, provide justification for superelevation rates greater than 6%. Vehicles moving at slow speeds or stopped on curves with supers greater than 6% tend to slide inward on the radius (downslope). Round the selected superelevation rate to the nearest full percent.

1250.04 Existing Curves Evaluate the superelevation on an existing curve to determine its adequacy. Use the equation in Exhibit 1250-2 to determine the minimum radius for a given superelevation and design speed.

Address superelevation when the existing radius is less than the minimum radius calculated using the equation or when the maximum speed determined by a ball banking analysis is less than the design speed. When modifying the superelevation of an existing curve, provide superelevation as given in Section 1250.02.

1250.05 Turning Movements at Intersections Curves associated with the turning movements at intersections are superelevated using Exhibit 1250-7. Use superelevation rates as high as practicable, consistent with curve length and climatic conditions. Exhibit 1250-7 shows the minimum radius for a selected superelevation and given design speed for intersections and low-speed curves. When using high superelevation rates on short curves, provide smooth transitions with merging ramps or roadways.
1250.06 Runoff for Highway Curves Provide transitions for all superelevated highway curves as specified in Exhibit 1250-8 through Exhibit 1250-12. Which transition to use depends on the location of the pivot point, the direction of the curve, and the roadway cross slope. The length of the runoff is based on a maximum allowable difference between the grade at the pivot point and the grade at the outer edge of traveled way for one 12-foot lane. Pay close attention to the profile of the edge of traveled way created by the superelevation runoff; do not let it appear distorted. The combination of superelevation transition and grade may result in a hump and/or dip in the profile of the edge of traveled way. When this happens, the transition may be lengthened to eliminate the hump and/or dip. If the hump and/or dip cannot be eliminated this way, pay special attention to drainage in the low areas to prevent ponding. Locate the pivot point at the centerline of the roadway to help minimize humps and dips at the edge of the traveled lane and reduce the superelevation runoff length. When reverse curves are necessary, provide sufficient tangent length for complete superelevation runoff for both curves—that is, from full superelevation of the first curve, to level to full superelevation of the second curve. If tangent length is longer than this, but not sufficient to provide full super transitions—that is, from full superelevation of the first curve, to normal crown to full superelevation of the second curve—increase the superelevation runoff lengths until they abut.

Cross Slope and Superelevation
This provides one continuous transition, without a normal crown section, similar to Designs C2 and D2 in Exhibit 1250-10 and Exhibit 1250-11, except that full super will be attained rather than the normal pavement slope as shown. Superelevation runoff on structures is permissible but not desirable. Whenever practicable, strive for full super or normal crown slopes on structures.
1250.07 Runoff for Ramp Curves Superelevation runoff for ramps use the same maximum relative slopes as the specific design speeds used for highway curves. Multilane ramps have a width similar to the width for highway lanes; therefore, Exhibit 1250-8 through Exhibit 1250-12 are used to determine the superelevation runoff for ramps. Superelevation transition lengths (LT) for single-lane ramps are given in Exhibit 1250-13 and Exhibit 1250-14. Additional runoff length for turning roadway widening is not required.

1260.01 General Sight distance allows the driver to assess developing situations and take actions appropriate for the conditions. Sight distance relies on drivers being aware of and paying attention to their surroundings and driving appropriately for conditions presented. For the purposes of design, sight distance is considered in terms of stopping sight distance, passing sight distance, and decision sight distance. For additional information, see the following: Chapter 1250 Sight distance at railroad crossings Chapter 1310 Sight distance at intersections at grade Chapter 1320 Sight distance at roundabouts Chapter 1340 Sight distance at driveways Chapter 1515 Sight distance for shared-use paths

1260.03 Stopping Sight Distance (Eye height – 3.5 ft, Object height – 2.0 ft) 1260.03(1) Design Criteria Stopping sight distance is provided when the sight distance available to a driver equals or exceeds the stopping distance for a passenger car traveling at the design speed. Stopping distance for design is very conservatively calculated, with lower deceleration and slower perception reaction time than normally expected from the driver. Provide design stopping sight distance at all points on all highways and on all intersecting roadways, unless a design analysis is deemed appropriate.

Sight Distance
1260.03(1)(a) Stopping Sight Distance Stopping sight distance is the sum of two distances: the distance traveled during perception and reaction time and the distance to stop the vehicle. The perception and reaction distance used in design is the distance traveled in 2.5 seconds at the design speed.
The design stopping sight distance is calculated using the design speed and a constant deceleration rate of 11.2 feet/second2. For stopping sight distances on grades less than 3%, see Exhibit 1260-1; for grades 3% or greater, see Exhibit 1260-2.
1260.03(1)(b) Design Stopping Sight Distance Exhibit 1260-1 gives the design stopping sight distances for grades less than 3%, the minimum curve length for a 1% grade change to provide the stopping sight distance for a crest (Kc) and sag (Ks) vertical curve, and the minimum length of vertical curve for the design speed (VCLm). For stopping sight distances when the grade is 3% or greater, see Exhibit 1260-2. Exhibit 1260-1 Design Stopping Sight Distance Design Speed (mph)

Use Exhibit 1260-4 or the equations in Exhibit 1260-5 to find the minimum crest vertical curve length to provide stopping sight distance when given the algebraic difference in grades. Exhibit 1260-4 does not show the sight distance greater than the length of curve equation. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

When the sight distance is greater than the length of curve and the length of curve is critical, the S>L equation given in Exhibit 1260-5 shall be used to find the minimum curve length. When a new crest vertical curve is built or an existing one is rebuilt with grades less than 3%, provide design stopping sight distance from Exhibit 1260-1. For grades 3% or greater, provide stopping sight distance from Section 1260.03(2). Exhibit 1260-4 Stopping Sight Distance: Crest Vertical Curves
The minimum length can also be determined by multiplying the algebraic difference in grades by the KC value from Exhibit 1260-1 (L=KC*A). Both the exhibit and the equation give approximately the same length of curve. Neither use the S>L equation.

1260.03(4) Sag Vertical Curves When evaluating an existing roadway, refer to Section 1260.03(7). Sight distance is not restricted by sag vertical curves during the hours of daylight. Therefore, headlight sight distance is used for the sight distance design criteria at sag vertical curves. In some cases, a lesser length may be allowed. For guidance, see Chapter 1220. Refer to Exhibit 1260-6 or the equations in Exhibit 1260-7 to find the minimum length for a sag vertical curve to provide the headlight stopping sight distance when given the algebraic difference in grades. The value for S is shown as the distance between the vehicle and the point where a 1-degree angle upward of the headlight beam intersects with the roadway. The sight distance greater than the length of curve equation is not used in Exhibit 1260-6. When the sight distance is greater than the length of curve and the length of curve is critical, the S>L equation given in Exhibit 1260-7 shall be used to find the minimum length of curve. When a new sag vertical curve is built or an existing one is rebuilt with grades less than 3%, provide design stopping sight distance from Exhibit 1260-1. For grades 3% or greater, provide stopping sight distance from Section 1260.03(2).

1260.03(5) Horizontal Curves When evaluating an existing roadway, see Section 1260.03(7). Use Exhibit 1260-8 or the equation in Exhibit 1260-9 to check stopping sight distance where sightline obstructions are on the inside of a curve. A stopping sight distance sightline obstruction is any roadside object within the horizontal sightline offset (M) distance (such as median barrier, guardrail, bridges, walls, cut slopes, buildings or wooded areas), 2.0 feet or greater above the roadway surface at the centerline of the lane on the inside of the curve (h0). Exhibit 1260-8 and the equation in Exhibit 1260-9 are for use when the length of curve is greater than the sight distance and the sight restriction is more than half the sight distance from the end of the curve. Where the length of curve is less than the stopping sight distance or the sight restriction is near either end of the curve, the desired sight distance may be available with a lesser M distance. When this occurs, the sight distance can be checked graphically.

A sightline obstruction is any roadside object within the horizontal sightline offset (M) distance, 2.0 feet or greater above the roadway surface at the centerline of the lane on the inside of the curve.

Roadside objects with a height (h0) between 2.0 feet and 2.75 feet might not be a stopping sight distance sightline obstruction. Objects with an h0 between 2.0 feet and 2.75 feet can be checked graphically to determine whether they are stopping sight distance sightline obstructions. Where a sightline obstruction exists and site characteristics preclude design modifications to meet criteria, consult with the region Traffic Engineer and Assistant State Design Engineer for a determination of appropriate action.

Crest vertical curves make roadside objects more likely to become sightline obstructions. Sag vertical curves make roadside objects less likely to be sightline obstructions. Exhibit 1260-10 can be used to determine the sight distance for crest vertical curves on horizontal curves with:

The available sight distance must be checked graphically for these sightline obstructions.

There is no identified collision trend. The existing vertical and horizontal alignment is retained. The existing roadway pavement is not reconstructed. The roadway will not be widened, except for minor shoulder widening requiring no work past the bottom of the ditch. The sightline obstruction is existing. Roadside improvements to sight distance are within existing right of way.
Crest Vertical Curves – The minimum length of an existing crest vertical curve may be found using the equations in Exhibit 1260-5 or using the KC values from Exhibit 1260-10. Sag Vertical Curves – The minimum length of an existing sag vertical curve may be found using the equations in Exhibit 1260-7 or using the KS values from Exhibit 1260-10.

The potential for passing maneuver conflicts is ultimately determined by the judgments of the driver and the conditions present at the time of the maneuver. Exhibit 1260-12 gives the passing sight distances for various design speeds. Exhibit 1260-11 Passing Sight Distance Design Speed (mph) 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80

Sight Distance
On two-lane two-way highways, provide passing opportunities to meet traffic volume demands. This can be accomplished with roadway sections that provide passing sight distance or by adding passing lanes at locations that would provide the greatest benefit to passing (see Chapter 1270). In the design stage, passing sight distance can be provided by adjusting the alignment either vertically or horizontally to increase passing opportunities. These considerations also apply to multilane highways where staged construction includes a two-lane two-way operation as an initial stage. Whether auxiliary lanes are provided, however, depends on the time lag proposed between the initial stage and the final stage of construction.
1260.04(2) Passing Sight Distance Vertical Curves Exhibit 1260-14 gives the length of crest vertical curve used to provide passing sight distance for two lane highways. The distance from Exhibit 1260-12 and the equations in Exhibit 1260-13 may also be used to determine the minimum length of vertical curve to meet the passing sight distance criteria. Sag vertical curves are not a restriction to passing sight distance. Exhibit 1260-12 Passing Sight Distance: Crest Vertical Curve Calculations

1260.04(3) Passing Sight Distance Horizontal Curves Passing sight distance can be restricted on the inside of a horizontal curve by sightline obstructions that are 3.5 feet or more above the roadway surface. Use the distance from Exhibit 1260-12 and the equation in Exhibit 1260-9 to determine whether the object is close enough to the roadway to be a restriction to passing sight distance. The equation assumes that the curve length is greater than the sight distance. Where the curve length is less than the sight distance, the desired sight distance may be available with a lesser sightline offset (M) distance.
1260.05 Decision Sight Distance (Eye height – 3.5 ft, Object height – 2.0 ft) Decision sight distance values are greater than stopping sight distance values because they give the driver an additional margin for error and afford sufficient length to maneuver at the same or reduced speed rather than to just stop.

Consider decision sight distances (see Exhibit 1260-14) at locations where there is high likelihood for driver error in information reception, decision making, or control actions. If site characteristics and budget allow, locate these highway features where decision sight distance can be provided. If this is not practicable, use suitable traffic control devices and positive guidance to give advanced warning of the conditions.

1270.01 General Auxiliary lanes are used to comply with capacity demand; maintain lane balance; accommodate speed change, weaving, and maneuvering for entering and exiting traffic; and encourage carpools, vanpools, and the use of transit. For signing and delineation of auxiliary lanes, see the Standard Plans, the Traffic Manual, and the MUTCD. Contact the region Traffic Engineer for guidance. Although slow-moving vehicle turnouts and shoulder driving for slow vehicles are not auxiliary lanes, they are covered in this chapter because they perform a similar function. For additional information, see the following: Chapter 1103 Design controls, including speed Chapter 1230 Geometric cross section components Chapter 1310 Turn lanes Chapter 1310 Speed change lanes at intersections Chapter 1360 Collector-distributor roads Chapter 1360 Weaving lanes Chapter 1410 High-occupancy vehicle lanes
1270.02 Climbing Lanes 1270.02(1) General Climbing lanes (see Exhibit 1270-1) are normally associated with truck traffic, but they may also be considered in recreational or other areas that are subject to slow-moving traffic. Climbing lanes are designed independently for each direction of travel.
1270.02(2) Climbing Lane Warrants Generally, climbing lanes are provided when two warrants—speed reduction and level of service—are met. Either warrant may be waived if, for example, slow-moving traffic is causing an identified collision trend or congestion that could be corrected by the addition of a climbing lane. However, under most conditions, climbing lanes are built when both warrants are met.

Auxiliary Lanes
1270.02(2)(a) Warrant No. 1: Speed Reduction Exhibit 1270-2 shows how the percent and length of grade affect vehicle speeds. The data is based on a typical commercial truck. The maximum entrance speed, shown in the graphs, is 60 mph. This is the maximum value regardless of the posted speed of the highway. When the posted speed is above 60 mph, use 60 mph in place of the posted speed. Examine the profile at least ¼ mile preceding the grade to obtain a reasonable approach speed. If a vertical curve makes up part of the length of grade, approximate the equivalent uniform grade length. Whenever the gradient causes a 10 mph speed reduction below the posted speed limit for a typical truck for either two-lane or multilane highways, the speed reduction warrant is met (see Exhibit 1270-3).
1270.02(2)(b) Warrant No. 2: Level of Service The level of service warrant for two-lane highways is met when the upgrade traffic volume exceeds 200 vehicles per hour and the upgrade truck volume exceeds 20 vehicles per hour. On multilane highways, a climbing lane is warranted when a capacity analysis shows the need for more lanes on an upgrade than on a downgrade carrying the same traffic volume. Exhibit 1270-1 Climbing Lane Example
1270.02(3) Climbing Lane Design When a climbing lane is justified, design it in accordance with Exhibit 1270-4. Provide signing and delineation to identify the presence of the auxiliary lane. Begin climbing lanes at the point where the speed reduction warrant is met and end them where the warrant ends for multilane highways and 300 feet beyond for two-lane highways. Consider extending the auxiliary lane over the crest to improve vehicle acceleration and sight distance. Design climbing lane width equal to that of the adjoining through lane and at the same cross slope as the adjoining lanes. Whenever possible, maintain a shoulder width equal to the adjacent roadway segments (preserve shoulder width continuity). On two-way two-lane highways, the shoulder may be reduced to 4 feet. If the shoulder width is reduced to 4 feet document the reasoning for the decision in the design parameter sheets. If the shoulder width is reduced to less than 4 feet, a design analysis is required.

Exhibit 1270-3 Speed Reduction Warrant Example
Given: A two-lane highway meeting the level of service warrant, with the above profile, and a 60 mph posted speed. Determine: Is the climbing lane warranted? If so, what is its length? Solution: 1. Follow the 4% grade deceleration curve from a speed of 60 mph to a speed of 50 mph at 1,200 ft. The speed reduction warrant is met and a climbing lane is needed. 2. Continue on the 4% grade deceleration curve to 4,000 ft. Note that the speed at the end of the 4% grade is 35 mph. 3. Follow the 1% grade acceleration curve from a speed of 35 mph for 1,000 ft. Note that the speed at the end of the 1% grade is 41 mph. 4. Follow the -2% grade acceleration curve from a speed of 41 mph to a speed of 50 mph, ending the speed reduction warrant. Note that the distance is 700 ft. 5. The total auxiliary lane length is (4,000-1,200)+1,000+700+300=4,800 feet. 300 ft is added to the speed reduction warrant for a two-lane highway (see Section 1270.02(3) and Exhibit 1270-4).

1270.03 Passing Lanes 1270.03(1) Passing Lane Benefits A passing lane (see Exhibit 1270-5) is an auxiliary lane provided in one or both directions of travel on a two-lane highway to improve passing opportunities. They may be intermittent or continuous passing lanes in level or rolling terrain and short four-lane sections. The objectives of passing lanes are to:
•
•
•
Improve overall traffic operations on two-lane highways by breaking up traffic platoons and reducing delays caused by inadequate passing opportunities over substantial lengths of highway. Increase average travel speed within the passing lane itself; the speed benefits of passing lanes continue downstream of the lane. Passing lanes typically reduce the percent time spent following within the passing lane itself. These “percent time spent following” benefits can continue for some distance downstream of the passing lane. Improve safety by providing assured passing opportunities without the need for the passing driver to use the opposing traffic lane. Safety evaluations have shown that passing lanes and short four-lane sections reduce collision rates and severity.
1270.03(2) Passing Lane Length Design passing lanes long enough to provide a reduction in traffic platooning. To maximize the traffic operational efficiency of a passing lane in level or rolling terrain, its length can vary from 0.5 mile to 2.0 miles depending on the directional flow rate, as shown in Exhibit 1270-6. Passing lanes longer than 2 miles can cause the driver to lose the sense that the highway is a two-lane facility. However, these lengths may vary for other reasons such as addressing safety-related issues. Passing lanes longer than 2.0 miles or shorter than 0.5 miles in length may be used depending on the identified need or other operational considerations within the design. Lengths shown do not include passing lane tapers at the beginning or end of the passing lane. Exhibit 1270-5 Passing Lane Example

Contact the Headquarters Design Office for assistance (https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/design-tools-and-support).
1270.03(3) Passing Lane Location A number of factors are considered when selecting an appropriate location for a passing lane, including the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Locate passing lanes where decision sight distance (see Chapter 1260) at the lane decrease tapers can be provided. Provide stopping sight distance continuously along the roadway Avoid locating passing lanes near high-volume intersections, existing structures, railroad crossings, areas of dense development, and two-way left-turn lanes. Locate passing lanes where they appear logical to the driver. When designing the addition of passing lanes, make sure existing curves at the desired location have adequate superelevation to provide speeds suitable for passing. For information on superelevation, see Chapter 1250. Avoid other physical constraints, such as bridges and culverts, if they restrict the provision of a continuous shoulder. Consider the number, type, and location of intersections and road approaches. Consider grades when choosing the side on which to install the passing lane. Uphill grades are preferred but not mandatory. Preference for passing is normally given to the traffic departing a developed area such as a small town.
1270.03(3)(a) Traffic Operational Considerations When passing lanes are provided at an isolated location, their typical objective is to reduce delays at a specific bottleneck; for example, climbing lanes (see Section 1270.02). The location of the passing lane is dictated by the needs of the specific traffic operational problem encountered. When passing lanes are provided to improve traffic operations over a length of road, there is flexibility in the choice of passing lane locations to maximize their operational effectiveness and minimize construction costs. If delay problems on an upgrade are severe, the upgrade will usually be the preferred location for a passing lane. Passing lanes at upgrades begin before speeds are reduced to unacceptable levels and, where possible, continue over the crest of the grade so that slower vehicles can regain some speed before merging.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1270-7
Chapter 1270
Auxiliary Lanes
1270.03(3)(b) Construction Cost Considerations The cost of constructing a passing lane can vary substantially, depending on terrain, highway structures, shoulders, and adjacent development. Thus, the choice of a suitable location for a passing lane may be critical to its cost-effectiveness. Generally, passing lanes in level and rolling terrain can be placed where they are least expensive to construct, avoiding locations with high cuts and fills and existing structures that would be expensive to widen.
1270.03(3)(c) Intersection-Related Considerations Consider a corridor evaluation of potential passing lane locations for each direction, avoiding placement of passing lanes near intersections. Avoid or minimize turning movements on a road section where passing is encouraged. Low-volume intersections and driveways are allowed within passing lanes, but not within the taper transition areas. Where the presence of higher-volume intersections and driveways cannot be avoided, consider including provisions for turning vehicles, such as left-turn lanes. Provide right- and left-turn lanes in passing lane sections where they would be provided on a conventional twolane highway. Left turns within the first 1,000 feet of a passing lane are undesirable. Strategies to address the turning movement could include left-turn lanes, right-in/right-out access, beginning the passing lane after the entrance, and so on.
1270.03(4) Passing Lane Design Where a passing lane is planned, evaluate several possible configurations (see Section 1270.03(4)(a)) that are consistent with the corridor and fit within the constraints of the specific location. The recommended minimum transition distance between passing lanes in opposing directions is 500 feet for “tail-to-tail” and 1,500 feet for “head-to-head” (see Exhibit 1270-8). Some separation between lanes in opposite directions of travel is desirable; however, passing lanes can operate effectively with no separation. In either situation, address pavement markings and centerline rumble strips as appropriate. It is desirable to channelize the beginning of a passing lane to move traffic to the right lane in order to promote prompt usage of the right lane by platoon leaders and maximize passing lane efficiency. Widening symmetrically to maintain the roadway crown at the centerline is preferred, including in continuous passing lane configurations. However, the roadway crown may be placed in other locations as deemed appropriate. Considerations for crown locations might include: costs, constructability, right of way, environmentally sensitive roadsides, or other factors.

Auxiliary Lanes
1270.03(4)(a) Alternative Configurations Where a passing lane will be provided, evaluate the configurations shown in Exhibit 1270-7. In the exhibit, general passing lane configurations and their typical applications are described in the following: a. Isolated Passing Lane – Exhibit 1270-7 (a) o Two-lane highway with passing lane provided at a spot location to dissipate queues. o For isolated grades, consider climbing lanes (see Section 1270.02). b. Intermittent Passing Lanes, Separated – Exhibit 1270-7 (b) o Often pairs are used at regular intervals along a two-lane highway. o Frequency of passing lanes depends on desired level of service. o The spacing between passing lanes and between pairs may be adjusted to fit the conditions along the route (see Section 1270.03(3)). c. Continuous Passing Lanes – Exhibit 1270-7 (c) o Use only when constraints do not allow for the use of other configurations. The use of this configuration requires concurrence from the region Traffic Engineer. (See Exhibit 1270-8 for additional information regarding buffer areas.) o Appropriate for two-lane roadways carrying relatively high traffic volumes where nearly continuous passing lanes are needed to achieve the desired level of service. o Particularly appropriate over an extended section of roadway where a wide pavement is already available. o May be used as an interim stage for an ultimate four-lane highway. o Short Four-Lane Section – Exhibit 1270-7 (d) o Sufficient length for adjoining passing lanes is not available. o Particularly appropriate where the ultimate design for the highway is four lanes. d. Intermittent Three-Lane Passing Lanes – Exhibit 1270-7 (e) o Does not require the slow vehicle to change lanes to allow passing. o Requires the widening to transition from one side of the existing roadway to the other. o Eliminates the head-to-head tapers.
1270.03(4)(b) Geometric Aspects Carefully design transitions between passing lanes in opposing directions. Intersections, bridges, other structures, two-way left-turn lanes, painted medians, or similar elements can be used to provide a buffer area between opposing passing lanes. The length of the buffer area between adjoining passing lanes depends on the configuration (see Exhibit 1270-8). Exhibit 1270-7 illustrates five passing lane design configurations. Part (c) illustrates a continuous three-lane section with alternating passing lanes. Consider a four-lane cross section when volume demand exceeds the capacity of a continuous three-lane roadway. Exhibit 1270-9 illustrates taper rates, cross slopes, and section lengths for three and four-lane passing sections. Where practicable provide shoulder width in a passing lane section equal to the shoulder width on the adjacent segments of a two-lane highway. However, the shoulder may be reduced to 4 feet. If the shoulder width is reduced to 4 feet, document the reason for the decision on the design parameter sheets. If the shoulder width is reduced to less than 4 feet, a design analysis is required. See Chapter 1600 for shoulder rumble strip criteria and considerations.

Chapter 1270
Auxiliary Lanes
Where practicable, design the passing lane width the same as the lane width on the adjacent segments of the two-lane highway. Provide a 25:1 or flatter taper rate to increase the width for a passing lane. When all traffic is directed to the right lane at the beginning of the passing lane, provide a taper rate of the posted speed:1. Provide a posted speed:1 taper rate for the merging taper at the end of a passing lane. (Refer to the Lane Transitions section in Chapter 1210 for additional information on taper rates.) Consider a wide shoulder at the lane drop taper to provide a recovery area for drivers who encounter a merging conflict. Provide signing and delineation to identify the presence of an auxiliary passing lane. Refer to the Standard Plans, the Traffic Manual, and the MUTCD for passing lane signing and marking guidance.

1270.04 Slow-Moving Vehicle Turnouts 1270.04(1) General RCW 46.61.427 states: On a two-lane highway where passing is unsafe … a slow-moving vehicle, behind which five or more vehicles are formed in a line, shall turn off the roadway wherever sufficient area for a safe turn-out exists, in order to permit the vehicles following to proceed… A slow-moving vehicle turnout is not an auxiliary lane. Its purpose is to provide sufficient room for a slowmoving vehicle to pull out of through traffic and stop if necessary, allow vehicles to pass, and then return to the through lane. Generally, a slow-moving vehicle turnout is provided on existing roadways where passing opportunities are limited, where slow-moving vehicles such as trucks and recreational vehicles are predominant, and where the cost to provide a full auxiliary lane would be prohibitive.
1270.04(2) Design Base the design of a slow-moving vehicle turnout primarily on sound engineering judgment. Designs may vary from one location to another. Provide a length between 100 and 1,320 feet, excluding tapers. Select a width adequate for the vehicle type expected to use the turn-out, between 8 to 12 feet in width. Surface the turnouts with a stable, unyielding material (such as BST or HMA) with adequate structural strength to support the heavier traffic. To improve the ability of a vehicle to safely reenter through traffic, locate slow-moving vehicle turnouts where adequate sight distance is available. The minimum design range for slow-vehicle turnouts may be where at least design stopping sight distance is available. See Chapter 1260. Sign slow-moving vehicle turnouts to identify their presence. For guidance, see the Standard Plans, the Traffic Manual, and the MUTCD.
1270.05 Shoulder Driving for Slow Vehicles 1270.05(1) General Use of a shoulder driving section is an alternative means to meet the performance objectives provided by climbing or passing lanes. Review the following when considering a shoulder driving section:
•
•
•
•
•
Horizontal and vertical alignment Character of traffic Presence of bicycles Road approaches and intersections Clear zone (see Chapter 1600)
1270.05(2) Design When designing a shoulder for shoulder driving, locate where full design stopping sight distance (speed/path/direction decision sight distance is desirable) and a minimum length of 600 feet are available. Where practicable, avoid sharp horizontal curves. When barriers or other roadside objects are present, the minimum width is 12 feet.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1270-14
Chapter 1270
Auxiliary Lanes
The shoulder width depends on the vehicles that will be using the shoulder. Where trucks will be the primary vehicle using the shoulder, use a 12-foot width; when passenger cars are the primary vehicle, a 10-foot width may be used. Shoulder driving and bicycles are not compatible. When the route has been identified as a local, state, or regional significant bike route, shoulder driving for slow vehicles is undesirable. Reconstruct the shoulders to provide adequate structural strength for the anticipated traffic. Select locations where the side slope meets the criteria of Chapter 1239. When providing a transition at the end of a shoulder driving section, use a 50:1 taper. Signing for shoulder driving is required (see the Standard Plans, the Traffic Manual, and the MUTCD). Install guideposts when shoulder driving is to be permitted at night.
1270.06 Emergency Escape Ramps 1270.06(1) General Consider an emergency escape ramp (see Exhibit 1270-10) whenever a long, steep downgrade is encountered. In this situation, the possibility exists of a truck losing its brakes and going out of control at a high speed. Consult local maintenance personnel and check crash data to determine whether or not an escape ramp is justified. Exhibit 1270-10 Emergency Escape Ramp Example

1270.06(2) Design 1270.06(2)(a) Types Escape ramps include the following types:
•
•
•
•
Gravity escape ramps are ascending grade ramps paralleling the traveled way. They are commonly built on old roadways. Their long length and steep grade can present the driver with control problems, not only in stopping, but with rollback after stopping. Gravity escape ramps are the least desirable design. Sand pile escape ramps are piles of loose, dry sand dumped at the ramp site, usually not more than 400 feet in length. The deceleration is usually high and the sand can be affected by weather conditions; therefore, they are less desirable than arrester beds. However, where space is limited, they may be suitable. Arrester beds are parallel ramps filled with smooth, free-draining gravel. They stop the out-of-control vehicle by increasing the rolling resistance and are the most desirable design. Arrester beds are commonly built on an upgrade to add the benefit of gravity to the rolling resistance. However, successful arrester beds have been built on a level or descending grade. The Dragnet Vehicle Arresting Barrier consists of chain link or fiber net that is attached to energyabsorbing units. (See Chapter 1610 for additional information.)
1270.06(2)(b) Locations The location of an escape ramp depends on terrain, length of grade, sight distance, and roadway geometrics. Desirable locations include before a critical curve, near the bottom of a grade, or before a stop. It is desirable that the ramp leave the roadway on a tangent at least 3 miles from the beginning of the downgrade.
1270.06(2)(c) Lengths The length of an escape ramp depends on speed, grade, and type of design used. The minimum length is 200 feet. Calculate the stopping length using the equation in Exhibit 1270-11. Exhibit 1270-11 Emergency Escape Ramp Length
𝐿=
𝑉2 0.3(𝑅 ± 𝐺)
Where: L = Stopping distance (ft) V = Entering speed (mph) R = Rolling resistance (see Exhibit 1270-12) G = Grade of the escape ramp (%) Speeds of out-of-control trucks rarely exceed 90 mph; therefore, the desirable entering speed is 90 mph. Other entry speeds may be used when justification and the method used to determine the speed are documented.

1270.06(2)(d) Widths The width of each escape ramp depends on the needs of the individual situation. It is desirable for the ramp to be wide enough to accommodate more than one vehicle. The desirable width of an escape ramp to accommodate two out-of-control vehicles is 40 feet and the minimum width is 26 feet. The following items are additional considerations in the design of emergency escape ramps:
•
•
•
•
•
•
If possible, at or near the summit, provide a pull-off brake check area. Also, include in this area informative signing about the upcoming escape ramp. Free-draining, smooth, non-crushed gravel is desirable for an arrester bed. To assist in smooth deceleration of the vehicle, taper the depth of the bed from 3 inches at the entry to a full depth of 18 to 30 inches in not less than 100 feet. Mark and sign in advance of the ramp. Discourage normal traffic from using or parking in the ramp. Sign escape ramps in accordance with the guidance contained in the MUTCD for runaway truck ramps. Provide drainage adequate to prevent the bed from freezing or compacting. Consider including an impact attenuator at the end of the ramp if space is limited. A surfaced service road adjacent to the arrester bed is needed for wreckers and maintenance vehicles to remove vehicles and make repairs to the arrester bed. Anchors are desirable at 300-foot intervals to secure the wrecker when removing vehicles from the bed.
Typical examples of arrester beds are shown in Exhibit 1270-10 and Exhibit 1270-13. Include justification, all calculations, and any other design considerations in the emergency escape ramp documentation.

1300.01 General It is WSDOT practice to analyze potential intersection solutions at all intersection improvement locations in accordance with E 1090 – Moving Washington Forward: Practical Solutions. The objective is to provide the optimum solution within available resources, with an emphasis on low-cost investments. The analysis can be done for individual intersections, or on a corridor or network basis. This chapter provides guidance on preliminary intersection analysis and selection of control type. Intersection design is completed using Chapter 1310 for the geometrics of intersections, Chapter 1320 for roundabouts, and Chapter 1330 for traffic signals. Use the aforementioned chapters in conjunction with Chapter 1106, Chapter 1230 series, Chapter 1730, Chapter 1510, and Chapter 1520 to assist with dimensioning design elements. Consider design users and the balance between modes, safety and mobility performance considerations, context-sensitive/sustainable design, and economics when selecting and evaluating alternatives to meet the needs of the project. Identification of intersection projects can come from a variety of programs and sources, including those funded by local agencies and developers. The intent of this chapter is that the procedures apply to all types of intersection modifications on the state highway system. Potential safety project locations are identified through the safety priority programming process. Other programs may identify intersection needs through the priority programming process, but the influence of the type of intersection control with respect to specific performance category needs may not be fully understood until contributing factors analysis is completed (see Chapter 1101). Complete an Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE), formerly known as Intersection Control Analysis (ICA), as early as practicable, taking into account the level of community engagement that may need to occur prior to approval. The ICE (see Section 1300.05 for procedures) should be considered a working document that is initiated no later than the scoping phase so that the scope and schedule are compatible with the chosen intersection type. Scale the ICE according to the size and complexity of the project; for example, evaluation of adding a turn lane to an existing intersection control may take less effort than evaluating new intersection control. Consult the region or HQ Traffic offices for assistance with the level of effort required. It is WSDOT policy to focus on lower cost solutions with the intent to optimize return on investment. Only when all at-grade intersection alternatives are ruled out, including turn restrictions and complete intersection removal, should other more-costly measures be considered, such as grade-separation. Ramp terminal intersections are subject to the analysis requirements of this chapter. See Chapter 1360 and Chapter 550 for additional information.

1300.02 Intersection Control Objectives Intersections are an important part of highway design. Intersection control choice requires consideration of all potential users of the facility, including drivers of motorcycles, passenger cars, heavy vehicles of different classifications, public transit, and bicyclists and pedestrians. Design users have varying skills and abilities. Younger and older drivers in particular are subject to a variety of behavioral or human factors that can influence elements of their driving ability. See NCHRP Report 600 – Human Factors Guidelines for Road Systems: Second Edition for additional information (www.trb.org/Main/Blurbs/167909.aspx). Bicyclists, from recreational to commuters, also have a variety of skill sets that can influence the effectiveness of bike facilities and intersection operational design (see Chapter 1520 for additional information). Meeting the needs of one user group can directly influence the service that other groups experience. The selection process evaluates these competing needs and results in an optimal balance of tradeoffs for all design users, recognizing the context and priorities of the location. The intent of an ICE is not to design an intersection, but to evaluate the compatibility of different intersection control types with respect to context, modal priority, intersection design vehicle, and the identified balance of performance needs. Four basic intersection design consideration categories are shown in Exhibit 1300-1 and can affect the intersection control types depending on the situation. The objectives of the ICE are to:
• Provide a consistent framework to determine the most compatible intersection control type for the location, context, economics, and balance of performance needs.
• Evaluate the operational and safety performance for various appropriate and feasible intersection control types under consideration.
• Evaluate the modal performance considerations between different intersection control types with respect to the identified modal priority and intersection design vehicle (see Chapter 1103). Identify the potential modal treatments that augment the control types.
• Consider the intersection operations and the relationship with adjacent intersections and other access points.
• Evaluate the intersection control types for potential sustainability, community value, and expected maintenance and operation needs.
• Include roundabouts in all intersection control evaluations due to their safety, operational, and sustainability benefits.
• Consider emerging alternative intersection designs such as displaced left-turn (DLT) and restricted crossing u-turn intersections (RCUT) where appropriate.
• Select the intersection control type for the project based on overall need and context. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Intersection Control Type
1300.03 Common Types of Intersection Control Generally, intersection control evaluations consider multiple intersection control types when intersections are assessed. The following is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of intersection control types but does serve as an initial guide. Depending on the context at a certain location, an entirely different or unique solution may be reached. Intersection control decisions including individual movements are often documented in Intersection Control Evaluations. However, not all changes to intersections require an Intersection Control Evaluations, in those instances please note the documentation requirements in this section.
1300.03(1) Uncontrolled Intersections Uncontrolled movements are those that do not have signing, and the normal right of way rule (RCW 46.61.180) applies. This intersection type is typically found on local roads and streets where the volumes of the intersecting roadways are low, speeds are low, and there is little to no crash history. Uncontrolled movements can sometimes be found in existing intersections such as right turns onto adjoining roads or highways. In those rare cases, document the use of uncontrolled movements for state routes at new or changed intersections projects in urban areas or where pedestrians or bicycles are expected.

1300.03(2) Yield Control Intersections with yield control assign right of way without requiring a stop. Vehicles controlled by a YIELD sign need to slow down to a speed that is reasonable for the existing conditions and can stop when necessary to avoid interfering with conflicts that have the right of way. All approaches to roundabouts are yield controlled. Sometimes channelized movements at intersections and interchanges are as well. Except at roundabouts, document use of yield control at intersections for state routes at new or changed intersections projects within urban areas or where pedestrians and bicycles are expected.

1300.03(3) Two-Way Stop Control Intersections with two-way stop control are a common, lower cost control, which require the traffic on the minor roadway to stop and yield to mainline traffic before entering the major roadway. Along certain corridors, especially where u-turn opportunities exist, consider limiting access at two-way stops to “right-in, right-out only.”
1300.03(4) All-Way Stop Control For an all-way stop intersection, motor vehicle traffic approaching it from all directions is required to stop before proceeding through the intersection. An all-way stop may have multiple approaches and typically marked with a supplemental signing stating the number of approaches. All-way stop control is most effective at the intersection of low-speed, 2-lane roadways not exceeding 1,400 vehicles during the peak hour. All-way stop control are not used for projects on multilane state highways at new or updated intersection projects with more than one thru lane in a direction. Guidance for consideration of all-way stop control is provided in the MUTCD.

1300.03(5) Roundabouts Roundabouts are often circular (or near-circular) at-grade intersections, where traffic on the approaches yield to traffic within the circulating roadway. Roundabouts are an effective intersection type that may offer the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Reduced fatal and injury crashes compared with other at-grade intersection types. Fewer conflict points. Lower potential for wrong-way driving. Reduced traffic delays. Traffic-calming and lower speeds. More capacity than a two-way or multi-way stop. Quickly serves pedestrians needing to cross the intersection and shortens crossing distance for pedestrians by allowing for crossing in stages using splitter islands as pedestrian refuges. Reduced vehicular approach speeds that result in reduced crash and severity potential to pedestrians. Ability to serve high turning volumes with minimal number of approach lanes. Improved operations where space for queuing is limited. Improved capacity at ramp terminals intersections with high left-turn volumes without affecting the structure. Facilitation of u-turn movements and can be appropriate when combined with access management along a corridor. Aesthetic treatments and gateways to communities. Flexibility to fit funding and a variety of site constraints. Roundabouts are scalable and site-specific solutions. See Chapter 1320 for more information on roundabout types and design.

1300.03(6) Traffic Control Signals Signalized intersections may offer the following benefits:
•
•
•
Increased capacity of the intersection compared to stop-controlled intersections. Allow for improved progression within a coordinated system along a corridor or a grid. Can be used to interrupt heavy traffic at intervals to permit other traffic, vehicular or pedestrian, to complete their movement or enter the intersection. Can be preempted to provide priority service to railroad, emergency responders, transit and approaches where advance queue loops are used. Reduced at-angle vehicle crashes compared to stop-controlled intersections.
•
•
However, signalized intersections have drawbacks. They:
•
•
•
•
Require continual maintenance and engineering for optimal operations. Cannot adequately balance large traffic flows with pedestrian demands. Can be susceptible to power outages and detection failures. Increase rear-end crashes.
Indiscriminate use of traffic signals can adversely affect the safety performance and operational efficiency of vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic. Therefore, and as required by the MUTCD, a traffic signal should be considered for installation only after if it is determined to meet specific “warrants” and an engineering study shows that the installation would improve safety and/or operations. Satisfying a signal warrant does not mandate the installation of a traffic signal nor by itself meet the requirements of Section 1300.05; but failing to satisfy at least one warrant shall remove the signal from consideration. Not all crashes are correctable with the installation of a traffic signal. Traffic signals may decrease the potential for crashes of one type and increase the potential for another type. For instance, at-angle crashes are less frequent with signals because the traffic movements are controlled, but rear-end crashes are more frequent with signals because of stopping and starting of vehicles. At-angle crashes are usually more severe than rear-end crashes; however, the severity of these rear-end crashes tend to be higher at operating speeds above 40 mph. This requires careful consideration of the location characteristics, traffic flow, and crash history. State statutes (RCW 46.61.085) require WSDOT approval for the design and location of all conventional traffic signals and for some types of beacons located on city streets forming parts of state highways. The Traffic Signal Permit (DOT Form 242-014 EF) is the formal record of the department’s approval of the installation and type of signal. For traffic signal permit guidance, see Chapter 1330.
1300.03(7) Alternative Intersections Alternative intersections work mainly by rerouting U and left turns, and/or separating movements. Alternative intersections may have different terminology in different areas, but the most common types include:

Intersection Control Type
As alternative intersections may be relatively new to Washington State and its users, more education and community engagement will be necessary to help ensure project success. However, extensive experience shows that many of these intersection types can provide better operational and safety performance, often at much less cost than traditional strategies. Three types of alternative intersections are highlighted in the subsections below: median u-turn, restricted crossing u-turn, and displaced left-turn intersections. For more information about these and other intersection design solutions, see the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Alternative Intersection Design web page.
1300.03(7)(a) Median U-Turn The Median UTurn (MUT) intersection treatment relocates left turn movements downstream from the intersection resulting in lower delays, higher throughput, and reduction in the number and severity of crashes. Left-turning drivers proceed straight through the at-grade intersection, and then execute a u-turn at some distance downstream at a new or existing median opening. The main intersection is typically signalized and can be highly efficient needing only two signal phases. By removing the left turns at the main intersection, the MUT design results in a significant reduction in rear-end, angle, and sideswipe crashes; while reducing the number of conflict points from 32 to 16 when compared to a conventional signalized intersection. The MUT can also have advantages for pedestrians with fewer conflict points and a lower delay. However, the intersection design may reduce bicyclist mobility as they are expected to use the pedestrian crossings in order to perform left turns at the intersection. The MUT intersection design is more likely to be suitable for consideration in situations where:
•
•
•
•
The intersection is over capacity. There are heavy through volumes and low to moderate left turn volumes. The intersection is within a higher-speed, multilane, median-divided corridor. There are safety concerns at an existing signalized intersection or corridor.
Refer to FHWA’s Median U-Turn Intersection Informational Guide for geometric design considerations and recommendations. (See Chapter 1310 for geometrics when designing the u-turn movement for the MUT intersection.)

1300.03(7)(b) Restricted Crossing U-Turn Intersection Restricted Crossing U-Turn (RCUT) intersections, also known as superstreets or J-turns, have similarities with the MUT in that the minor road left-turning movements are redirected (see Exhibit 1300-2). RCUTs, however, also redirect minor road through movements as shown in Exhibit 1300-3. This intersection type results in lower delays, improved progression, and a potential reduction in the total number of crashes and fatal and injury crashes. Drivers on the minor road approaches must turn right onto the major road and then perform a u-turn maneuver at a median opening downstream. However, the major road left turn movements may still be allowed at the main intersection. RCUT intersections may or may not warrant signalization due to traffic volumes, and those with signalization require fewer signal phases and shorter cycle lengths than a traditional signalized intersection. The RCUT intersection is more likely suitable for consideration in situations where:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The intersection is over capacity. There is a need to improve travel time and progression for the major road. There are crashes at the intersection related to turning movements that can be reduced by a RCUT. The intersection is within a higher-speed, multilane corridor. There are low through and left turn volumes on the minor road. Pedestrian volumes are low. The major roadway contains sufficient median width, or total right of way width, to support the u-turn movements.

Example of RCUT Intersection with stop-control from FHWA’s Restricted Crossing U-Turn Intersection Informational Guide The RCUT intersection may be a potential alternative compared to a grade-separated interchange, at locations meeting grade-separated considerations identified in Section 530.04(3). Refer to FHWA’s Restricted Crossing UTurn Intersection Informational Guide for geometric design considerations and recommendations. (See Chapter 1310 for geometrics when designing the u-turn movement for the RCUT.)
1300.03(7)(c) Displaced Left-Turn Intersection The Displaced Left-Turn (DLT) intersection, also known as a continuous flow intersection, works mainly by relocating one or more left turn movements to the other side of the opposing traffic via an interconnected signalized crossover. This essentially causes the traffic signal system to be more efficient by eliminating the left turn phase at the main intersection allowing for more green time to be allocated to other movements. The DLT can reduce delays by up to 40%, but often can be delivered for just slightly more cost than a typical signalized intersection. Compared with a conventional intersection, the DLT can be more challenging for pedestrians due to longer crossing distances and counter-intuitive left turn vehicular movements. However, the DLT typically has shorter cycle lengths and potentially shorter delays. The DLT intersection design is best applied in situations where:
•
•
•
•
•
•
There are high left-turn and through volumes. Intersection is over capacity. There are excessive delays and queuing, especially when left turn queues extend past the available storage bays. Pedestrian volumes are low. Sufficient right-of-way exists on the leg(s) that need to be widened to accommodate the new lanes. Context is urban/suburban.

1300.04 Modal Considerations When designing a multimodal intersection, consideration needs to be given to all design users at the intersection, the intersection design vehicle and selected modal priority (see Chapter 1103). It is not appropriate to design for specific modal treatments on the outset of evaluating intersection control types; however, modally oriented intersection treatments may be necessary to enhance specific modal baseline or contextual performance needs (see Chapter 1101), and may influence the control type selection. Include a discussion of the potential modally oriented treatments relevant to the control types being analyzed and modal performance needs. Evaluate the potential effect of modal specific treatments on all design users relevant for the control types evaluated in the ICE.
1300.04(1) Pedestrian Considerations Consider the intersection type and how it accommodates pedestrians. With each intersection type, there may be specific elements and/or treatments applicable for pedestrians (see, for example Chapter 1231 and Chapter 1510) to meet modal performance needs identified (see Chapter 1101). For example, a signalized intersection with a long cycle length, high vehicle speeds, or frequent permitted turning movements is generally not appropriate for areas with moderate to high pedestrian demand. However, a roundabout or responsive signal in an urban downtown core with low speeds is typically well respected with high compliance and short delays.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1300-12
Chapter 1300
Intersection Control Type
Roundabouts often accommodate pedestrian crossings because of high motorist compliance rates, short delays, and minimal disruption to vehicular traffic flow due to short crossing distances, reduced vehicular speeds, and two-stage crossings. Additional strategies may be utilized at multi-lane roundabouts if the pedestrian network and context supports enhanced pedestrian crossings. Additional information on emerging practices to address pedestrian performance needs for different intersection control types can be found at the Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center (www.pedbikeinfo.org/). For signalized intersections, sidewalk and ramp designs have additional requirements to accommodate the pedestrian features of the traffic signal system (see Chapter 1330).
1300.04(2) Bicycle Considerations For consideration of bicycle needs at intersections and treatments that may have an operational effect on other design users, see Chapter 1515 and Chapter 1520. Additional emerging practice information to address bicycle performance needs for different intersection control types can be found at the Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center (www.pedbikeinfo.org/) and the NACTO Urban Bikeway Design Guide (nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/).
1300.04(3) Transit Considerations When transit vehicles are identified as a modal priority, consider treatments to meet the performance needs of the specific transit vehicle types and their effect on the performance of other design users (see Chapter 1103). Transit oriented treatments can vary significantly depending on the proximity of stop locations with respect to the intersection location and origin of the transit movement (see Chapter 1730 for bus stop placement guidelines), and the type of transit vehicle (such as a fixed guideway vehicle). Discuss treatment options and any operating restrictions the transit provider may have regarding different intersection control types.
1300.04(4) Operational Considerations Traditional delay analysis focuses on determining the peak-hour letter-graded Level of Service (LOS) of an individual intersection. However, as this approach often does not account for multimodal users and as roughly 80% of the daily traffic volumes occur outside of the peak hours, a more encompassing review of the intersection is needed to provide sufficient multimodal capacity and safety performance at all hours of the day. Intersection control can have an influence on road user behavior and modal operations, not just at the intersection itself, but also along the corridor or surrounding network, even when the intersection has an acceptable LOS. Delay affects route and mode choice and sometimes whether a user will decide to complete the trip. A user’s willingness to accept delay depends on many factors including the user’s knowledge of the transportation network, anticipated traffic conditions, and alternative options. The increasing presence of invehicle guidance systems and real-time traffic apps further aids the user in selecting the route with shortest travel times. Also, some alternatives that may improve mobility for one mode, such as the addition of turn lanes, may result in a performance degradation or even discourage trips for pedestrians or other modes. Thus, it is important to consider the effects of intersection control on the surrounding network and for all potential users. The following are some factors when selecting and evaluating alternatives:
•
•
Access management strategies can be effective in promoting efficient travel patterns and rerouting traffic to other existing intersections. Check with the WSDOT region Planning Office for future land use plans or comprehensive plans to provide for future growth accommodation. Consider the volume to capacity (V/C) ratio, the delay, and the queue length of each approach. Some scenarios may require additional sensitivity analysis to determine the impacts of small changes in volumes.

Intersection Control Type
Examine the effects of existing conditions. Consider progression through nearby intersections (corridor and network analysis) and known risky or illegal driving maneuvers. Consider the possibility that traffic from other intersections with lower LOS will divert to the new/revised intersection.
1300.05 Procedures 1300.05(1) For new intersections Determine and document intersection control according to the applicable procedures in this chapter.
1300.05(2) For existing intersections An Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) is required for intersection improvement projects involving pavement construction and/or reconstruction, or preservation projects such as signal replacement/rehabilitation. Evaluate intersection control in accordance with this chapter unless there is documentation that this analysis has already been completed and is referenced in the Project Summary. An ICE is not required, but should be considered, for existing intersections that are unaffected by the project (per the contributing factors analysis) or are receiving minor revisions such as signal timing changes or rechannelization of existing pavement. Intersection rechannelization within existing pavement can result in operational and safety performance changes that should be evaluated within the existing project framework. Consideration should be given to mainline traffic volume, entering volume, and availability of mainline gaps for additions of left- or right-turn storage within existing intersection width.
1300.05(3) Intersection Control Evaluation The Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE), formerly known as the Intersection Control Analysis, is a 5-step process meant to screen and evaluate alternatives to determine the best possible intersection type and design. Scale the ICE according to the size and complexity of the project. Due to the safety and operational performance record, a roundabout is required to be evaluated in Step 1. For each alternative, provide a brief description of the assumed layout. Include the number of lanes on major and minor approaches and any measures necessary to accommodate multi-modal users. For a roundabout, document the assumed inscribed circle diameter. For a signal, document the assumed cycle length and phasing strategy used for the analysis. Step 1: Background and Project Needs – Describe the existing conditions. Include physical characteristics of the site, posted speed, AADT, turning movement volumes, channelization and control features, multimodal facilities, context, and modal priority. Document the project’s baseline and contextual needs and performance metrics and targets that will be affected by the intersection. These needs, metrics, and targets will be used for alternative comparison in Step 3. Identify all project alternatives under consideration. For each alternative, determine if it is expected to meet the basic needs of the project. Remove alternatives that do not pass the initial screening and document their removal. All remaining alternatives are to proceed to Step 2. Step 2: Feasibility – Develop the alternatives at a sketch level to determine the footprint required to achieve performance measures. Consider right-of-way, environmental, cost, context-sensitive/sustainable design, and geometrics/physical constraints for each remaining alternative.

Determine the right of way requirements and feasibility. Discuss the right of way requirements and the feasibility of acquiring that right of way in the analysis. Include sketches or plan sheets with sufficient detail to identify topography, existing utilities, environmental constraints, drainage, buildings, and other fixed objects. An economic evaluation will be useful if additional right of way is needed. Include the right of way costs in the alternatives evaluation (Step 4). Identify known environmental concerns that could influence control type selection. At this stage, are there any red flags or obvious concerns between potential control types? Are there any known environmental risks that may substantially increase the cost of the project or available information that could help in alternatives comparison? Consult with region Environmental staff for support. Consider Context Sensitive/Sustainable Design. Context sensitive design is a model for transportation project development. A proposed transportation project is to be planned not only for its physical aspects as a facility serving specific transportation objectives for pertinent modes, but also for its effects on the aesthetic, social, economic, and environmental values, needs, constraints, and opportunities in a larger community setting. Projects designed using this model: Optimize safety of the facility for both the user modes and the community. Promote multimodal solutions. Are in harmony with the community, and preserve the environmental, scenic, aesthetic, historic, and natural resource values of the area. Are designed and built with minimal disruption to the community. Involve efficient and effective use of the resources (time, budget, community) of all involved parties. Minimize maintenance and maximize useful lifetime of the design. See additional guidance in Chapter 301.
Step 3: Operational and Safety Performance Analysis – Perform and report the results of applicable analyses for all remaining alternatives and the no-build condition for performance metrics and targets identified in Step 1. The analysis is scalable, but typically should include the metrics below. The level of effort should be based on project complexity, cost of proposed alternatives, context, and impact to the network and other modes. Contact the region Traffic Office early in the process to determine the network area of influence and scope of analysis. Include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
Traffic Analysis – Use the opening year and selected design year for analysis (see Chapter 1103). In some cases, it may also be appropriate to analyze the horizon year as well. Identify and justify any growth rates used and provide turning movements for all scenarios. There are several deterministic and microsimulation tools for analyzing delay and intersection performance. Traffic volumes and the proximity to other access points will dictate the modeling effort required. Contact the region Traffic Office to determine the appropriate approved tool(s). For more information and guidance on traffic analysis, refer to Chapter 320 and the Traffic Analysis webpage (https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineeringstandards/design-topics/traffic-analysis). Peak hour(s) – Report the delay for each alternative. Off-Peak – Report the delay for an additional time period representative of off-peak travel. Depending on location, up to 80% of total delay can occur in off-peak hours. If a traffic signal is under consideration, perform and report the findings of the signal warrant analysis. Safety Performance Analysis – See the Safety Analysis Guide for ICE safety analysis procedures.

Multimodal safety and operations – Briefly discuss how the design for each alternative is expected to affect applicable multimodal users. Potential items to consider include pedestrian delay, number of lanes to cross, protected vs permitted turning movements, motorist approach speed, speed differential of users, etc. When applicable, evaluate multimodal treatments that may be necessary for each alternative to meet the performance needs of each user type.
If a roundabout is determined to be the preferred alternative based on analysis conducted in Steps 1 through 3, contact the Region Traffic Engineer to determine if further alternative evaluation is required. Step 4: Alternatives Evaluation – Compare the alternatives based on their ability to
