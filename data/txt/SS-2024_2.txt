Saw cut slots will be required in the pavement to place the center of the dowel at middepth in the concrete slab. The completed slot shall provide a level, secure surface for the feet of the dowel bar chairs. Slots that intersect longitudinal or random cracks shall not be retrofitted. When gang saws are used, slots that are not used shall be cleaned and sealed with either Type I or IV epoxy resin as specified in Section 9-26. The transverse joint between cement concrete pavement and a Bridge approach slab shall not be retrofitted.
Saw cut slots shall be prepared such that dowel bars can be placed at the mid depth of the concrete slab, centered over the transverse joint, and parallel to the centerline and to the
Roadway surface.
Placement Tolerances for Dowel Bars 1. 2. 3. 4.

± 1 inch of the middle of the concrete slab depth. ± 1 inch of being centered over the transverse joint. ± ½ inch from parallel to the centerline. ± ½ inch from parallel to the Roadway surface.
If jackhammers are used to break loose the concrete they shall weigh less than 30 pounds.
All slot surfaces shall be cleaned to bare concrete by sand blasting. The cleaning shall remove all slurry, parting compound, and other foreign materials prior to installation of the dowel. Damage to the concrete shall be repaired by the Contractor at no cost to the Contracting Agency. Traffic shall not be allowed on slots where concrete has been removed.
Prior to placement, the dowel bars shall be lightly coated with a parting compound and placed on a chair that will provide a minimum of ½-inch clearance between the bottom of the dowel and the bottom of the slot.
The chair design shall hold the dowel bar tightly in place during placement of the concrete patching material. If the transverse joint or crack is open ¼ inch or more, the Contractor shall caulk the transverse joint or crack at the bottom and sides of the slot as shown in the Plans immediately prior to placement of the dowel bar and concrete patching material.
The caulking filler shall not be placed farther than ½ inch outside either side of the joint or crack. The transverse joint or crack shall be caulked sufficiently to satisfy the above requirements and to prevent the patching material from entering the joint/crack at the bottom or sides of the slot.
A ⅜-inch-thick foam insert shall be placed at the middle of the dowel to maintain the transverse joint. The foam insert shall fit tightly around the dowel and to the bottom and edges of the slot and extend to the top of the existing pavement surface. The foam insert shall be capable of remaining in a vertical position and held tightly to all edges during placement of the patch.

Provide HMA hauling equipment with tight, clean, smooth metal beds and a cover of canvas or other suitable material of sufficient size to protect the HMA from adverse weather. Securely attach the cover to protect the HMA whenever the weather conditions during the work shift include, or are forecast to include, precipitation or an air temperature less than 45°F.
Prevent HMA from adhering to the hauling equipment. Spray metal beds with an environmentally benign release agent. Drain excess release agent prior to filling hauling equipment with HMA. Do not use petroleum derivatives or other coating material that contaminate or alter the characteristics of the HMA. For hopper trucks, operate the conveyer during the process of applying the release agent. 5-04.3(3)C

Pavers
Use self-contained, power-propelled pavers provided with an internally heated vibratory screed that is capable of spreading and finishing courses of HMA in lane widths required by the paving section shown in the Plans.
When requested by the Engineer, provide written certification that the paver is equipped with the most current equipment available from the manufacturer for the prevention of segregation of the coarse aggregate particles. The certification shall list the make, model, and year of the paver and all equipment that has been retrofitted to the paver.
Operate the screed in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations and in a manner to produce a finished surface of the required evenness and texture without tearing, shoving, segregating, or gouging the mixture. Provide a copy of the manufacturer’s recommendations upon request by the Contracting Agency. Extensions to the screed will be allowed provided they produce the same results, including ride, density, and surface texture as obtained by the primary screed. In the Traveled Way do not use extensions without both augers and an internally heated vibratory screed.
Equip the paver with automatic screed controls and sensors. The controls shall be capable of sensing grade from an outside reference line, sensing the transverse slope of the screed, and providing automatic signals that operate the screed to maintain the desired grade and transverse slope. Construct the sensor so it will operate from a reference line or a mat referencing device. The transverse slope controller shall be capable of maintaining the screed at the desired slope within plus or minus 0.1 percent.
Page 5-32
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Hot Mix Asphalt 5-04
Equip the paver with automatic feeder controls, properly adjusted to maintain a uniform depth of material ahead of the screed.
Manual operation of the screed is permitted in the construction of irregularly shaped and minor areas. These areas include, but are not limited to, gore areas, road approaches, tapers and left-turn channelizations.
When specified in the Contract, provide reference lines for vertical control. Place reference lines on both outer edges of the Traveled Way of each Roadway. Horizontal control utilizing the reference line is permitted. Automatically control the grade and slope of intermediate lanes by means of reference lines or a mat referencing device and a slope control device. When the finish of the grade prepared for paving is superior to the established tolerances and when, in the opinion of the Engineer, further improvement to the line, grade, cross-section, and smoothness can best be achieved without the use of the reference line, a mat referencing device may be substituted for the reference line.
Substitution of the device will be subject to the continued approval of the Engineer. A joint matcher may be used subject to the approval of the Engineer. The reference line may be removed after completion of the first course of HMA when approved by the
Engineer. Whenever the Engineer determines that these methods are failing to provide the necessary vertical control, the reference lines will be reinstalled by the Contractor.
Furnish and install all pins, brackets, tensioning devices, wire, and accessories necessary for satisfactory operation of the automatic control equipment.
If the paving machine in use is not providing the required finish, the Engineer may suspend Work as allowed by Section 1-08.6. 5-04.3(3)D

Material Transfer Device or Material Transfer Vehicle
Use a material transfer device (MTD) or material transfer vehicle (MTV) to deliver the
HMA from the hauling equipment to the paving machine for all lifts in (or partially in) the top 0.30 feet of the pavement section used in traffic lanes. However, an MTD/V is not required for HMA placed in irregularly shaped and minor areas such as tapers and turn lanes, or for HMA mixture that is accepted by Visual Evaluation. At the Contractor’s request the Engineer may approve paving without an MTD/V; the Engineer will determine if an equitable adjustment in cost or time is due. If a windrow elevator is used, the
Engineer may limit the length of the windrow in urban areas or through intersections.
To be approved for use, an MTV: 1.
Shall be self-propelled vehicle, separate from the hauling vehicle or paver. 2.

Rollers

Operate rollers in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. When requested by the Engineer, provide a Type 1 Working Drawing of the manufacturer’s recommendation for the use of any roller planned for use on the project. Do not use rollers that crush aggregate, produce pickup or washboard, unevenly compact the surface, displace the mix, or produce other undesirable results. 5-04.3(4)
Preparation of Existing Paved Surfaces
Before constructing HMA on an existing paved surface, the entire surface of the pavement shall be clean. Entirely remove all fatty asphalt patches, grease drippings, and other deleterious substances from the existing pavement. Thoroughly clean all pavements or bituminous surfaces of dust, soil, pavement grindings, and other foreign matter.
Thoroughly remove all cleaning or solvent type liquids spilled on the pavement before paving proceeds. Fill all holes and small depressions with an appropriate class of HMA.
Level and thoroughly compact the surface of the patched area.
Apply a uniform coat of asphalt (tack coat) to all paved surfaces on which courses of HMA are to be placed or abutted. Apply tack coat to cover the cleaned existing pavement with a thin film of residual asphalt free of streaks and bare spots. Apply a heavy application of tack coat to all joints. For Roadways open to traffic, limit the application of tack coat to surfaces that will be paved during the same working shift. Equip the spreading equipment with a thermometer to indicate the temperature of the tack coat material.
Do not operate equipment on tacked surfaces until the tack has broken and cured. Repair tack coat damaged by the Contractor’s operation, prior to placement of the HMA.
Unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer, use cationic emulsified asphalt CSS-1, CSS-1h, or Performance Graded (PG) asphalt for tack coat. The CSS-1 and CSS-1h may be diluted with water at a rate not to exceed one part water to one part emulsified asphalt. Do not allow the tack coat material to exceed the maximum temperature recommended by the asphalt supplier.

Pavement Repair
Excavate pavement repair areas and backfill these with HMA in accordance with the details shown in the Plans and as staked. Conduct the excavation operations in a manner that will protect the pavement that is to remain. Repair pavement not designated to be removed that is damaged as a result of the Contractor’s operations to the satisfaction of the Engineer at no cost to the Contracting Agency. Excavate only within one lane at a time unless approved otherwise by the Engineer. Do not excavate more area than can be completely backfilled and compacted during the same shift.
Unless otherwise shown in the Plans or determined by the Engineer, excavate to a depth of 1.0 feet. The Engineer will make the final determination of the excavation depth required.
The minimum width of a pavement repair area shall be 40 inches unless shown otherwise in the Plans. Prior to excavation, sawcut the perimeter of the pavement area to be removed unless the pavement in the pavement repair area is to be removed by a pavement grinder.
Excavated materials shall be the property of the Contractor and shall be disposed of in a Contractor-provided site off the Right of Way or used in accordance with
Sections 2-02.3(3) or 9-03.21.
Apply a heavy application of tack coat to all surfaces of existing pavement in the pavement repair area, in accordance with Section 5-04.3(4).
Place the HMA backfill in lifts not to exceed 0.35-foot compacted depth. Thoroughly compact each lift by a mechanical tamper or a roller. 5-04.3(5)

Producing/Stockpiling Aggregates, RAP, & RAS
Produce aggregate in compliance with Section 3-01. Comply with Section 3-02 for preparing stockpile sites, stockpiling, and removing from stockpile each of the following: aggregates, RAP, and RAS. Provide sufficient storage space for each size of aggregate,
RAP and RAS. Fine aggregate or RAP may be uniformly blended with the RAS as a method of preventing the agglomeration of RAS particles. Remove the aggregates, RAP and RAS from stockpile(s) in a manner that ensures minimal segregation when being moved to the
HMA plant for processing into the final mixture. Keep different aggregate sizes separated until they have been delivered to the HMA plant.
When hydrated lime is required by use of the marination treatment, the aggregates shall be stockpiled in accordance with Section 5-04.3(3)A. 5-04.3(5)A
Stockpiling RAP or RAS for High RAP/Any RAS Mixes
Do not place any RAP or RAS into a stockpile which has been sequestered for a High
RAP/Any RAS mix design. Do not incorporate any RAP or RAS into a High RAP/Any RAS mixture from a source other than the stockpile which was sequestered for approval of that particular High RAP/Any RAS mix design.
RAP that is used in a Low RAP/No RAS mix is not required to come from a sequestered stockpile. 5-04.3(6)
Mixing

The asphalt supplier shall introduce recycling agent and anti-stripping additive, in the amount designated on the QPL for the mix design, into the asphalt binder prior to shipment to the asphalt mixing plant.
Anti-strip is not required for temporary work that will be removed prior to Physical
Completion.
Use asphalt binder of the grade, and from the supplier, in the approved mix design.
2024 Standard Specifications

Hot Mix Asphalt
Prior to introducing reclaimed materials into the asphalt plant, remove wire, nails, and other foreign material. Discontinue use of the reclaimed material if the Engineer, in their sole discretion, determines the wire, nails, or other foreign material to be excessive.
Size RAP and RAS prior to entering the mixer to provide uniform and thoroughly mixed
HMA. If there is evidence of the RAP or RAS not breaking down during the heating and mixing of the HMA, immediately suspend the use of the RAP or RAS until changes have been approved by the Engineer.
After the required amount of mineral materials, RAP, RAS, new asphalt binder and recycling agent have been introduced into the mixer, mix the HMA until complete and uniform coating of the particles and thorough distribution of the asphalt binder throughout the mineral materials, RAP and RAS is ensured.
Upon discharge from the mixer, ensure that the temperature of the HMA does not exceed the optimum mixing temperature shown on the accepted Mix Design Report by more than 25°F, or as allowed by the Engineer. When an additive is included in the manufacture of HMA, do not heat the additive (at any stage of production including in binder storage tanks) to a temperature higher than the maximum recommended by the manufacturer of the additive.
A maximum water content of 2 percent in the mix, at discharge, will be allowed providing the water causes no problems with handling, stripping, or flushing. If the water in the
HMA causes any of these problems, reduce the moisture content.
During the daily operation, HMA may be temporarily held in approved storage facilities.
Do not incorporate HMA into the Work that has been held for more than 24 hours after mixing. Provide an easily readable, low bin-level indicator on the storage facility that indicates the amount of material in storage. Waste the HMA in storage when the top level of HMA drops below the top of the cone of the storage facility, except as the storage facility is being emptied at the end of the working shift. Dispose of rejected or waste HMA at no expense to the Contracting Agency. 5-04.3(7)

Use HMA pavers complying with Section 5-04.3(3) to distribute the mix. On areas where irregularities or unavoidable obstacles make the use of mechanical spreading and finishing equipment impractical, the paving may be done with other equipment or by hand.
When more than one JMF is being utilized to produce HMA, place the material produced for each JMF with separate spreading and compacting equipment. Do not intermingle
HMA produced from more than one JMF. Each strip of HMA placed during a work shift shall conform to a single JMF established for the class of HMA specified unless there is a need to make an adjustment in the JMF. 5-04.3(8)
Aggregate Acceptance Prior to Incorporation in HMA
Sample aggregate for meeting the requirements of Section 3-04 prior to being incorporated into HMA.

M 41-10 Hot Mix Asphalt 5-04 in Section 3-04. Aggregate acceptance testing will be performed by the Contracting
Agency. Aggregate contributed from RAP and/or RAS will not be evaluated under
Section 3-04.
The Contracting Agency’s combined aggregate bulk specific gravity (Gsb) blend as shown on the HMA Mix Design will be used for VMA calculations until the Contractor submits a written request for a Gsb test. The new Gsb will be used in the VMA calculations for
HMA from the date the Project Engineer receives the written request for a Gsb retest.
The Contractor may request aggregate specific gravity (Gsb) testing be performed by the
Contracting Agency twice per project for the first 10,000 HMA tons produced, and once thereafter. The Gsb blend of the combined stockpiles will be used to calculate voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) of HMA produced after the new Gsb is determined.
For aggregate that will be used in HMA mixture which will be accepted by Statistical
Evaluation, the Contracting Agency’s acceptance of the aggregate will be based on: 1.

Samples taken prior to mixing with asphalt binder, RAP, or RAS; 2.
Testing for the materials properties of fracture, uncompacted void content, and sand equivalent; 3.
Evaluation by the Contracting Agency in accordance with Section 3-04, including price adjustments as described therein.

Test Point Evaluation of HMA Compaction is
Required For: • HMA not meeting the criteria for Statistical
Evaluation or Visual
Evaluation
1 This table applies to all HMA, and shall be the sole basis for determining the acceptance method for compaction.
The Contracting Agency may, at its sole discretion, evaluate HMA for compliance with the
Cyclic Density requirements of Section 5-04.3(10)B. 5-04.3(10)A
HMA Compaction – General Compaction Requirements
Immediately after the HMA has been spread and struck off, and after surface irregularities have been adjusted, thoroughly and uniformly compact the mix. The completed course shall be free from ridges, ruts, humps, depressions, objectionable marks, and irregularities and shall conform to the line, grade, and cross-section shown in the Plans. If necessary, alter the JMF in accordance with Section 9-03.8(7) to achieve desired results.
Compact the mix when it is in the proper condition so that no undue displacement, cracking, or shoving occurs. Compact areas inaccessible to large compaction equipment by mechanical or hand tampers. Remove HMA that becomes loose, broken, contaminated, shows an excess or deficiency of asphalt, or is in any way defective. Replace the removed material with new HMA, and compact it immediately to conform to the surrounding area.
The type of rollers to be used and their relative position in the compaction sequence shall generally be the Contractor’s option, provided the specified densities are attained.
An exception shall be that pneumatic tired rollers shall be used for compaction of the wearing course beginning October 1st of any year through March 31st of the following year. Coverage with a steel wheel roller may precede pneumatic tired rolling. Unless otherwise approved by the Engineer, operate rollers in the static mode when the internal temperature of the mix is less than 175°F. Regardless of mix temperature, do not operate a roller in a mode that results in checking or cracking of the mat.
On bridge decks and on roadway approaches within five feet of a bridge/back of pavement seat, rollers shall not be operated in a vibratory mode, defined as a mode in which the drum vibrates vertically. However, unless otherwise noted on the plans, rollers may be operated in an oscillatory mode, defined as a mode in which the drum vibrates in the horizontal direction only. 5-04.3(10)B

HMA Compaction – Cyclic Density
Low cyclic density areas are defined as spots or streaks in the pavement that are less than
90 percent of the theoretical maximum density. At the Engineer’s discretion, the Engineer may evaluate the HMA pavement for low cyclic density, and when doing so will follow
WSDOT SOP 733. A $500 Cyclic Density Price Adjustment will be assessed for a 500-foot section with two or more density readings below 90 percent of the theoretical maximum density.

HMA Compaction Acceptance – Statistical Evaluation
HMA compaction which is accepted by Statistical Evaluation will be based on acceptance testing performed by the Contracting Agency, and statistical analysis of those acceptance tests results. This will result in a Compaction Price Adjustment. 5-04.3(10)C1 HMA Compaction Statistical Evaluation – Lots and Sublots
HMA compaction which is accepted by Statistical Evaluation will be evaluated by the
Contracting Agency dividing the project into compaction lots, and each compaction lot will be evaluated using stratified random sampling by the Contracting Agency sub-dividing each compaction lot into compaction sublots. All mixture in any individual compaction lot shall be of the same mix design. The compaction sublots will be numbered in the order in which the mixture (of a particular mix design) is paved.
Except for the final compaction lot, each compaction lot comprises a maximum of 15 compaction sublots. The final compaction lot of each mix design on the Contract will comprises a maximum of 25 sublots. For contracts with a plan quantity less than 300 tons of statistically accepted HMA for compaction, the minimum number of compaction sublots shall be three.
Each compaction sublot shall be uniform in size as shown in Table 15, except that the last compaction sublot of each day may be increased to a maximum of two times the compaction sublot quantity calculated. Minor variations in the size of a sublot shall not be cause to invalidate the associated test result.

The following will cause one compaction lot to end prematurely and a new compaction lot to begin: • For a compaction lot in progress with a compaction CPF less than 0.75 using an LSL = 92.0, a new compaction lot will begin at the Contractor’s request after the Engineer is satisfied that material conforming to the Specifications can be produced. See also
Section 5-04.3(11)F.
All HMA which is paved on a bridge and accepted for compaction by Statistical Evaluation will compose a bridge compaction lot. If the contract includes such HMA on more than one bridge, compaction will be evaluated on each bridge individually, as separate bridge compaction lots.
Bridge compaction sublots will be determined by the Engineer subject to the following: • All sublots on a given bridge will be approximately the same size. • Sublots will be stratified from the lot. • In no case will there be less than 3 sublots in each bridge compaction lot. • No sublot will exceed 50 tons. • Compaction test locations will be determined by the Engineer in accordance with
WSDOT Test Method T 716.

Comply with Section 1-06.2(1).
The location of HMA compaction acceptance tests will be randomly selected by the
Contracting Agency from within each sublot, with one test per sublot. The Contracting
Agency will determine the random sample location using WSDOT Test Method T 716.
Use Table 16 to determine compaction acceptance test procedures and to allocate compaction acceptance sampling and testing responsibilities between the Contractor and the Contracting Agency. HMA cores shall be taken or nuclear density testing shall occur after completion of the finish rolling, prior to opening to traffic, and on the same day that the mix is placed.
When using the nuclear density gauge for acceptance testing of pavement density, the
Engineer will follow WSDOT SOP 730 for correlating the nuclear gauge with HMA cores.
When cores are required for the correlation, coring will be by the Contracting Agency unless the Contract includes the item "HMA Core - Roadway". Testing will be by the
Contracting Agency. When a core is taken for gauge correlation at the location of a sublot, the relative density of the core will be used for the sublot test result and is exempt from retesting. 5-04.3(10)C3 HMA Statistical Compaction – Price Adjustments
For each HMA compaction lot (that is accepted by Statistical Evaluation) which has less than three compaction sublots, for which all compaction sublots attain a minimum of 92 percent compaction determined in accordance with FOP for AASHTO T 355 (or
WSDOT SOP 736 when provided by the Contract), the HMA will be accepted at the unit
Contract price with no further evaluation.
For each HMA compaction lot (that is accepted by Statistical Evaluation) which does not meet the criteria in the preceding paragraph, the compaction lot shall be evaluated in accordance with Section 1-06.2(2)D4 to determine the appropriate Composite Pay
Factor (CPF). All of the test results obtained from the acceptance samples from a given compaction lot shall be evaluated collectively. Additional testing by either a nuclear density gauge or cores will be completed as required to provide a minimum of three tests for evaluation.

For a compaction sublot that has been tested with a nuclear density gauge that did not meet the minimum of 92.0 percent of the theoretical maximum density in a compaction lot with a CPF below 1.00 and thus subject to a price reduction or rejection, the
Contractor may request that a core, taken at the same location as the nuclear density test, be used for determination of the relative density of the compaction sublot. The relative density of the core will replace the relative density determined by the nuclear density gauge for the compaction sublot and will be used for calculation of the CPF and acceptance of HMA compaction lot. When cores are taken at the request of the
Contractor, they shall be requested by noon of the next workday after the test results for the compaction sublot have been provided or made available to the Contractor. Traffic control shall be provided by the Contractor as requested by the Engineer. Failure by the
Contractor to provide the requested traffic control will result in forfeiture of the request for retesting. When the CPF for the compaction lot based on the results of the cores is less than 1.00, the Contracting Agency will deduct the cost for the coring from monies due or that may become due the Contractor. When the Contracting Agency performs the core sampling, the Contracting Agency will deduct $200 per core from monies due. When the Contractor performs the core sampling, it will be at their expense and no payment will be made under the HMA Core item. In either case, the Contractor shall pay for the cost of the traffic control. 5-04.3(10)D
HMA Compaction – Visual Evaluation

Visual Evaluation will be the basis of acceptance for compaction of the Bid items “HMA for Pavement Repair Cl. ___ PG ___” and “HMA for Prelevelling Class___ PG___”. This HMA shall be thoroughly compacted to the satisfaction of the Engineer. HMA that is used to prelevel wheel ruts shall be compacted with a pneumatic tire roller. 5-04.3(10)E
HMA Compaction – Test Point Evaluation
When compaction acceptance is by Test Point Evaluation, compact HMA based on a test point evaluation of the compaction train. Perform the test point evaluation in accordance with instructions from the Engineer. The number of passes with an approved compaction train, required to attain the maximum test point density, shall be used on all subsequent paving. 5-04.3(10)F

Rejection Without Testing (Mixture or Compaction)
The Engineer may, without sampling, reject all batches, loads, or sections of Roadway that appears defective. Material rejected before placement shall not be incorporated into the pavement.
No payment will be made for the rejected materials or the removal of the materials unless the Contractor requests the rejected material to be tested. If the Contractor requests testing, acceptance will be by Statistical Evaluation, and a minimum of three samples will be obtained and tested. When uncompacted material is required for testing but not available, the Engineer will determine random sample locations on the roadway in accordance with WSDOT Test Method T 716, take cores in accordance with WSDOT
SOP 734, and test the cores in accordance with WSDOT SOP 737.
If the CPF for the rejected material is less than 0.75, no payment will be made for the rejected material; in addition, the cost of sampling and testing shall be borne by the
Contractor. If the CPF is greater than or equal to 0.75, the cost of sampling and testing will be borne by the Contracting Agency. If the material is rejected before placement and the CPF is greater than or equal to 0.75, compensation for the rejected material will be at a CPF of 0.75. If rejection occurs after placement and the CPF is greater than or equal to 0.75, compensation for the rejected material will be at the calculated CPF with an addition of 25 percent of the unit Contract price added for the cost of removal and disposal. 5-04.3(11)D

Rejection – A Partial Sublot (Mixture or Compaction)
In addition to the random acceptance sampling and testing, the Engineer may also isolate from a mixture or compaction sublot material that is suspected of being defective in relative density, gradation or asphalt binder content. Such isolated material will not include an original sample location. The Contracting Agency will obtain a minimum of three random samples of the suspect material and perform the testing. When uncompacted material is required for testing but is not available, the Engineer will select random sample locations on the roadway in accordance with WSDOT Test Method
T 716, take cores samples in accordance with WSDOT SOP 734, and test the material in accordance with WSDOT SOP 737. The material will then be statistically evaluated as an independent lot in accordance with Section 1-06.2(2). 5-04.3(11)E
Rejection – An Entire Sublot (Mixture or Compaction)
An entire mixture or compaction sublot that is suspected of being defective may be rejected. When this occurs, a minimum of two additional random samples from this sublot will be obtained. When uncompacted material is required for the additional samples but the material has been compacted, the Contracting Agency will take and test cores from the roadway as described in Section 5-04.3(11)D. The additional samples and the original sublot will be evaluated as an independent lot in accordance with Section 1-06.2(2). 5-04.3(11)F
Rejection - A Lot in Progress (Mixture or Compaction)
The Contractor shall shut down operations and shall not resume HMA placement until such time as the Engineer is satisfied that material conforming to the Specifications can be produced when: 1. the Composite Pay Factor (CPF) of a mixture or compaction lot in progress drops below 1.00 and the Contractor is taking no corrective action, or 2. the Pay Factor (PFi) for any constituent of a mixture or compaction lot in progress drops below 0.95 and the Contractor is taking no corrective action, or 3. either the PFi for any constituent or the CPF of a mixture or compaction lot in progress is less than 0.75. 5-04.3(11)G

When compressive strengths fail to satisfy one or both of the above requirements, the
Contractor may request acceptance of in-place concrete strength based on core results.
This method will not be used if the Engineer determines coring would be harmful to the integrity of the Structure. Cores, if allowed, will be obtained by the Contractor in accordance with FOP for AASHTO T 24 and delivered to the Contracting Agency for testing in accordance with AASHTO T 22. If the concrete in the Structure will be dry under service conditions, the core will be air-dried at a temperature of between 60°F and 80°F and at a relative humidity of less than 60 percent for 7 days before testing, and will be tested air dry.
Acceptance for each sublot by the core method requires that the average compressive strength of three cores be at least 85 percent of the specified strength with no one core less than 75 percent of the specified strength. When the Contractor requests strength analysis by coring, the results obtained will be accepted by both parties as conclusive and supersede all other strength data for the concrete sublot.
If the Contractor elects to core, cores shall be obtained no later than 50 days after initial concrete placement. The Engineer will concur in the locations to be cored. Repair of cored areas shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. The cost incurred in coring and testing these cores, including repair of core locations, shall be borne by the Contractor. 5-05.3(5)

Ready-mixed concrete shall be mixed and delivered in accordance with the requirements of Sections 6-02.3(4), 6-02.3(4)A, and 6-02.3(4)B.
When mixed in a batching plant, the mixing time shall not be less than 50 seconds nor more than 90 seconds.
The mixer shall be operated at a drum speed as shown on the manufacturer’s nameplate on the mixer. Concrete mixed less than the specified time shall be discarded and disposed of by the Contractor at no expense to the Contracting Agency. The volume of concrete mixed per batch shall not exceed the mixer’s rated capacity, as shown on the manufacturer’s standard rating plate on the mixer.
Each concrete mixing machine shall be equipped with a device for counting automatically the number of batches mixed during the day’s operation.
Retempering concrete by adding water or by other means will not be permitted. 5-05.3(5)A
Limitations of Mixing
Concrete shall not be mixed, placed, or finished when the natural light is inadequate, as determined by the Engineer, unless an adequate and approved artificial lighting system is operated.
Mixing and placing concrete shall be discontinued when a descending air temperature in the shade away from artificial heat reaches 40ºF and shall not be resumed until an ascending air temperature in the shade and away from artificial heat reaches 35ºF unless authorized in writing by the Engineer.
When mixing and placing is authorized during cold weather, the aggregates may be heated by either steam or dry heat prior to being placed in the mixer. The apparatus used shall heat the mass uniformly and shall be arranged to preclude the possible occurrence of overheated areas which might injure the materials. Unless otherwise authorized, the temperature of the mixed concrete shall be not less than 50ºF and not more than 90ºF at the time of discharge into the hauling conveyance.

Slip-Form Construction
The concrete shall be distributed uniformly into final position by a self-propelled slip-form paver without delay. The alignment and elevation of the paver shall be regulated from outside reference lines established for this purpose, or by an electronic control system capable of controlling the line and grade within required tolerances. The paver shall vibrate the concrete for the full width and depth of the strip of pavement being placed and the vibration shall be adequate to provide a consistency of concrete that will stand normal to the surface with sharp well-defined edges. The sliding forms shall be rigidly held together laterally to prevent spreading of the forms.
The plastic concrete shall be effectively consolidated by internal vibration with transverse vibrating units for the full width of pavement and/or a series of equally spaced longitudinal vibrating units. The space from the outer edge of the pavement to the outer longitudinal unit shall not exceed 9 inches. The spacing of internal units shall be uniform and not exceed 18 inches.
The term internal vibration means vibration by vibrating units located within the specified thickness of pavement section.
The rate of vibration of each vibrating unit shall be not less than 7,500 cycles per minute, and the amplitude of vibration shall be sufficient to be perceptible on the surface of the concrete along the entire length of the vibrating unit and for a distance of at least 1 foot.
The frequency of vibration or amplitude shall be varied proportionately with the rate of travel to result in a uniform density and air content. The paving machine shall be equipped with a tachometer or other suitable device for measuring and indicating the actual frequency of vibrations.
The concrete shall be held at a uniform consistency. The slip-form paver shall be operated with as nearly a continuous forward movement as possible and all operations of mixing, delivering, and spreading concrete shall be coordinated to provide uniform progress with stopping and starting of the paver held to a minimum.

Surface Smoothness

Pavement surface smoothness for this project will include International Roughness Index (IRI) testing. The Contractor shall perform IRI testing on each through lane, climbing lane, and passing lane, greater than 0.25 mile in length and these lanes will be subject to incentive/disincentive adjustments. Ride quality will be evaluated using the Mean
Roughness Index (MRI) calculated by averaging the IRI data for the left and right wheel path within the section.
Ramps, shoulders and tapers will not be included in MRI testing for pavement smoothness and will not be subject to incentive adjustments. All Work is subject to parallel and transverse 10-foot straightedge requirements, corrective work and disincentive adjustments.
Operate the inertial profiler in accordance with AASHTO R 57. Collect two longitudinal traces, one in each wheel path. Collect profile data after completion of all concrete paving on the project in a continuous pass including areas excluded from pay adjustments.
Provide notice to the Engineer a minimum of seven calendar days prior to testing.
Within 30 calendar days after the Contractor’s testing, the Engineer may perform verification testing. If the verification testing shows a difference in MRI greater than the percentages shown in Table 2 of AASHTO R 54 the following resolution process will be followed: 1.
The profiles, equipment and procedures will be evaluated to determine the cause of the difference. 2.
If the cause of the discrepancy cannot be resolved the pavement shall be retested with both profilers at a mutually agreed time. The two profilers will test the section within 30 minutes of each other.

Corrective work for pavement smoothness may be taken by the Contractor prior to
MRI testing. After completion of the MRI testing the Contractor shall measure the smoothness of each 52.8-foot section with an MRI greater than 125 inches per mile with a 10-foot straightedge within 14 calendar days or as allowed by the Engineer. The
Contractor shall identify all locations that require corrective work and provide the straight edge measurements at each location that exceeds the allowable limit to the Engineer.
If all measurements in a 52.8-foot section comply with smoothness requirements, the
Contractor shall provide the maximum measurement to the Engineer and a statement that corrective work is not required. Unless allowed by the Engineer, corrective work shall be taken by the Contractor for pavement identified by the Contractor or Engineer that does not meet the following requirements: 1.

The completed surface shall be of uniform texture, smooth, uniform as to crown and grade, and free from defects of all kinds. 2.
The completed surface shall not vary more than ⅛ inch from the lower edge of a 10-foot straightedge placed on the surface parallel to the centerline. 3.

For repairs following MRI testing the repaired area shall be checked by the Contractor with a 10-foot straightedge to ensure it no longer requires corrective work. With concurrence of the Engineer an inertial profiler may be used in place of the 10-foot straight edge.
If correction of the roadway as listed above either will not or does not produce satisfactory results as to smoothness or serviceability the Engineer may accept the completed pavement and a credit will be calculated in accordance with Section 5-05.5.
The credit will be in addition to the price adjustment for MRI. Under these circumstances, the decision whether to accept the completed pavement or to require corrective work as described above shall be vested entirely in the Engineer. 5-05.3(13)
Curing
Immediately after the finishing operations have been completed and as soon as marring of the concrete will not occur, the entire surface of the newly placed concrete shall be cured in accordance with one of the following methods the Contractor may elect. 5-05.3(13)A
Curing Compound
Liquid membrane-forming concrete curing compound Type 2 meeting the requirements of
Section 9-23.2 shall be applied to the entire area of the exposed surface of the concrete with an approved mechanical spray machine. The spray fog shall be protected from the wind with an adequate shield. It shall be applied uniformly at the rate of one gallon to not more than 150-square feet.

2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Cement Concrete Pavement 5-05
Before placing the curing compound in the spray tank, it shall be thoroughly agitated as recommended by the Manufacturer. The compound shall not be diluted by the addition of solvents nor be altered in any manner. If the compound has become chilled to the extent that it is too viscous for proper stirring or application or if portions of the vehicle have been precipitated from solution, it shall be heated to restore proper fluidity but it shall not be heated above 100ºF. All curing compound shall have approval prior to placing in the spray tanks.
The curing compound shall be applied immediately after the concrete has been finished and after bleed water that has collected on the surface has disappeared, or at a time designated by the Engineer. If hair checking develops in the pavement before finishing is completed, the Engineer may order the application of the curing compound at an earlier stage, in which event any concrete cut from the surface in finishing operations shall be removed entirely from the pavement. If additional mortar is then needed to fill torn areas, it shall be obtained ahead of the spraying operations. All areas cut by finishing tools subsequent to the application of the curing compound shall immediately be given new applications at the rate specified above.
The curing compound, after application, shall be protected by the Contractor from injury until the pavement has reached a minimum compressive strength of 2,500 psi.
All traffic, either by foot or otherwise, shall be considered as injurious to the film of the applied compound.
The Contractor shall provide on the job a sufficient quantity of white polyethylene sheeting to cover all the pavement laid in 3 hours of maximum operation. This sheeting shall be reserved exclusively for the protection of the pavement in case of rain or breakdown of the spray equipment used for applying the curing compound. The protective sheeting shall be placed over the pavement when ordered, and in the manner specified by the Engineer.
Areas from which it is impossible to exclude traffic shall be protected by a covering of sand or earth not less than 1 foot in thickness or by other suitable and effective means.
The protective covering shall be placed no earlier than 24 hours after application of the compound.
The Contractor shall assume all liabilities for and protect the Contracting Agency from any damages or claims arising from the use of materials or processes described herein. 5-05.3(13)B

White Polyethylene Sheeting
The sheeting shall be placed over the pavement immediately after finishing operations are completed, or at a time designated by the Engineer.
The sheeting shall be laid so that individual sheets overlap at least 2 feet, and the lapped areas shall be held in close contact with the pavement by weighting with earth or boards to prevent movement by the wind. The sheeting shall extend downward to cover the edges of the pavement and shall be secured to the Subgrade with a continuous bank of earth or surfacing material. All holes occurring in the sheeting shall be patched. The sheeting shall be maintained against injury and remain in place until the pavement has reached a minimum compressive strength of 2,500 psi. 5-05.3(13)C
Wet Curing
Wet curing shall be accomplished by applying a continuous fog or mist spray to the entire pavement surface until it has reached a minimum compressive strength of 2,500 psi. If water runoff is not a concern, continuous sprinkling is acceptable. Sprinkling shall not begin until the concrete has achieved initial set as determined by AASHTO T 197 or other approved method.

Qualification of Concrete Suppliers
Batch Plant Prequalification requires a certification by the National Ready Mix Concrete
Association (NRMCA). Information concerning NRMCA certification may be obtained from the NRMCA at 900 Spring Street, Silver Springs, MD 20910 or online at www. nrmca.org. The NRMCA certification shall be valid for a 2-year period from the date of certificate. The following documentation shall be submitted to the Engineer; a copy of the current NRMCA Certificate of Conformance, the concrete mix design(s) (WSDOT
Form 350-040), along with copies of the truck list, batch plant scale certification, admixture dispensing certification, and volumetric water batching devices (including water meters) verification.
For central-mixed concrete, the mixer shall be equipped with a timer that prevents the batch from discharging until the batch has been mixed for the prescribed mixing time. A mixing time of 1 minute will be required after all materials and water have been introduced into the drum. Shorter mixing time may be allowed if the mixer performance is tested in accordance with (AASHTO M157 Annex A1 Concrete Uniformity Requirements).
Tests shall be conducted by an independent testing lab or by a commercial concrete producer’s lab. If the tests are performed by a producer’s lab, the Engineer or a representative will witness all testing.
For shrink-mixed concrete, the mixing time in the stationary mixer shall not be less than
30 seconds or until the ingredients have been thoroughly blended.
For transit-mixed or shrink-mixed concrete, the mixing time in the transit mixer shall be a minimum of 70 revolutions at the mixing speed designated by the manufacturer of the mixer. Following mixing, the concrete in the transit mixer may be agitated at the manufacturer’s designated agitation speed. A maximum of 320 revolutions (total of mixing and agitation) will be permitted prior to discharge.
All transit-mixers shall be equipped with an operational revolution counter and a functional device for measurement of water added. All mixing drums shall be free of concrete buildup and the mixing blades shall meet the minimum Specifications of the drum manufacturer. A copy of the manufacturer’s blade dimensions and configuration shall be on file at the concrete producer’s office. A clearly visible metal data plate (or plates) attached to each mixer and agitator shall display: (1) the maximum concrete capacity of the drum or container for mixing and agitating, and (2) the rotation speed of the drum or blades for both the agitation and mixing speeds. Mixers and agitators shall always operate within the capacity and speed-of-rotation limits set by the manufacturer.
Mixers, when fully loaded, shall keep the concrete uniformly mixed. All mixers and agitators shall be capable of discharging the concrete at a steady rate. Only those transitmixers which meet the above requirements will be allowed to deliver concrete to a
Contracting Agency project covered by these Specifications.
In transit-mixing, mixing shall begin within 30 seconds after the cement is added to the aggregates.
Central-mixed concrete, transported by truck mixer/agitator, shall not undergo more than
250 revolutions of the drum or blades before beginning discharging. To remain below this limit, the suppler may agitate the concrete intermittently within the prescribed time limit. When water or admixtures are added after the load is initially mixed, an additional
30 revolutions will be required at the recommended mixing speed.
For each project, at least biannually, or as required, the Plant Manager will examine mixers and agitators to check for buildup of hardened concrete or worn blades. If this

Concrete Structures examination reveals a problem, or if the Engineer wishes to test the quality of the concrete, slump tests may be performed with samples taken at approximately the ¼ and ¾ points as the batch is discharged. The maximum allowable slump difference shall be as follows:
If the average of the two slump tests is < 4 inches, the difference shall be < 1 inch or if the average of the two slump tests is >4 inches, the difference shall be < 1½ inches.
If the slump difference exceeds these limits, the equipment shall not be used until the faulty condition is corrected. However, the equipment may continue in use if longer mixing times or smaller loads produce batches that pass the slump uniformity tests.
All concrete production facilities will be subject to verification inspections at the discretion of the Engineer. Verification inspections are a check for: current scale certifications; accuracy of water metering devices; accuracy of the batching process; and verification of coarse aggregate quality.
If the concrete producer fails to pass the verification inspection, the following actions will be taken: 1.
For the first violation, a written warning will be provided. 2.
For the second violation, the Engineer will give written notification and the
Contracting Agency will assess a price reduction equal to 15 percent of the invoice cost of the concrete that is supplied from the time of the infraction until the deficient condition is corrected.

3.
For the third violation, the concrete supplier is suspended from providing concrete until all such deficiencies causing the violation have been permanently corrected and the plant and equipment have been reinspected and meets all the prequalification requirements. 4.
For the fourth violation, the concrete supplier shall be disqualified from supplying concrete for 1 year from the date of disqualification. At the end of the suspension period the concrete supplier may request that the facilities be inspected for prequalification. 6-02.3(4)B

A sublot is defined as the material represented by an individual strength test. An individual strength test is the average compressive strength of cylinders from the same sample of material.
Each sublot will be deemed to have met the specified compressive strength requirement when both of the following conditions are met: 1.
Individual strength tests do not fall below the specified strength by more than 12½ percent or 500 psi, whichever is least. 2.
An individual strength test averaged with the two preceding individual strength tests meets or exceeds specified strength (for the same class and exact mix I.D. of concrete on the same Contract).
When compressive strengths fail to satisfy one or both of the above requirements, the
Contractor may: 1. 2.
Request acceptance based on the Contractor/Suppliers strength test data for cylinders made from the same truckload of concrete as the Contracting Agency cylinders; provided: a.

The Contractor’s test results are obtained from testing cylinders fabricated, handled, and stored for 28 days in accordance with FOP for AASHTO R 100 and tested in accordance with AASHTO T 22. The test cylinders shall be the same size cylinders as those cast by the Contracting Agency. b.
The technician fabricating the cylinders is qualified by either ACI, Grade 1 or
WAQTC to perform this Work. c.
The Laboratory performing the tests in accordance with AASHTO T 22 has an equipment calibration/certification system, and a technician training and evaluation process in accordance with AASHTO R-18. d.
Both the Contractor and Contracting Agency have at least 15 test results from the same mix to compare. The Contractor’s results could be used if the
Contractor’s computed average of all their test results is within one standard deviation of the Contracting Agency’s average test result. The computed standard deviation of the Contractor’s results must also be within plus or minus 200 psi of the Contracting Agency’s standard deviation.
Request acceptance of in-place concrete strength based on core results. This method will not be used if the Engineer determines coring would be harmful to the integrity of the Structure. Cores, if allowed, will be obtained by the Contractor in accordance with
AASHTO T 24 and delivered to the Contracting Agency for testing in accordance with
AASHTO T 22. If the concrete in the Structure will be dry under service conditions, the core will be air dried at a temperature of between 60°F and 80°F and at a relative humidity of less than 60 percent for 7 days before testing, and will be tested air dry.
Acceptance for each sublot by the core method requires that the average compressive strength of three cores be at least 85 percent of the specified strength with no one core less than 75 percent of the specified strength. When the Contractor requests strength analysis by coring, the results obtained will be accepted by both parties as conclusive and supersede all other strength data for the concrete sublot.
If the Contractor elects to core, cores shall be obtained no later than 50 days after initial concrete placement. The Engineer will concur in the locations to be cored. Repair of cored areas shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. The cost incurred in coring and testing these cores, including repair of core locations, shall be borne by the Contractor.

The Contractor shall submit Type 2 Working Drawings consisting of formwork and reinforcement details of the test section and SCC placement procedures.
After removing the forms, the test section will be inspected for signs of honeycombs, cracks, aggregate segregation, sedimentation, cold joints, and other surface and concrete placement defects. If such defects are present, the Contractor shall revise the formwork and SCC placement procedures as necessary to eliminate such defects.
Acceptance of the test section and the SCC mix design is contingent on acceptable visual inspection, and a minimum of two 4-inch minimum diameter core samples taken from the placement location and the furthest-most limits of the concrete as identified by the
Engineer. The number of core locations will be specified by the Engineer. The difference in average unit weight of the locations represented by the core samples shall be less than 5-percent.

Placing Concrete
The Contractor shall not place concrete: 1.
On frozen or ice-coated ground or Subgrade; 2.
Against or on ice-coated forms, reinforcing steel, structural steel, conduits, precast members, or construction joints; 3.
Under rainy conditions; placing of concrete shall be stopped before the quantity of surface water is sufficient to affect or damage surface mortar quality or cause a flow or wash the concrete surface; 4.
In a foundation until the Engineer has accepted its depth and characteristics; 5.
Until the Engineer has accepted the form and the placement of installed reinforcing; or 6.
In a Work area when vibrations from nearby Work may harm the concrete’s initial set or strength.
When a foundation excavation contains water, the Contractor shall pump it dry before placing concrete. If this is impossible, an underwater concrete seal shall be placed that complies with Section 6-02.3(6)B. This seal shall be thick enough to resist uplift.
All foundations, forms, and contacting concrete surfaces shall be moistened with water just before the concrete is placed. Standing water on the foundation, concrete surface, or forms shall be removed.
The Contractor shall place concrete in the forms as soon as possible after mixing. The concrete shall always be plastic and workable. For this reason, the Engineer may reduce the time to discharge even further. Concrete placement shall be continuous, with no interruption longer than 30 minutes between adjoining layers unless the Engineer allows a longer time. The Type 2 Working Drawing submittal shall include justification that the concrete mix design will remain fluid for interruptions longer than 30 minutes between placements. Each layer shall be placed and consolidated before the preceding layer takes initial set. After initial set, the forms shall not be jarred, and projecting ends of reinforcing bars shall not be disturbed.
In girders or walls, concrete shall be placed in continuous, horizontal layers 1½ to 2½ feet deep. Compaction shall leave no line of separation between layers. In each part of a form, the concrete shall be deposited as near its final position as possible.
Methods for placing and consolidating concrete shall not segregate aggregates or displace reinforcing steel. Methods shall leave a compact, dense, and impervious concrete with smooth faces on exposed surfaces. Plastering is not permitted. Defective concrete shall be removed at the Contractor’s expense.

Concrete Structures
To prevent aggregates from separating, the conveyor belt used to transport concrete shall not exceed 300 feet in length. If the mix needs protection from sun or rain, the Contractor shall cover the belt. When concrete pumps are used for placement, a Contractor’s representative shall, prior to use on the first placement of each day, visually inspect the pumps water chamber for water leakage. No pump shall be used that allows free water to flow past the piston.
If a concrete pump is used as the placing system, the pump priming slurry shall be discarded before placement. Initial acceptance testing may be delayed until the pump priming slurry has been eliminated from the concrete being pumped. Eliminating the priming slurry from the concrete may require that several cubic yards of concrete are discharged through the pumping system and discarded. Use of a concrete pump requires a reserve pump (or other backup equipment) at the site.
If the concrete will drop more than 5 feet, it shall be deposited through a sheet metal (or other accepted) conduit. If the form slopes, the concrete shall be lowered through accepted conduit to keep it from sliding down one side of the form. No aluminum conduits or tremies shall be used to pump or place concrete. If aluminum concrete truck end chutes are used, concrete shall be continuously discharged in a manner that minimizes contact time between the concrete and the chute.
Before placing bridge deck concrete on steel spans, the Contractor shall release the falsework under the bridge and let the span swing free on its supports. Concrete in flat slab bridges shall be placed in one continuous operation for each span or series of continuous spans.
Concrete for bridge decks and the stems of T-beams or box-girders shall be placed in separate operations if the stem of the beam or girder is more than 3 feet deep. First the beam or girder stem shall be filled to the bottom of the slab fillets. Bridge deck concrete shall not be placed until enough time has passed to permit the earlier concrete to shrink (at least 12 hours). If stem depth is 3 feet or less, the Contractor may place concrete in
1 continuous operation if the Engineer concurs.
Between expansion or construction joints, concrete in beams, girders, bridge decks, piers, columns, walls, and traffic and pedestrian barriers shall be placed in a continuous operation.
After the concrete has been consolidated and prior to the application of cure, all surfaces of concrete that are not placed against forms shall be struck off to the planned elevation or slope and the surface shall be finished by floating with a float to seal the surface.
No traffic or pedestrian barrier shall be placed until after the bridge deck is complete for the entire Structure. No concrete barriers shall be placed until the falsework has been released and the span supports itself. The Contractor may choose not to release the deck overhang falsework prior to the barrier placement. The Contractor shall submit a Type 2E
Working Drawing consisting of calculations indicating the loads induced into the girder webs due to the barrier weight and all live loads placed on the Structure do not exceed the design capacity of the girder component. This analysis is not required for bridges with concrete Superstructures. No barrier, curb, or sidewalk shall be placed on steel or prestressed concrete girder bridges until the bridge deck reaches a compressive strength of at least 3,000 psi.
The Contractor may construct traffic and pedestrian barriers by the slipform method.
However, the barrier may not deviate more than ¼ inch when measured by a 10-foot straightedge held longitudinally on the front face, back face, and top surface. Electrical conduit within the barrier shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements of
Section 8-20.3(5).
When placing concrete in arch rings, the Contractor shall ensure that the load on the falsework remains symmetrical and uniform.

Unless otherwise allowed by the Engineer, arch ribs in open spandrel arches shall be placed in sections. Small key sections between large sections shall be filled after the large sections have shrunk. 6-02.3(6)A
Weather and Temperature Limits to Protect Concrete 6-02.3(6)A1
Hot Weather Protection
The Contractor shall provide concrete within the specified temperature limits. Cooling of the coarse aggregate piles by sprinkling with water is permitted provided the moisture content is monitored, the mixing water is adjusted for the free water in the aggregate and the coarse aggregate is removed from at least 1 foot above the bottom of the pile.
Sprinkling of fine aggregate piles with water is not allowed. Refrigerating mixing water, or replacing all or part of the mixing water with crushed ice is permitted, provided the ice is completely melted by placing time.
If air temperature exceeds 90°F, the Contractor shall use water spray or other accepted methods to cool all concrete-contact surfaces to less than 90°F. These surfaces include forms, reinforcing steel, steel beam flanges, and any others that touch the concrete. 6-02.3(6)A2
Cold Weather Protection
Concrete shall be maintained at or above a temperature of 40°F during the first seven days of the Cold Weather Protection Period and at or above a temperature of 35°F during the remainder of the Cold Weather Protection Period. Cold weather protection requirements do not apply to concrete in shafts and piles placed below the ground line.
Prior to placing concrete in cold weather, the Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working
Drawing with a written procedure for cold weather concreting. The procedure shall detail how the Contractor will adequately cure the concrete and prevent the concrete temperature from falling below the minimum temperature. Extra protection shall be provided for areas especially vulnerable to freezing (such as exposed top surfaces, corners and edges, thin sections, and concrete placed into steel forms). Concrete placement will only be allowed if the Contractor’s cold weather protection plan has been accepted by the Engineer.
Prior to concrete placement, the Contractor shall review the 7-day temperature predictions for the job site from the Western Region Headquarters of the National
Weather Service (www.wrh.noaa.gov). When temperatures below 35°F are predicted, the
Contractor shall: 1.

Install temperature sensors in each concrete placement. One sensor shall be installed for every 100 cubic yards of concrete placed. Sensors shall be installed at locations directed by the Engineer, and shall be placed 1.5 inches from the face of concrete. 2.
Immediately after concrete placement, temperature sensors shall be installed on the concrete surface at locations directed by the Engineer. One sensor shall be installed for every 100 cubic yards of concrete placed.
Temperatures shall be measured and recorded a minimum of every hour for the duration of the Cold Weather Protection Period. Temperature data shall be submitted to the
Engineer as a Type 1 Working Drawing within three days following the end of the Cold
Weather Protection Period.
For each day that the concrete temperature falls below 40°F during the first seven days of the Cold Weather Protection Period, no curing time is awarded for that day and the Cold
Weather Protection Period is extended for one additional day. If the concrete temperature falls below 35°F during the Cold Weather Protection Period, the concrete may be rejected by the Engineer.

Placing Concrete in Foundation Seals
If the Plans require a concrete seal, the Contractor shall place the concrete underwater inside a watertight cofferdam, tube, or caisson. Seal concrete shall be placed in a compact mass in still water. It shall remain undisturbed and in still water until fully set. While seal concrete is being deposited, the water elevation inside and outside the cofferdam shall remain equal to prevent any flow through the seal in either direction. The cofferdam shall be vented at the vent elevation shown in the Plans. The thickness of the seal is based upon this vent elevation.
The seal shall be at least 18 inches thick unless the Plans show otherwise. The Engineer may change the seal thickness during construction which may require redesign of the footing and the pier shaft or column. Although seal thickness changes may result in the use of more or less concrete, reinforcing steel, and excavation, payment will remain as originally defined in unit Contract prices.
To place seal concrete underwater, the Contractor shall use a concrete pump or tremie.
The tremie shall have a hopper at the top that empties into a watertight tube at least
10 inches in diameter. The discharge end of the tube on the tremie or concrete pump shall include a device to seal out water while the tube is first filled with concrete. Tube supports shall permit the discharge end to move freely across the entire Work area and to drop rapidly to slow or stop the flow. One tremie may be used to concrete an area up to
18 feet per side. Each additional area of this size requires one additional tremie.
Throughout the underwater concrete placement operation, the discharge end of the tube shall remain submerged in the concrete and the tube shall always contain enough concrete to prevent water from entering. The concrete placement shall be continuous until the Work is completed, resulting in a seamless, uniform seal. If the concreting operation is interrupted, the Engineer may require the Contractor to prove by core drilling or other tests that the seal contains no voids or horizontal joints. If testing reveals voids or joints, the Contractor shall repair them or replace the seal at no expense to the
Contracting Agency. requirements of Section 6-02.3(4)C. 6-02.3(6)C

Dewatering Concrete Seals and Foundations
After a concrete seal is constructed, the Contractor shall pump the water out of the cofferdam and place the rest of the concrete in the dry. This pumping shall not begin until the seal has set enough to withstand the hydrostatic pressure (3 days for gravity seals and 10 days for seals containing piling or shafts). The Engineer may extend these waiting periods to ensure structural safety or to meet a condition of the operating permit.
If weighted cribs are used to resist hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of the seal, the
Contractor shall anchor them to the foundation seal. Any method used (such as dowels or keys) shall transfer the entire weight of the crib to the seal.
No pumping shall be done during or for 24 hours after concrete placement unless done from a suitable sump separated from the concrete Work by a watertight wall. Pumping shall be done in a way that rules out any chance of concrete being carried away. 6-02.3(6)D
Protection Against Vibration
Freshly placed concrete shall not be subjected to excessive vibration and shock waves during the curing period until it has reached a 2,000 psi minimum compressive strength for structural concrete and lower-strength classes of concrete.
After the first 5 hours from the time the concrete has been placed and consolidated, the
Contractor shall keep all vibration producing operations at a safe horizontal distance from the freshly placed concrete by following either the prescriptive safe distance method or the monitoring safe distance method. These requirements for the protection of freshly

After the concrete has reached a minimum compressive strength specified above, the safe horizontal distance restrictions would no longer apply. 6-02.3(6)D2
Monitoring Safe Distance Method
The Contractor may monitor the vibration producing operations in order to decrease the safe horizontal distance requirements of the prescriptive safe distance method. If this method is chosen, all construction operations that produce vibration or shock waves in the vicinity of freshly placed concrete shall be monitored by the Contractor with monitoring equipment sensitive enough to detect a minimum peak particle velocity (PPV) of 0.10 inches per second. Monitoring devices shall be placed on or adjacent to the freshly placed concrete when the measurements are taken. During the time subsequent to the concrete placement, the Contractor shall cease all vibration or shock producing operations in the vicinity of the newly placed concrete when the monitoring equipment detects excessive vibration and shock waves defined as exceeding the following PPVs:

Curing requirements of Section 6-02.3(9)C shall be maintained until 70% of the specified design strength is achieved.
Forms may be steel or plywood faced, providing they impart the required finish to the concrete. 6-02.3(9)C
Curing

Concrete in the precast units shall be cured by either moist or accelerated curing methods. The curing methods to be used by a manufacturing facility shall be preapproved in the WSDOT plant certification process. The methods to be used when cast on-site shall be as accepted in the On-site Pre-casting and Quality Control Plan. 1.
For moist curing, the surface of the concrete shall be kept covered or moist until such time as the compressive strength of the concrete reaches 70% of the specified design strength. Exposed surfaces shall be kept continually moist by fogging, spraying, or covering with moist burlap or cotton mats. Moist curing shall commence as soon as possible following completion of surface finishing. 2.
For accelerated curing, heat shall be applied at a controlled rate following the initial set of concrete in combination with an effective method of supplying or retaining moisture. Moisture may be applied by a cover of moist burlap, cotton matting, or other effective means. Moisture may be retained by covering the unit with an impermeable sheet.
Heat may be radiant, convection, conducted steam or hot air. Heat the concrete to no more than 100°F during the first 2 hours after placing the concrete, and then increase no more than 25°F per hour to a maximum of 175°F. After curing is complete, cool the concrete no more than 25°F per hour to 100°F. Maintain the concrete temperature above 60°F until the unit reaches stripping strength.
Concrete temperature shall be monitored by means of a thermocouple embedded in the concrete (linked with a thermometer accurate to plus or minus 5°F). The recording sensor (accurate to plus or minus 5°F) shall be arranged and calibrated to continuously record, date, and identify concrete temperature throughout the heating cycle. This temperature record shall be made available to the Engineer for inspection and become a part of the documentation required.
The Contractor shall never allow dry heat to directly touch exposed unit surfaces at any point. 6-02.3(9)D
Control Strength
The concrete strength at stripping and the verification of design strength shall be determined by testing cylinders made from the same concrete as the precast units.
The cylinders shall be made, handled, and stored in accordance with WSDOT FOP for
AASHTO R 100 and compression tested in accordance with AASHTO T 22 and AASHTO
T 231.
For accelerated cured units, concrete strength shall be measured on test cylinders cast from the same concrete as that in the unit. These cylinders shall be cured under timetemperature relationships and conditions that simulate those of the unit. If the forms are heated by steam or hot air, test cylinders will remain in the coolest zone throughout curing. If forms are heated another way, the Contractor shall provide a record of the curing time- temperature relationship for the cylinders for each unit to the Engineer.

Not use vibrators to move concrete; 4.
Not revibrate the concrete surface areas where workers have stopped prior to screeding; 5.
Remove concrete, if any, splashed onto reinforcing steel in adjacent segments before concreting them;

6.
Maintain a slight excess of concrete in front of the screed across the entire width of the placement operation. The Contractor shall coordinate the rate of placement such that the concrete is placed, consolidated, and struck off within 30 minutes from the time of placement, unless otherwise accepted by the Engineer at the pre-deck pour meeting; 7.
Operate the finishing machine to create a surface that is true and ready for final finish without overfinishing or bringing excessive amounts of mortar to the surface; and 8.
Leave a thin, even film of mortar on the concrete surface after the last pass of the finishing machine pan.
Workers shall complete all post screeding operations without walking on the concrete.
This may require work bridges spanning the full width of the deck/slab.
After removing the screed supports, the Contractor shall fill the voids with concrete (not mortar).
If the surface left by the finishing machine is porous, rough, or has minor irregularities, the Contractor shall float the surface of the concrete. Floating shall leave a smooth and even surface. Float finishing shall be kept to the minimum number of passes necessary to seal the surface. The floats shall be at least 4-feet long. Each transverse pass of the float shall overlap the previous pass by at least half the length of the float. The first floating shall be at right angles to the strike-off. The second floating shall be at right angles to the centerline of the span. A smooth riding surface shall be maintained across construction joints.
The edge of completed roadway slabs at expansion joints and compression seals shall have a ⅜-inch radius.
After floating, but while the concrete remains plastic, the Contractor shall test the entire deck/slab for flatness (allowing for crown, camber, and vertical curvature). The testing shall be done with a 10-foot straightedge held on the surface. The straightedge shall be advanced in successive positions parallel to the centerline, moving not more than one half the length of the straightedge each time it advances. This procedure shall be repeated with the straightedge held perpendicular to the centerline. An acceptable surface shall be one free from deviations of more than ⅛-inch under the 10-foot straightedge.
If the test reveals depressions, the Contractor shall fill them with freshly mixed concrete, strike off, consolidate, and refinish them. High areas shall be cut down and refinished.
Retesting and refinishing shall continue until a surface conforming to the requirements specified above is produced.

M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02
For each detail under consideration, the wheel loads shall be positioned transversely on a centerbeam to achieve the maximum nominal stress range at that detail. The vertical and horizontal wheel loads shall be applied as line loads to the top of the centerbeams at their centerlines. The design stress range in the centerbeam-to-support bar connection shall be calculated as specified below. The design nominal stress ranges, ∆f, multiplied by the appropriate load factors in Table 3.4.1-1 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design
Specifications, shall be used for fatigue design as specified at the end of this subsection. 6-02.3(13)C7 Welded or Bolted Single-Support-Bar Systems
The nominal stress range, ∆f, in the centerbeam at a welded or bolted stirrup shall be the sum of the longitudinal bending stress ranges at the critical section resulting from vertical and horizontal loading. The effects of stresses in any load-bearing attachments such as the stirrup or yoke shall not be considered when calculating the longitudinal stress range in the centerbeam. For bolted single-support-bar systems, stress ranges shall be calculated using the net section.
The nominal stress range, ∆f, in the stirrup or yoke shall be calculated without considering the effects of stresses in the centerbeam. The stress range shall be calculated by assuming a load range in the stirrup equal to 30% of the total vertical reaction force between the centerbeam and the support bar. The effects of horizontal loads may be neglected in the design of the stirrup. 6-02.3(13)C8 Welded Multiple-Support-Bar Systems
Three locations have been identified as initiation sites for fatigue cracking at a centerbeam-to-support bar welded connection. The types of cracking associated with these three locations are described below. The corresponding equations may be used to calculate the nominal stress range, ∆f. For the support bar, either the reduced moment at the critical cross section or the moment at the centerline of the connection may be used in these equations.
Centerbeam weld toe cracking is driven by a combination of longitudinal bending stress range, SRB, in the centerbeam, and vertical stress range, SRZ, at the top of the connection weld.
The longitudinal bending stress range, SRB, at the bottom of the centerbeam shall be calculated as:
SRB = MVcb / SXcb + MHcb / SYcb
The vertical stress range, SRZ, at the top of the connection weld shall be calculated as:
SRZ = RH∙ dcb / SWtop + RV / AWtop
Support bar weld toe cracking is driven by a combination of longitudinal bending stress range, SRB, in the support bar and vertical stress range, SRZ, at the bottom of the connection weld.
The longitudinal bending stress range, SRB, at the top of the support bar shall be calculated as:
SRB = MVsb / SXsb + 0.5 ∙ RH ∙ (dcb + hW + 0.5 ∙ dsb) / SXsb
The vertical stress range, SRZ, at the bottom of the connection weld shall be calculated as:
SRZ = RH ∙ (dcb + hW) / Swbot + RV / AWbot
Weld throat cracking is driven by a vertical stress range at the weld throat.

Concrete Structures
The vertical stress range, SRZ, at mid-height of the connection weld shall be calculated as:
SRZ = RV / Awmid + RH ∙ (dcb + 0.5 ∙ hW) / SWmid
In the above equations:
RV = vertical reaction at the connection weld
RH = horizontal reaction at the connection weld
MVcb = bending moment in the centerbeam due to applied vertical forces
MHcb = bending moment in the centerbeam due to applied horizontal forces
MVsb = bending moment in the support bar due to applied vertical forces
SXcb = section modulus at bottom of the centerbeam about horizontal axis
SYcb = section modulus of the centerbeam about vertical axis
SXsb = section modulus at top of the support bar about horizontal axis
AWtop = area of the weld at the top of the connection
AWmid = area of the weld at the middle of the connection
AWbot = area of the weld at the bottom of the connection
SWtop = section modulus of the weld at the top of the connection
SWmid = section modulus of the weld at the middle of the connection
SWbot = section modulus of the weld at the bottom of the connection hW = height of the weld dcb = depth of the centerbeam dsb = depth of the support bar
The nominal stress range, ∆f, at welded multiple-support-bar connection details shall be calculated for each case above as follows: ∆f = (S2RB + S2RZ)1/2
Where:
SRB

SRZ longitudinal stress range in the centerbeam or support bar, as calculated for each specific case above. vertical stress range in the centerbeam-to-support bar connection weld, as calculated for each specific case above.
All modular expansion joint system structural members, connections (bolted and welded), splices, and attachments shall satisfy the following: γ∆f = (ΔF)TH γ ∆f (ΔF)TH the load factor for the Fatigue I Limit State, as stipulated in Table 3.4.1-1 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. the nominal stress range as specified at the beginning of this subsection. constant amplitude fatigue threshold (CAFL) as specified in
Section 6-02.3(13)C9. 6-02.3(13)C9 Fatigue Resistance Characterization Requirements
The fatigue resistance of all details shall be characterized in terms of the detail categories specified in Table 6.6.1.2.5-1 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications.
Many details composing modular expansion joint systems may clearly correspond to specific structural details depicted in Figure 6.6.1.2.3-1 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge
Design Specifications. In these cases, the applicable fatigue categories specified in Table 6.6.1.2.3-1 may be used for design.
In cases where the Engineer establishes that a detail does not clearly correspond to a structural detail depicted in Figure 6.6.1.2.3-1, fatigue testing of specimens exhibiting that detail shall be conducted, in accordance with Sections 6-02.3(13)C11,

M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02 6-02.3(13)C23, and 6-02.3(13)C26, to establish the appropriate constant amplitude fatigue limit (CAFL) for that detail. 6-02.3(13)C10 Strength I Limit State Design Requirements
Modular expansion joint system structural steel members, connections (bolted and welded), splices, and attachments shall be designed to resist the Strength
I Limit State load combination specified in Table 3.4.1-1 of the AASHTO LRFD
Bridge Design Specifications. The vertical and horizontal loads specified in Section 6-02.3(13)C4 shall be applied simultaneously. These loads shall be distributed as specified in Section 6-02.3(13)C5. 6-02.3(13)C11 Fatigue Testing of Metallic Structural Components and Connections
This test procedure is acceptable for, and specifically applicable to, establishing the fatigue resistance of the centerbeam-to-support bar connection in modular expansion joint systems. It is applicable to single-support-bar and multiple-support-bar systems having either welded or bolted centerbeam-to-support bar connections. The same methodology may be applied to establish the fatigue resistance of other modular expansion joint metallic structural component details, including centerbeam splices.
Each fatigue test generates a discrete datum. Each datum comprises an applied constant amplitude nominal stress range, Sr, and the corresponding number of cycles, N, associated with either a predetermined extent of crack propagation, defined as failure, or with termination of the test, defined as runout. Ten data shall be acquired for each connection detail. All data shall be in the very long life range, corresponding as closely to the constant amplitude fatigue limit (CAFL) as practical. Specifically, the number of cycles, N, associated with each datum, shall be no less than one order of magnitude less than Nmin corresponding to the detail category specific CAFL specified in Section 6-02.3(13)C19.
For example, to characterize a detail as Detail Category C, the tested number of cycles, N, shall exceed 4.4 x 105 for each datum.
The constant amplitude nominal stress range shall be calculated at the anticipated initiation location of an incipient crack. Nominal stresses shall be calculated using conventional equations for analyzing bending and axial load. These equations are essentially the same as those used in strength design. The stress concentration effects of a weld, bolt hole, or other local features are not explicitly embodied in the conventional nominal stress equations.
The appropriate AASHTO detail category applicable to fatigue design shall be established by comparing acquired test data to fatigue resistance graphs representing the AASHTO detail categories. The constant amplitude fatigue limit (CAFL) applicable to fatigue design corresponds to the AASHTO detail category fatigue resistance graph representing a lower bound of the experimentally acquired data.
When testing is conducted exclusively in the infinite life regime and more stringent test data scatter requirements are satisfied, a unique CAFL (different from those CAFL corresponding to specific detail categories specified by AASHTO) may be established for fatigue design.
Specimens selected for testing shall be full-scale centerbeam and support bar assemblies or subassemblies representative of those installed in field applications. A subassembly is defined as a specimen having the same physical and geometric properties as an assembly but having a reduced number of centerbeams.
Each specimen shall consist of three continuous centerbeam spans over four equally spaced support bars. Centerbeam spans between adjacent support bar centerlines shall be a minimum of 3’-0” and a maximum of 4’-6”. Support bar spans shall be a minimum of 3’-0” and a maximum of 3’-8”. The centerbeam-to-support bar connection being tested shall be located at the midspan of each support bar.

Concrete Structures
All welded or bolted attachments used to secure equidistant springs to a support bar, centerbeam, or stirrup shall be fabricated as an integral part of the specimen. A rigid load path to the test fixture shall be provided to resist any horizontal forces or displacements which would normally be resisted through these attachments in a field installation. All miscellaneous welded or bolted attachments, including welded attachments used to secure the expansion joint strip seals to the centerbeams, shall also be fabricated as integral parts of the specimen.
Support bars of subassembly specimens that are components of single-support-bar swivel-joist type modular expansion joint systems shall be oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the centerbeam.
Prior to testing, each specimen shall be visually inspected for defects, loose fasteners or other aberrations which could plausibly affect the tested fatigue resistance. Defects and flaws shall be defined in accordance with the appropriate governing specification (ASTM
A6, AWS D1.5, etc.). Data acquired from specimens containing such anomalies shall not be excluded from consideration except as permitted in Section 6-02.3(13)C20. Observed anomalies shall also be reported with its corresponding data in the tabular format stipulated in Section 6-02.3(13)C22.
Each specimen shall be sufficiently instrumented to measure the static nominal strain range within that specimen for a specific applied load range. Best results can generally be obtained when the applied load range for the static calibration tests does not pass through zero load. Strain measurements shall be made at locations sufficiently distant from local effects, such as weld toes or bolt holes, which could significantly influence acquired test data.
As a minimum, eight strain gages shall be installed on the centerbeam top flange in the vicinity of each centerbeam-to-support bar connection. These gages shall be installed in pairs on each side of the connection at distances of one and two times the depth of the centerbeam from the centerline of the connection. Each pair of strain gages shall be located symmetrically about the centerline of the centerbeam. As a minimum, two strain gages shall also be installed on the support bar bottom flange in the vicinity of each centerbeam-to-support bar connection. One of these strain gages shall be installed on each side of the connection at a distance equal to the depth of the support bar from the centerline of the connection. These strain gages shall be installed along the centerline of the support bar. 6-02.3(13)C12 Fatigue Testing Test Fixtures
Test fixtures shall have the capability to adequately support and secure the specimen throughout the duration of the test. The fixture shall be designed and fabricated to such tolerances as required to assure that additional stresses will not be generated in the specimen as a consequence of fixture misalignment. Mismatches resulting from specimen fabrication errors shall be accommodated by shimming or other such means precluding the application of force to the specimen.
Typical elastomeric bearings and springs used to transfer vertical loads from the support bars to the support boxes may be replaced with steel bearings in the test fixture. This modification will enable fatigue testing at higher load ranges and different frequencies than those encountered during normal service conditions.
Load shall be applied through two 10-inch long patches. Each patch shall typically comprise a steel plate and a hard rubber bearing pad placed in contact with the bottom flange of the centerbeam. Each patch shall be located at midspan of each outer span.
In order to assure adequate seating of the specimen to the test fixture, a minimum of
10 kips shall be applied at each patch location. This requirement is waived for tests of single support bar systems conducted using load reversal. Once this load has been applied, all strain measuring devices shall be rebalanced to zero strain while the preload
Page 6-48

2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02 is maintained. An additional load approximately equivalent to the calculated load range shall be applied. Strain ranges shall be measured for the load range from 10 kips to the peak load. Each static calibration test shall be repeated three times while still maintaining a minimum 10 kips load at each load patch. The measured strain ranges from each repetition should vary by no more than 25% from the mean value. If the stress ranges are not repeatable, appropriate modifications shall be made to the test fixture. 6-02.3(13)C13 Static Calibration Test
Prior to fatigue resistance testing, a static calibration test shall be performed in order to validate the structural analysis model. The static calibration test shall be performed after attainment of stress range repeatability as described in Section 6-02.3(13)C12. The structural analysis model shall be considered validated when calculated strain ranges are within ±25% of the measured strain ranges at every strain gage location.
For the purpose of reporting nominal fatigue resistance stress ranges at specific details, stress ranges determined through structural analysis of the model shall be preferred over stress ranges acquired directly from test measurements. 6-02.3(13)C14 Fatigue Test Procedure
A minimum of ten data points shall be required to establish the fatigue resistance of each detail. The centerbeam-to-support bar connection shall be considered as a single detail.
Several data points may be obtained from a single specimen by repairing the cracked sections of that specimen and resuming testing. Such repairs shall have minimal effect on the stress ranges at unfailed details still being tested. Data points derived from tests in which a repaired detail cracks again shall be discarded.
All data shall be in the very long life range, corresponding as closely to the constant amplitude fatigue limit as practical, but in no case less than 200,000 cycles. Either finite life regime or infinite life regime testing may be conducted. For infinite life regime testing, the number of cycles, N, associated with each of the ten data shall be at least twice the number of cycles, Nmin, designated in the table in Section 6-02.3(13)C19.
Loads shall be applied using hydraulic actuators or other similar loading devices. The magnitude of the vertical load range, ∆Pv, shall be maintained and continuously monitored throughout the duration of the test. Vertical and horizontal load ranges shall be applied to the specimen simultaneously. The horizontal load range shall always be equal to 20% of the vertical load range, ∆Pv. This horizontal-to-vertical load ratio may be maintained by inclining the specimen 11.3 degrees with respect to the horizontal plane and applying load through vertically oriented actuators.
For multiple support bar systems, the loading mechanism shall be either exclusively tension or exclusively compression and shall be applied at a constant amplitude at any desired frequency. The applied load range shall be in a direction such that the reaction force between the centerbeam and support bar is always tensile. The load range shall not pass through zero load. Minimum preload shall be maintained throughout the duration of the test.
Single support bar systems may be loaded using the same procedures as those for multiple support bar systems. If premature stirrup failure occurs, an applied load range of 70% compression and 30% tension may be used.
The load ranges used in the test shall not be so large as to alter the observed failure mode from that which would be observed under service conditions. Under no circumstance shall imposed stress exceed the yield stress of the material in any portion of the specimen.
Each specimen shall be tested using at least two different load (stress) ranges.
If infinite life regime testing is conducted, the first load range should be chosen so that the applied stress range is just above the postulated CAFL. The load range in the subsequent test shall be decreased if failure resulted and increased if the test resulted in a runout. A

Concrete Structures suggested increment in load is such that the stress range is increased or decreased by 2 ksi. The applicable CAFL shall be selected from those CAFL values corresponding to the
AASHTO fatigue categories. The selected CAFL is the one just below the lowest stress range that resulted in cracking. 6-02.3(13)C15 Fatigue Test Failure Criteria
Failure in welded centerbeam-to-support bar connection specimens includes the following:
Centerbeam weld toe cracking originates at or near the centerbeam weld toe, propagates up into the centerbeam at some angle, and grows back over the connection. These cracks typically grow at an angle of about 45 degrees. A specimen shall be considered as failed due to this type of cracking when the crack has grown on any vertical face a length from the point of origin equal to half of the centerbeam depth.
Support bar weld toe cracking originates at or near the support bar weld toe, propagates down into the support bar, and grows back under the connection at some angle, typically about 45 degrees. A specimen shall be considered as failed due to this type of cracking when the crack has grown on any vertical support bar face a length from the point of origin equal to half of the depth of the support bar.
Weld throat cracking originates in the weld throat and typically grows in a plane parallel to the longitudinal axis of the support bar at about mid-depth of the weld throat. A specimen shall be considered as failed due to this type of cracking when a complete fracture of the weld throat has occurred. These cracks have been observed to turn down into the support bar, but only after significant growth. In such instances, the criteria for support bar weld toe cracking shall be applied.

A bolted centerbeam-to-support bar connection specimen shall be considered as failed when: 1.

Fatigue cracks which have grown out of a bolt hole have resulted in the complete fracture of the tension flange of the centerbeam. 2.
Fatigue cracks which have grown out of a bolt hole have extended into any face of the centerbeam web a distance equivalent to half of the centerbeam depth less the centerbeam flange thickness. 3.
A portion of a stirrup fractures completely. 4.
A single bolt fractures completely. 6-02.3(13)C16 Alternate Criteria for Termination of a Finite Life Regime Fatigue Test
A test may also be terminated when, for a given stress range, the specimen has survived the number of cycles required to plot the data above either a particular fatigue resistance curve or the maximum permitted in Section 6-02.3(13)C20. For example, if the applied stress range is 17 ksi and the desired fatigue resistance curve is Category C, then based upon the equation presented in Section 6-02.3(13)C19, the test may be terminated after application of about 900,000 cycles provided that the specimen has not failed based on the above described criteria. 6-02.3(13)C17 Nominal Stress Range for Welded Centerbeam-to-Support Bar Systems
The nominal stress range for centerbeam weld toe cracking shall be calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the longitudinal bending stress range in the centerbeam and the vertical stress range at the top of the weld.

Plans for Falsework and Formwork
The Contractor shall submit all plans for falsework and formwork as Type 2E Working
Drawings. A submittal is not required for footing or retaining wall formwork if the concrete placement is 4 feet or less in height. Formwork plans are required for fixed form barriers regardless of height.
The design of falsework and formwork shall be based on: 1.
Applied loads and conditions which are no less severe than those described in Section 6-02.3(17)A;

2.
Allowable stresses and deflections which are no greater than those described in

Pre-Contract Review of Falsework and Formwork Plans
The Contractor may request pre-contract review of formwork plans for abutments, wingwalls, diaphragms, retaining walls, columns, girders and beams, box Structures, railings, and bulkheads. Plans for falsework supporting the bridge deck for interior spans between precast prestressed concrete girders may also be submitted for pre-contract review.
To obtain pre-contract review, the Contractor shall electronically submit drawings and design calculations in PDF format directly to: BridgeConstructionSupport@wsdot.wa.gov
The Bridge and Structures Office, Construction Support Engineer will return the falsework or formwork plan to the Contractor with review notes, an effective date of review, and revisions needed prior to use.
For each contract on which the pre-reviewed falsework or formwork plans will be used, the Contractor shall submit a copy to the Engineer. Construction shall not begin until the
Engineer has given concurrence.
If the falsework or formwork being constructed has deviations to the preapproved falsework or formwork plan, the Contractor shall submit plan revisions for review and approval in accordance with Section 6-02.3(16). 6-02.3(17)
Falsework and Formwork

Formwork and falsework are both structural systems. Formwork contains the lateral pressure exerted by concrete placed in the forms. Falsework supports the vertical and/ or the horizontal loads of the formwork, reinforcing steel, concrete, and live loads during construction.
The Contractor shall set falsework, to produce in the finished Structure, the lines and grades indicated in the Contract Plans. The setting of falsework shall allow for shrinkage, settlement, falsework girder camber, and all structural camber the Plans or the
Engineer require.
Concrete forms shall be mortar tight, true to the dimensions, lines, and grades of the
Structure. Curved surfaces shown in the Contract Plans shall be constructed as curved surfaces and not chorded, except as allowed in Section 6-02.3(17)J. Concrete formwork shall be of sufficient strength and stiffness to prevent overstress and excess deflection as defined in Section 6-02.3(17)B. The rate of depositing concrete in the forms shall not exceed the placement rate in the formwork plan Working Drawing. The interior form shape and dimensions shall also ensure that the finished concrete will conform with the
Contract Plans.
If the new Structure is near or part of an existing one, the Contractor shall not use the existing Structure to suspend or support falsework unless the Plans or Special
Provisions state otherwise. For prestressed girder and T-beam bridge widenings or stage construction, the bridge deck and the diaphragm forms may be supported from the existing Structure or previous stage, if accepted by the Engineer. For steel plate girder bridge widenings or stage construction, only the bridge deck forms may be supported from the existing Structure or previous stage, if accepted by the Engineer. See Section 6-02.3(17)E for additional conditions.
On bridge decks, forms designed to stay in place made of steel or precast concrete panels shall not be used.
For post-tensioned Structures, both falsework and forms shall be designed to carry the additional loads caused by the post-tensioning operations. The Contractor shall construct supporting falsework in a way that leaves the Superstructure free to contract and lift off the falsework during post-tensioning. Forms that will remain inside box girders to support the placement of the bridge deck concrete shall, by design, resist girder contraction as little as possible. See Section 6-02.3(26) for additional conditions.

Design Loads
The design load for falsework shall consist of the sum of dead and live vertical loads, and a design horizontal load. The minimum total design load for any falsework shall not be less than 100 lbs/sf for combined live and dead load regardless of Structure thickness.
The entire Superstructure cross-section, except traffic barrier, shall be considered to be placed at one time for purposes of determining support requirements and designing falsework girders for their stresses and deflections, except as follows:
For concrete box girder bridges, the girder stem, diaphragms, crossbeam and connected bottom slabs may be considered self-supporting between the falsework bents at the time the top slab is place provided the following conditions are true: 1.
Five or more days have elapsed since the stem walls were placed. 2.
The distance between the falsework bents is less than or equal to four times the depth of the girder that has been placed in the preceding concrete placements.
Falsework bents shall be designed for the entire live load and dead load, including all load transfer that takes place during post-tensioning, and braced for the design horizontal load.
Dead loads shall include the weight of all successive placements of concrete, reinforcing steel, forms and falsework, and all load transfer that takes place during post-tensioning.
The weight of concrete with reinforcing steel shall be assumed to be not less than
160 pounds per cubic foot.
Live loads shall consist of a minimum uniform load of not less than 25 psf, applied over the entire falsework plan area, plus the greater of: 1.

Actual weights of the deck finishing equipment applied at the rails, or; 2.
A minimum load of 75 pounds per linear foot applied at the edge of the bridge deck.
The design horizontal load to be resisted by the falsework bracing system in any direction shall be:
The sum of all identifiable horizontal loads due to equipment, construction sequence, side-sway caused by geometry or eccentric loading conditions, or other causes, and an allowance for wind plus an additional allowance of 1 percent of the total dead load to provide for unexpected forces. In no case shall the design horizontal load be less than 3 percent of the total dead load.
The minimum horizontal load to be allowed for wind on each heavy-duty steel shoring tower having a vertical load carrying capacity exceeding 30 kips per leg shall be the sum of the products of the wind impact area, shape factor, and the applicable wind pressure value for each height zone. The wind impact area is the total projected area of all the elements in the tower face normal to the applied wind. The shape factor for heavy-duty steel shoring towers shall be taken as 2.2. Wind pressure values shall be determined from the following table:

Q = 1 + 0.2W; but Q shall not be more than 10.
Where:
W = is the width of the falsework system, in feet, measured normal to the direction of the wind force being considered.
The falsework system shall also be designed so that it will be sufficiently stable to resist overturning prior to the placement of the concrete. The minimum factor of safety against falsework overturning in all directions from the assumed horizontal load for all stages of construction shall be 1.25. If the required resisting moment is less than 1.25 times the overturning moment, the difference shall be resisted by bracing, cable guys, or other means of external support.
Design of falsework shall include the vertical component (whether positive or negative) of bracing loads imposed by the design horizontal load. Design of falsework shall investigate the effects of any horizontal displacement due to stretch of the bracing. This is particularly important when using cable or rod bracing systems.
If the concrete is to be post-tensioned, the falsework shall be designed to support all increased or redistributed loads caused by the prestressing forces. 6-02.3(17)B

Allowable Design Stresses and Deflections
The maximum allowable stresses listed in this section are based on the use of identifiable, undamaged, high-quality materials. Stresses shall be appropriately reduced if lesser quality materials are to be used.
These maximum allowable stresses include all adjustment factors, such as the short-term load duration factor. The maximum allowable stresses and deflections used in the design of the falsework and formwork shall be as follows: 6-02.3(17)B1 Deflection
Deflection resulting from dead load and concrete pressure for exposed visible surfaces shall not exceed 1/360 of the span.
Deflection resulting from dead load and concrete pressure for unexposed non-visible surfaces, including the bottom of the deck slab between girders shall not exceed 1/270 of the span.
In the foregoing, the span length shall be the center line to center line distance between supports for simple and continuous spans, and from the center line of support to the

end of the member for cantilever spans. For plywood supported on members wider than 1½ inches, the span length shall be taken as the clear span plus 1½ inches. Also, dead load shall include the weight of all successive placements of concrete, reinforcing steel, forms and falsework self weight. Only the self weight of falsework girders may be excluded from the calculation of the above deflections provided that the falsework girder deflection is compensated for by the installation of camber strips.
Where successive placements of concrete are to act compositely in the completed
Structure, deflection control becomes extremely critical. Maximum deflection of supporting members shall not exceed 1/500 of the span for members constructed in several successive placements (such as concrete box girder and concrete T-beam girder
Structures). Falsework components shall be sized, positioned, and/or supported to minimize progressive increases in deflection of the Structure which would preload the concrete or reinforcing steel before it becomes fully composite. 6-02.3(17)B2 Timber
Each species and grade of timber/lumber used in constructing falsework and formwork shall be identified in the drawings. The allowable stresses and loads shall not exceed the lesser of stresses and loads given in the table below or factored stresses for designated species and grade in Table 7.3 of the Timber Construction Manual, latest edition, by the
American Institute of Timber Construction.

Additional requirements are found in other parts of Section 6-02.3(17). Criteria for the design of lumber and timber connections are found in Section 6-02.3(17)I.
Plywood for formwork shall be designed in accordance with the methods and stresses allowed in the APA Design/Construction Guide for Concrete Forming as published by the
American Plywood Association, Tacoma, Washington. As concrete forming is a special application for plywood, wet stresses shall be used and then adjusted for forming conditions such as duration of load, and experience factors. Concrete pour pressures shall be in accordance with Section 6-02.3(17)J.

Wedges shall be used to permit formwork to be taken up and released uniformly. Wedges shall be oak or close-grained Douglas fir. Cedar wedges or shims shall not be used anywhere in a falsework or forming system. Wedges shall be used at the top or bottom of shores, but not at both top and bottom. After the final adjustment of the shore elevation is complete, the wedges shall be fastened securely to the sill or cap beam. Only one set of wedges (with one optional block) shall be used at one location. Screw jacks (or other allowed devices) shall be used under arches to allow incremental release of the falsework.
Sand jacks may be used to support falsework and are used for falsework lowering only.
Sand jacks shall be constructed of steel with snug fitting steel or concrete pistons. Sand jacks shall be filled with dry sand and the jack protected from moisture throughout its use.
They shall be designed and installed in such a way to prevent the unintentional migration or loss of sand. All sand jacks shall be tested in accordance with Section 6-02.3(17)G.
When falsework is over or adjacent to Roadways or railroads, all details of the falsework system which contribute to the horizontal stability and resistance to impact shall be installed at the time each element of the falsework is erected and shall remain in place until the falsework is removed. For other requirements see Section 6-02.3(17)C.
Transverse construction joints in the Superstructure shall be supported by falsework at the joint location. The falsework shall be constructed in such a manner that subsequent pours will not produce additional stresses in the concrete already in place. 6-02.3(17)D4 Manufactured Shoring Tower Systems and Devices
Manufactured proprietary shoring tower systems shall be identified in the falsework plans by make and model and safe working load capacity per leg. The safe working load for shoring tower systems shall be based upon a minimum 2½ to 1 factor of safety.
The safe working load capacity, anticipated deflection (or settlement), make and model shall be identified in the falsework plans for manufactured devices such as: single shores, overhang brackets, support bracket and jack assemblies, friction collars and clamps, hangers, saddles, and sand jacks.

The maximum allowable free end deflection of deck overhang brackets under working loads applied shall not exceed 3/16 inch measured at the edge of the concrete slab regardless of the fact that the deflection may be compensated for by pre-cambering or of setting the elevations high. The Contractor shall comply with all manufacturer’s specifications; including those relating to bolt torque, placing washers under nuts and bolt heads, cleaning and oiling of parts, and the reuse of material. Devices which are deteriorated, bent, warped, or have poorly fitted connections or welds, shall not be installed.
Shoring tower or device capacity as shown in catalogs or brochures published by the manufacturer shall be considered as the maximum load which the shoring is able to safely support under ideal conditions. These maximum values shall be reduced for adverse loading conditions; such as horizontal loads, eccentricity due to unbalanced spans or placing sequence, and uneven foundation settlement.

Upon request by the Engineer, the Contractor shall furnish manufacturer certified test reports and results showing load capacity, deflection, test installation conditions, and identify associated components and hardware for shoring tower systems or other devices. In addition to manufacturer’s requirements, the criteria shown in the following sections for manufactured proprietary shoring tower systems and devices shall be complied with when preparing falsework plans, calculations, and installing these shoring tower systems and devices as falsework.
Alternative criteria and/or systems shall be submitted as a Type 2 Working Drawing consisting of a written statement on the manufacturer’s letterhead, signed by the shoring or device manufacturer (not signed by a material supplier or the Contractor) addressing the following: 1.
Identity of the specific Contract on which the alternative criteria and/or system will apply; 2.
Description of the alternative criteria and/or system; 3.
Technical data and test reports; 4.
The conditions under which the particular alternative criteria may be followed; and 5.
That a design based on the alternative criteria will not overstress or over deflect shoring components or devices nor reduce the required safety factor.
In any case where the falsework drawings detail a manufactured product and the manufacturer’s safe working load, load versus deflection curves, factor of safety, and installation requirements cannot be found in any catalog, the Engineer may require load testing in accordance with Section 6-02.3(17)G to verify the safe working load and deflection characteristics.
Tower leg loads shall not exceed the limiting values under any loading condition or sequence. All frame extensions and reduced capacity shall be shown in the falsework plans. Screw jacks shall fit tight in the leg assemblies without wobble. Screw jacks shall be plumb and straight. Shoring towers shall be installed plumb, and load distribution beams shall be arranged such that vertical loads are distributed to all legs for all successive concrete placements. There shall be no eccentric loads on shoring tower heads unless the heads have been designed for such loading. Shoring towers shall remain square or rectangular in plan view and shall not be skewed. There shall be no interchanging of parts from one manufactured shoring system to another. Bent or faulty components shall not be used.
For manufactured shoring towers that allow ganging of frames, the number of ganged frames shall be limited to one frame per opposing side of a tower, and the total number of legs per ganged tower shall not exceed eight legs.

Stringers, Beams, Joists, Bridge Deck Support, and Deck Overhangs
All stringers, beams, joists, and bridge deck support shall be designed for the design loads, deflections, and allowable stresses described in the preceding Section 6-02.3(17)A, B, and
C and for the following conditions.
At points of support, stringers, beams, joists, and trusses shall be restrained against rotation about their longitudinal axis. The effect of biaxial bending shall be investigated in all cases where falsework beams are not set plumb and the Structure cross-slope exceeds
3 percent.
For box girder and T-beam bridges, the centerline of falsework beams or stringers shall be located within 2 feet of the bridge girder stems and preferably directly under the stems or webs. Stringers supporting formwork for concrete box girder and T-beam slab overhangs shall be stiff enough so that the differential deflection due to the placement of bridge deck concrete is no more than 3/16 inch between the outside edge of the bridge deck and the exterior web even if camber strips can compensate for the deflection.
Friction shall not be relied upon for lateral stability of beams or stringers. If the compression flange of a beam is not laterally restrained, the allowable bending stress shall be reduced to prevent flange buckling. If flange restraint is provided and since it is impossible to predict the direction in which a compression flange will buckle, positive restraint shall be provided in both directions. Flange restraint shall be designed for a minimum load of 2 percent of the calculated compression force in the beam flange at the point under consideration.
Camber strips shall be used to compensate for falsework take-up and deflection, vertical alignment, and the anticipated Structure dead load deflection shown in the camber diagram in the Contract Plans. Camber is the adjustment to the profile of a loadsupporting beam or stringer so that the completed Structure will have the lines and grades shown in the Plans. The dead load camber diagram shown in the Contract Plans is the predicted Structure dead load deflection due to weight of applied concrete loads. This dead load camber shall be increased by: 1.

Amount of anticipated falsework take up, 2.
Anticipated deflection of the falsework beam or stringer under the actual load imposed, and 3.
Vertical curve compensation, if any.
Camber strips shall be fastened by nailing to the top of wood members, or by clamping or banding in the case of steel members. Camber strips shall have sufficient contact bearing area to prevent crushing under total load. Camber strips are required when the total camber adjustment exceeds ¼ inch for exterior falsework stringers and ½ inch for interior stringers.
On concrete box girder Structures, the forms supporting the bridge deck shall rest on ledgers or similar supports and shall not be supported from the bottom slab except as provided below. The form supports shall be fastened within 18 inches of the top of the web walls, producing a clear span between web walls. The bridge deck forms may be supported or posted from the bottom slab if the following conditions are met: 1.
Permanent access, shown in the Contract Plans, is provided to the cells, and the centerline to centerline distance between web walls is greater than 10 feet; 2.
Falsework stringers designed for total load, stresses and deflections in accordance with Section 6-02.3(17)A and B are located directly below each row of posts; 3.
Posts have adequate lateral restraint; and 4.
All forms (including the bridge deck forms), posts, and bracing are completely removed.

M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02
The falsework and forms on concrete box girder Structures supporting a sloping web and deck overhang shall consist of a lateral support system which is designed to resist all rotational forces acting on the stem, including those caused by the placement of bridge deck concrete, bridge deck formwork mass, finishing machine, and other live loads.
Stem reinforcing steel shall not be stressed by the construction of the bridge deck slab placement. Overhang brackets shall not be used for the support of bridge deck forms from sloping web concrete box girder bridges.
Deck slab forms between girders or webs shall be constructed such that there is no differential settlement relative to the girders. The support systems for form panels supporting concrete deck slabs and overhangs on girder bridges (such as steel plate girders and prestressed girders) shall be designed as falsework. Falsework supporting deck slabs and overhangs on girder bridges shall be supported directly by the girders so that there will be no differential settlement between the girders and the deck forms during placement of deck concrete. 6-02.3(17)F
Bracing
All falsework bracing systems shall be designed to resist the horizontal design load in all directions with the falsework in either the loaded or unloaded condition. All bracing, connection details, specific locations of connections, and hardware used shall be shown in the falsework plans. Falsework diagonal bracing shall be thoroughly analyzed with particular attention given to the connections. The allowable stresses in the diagonal braces may be controlled by the joint strength or the compression stability of the diagonal.
Timber bracing for timber falsework bents shall have connections designed in accordance with Section 6-02.3(17)I. All damaged cross-bracing, such as split timber members shall be replaced. Steel strapping shall avoid making sharp angles or right-angle bends. A means of preventing accidental loss of tension shall be provided for steel strapping. See Sections 6-02.3(17)A, B, and C for design loads and allowable stresses.
Bracing shall not be attached to concrete traffic barrier, guardrail posts, or guardrail.
To prevent falsework beam or stringer compression flange buckling, cross-bracing members and connections shall be designed to carry tension as well as compression. All components, connection details and specific locations shall be shown in the falsework plans. Bracing, blocking, struts, and ties required for positive lateral restraint of beam flanges shall be installed at right angles to the beam in plan view. If possible, bracing in adjacent bays shall be set in the same transverse plane. However, if because of skew or other considerations, it is necessary to offset the bracing in adjacent bays, the offset distance shall not exceed twice the depth of the beam.
All falsework and bracing shall be inspected by the Contractor for plumbness of vertical support members, secure connections, tight cables, and straight bracing members immediately prior to, during, and immediately after every concrete placement.
Bracing shall be provided to withstand all imposed loads during erection of the falsework and all phases of construction for falsework adjacent to a Roadway, sidewalk, or railroad track which is open to the public. All details of the falsework system which contribute to horizontal stability and resistance to impact, including the bolts in bracing, shall be installed at the time each element of the falsework is erected and shall remain in place until the falsework is removed. The falsework plans shall show provisions for supplemental bracing or methods to be used to conform to this requirement during each phase of erection and removal. Wind loads shall be included in the design of such bracing or methods. Loads, connections, and materials for falsework adjacent to Roadways, shall also be in accordance with Section 6-02.3(17)C.

Concrete Structures 6-02.3(17)F1 Cable or Tension Bracing Systems
When cables, wire rope, steel rod, or other types of tension bracing members are used as external bracing to resist horizontal forces, or as temporary bracing to support bents while falsework is being erected or removed adjacent to traffic, all elements of the bracing system shall be shown in the falsework plans. Bracing shall not be attached to concrete traffic barrier, guardrail posts, or guardrail. All damaged bracing, such as frayed and kinked guying systems shall be replaced. Wire rope shall avoid making sharp angles or rightangle bends and a means of preventing accidental loss of tension shall be provided. The following information shall be submitted as a Type 2 Working Drawing: 1.
Cable diameter, rod, or tension member size, and allowable working load. 2.
Location and method of attaching the cable, rod, or tension member to the falsework.
The connecting device shall be designed to transfer both horizontal and vertical forces to the cable without overstressing the falsework component. 3.
The type of cable connectors or fastening devices (such as wire rope clips, plate clamps, or other attachment devices) to be used and the efficiency factor for each type. If cables are to be spliced, the splicing method shall be shown. 4.
Method of tightening cables, rods, or tension members after installation if tightening is necessary to ensure their effectiveness. Method of preventing accidental loosening.

5.
Anchorage details, including the size and mass of concrete anchor blocks, the assumed coefficient of friction for surface anchorages, and the assumed lateral soil bearing capacity for buried anchorages. 6.
Method of pre-stretching or preloading cable or tension members. 7.
Determination of the potential stretch or elongation of the tension member under the design load and if the resulting lateral deflection will cause excessive secondary stresses in the falsework.
Copies of manufacturer’s catalog or brochure showing technical data pertaining to the type of cable to be used shall be furnished with the falsework plans. Technical data shall include the cable diameter, the number of strands and the number of wires per strand, ultimate breaking strength or recommended safe working strength, and any other information as may be needed to identify the cable.
In the absence of sufficient technical data to identify the cable, or if it is old and obviously worn, the Contractor shall perform cable breaking tests to establish the safe working load for each reel of cable furnished. For static guy cable the minimum factor of safety shall be
3 to 1. The Contractor shall provide the Engineer an opportunity to witness these tests.
When cable bracing is used to prevent the overturning of heavy-duty shoring, attention shall be given to the connections by which forces are transferred from the shoring to the cables. Cable restraint shall be designed to act through the cap system to prevent the inadvertent application of forces which the shoring is not designed to withstand. Cables shall not be attached to tower components.
Cable splices made by lapping and clipping with wire rope clip type clamps shall not be used. Other splicing methods may be used; however, at each location where the cable is spliced, cable strength shall be verified by a load test.
When cables are used as external bracing to resist overturning of a falsework system, the horizontal load to be carried by the cables shall be calculated as follows: 1.

When used with heavy-duty shoring systems, cables shall be designed to resist the difference between 1.25 times the total overturning moment and the resistance to overturning provided by the individual falsework towers.

2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Concrete Structures 6-02 2.
When used with pipe-frame shoring systems where supplemental bracing is required, cables shall be designed to resist the difference between 1.25 times the total overturning moment and the resistance to overturning provided by the shoring system as a whole. 3.
When used as external bracing to prevent overturning of all other types of falsework, including temporary support during erection and removal of falsework at traffic openings, cables shall be designed to resist 1.25 times the total overturning moment.
The maximum allowable cable design load shall be determined using the following criteria: 1.
If the cable is new, or is in uniformly good condition, and if it can be identified by reference to a manufacturer’s catalog or other technical publication, the allowable load shall be the ultimate strength of the cable as specified by the manufacturer, multiplied by the efficiency of the cable connector, and divided by a safety factor of 3 (i.e., safe working load = breaking strength × connector efficiency/safety factor). 2.
If the cable is used but still in serviceable condition, or is new or nearly new but cannot be found in a manufacturer’s catalog, the Contractor shall perform load breaking tests. In this case, the cable design load shall not exceed the breaking strength, as determined by the load test, multiplied by the connector efficiency factor, and divided by a safety factor of 3. 3.
If the cable is used and still in serviceable condition, or is a new or nearly new cable which cannot be identified, and if load breaking tests are not performed, the cable design load shall not exceed the safe working load shown in the wire rope capacities table multiplied by the cable connector efficiency.
Cable connectors shall be designed in accordance with criteria shown in the following tables “Efficiency of Wire Rope Connections” and “Applying Wire Rope Clips”. Cable safe working loads are provided in table “Wire Rope Capacities”.

0.50 for installations West of the Cascade Range crest line; and 3.
0.50 for load acting at an angle to the bolt axis, as is the case with longitudinal bracing when falsework bents are skewed.
Except for connections in falsework adjacent to or over railroads or Roadways, threaded rods and coil rods may be used in place of bolts of the same diameter with no reduction in the tabulated values. At openings for Roadways and railroads, all connections shall be bolted using ⅝-inch diameter or larger through bolts.
Bolt holes shall be a minimum 1/32 inch to a maximum ⅛ inch larger than the bolt diameter.
A washer not less than a standard cut washer shall be installed between the wood and the bolt head and between the wood and the nut to distribute the bearing stress under the bolt head and nut and to avoid crushing the fibers. In lieu of standard cut washers, metal plates or straps with dimensions at least equal to that of a standard cut washer may be substituted.
When steel bars or shapes are used as diagonal bracing, the tabulated design values shown in AITC Table 6.20 for the main members loaded parallel to grain (P value) are increased 75 percent for joints made with bolts ½ inch or less in diameter, 25 percent for joints made with bolts 1½ inch in diameter, and proportionally for intermediate diameters.
No increase in the tabulated values is allowed for perpendicular-to-grain loading (Q value).

Clearance requirements for end, edge, and bolt spacing distance shall be as shown below.
All distances are measured from the end or side of the wood member to the center of the bolt hole. For members which are subject to load reversals the larger controlling distances shall be used for design. For parallel-to-grain loading, the minimum distances for full design load: 1.
In tension, minimum end distance shall be seven times the bolt diameter; 2.
In compression, minimum end distance shall be four times the bolt diameter; and 3.
In tension or compression, the minimum edge distance shall be one and one-half times the bolt diameter.
For perpendicular-to-grain loading, the minimum distance for full design load: 1.
Minimum end distance shall be four times the bolt diameter; 2.
Edge distance toward which the load is acting shall be at least four times the bolt diameter; and 3.
Distance on the opposite edge shall be at least 1½-bolt diameters.

Minimum clearance (spacing) between adjacent bolts in a row shall be four times the bolt diameter, measured center-to-center of the bolt holes.
When more than two bolts are used in a line parallel to the axis of the side member, additional requirements shall be followed as shown in the AITC manual. 6-02.3(17)I2
Lag Screw Connections
Design values for lag screws subject to withdrawal loading are found in AITC Table 6.27.
Values for wood having a specific gravity of 0.51 for Douglas Fir-Larch or 0.42 for Hem‑Fir shall be assumed when using the table. The withdrawal values are in pounds per inch of penetration of the threaded part of the lag screw into the side grain of the member holding the point, with the axis of the screw perpendicular to that member. The maximum load on a given screw shall not exceed the allowable tensile strength of the screw at the root section.
AITC recommends against subjecting lag screws to end-grain withdrawal loading.
However, if this condition cannot be avoided, the design value shall be 75 percent of the corresponding value for withdrawal from the side grain.
Values in the Group II wood species column shall be used for Douglas Fir-Larch and the
Group III wood species column shall be used for Hem-Fir. When the load is applied at an angle to the grain, as is the case with falsework bracing, the design value shall be obtained from the Hankinson formula shown in the AITC manual.
When lag screws are subjected to a combined lateral and withdrawal loading, as would be the case with longitudinal bracing when the falsework bents are skewed, the effect of the lateral and withdrawal forces shall be determined separately. The withdrawal component of the applied load shall not exceed the allowable value in withdrawal. The lateral component of the applied load shall not exceed the allowable lateral load value.
Lag screws shall be inserted in lead holes as follows: 1.

The clearance hole for the shank shall have the same diameter as the shank, and the same depth of penetration as the length of unthreaded shank; 2.
The lead hole for the threaded portion shall have a diameter equal to 60 to
75 percent of the shank diameter and a length equal to at least the length of the threaded portion. The larger percentile figure in each range shall apply to screws of the greater diameters used in Group II wood species; 3.
The threaded portion of the screw shall be inserted in its lead hole by turning with a wrench, not by driving with a hammer; and

To facilitate insertion, soap or other lubricant shall be used on the screws or in the lead hole. 6-02.3(17)I3
Drift Pin and Drift Bolt Connections

When drift pins or drift bolts are used, the required length and penetration shall be determined using the following criteria. The lateral load-carrying capacity of drift pins and drift bolts driven into the side grain of a wood member shall be limited to 75 percent of the design values for a common bolt of the same diameter and length in the main member. For drift pin connections, the pin penetration into the connected members shall be increased to compensate for the absence of a bolt head and nut. For drift bolts or pins driven into the end grain of a member, the lateral load-carrying capacity shall be limited to 60 percent of the allowable side grain load (perpendicular to grain value) for an equal diameter bolt with nut. To develop this allowable load the drift bolt or pin shall penetrate at least 12 diameters into the end grain. To fully develop the allowable load of the drift bolts or pins, they shall be driven into predrilled holes, 1/16 inch less in diameter than the drift pin or bolt diameter.
The criteria shown in the AITC Timber Construction Manual, Current Edition shall apply to drift bolt or pin connection allowable loads for the following conditions: 1.
Withdrawal resistance; and 2.
When there are more than two drift bolts or pins in a joint, allowable loads shall be further reduced by applying applicable modification factors shown in the AITC
Table 6.3. 6-02.3(17)I4
Nailed and Spiked Joints
Joints using nails or spikes shall conform to the provisions of AITC. For side grain withdrawal, the values in AITC Table 6.35 for wood having a specific gravity of 0.51 for
Douglas Fir-Larch and a specific gravity of 0.42 for Hem-Fir shall be used. End grain withdrawal shall not be used. For lateral loading, the values in AITC Table 6.36 for wood species Group II for Douglas Fir-Larch and wood species Group III for Hem-Fir shall be used. Diameters listed in the tables apply to fasteners before application of protective coatings.
When more than one nail or spike is used in a joint, the total design value for the joint in withdrawal or lateral resistance shall be the sum of the design values for the individual nails or spikes.
The tabulated design values for lateral loads are valid only when the nail penetrates into the main member at least 11 diameters for Douglas Fir-Larch and 13 diameters for HemFir. Note that the values are maximum values for the type and size of fastener shown. The tabulated values shall not be increased even if the actual penetration is exceeded.
When main member penetration is less than 11 diameters for Douglas Fir-Larch and 13 diameters for Hem-Fir, the design value shall be determined by straight-line interpolation between zero and the tabulated load, except that penetration shall not be less than ⅓ of that specified.
Double-headed or duplex nails used in falsework and formwork construction are shorter than common wire nails or box nails of the same size designation. They have less penetration into the main member and therefore their load-carrying capacity shall be adjusted accordingly.
Nail and spike minimum spacing in timber connections shall be as follows: 1.

The average center-to-center distance between adjacent nails, measured in any direction, shall not be less than the required penetration into the main member for the size of nail being used; and
Page 6-84
2024 Standard Specifications
M 41-10 Concrete Structures 2. 6-02
The minimum end distance in the side member, and the minimum edge distance in both the side member and the main member, shall not be less than ½ of the required penetration.
Allowable values for withdrawal and lateral load resistance are reduced when toe nails are used in accordance with the following: 1.
For withdrawal loading, the design load shall not exceed ⅔ of the value shown in the applicable design table; and 2.
For lateral loading, the design load shall not exceed 5⁄6 of the value shown in the applicable design table.
Toe nails are recommended to be driven at an approximate angle of 30 degrees with the piece and started approximately ⅓ of the length of the nail from the end or side of the piece. 6-02.3(17)I5
Timber Connection Adjustment for Duration of Load

Tabulated values for timber fasteners are for normal duration of load and may be increased for short duration loading, except for connections used in falsework and formwork for post tensioned Structures and staged construction sequences. Duration of load adjustment for timber connections shall not be allowed for all post tensioned
Structures and for staged construction sequences where delayed and/or staged loading occurs for any type of concrete Structure. The adjustment for duration of load as described in this section applies only to design values for timber connectors, such as nails, bolts, and lag screws. Allowable stresses for timber and structural steel components used in the connection, as described in Section 6-02.3(17)B, are maximums and thus shall not be increased.
Tabulated values for nails, bolts, and lag screws may be adjusted by the following duration-of-load factors: 1.
1.25 for falsework design governed by the minimum design horizontal load or greater (3 percent or greater of the dead load), 2.
1.33 for falsework design governed by wind load, and 3.
2.00 for falsework design governed by impact loading. 6-02.3(17)J
Face Lumber, Studs, Wales, and Metal Forms
Elements of this section shall be designed for the loads, allowable stresses, deflections, and conditions which pertain from other Subsections of Section 6-02.3(17).
Forms battered or inclined above the concrete will tend to lift up as concrete is placed and shall have positive anchorage or counterweights designed to resist uplift and shall be shown in the formwork plans. Where the concrete pouring sequence causes fresh concrete to be significantly higher along one side of tied forms than the opposite side, a positive form anchorage system shall be designed capable of resisting the imbalance of horizontal thrust, and prevent the dislocation and sliding of the entire form unit.
Wooden forms shall be faced with smooth sanded, exterior plywood. This plywood shall meet the requirements of the National Bureau of Standards, U.S. Product Standard PS 1, and the design specification of the American Plywood Association (APA). Each full sheet shall bear the APA stamp. The Contractor shall list in the form plans the grade and class of plywood. If the Engineer accepts the manufacturer’s certification of structural properties, the Contractor may use plywood that does not carry the APA stamp. Plywood panels stamped “shop” or “shop cutting”, shall not be used.
Plyform is an APA plywood specifically designed and manufactured for concrete forming.
Plyform differs from conventional exterior plywood grades in strength and the exterior face panels are sanded smooth and factory oiled. Likewise, there is a significant difference between grades designated Class 1, Class 2, and Structural I Plyform.

Concrete Structures
The grades of plywood for various form applications shall be as follows: 1.
Traffic and Pedestrian Barriers (except those that will receive an architectural surface treatment) – Plywood used for these surfaces shall be APA grade High-Density
Overlaid (HDO) Plyform Class I. But if the Contractor coats the form to prevent it from leaving joint and grain marks on the surface, plywood that meets or exceeds
APA grades B-B Plyform Class I or B-C (Group I species) may be used. Under this option, the Contractor shall provide for the Engineer’s acceptance a 4-foot-square, test panel of concrete formed with the same plywood and coating as proposed in the form plans. This panel shall include one form joint along its centerline. The Contractor shall apply coating material, according to the manufacturer’s instructions, before applying chemical release agents. 2.
Other Exposed Surfaces (all but those on traffic and pedestrian barriers) – Plywood used to form these surfaces shall meet or exceed the requirements of APA grades
B-B Plyform Class I or B-C (Group I series). If one face is less than B quality, the B (or better) face shall contact the concrete. 3.
Unexposed Surfaces (such as the underside of the bridge deck between girders, the interiors of box girders, or other concrete exposed surfaces not viewable to the public, and traffic and pedestrian barriers where surfaces will receive an architectural treatment) – Plywood used to form these surfaces may be APA grade CDX, provided the Contractor complies with stress and deflection requirements stated elsewhere in these Specifications.

Form joints on an exposed surface shall be in a horizontal or vertical plane. But in wingwalls and box girders, side form joints shall be placed at right angles and parallel to the Roadway grade. Joints parallel to studs or joists shall be backed by a stud or joist.
Joints at right angles to studs and joists shall be backed by a stud or other backing the
Engineer accepts. Perpendicular backing is not required if studs or joists are spaced: 1.
Nine inches or less on center and covered with ½-inch plywood, or 2.
Twelve inches or less on center and covered with ¾-inch plywood.
The face grain of plywood shall run perpendicular to studs or joists unless shown otherwise on the Contractor’s formwork Working Drawings. Proposals to deviate from the perpendicular orientation shall be accompanied by supporting calculations of the stresses and deflections.
Forming for all exposed curved surfaces shall follow the shape of the curve shown in the
Contract Plans and shall not be chorded except as follows. On any retaining wall that follows a horizontal circular curve, the wall stems may be a series of short chords if: 1.
The chords within the panel are the same length, unless otherwise allowed by the
Engineer;

2.
The chords do not vary from a true curve by more than ½ inch at any point; and 3.
All panel points are on the true curve.
Where architectural treatment is required, the angle point for chords in wall stems shall fall at vertical rustication joints.
For exposed surfaces of abutments, wingwalls, piers, retaining walls, and columns, the
Contractor shall build forms of plywood at least ¾ inch thick with studs no more than
12 inches on center. The Engineer may allow exceptions, but deflection of the plywood, studs, or wales shall never exceed 1⁄360 of the span (or 1⁄270 of the span for unexposed surfaces, including the bottom of the deck slab between girders).
All form plywood shall be at least ½ inch thick except on sharply curved surfaces. There, the Contractor may use ¼-inch plywood if it is backed firmly with heavier material.

Round columns or rounded pier shafts shall be formed with a self-supporting metal shell form or form tube that leaves a smooth, nonspiralling surface. Wood forms are not permitted.
Metal forms shall not be used elsewhere unless the Engineer is satisfied with the surface and allows use in writing. The Engineer may withdraw allowing use of metal forms at any time. If permitted to use a combination of wood and metal in forms, the Contractor shall coat the forms so that the texture produced by the wood matches that of the metal.
Aluminum shall not be used for metal forms.
For design purposes, the Contractor shall assume that on vertical surfaces concrete exerts
150 pounds per square foot per foot of depth. However, when the depth is reached where the rate of placement controls the pressure, the following table applies:
Pressure, Pounds per Square Foot for
Temperature of Concrete as Shown 60°F 70°F and Above 470 375 640 565 725 625 815 690 900 750 990 815 1,075 875 1,165 935 1,250 1,000 1,670 1,300

The pressures in the above table have been increased to provide an allowance for the vibration and impact.
All corners shall be beveled ¾ inch. However, footings, footing pedestals, and seals need not be beveled unless required in the Plans.
All forms shall be as mortar-tight as possible with no water standing in them as the concrete is placed.
The Contractor shall apply a parting compound on forms for exposed concrete surfaces.
This compound shall be a chemical release agent that permits the forms to separate cleanly from the concrete. The compound shall not penetrate or stain the surface and shall not attract dirt or other foreign matter. After the forms are removed, the concrete surface shall be dust-free and have a uniform appearance. The Contractor shall apply the compound at the manufacturer’s recommended rate to produce a surface free of dusting action and yet provide easy removal of the forms.
The Engineer may reject forms that will not produce a satisfactory surface. 6-02.3(17)K
Concrete Forms on Steel Spans
Concrete forms on all steel Structures shall be removable and shall not remain in place.
Where needed, the forms shall have openings for truss or girder members. Each opening shall be large enough to leave at least 1½ inches between the concrete and steel on all sides of the steel member after the forms have been removed. Unit Contract prices cover all costs related to these openings.
The Contractor shall not weld any part of the form to steel members.

Finishing Machine Support System

Before using finishing machines, the Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working Drawing consisting of detailed drawings that show the system proposed to support it. The
Contractor shall not attach this (or any other) equipment support system to the sides or suspend it from any girder unless the Engineer permits. The Engineer will not permit such a method if it will unduly alter stress patterns or create too much stress in the girder. 6-02.3(17)M
Restricted Overhead Clearance Sign 6-02.3(17)M1 Vehicular Traffic
The Contractor shall notify the Engineer not less than 15 working days before the anticipated start of each falsework and girder erection operation whenever such falsework or girders will reduce clearances available to the public traffic. Falsework openings shall not be more restrictive to traffic than shown in the Contract Plans.
Where the height of vehicular openings through falsework is less than 15 feet, a W 12-2 “Low Clearance Symbol Sign” shall be erected on the Shoulder in advance of the falsework and two or more W 12-301 and/or W 12-302 signs shall be attached to the falsework to provide accurate usable clearance information over the entire falsework opening. The posted low clearance shall include an allowance for anticipated falsework girder deflection (rounded-up to the next whole inch) due to design dead load, including all successive concrete pours. W 12-302 signs shall be used to designate prominent clearance restrictions and limits of usable clearance. In addition, where the clearance is less than the legal height limit (14 feet), a W 12-2 sign shall be erected in advance of the nearest intersecting road or wide point in the road at which a vehicle can detour or turn around.
A W 13-501 sign indicating the distance to the low clearance shall be installed below the advance sign. The Engineer will furnish the above noted signs and the Contractor shall erect and maintain them, all in accordance with Section 1-10.3(3). 6-02.3(17)M2 Railroad Traffic

Quality Control Plan. The SQCM shall submit a Type 1 Working Drawing with results of all visual inspections.
Radiographic examinations shall be performed on 25 percent of all complete joint penetration butt welded splices from a lot defined as 200, or a fraction thereof, of the same type of splice for each bar diameter that is used in the work.
The Contractor shall notify the Engineer in writing a minimum of 48 hours before performing radiographic examinations.
All required radiographic examinations shall be performed by the Contractor in accordance with ANSI/AWS D1.4/D1.4M:2018 and as specified below.
Before radiographic examination, welds shall conform to ANSI/AWS D1.4/D1.4M
Section 6.4. Radiographic acceptance shall be in accordance with ANSI/AWS D1.4/D1.4M
Table 6.1. Acceptance criteria for bar size #7 shall be the same as for bar size #8.
Should more than 12 percent of the splices which have been radiographically examined in any lot be defective, an additional 25 percent of the splices from the same lot, selected by the Engineer, or by the SQCM if the Engineer is not available, shall be radiographically

All defects shall be repaired in accordance with ANSI/AWS D1.4/D1.4M, latest edition.
The Contractor shall notify the Engineer in writing a minimum of 48 hours before performing any radiographic examinations.
The radiographic procedure used shall conform to ANSI/AWS D1.1, ANSI/AWS D1.4/
D1.4M:2018 Section 9.9, and the following: 1.
Two exposures shall be made for each splice. For each of the two exposures, the radiation source shall be centered on each bar to be radiographed. The first exposure shall be made with the radiation source placed at zero degrees from the top of the weld and perpendicular to the weld root and identified with a station mark of “0”. The second exposure shall be at 90 degrees to the “0” station mark and shall be identified with a station mark of “90”. When obstructions prevent a 90 degree placement of the radiation source for the second exposure, and when approved in writing by the
Engineer, the source may be rotated, around the centerline of the steel reinforcing bar, a maximum of 25 degrees. 2.
If more than one weld is to be radiographed during one exposure, the angle between the root line of each weld and the direction to the radiation source shall not be less than 65 degrees. 3.
Radiographs shall be made by either X-ray or gamma ray. Radiographs made by X-ray or gamma rays shall have densities of not less than 2.3 nor more than 3.5 in the area of interest. A tolerance of 0.05 in density is allowed for densitometer variations.
Gamma rays shall be from the iridium 192 isotope and the emitting specimen shall not exceed 0.18 inches in the greatest diagonal dimension.

4.
The radiographic film shall be placed perpendicular to the radiation source at all times; parallel to the root line of the weld unless source placement determines that the film shall be turned; and as close to the root of the weld as possible. 5.
The minimum source to film distance shall be maintained so as to ensure that all radiographs maintain a maximum geometric unsharpness of 0.020 at all times, regardless of the size of the steel reinforcing bars. 6.
Penetrameters shall be placed on the source side of the bar and perpendicular to the radiation source at all times. One penetrameter shall be placed in the center of each bar to be radiographed, perpendicular to the weld root, and adjacent to the weld.
Penetrameter images shall not appear in the weld area. 7.
