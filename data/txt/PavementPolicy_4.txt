3.8. Analysis Period The analysis period is the time period used for comparing design alternatives. An analysis period may contain several maintenance and rehabilitation activities during the life cycle of the pavement being evaluated (Peterson, 1985). In general, the recommended analysis period coincides with the useful life of the most durable alternative. WSDOT’s recommended analysis period for all pavement types is 50 years. 3.9. Risk Analysis The deterministic approach to life cycle costs involves the selection of discrete input values for the initial construction costs, routine maintenance and rehabilitation costs, the timing of each of these costs, and the discount rate. These values are then used to calculate a discrete single value for the present value of the specified project. The deterministic approach applies procedures and techniques without regard for the variability of inputs. An example of the deterministic approach is shown in below.

= $1,709,720 The deterministic approach is a viable method for determining life cycle costs; however, life cycle cost analysis contains several possible sources of uncertainty. In certain cases, the uncertainty factors may be sizeable enough to affect the ranking of the alternatives. To obtain more credible results, a systematic evaluation of risk should always be carried out. The primary disadvantage of the deterministic approach is that it does not account for the input parameter variability. The concept of risk comes from the uncertainty associated with future events – the inability to know what the future will bring in response to a given action today (FHWA, 1998). Risk analysis is concerned with three basic questions (FHWA, 1998): 1. What can happen? 2. How likely is it to happen? 3. What are the consequences of it happening? Risk analysis answers these questions by combining probabilistic descriptions of uncertain input parameters with computer simulation to characterize the risk associated with future outcomes (FHWA, 1998). It exposes areas of uncertainty typically hidden in the traditional deterministic approach to life cycle cost analysis, and it allows the decision maker to weigh the probability of an outcome actually occurring (FHWA, 1998). The two most commonly used methods of assessing the risk are probabilistic analysis and sensitivity analysis. The probabilistic approach combines probability descriptions of analysis inputs to generate the entire range of outcomes as well as the likelihood of occurrence. Probabilistic analysis represents uncertainties more realistically than does a sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis assigns the same weighting to all extreme or mean values, whereas probabilistic analysis assigns the lowest probability to extreme values. A probabilistic analysis is advocated, but if this is not possible, a sensitivity analysis at the very least should be carried out. 3.10.
Probabilistic Analysis
The probabilistic approach takes into account the uncertainty of the variables used as inputs in the life cycle cost analysis. The probability distribution is selected for each input variable, which are then used to generate the entire range of outcomes and the likelihood of occurrences for both the associated costs and the performance life. The procedure often used to apply a probability distribution is a “Monte Carlo Simulation”. The Monte Carlo Simulation is a computerized procedure that takes each input variable, assigns a range of values (using the mean and standard deviation of the input variable), and runs multiple combinations of all inputs and ranges to generate a life cycle cost probability distribution. Using the
84
WSDOT Pavement Policy probabilistic approach allows for the ability of determining the variability or “spread” of the life cycle cost distributions and determining which alternative has the lower associated risk (see Figure A3.4). WSDOT input values for the probabilistic analysis are contained in Appendix 5. probabilistic analysis is included in Appendix 6.
An example of a
By performing the Monte Carlo computer simulation, thousands, even tens of thousands of samples are randomly drawn from each input distribution to calculate a separate what-if scenario (FHWA, 1998). Risk analysis results are presented in the form of a probability distribution that describes the range of possible outcomes along with a probability weighting of occurrence (FHWA, 1998). With this information, the decision maker knows not only the full range of possible values, but also the relative probability of any particular outcome actually occurring (FHWA, 1998).
The narrower the distribution - the less associated risk

Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis is a technique used to determine the influence of major input assumptions, projections, and estimates on life cycle cost analysis results. In a sensitivity analysis, major input values are varied (either within some percentage of the initial value or over a range of values) while all other input values remain constant and the amount of change in results is noted (FHWA, 1998). An example of a sensitivity analysis is shown below.

Two pavement design strategies with discount rates that vary from two to six percent over a 35-year analysis period will be described. Figure A3.5 summarizes Tables A3.6 and A3.7 show the comparison of net present value at the various discount rates. For this example, Alternative 1 is more expensive at discount rates of five percent and lower, while Alternative 2 is more expensive at discount rates six percent and above.

A primary drawback of the sensitivity analysis is that the analysis gives equal weight to any input value assumptions, regardless of the likelihood of occurring (FHWA, 1998). In other words, the extreme values (best case and worst case) are given the same likelihood of occurrence as the expected value, which is not realistic (FHWA, 1998).
Project Specific Details After completing the pavement design analysis and the life cycle cost analysis, evaluation of project specific details must be identified when there are two or more viable alternatives. Finding the HMA and PCCP alternatives to be approximately equivalent, in regards to life cycle cost, the Region must provide project specific details that support the selected pavement type. The fact that these are not easily quantified does not lessen their importance; in fact these factors may be the overriding reason for making the final pavement type selection. These decision factors should be carefully reviewed and considered, by WSDOT engineers most knowledgeable of the corridor and the surrounding environment. When reporting the project specific details for pavement type selection, the Region must not use reasoning or examples that have already been taken into account within the pavement design analysis or the life cycle cost analysis. Examples of reasoning that should not be presented in the project specific details include: 1. Availability of funds for the more expensive pavement type. 2. Supporting the choice for pavement type based on ESALs or average daily traffic (ADT) that has already accounted for in the life cycle cost analysis. 3. Supporting the choice for pavement type based on user delay that has already accounted for in the life cycle cost analysis. The Region should include the engineering reasons that suggest the selection of one pavement type over another, given that their life cycle costs are approximately equivalent. Not all factors will come into play on every project, nor will all factors have equal weight or importance on each project. Refer to Appendix 7 for a listing of these considerations.

PAVEMENT TYPE SELECTION SR 704 Cross Base Highway MP 0.00 to MP 6.00 Vicinity
The Pavement Type Selection Committee has completed its review of the pavement type selection for project SR 704 Cross Base Highway located in central Pierce County. This project consists of constructing a new six-mile long East-West divided highway connecting Interstate 5 at Thorne Lane and State Route 7 at 176th Street. The proposed roadway section will consist of two Eastbound and two Westbound 12-ft. lanes with 4-ft. inside and 10-ft. outside shoulders. The design allows for the addition of future HOV lanes in the median. Following the procedure in the Pavement Type Selection Protocol, the analysis indicates the following: I. Pavement Design Analysis. There are no pavement design issues. Both Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) and Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) are viable alternatives. II. Life Cycle Cost Analysis. The HMA cost is 50-53% less than PCC. HMA is the selected option. III. Engineering Analysis. Not performed. The Life Cycle Cost difference is greater than 15% between the two pavement types. The Committee based on this analysis approves the use of HMA on this project.

1. Foundation Analysis and Results
I. Pavement Design Analysis
The SR 704 Cross Base Highway Project is located in central Pierce County. This project will create a new six-mile long, East-W est connection between I-5 at Thorne Lane (MP 123.5) and SR 7 at 176th St. (MP 48.3). The proposed multi-lane highway will consist of (4) 12-ft. lanes, 46-ft. wide median, 4-ft. inside shoulders and 10-ft. outside shoulders. The project is designed to provide for future HOV lanes in the median.
SR 704 Project
The purpose of this document is to evaluate and recommend either a hot mix asphalt (HMA) pavement or portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement for SR 704-Cross Base Highway. The W ashington State Department of Transportation (W SDOT) Pavement Type Selection Protocol will be used to compare and evaluate these two alternatives. The Protocol requires that a pavement type be selected based on the evaluation of three primary areas: pavement design, life cycle cost and project specific externalities.

II. Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) 1. The LCCA is based on the following parameters:
• Roadway Section: A one-mile section of roadway located between MP 3 and 4 was chosen to represent a typical section.
• Economic Variables: Estimated initial construction costs, future rehabilitation costs and user costs for this analysis are in 2005 dollars using a 4% discount rate.
• Traffic Data: The initial traffic volume of 15,000 ADT and annual growth factor of 1.92% were provided from a consulting firm contracted by the Olympia Design Office. Initial construction will not have traffic; therefore, no user cost will be assessed.
• Truck Percentage o Single Unit Trucks (4.0%) o Combination Trucks (6.0%)
• Free Flow Capacity: The LCCA software calculated a Free Flow Capacity of 2137 based on the Transportation Research Board’s “1994 Highway Capacity Manual”.
• Traffic Speed during Work Zone Conditions: A 40 mph reduced speed limit was used during the work zone lane closure periods.
• Functional Classification: This highway was assigned a “Rural” functional classification due to its location and population density.
• Queue Dissipation Capacity: Queue Dissipation Capacity of 1,818 passenger cars/lane/hour was used for all rehabilitation cycles on both alternatives.
• Maximum ADT (Both Directions): The ADT for this analysis was capped at 140,000.
• Maximum Queue Length (Miles): On this project, a maximum queue length of 2.0 miles was assumed.
• Work Zone Capacity: The work zone capacity of 1,340 vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) was used during lane closure periods.
• Day-time/Night-time Lane Closures: This hourly input is based on a 24-hour clock and marks the beginning and ending hours when a lane reduction will be in place during construction activities: o Day-time – Inbound: 9:00 a.m. start time of lane closure and 5:00 p.m. for the reopening time. – Outbound: 6:00 a.m. start time of lane closure and 3:00 p.m. for the reopening time.

Percent Difference
III. Project specific externalities Identification of project specific externalities is not required, since the cost difference between HMA and PCC alternatives is greater than 15%. The HMA alternative is between 50 and 53 % less than the PCCP alternative for all cases. The Olympic Region recommends the use of HMA for constructing SR 704. Use of HMA represents a substantial savings to WSDOT.
