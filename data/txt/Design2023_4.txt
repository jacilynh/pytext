Estimated project costs. May use project costs from similar locations of the alternative as cost justification. A qualitative discussion of life cycle cost using the following considerations: Annual maintenance and operations cost. For signals, this should include the cost of signal engineers and technicians to review and implement signal timings and respond to malfunctions and emerging issues. This value can be obtained from the region Traffic Office. Travel time savings in all hours of the day. Societal cost savings (considered as the Benefit in the analysis) of reduced crash frequency and/or severity using a predictive method as described in Chapter 321 and the Safety Analysis Guide. See the Safety Analysis Guide for WSDOT Societal Costs for crash severities. Salvage value of right of way, grading and drainage, and structures.
Step 5: Selection – Based on performance tradeoffs and documented project needs, select the recommended alternative.

•
•
•
•
•
•
Review the corridor sketch plans and database with the regional planning office. Information from a corridor or planning study. Current and future land use and whether or not the intersection control will reasonably accommodate future land use traffic changes. Community engagement and local agency coordination and comments. Effect on future local agency projects. Other elements considered in the selection of the intersection control.
1300.05(4) Community Engagement Community engagement is a necessary element of project development. Technical, public, and political aspects must be considered. It is critical that community engagement efforts occur with preparation and well-organized content regarding the known performance data associated with different control types to inform communities of the distinct differences between control types with respect to the existing and future contexts and modes.

Intersection Control Type
Use the baseline and contextual needs (see Chapter 1101) identified by the team and informed by the community to help support the options being considered to change operational and safety performance at a given location.
There is often concern from communities regarding control types that may be under consideration, especially the types of intersections that may seem unfamiliar or that break from the traditional approach. Education and outreach efforts, if necessary, are collaborative and are most useful during the analysis and early scoping stages. Follow the guidelines of WSDOT’s Community Engagement Plan (www.wsdot.wa.gov/planning/), and document the effort as indicated in Chapter 1100.
1300.05(5) Approval The ICE shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed Professional Engineer. Approval of the ICE (see Chapter 300 for more information) requires the following:
•
•
Region Traffic Engineer Approval HQ Traffic Approval
1300.05(6) Local Agency or Developer-Initiated Intersections Chapter 320 provides guidance for preparation of a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA). Early in the design process, local agencies and developers should coordinate with the region office to identify specific intersections for further analysis. The project initiator provides an Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) for approaches and intersections with state routes per Section 1300.05, or references this information in the TIA. The project initiator documents the design considerations and submits the ICE and all documentation to the region for approval (per Section 1300.05). After the ICE is approved, finalize the intersection design and obtain approval per Chapter 300 (for documentation), Chapter 1310 (for intersections), Chapter 1320 (for roundabouts), and Chapter 1330 (for traffic signals).

1310.01 General Intersections are a critical part of Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) highway design because of increased conflict potential. Design intersections for the needs of motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians based on the examples provided in this chapter and incorporating the specific design elements as described for each where appropriate. Traffic and driver characteristics, bicycle and pedestrian needs, physical features, and economics are considered during the scoping and design stages to develop channelization and traffic control to provide multimodal traffic flow through intersections. Channelization, which is the separation or regulation of traffic movements into delineated paths of travel, can facilitate the orderly movement of pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles. Channelization includes left-turn lanes, right-turn lanes, speed change lanes (both acceleration and deceleration lanes), and islands. If pedestrian facilities are present, the design objective becomes one of reducing the potential for vehicle/pedestrian conflicts. This is done by minimizing pedestrian crossing distances and controlling the speeds of turning vehicles. Pedestrian refuge islands can be beneficial. See chapters in the 1100 series for instruction on multimodal practical design, including identifying project needs, context, design controls, modal performance, alternatives analysis, and design element dimensioning. This chapter provides guidance for designing intersections, including ramp terminals. Refer to the following for additional information: Chapter 1103 Design controls

Intersections
1310.02 Designing for Motor Vehicles Consider all potential users of the facility in the design of an intersection. This involves addressing the needs of a diverse mix of user groups, including passenger cars, heavy vehicles of varying classifications, bicycles, and pedestrians. Often, meeting the needs of one user group results in a compromise in service to others. Intersection design balances these competing needs, resulting in appropriate levels of operation for all users. In addition to reducing the number of conflicts, minimize the conflict area as much as possible while still providing for the design vehicle (see Chapter 1103). This is done to control the speed of turning vehicles and reduce the area of exposure for vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. For additional information on pedestrian needs, see Chapter 1510. For intersections with shared-use paths, see Chapter 1515. For bicycle considerations at intersections, see Chapter 1520.
1310.02(1) Non-Geometric Considerations Geometric design considerations, such as sight distance and intersection angle, are important. Equally important are perception, contrast, and a driver’s age. Perception is a factor in the majority of crashes. Regardless of the type of intersection, the function depends on the driver’s ability to perceive what is happening with respect to the surroundings and other vehicles. When choosing an acceptable gap, the driver first identifies the approaching vehicle and then determines its speed. The driver uses visual clues provided by the immediate surroundings in making these decisions. Thus, given equal sight distance, it may be easier for the driver to judge a vehicle’s oncoming speed when there are more objects to pass by in the driver’s line of sight. Contrast allows drivers to discern one object from another.
1310.02(2) Intersection Angle and Roadway Alignment An important intersection design characteristic is the intersection angle. The desirable intersection angle is 90°, with 60° to 120° allowed. Do not put angle points on the roadway alignments within intersection areas or on the through roadway alignment within 100 feet of the edge of traveled way of a crossroad. However, angle points within the intersection are allowed at intersections with a minor through movement, such as at a ramp terminal (see Exhibit 1310-2). When feasible, locate intersections such that curves do not begin or end within the intersection area. It is desirable to locate the PC and PT 250 feet or more from the intersection so that a driver can settle into the curve before the gap in the striping for the intersection area. Do not locate short curves where both the PC and PT are within the intersection area.
1310.02(3) Lane Alignment It is desirable that entering through traffic is aligned with the exit lanes. However, the entering and exit lanes may be offset up to 6 feet when the following conditions are met:
•
•
•
•
Illumination is provided. The intersection is not within a horizontal curve, nor is it within a crest vertical curve. The taper rates provided in Exhibit 1310-1 are used. There is a posted speed of 55 mph or less.
Consider dotted extension lines that continue through the intersection.

1310.02(4) Intersection Spacing Provide intersection spacing for efficient operation of the highway. The minimum design intersection spacing for highways with limited access control is covered in Chapter 530. For other highways, the minimum design intersection spacing is dependent on the managed access highway class. (See Chapter 540 for minimum intersection spacing on managed access highways.) As a minimum, provide enough space between intersections for left-turn lanes and storage length. Space signalized intersections and intersections expected to be signalized to maintain efficient signal operation. Space intersections so that queues will not block an adjacent intersection. Evaluate existing intersections that are spaced less than shown in Chapter 530 and Chapter 540. Also, evaluate closing or restricting movements at intersections with operational issues. Document the spacing of existing intersections that will remain in place and the effects of the spacing on operation, capacity, and circulation.

Intersections
1310.02(5) Accommodating vs. Designing for Vehicles Accommodating for a vehicle allows encroachment of other lanes, shoulders, or other elements to complete the required maneuver. Designing for a vehicle does not require encroachment on those elements. There are competing design objectives when considering the crossing needs of pedestrians and the turning needs of larger vehicles. To design for large design vehicles, larger turn radii are used. This results in increased pavement areas, longer pedestrian crossing distances, and longer traffic signal arms. (See Chapter 1103 for design vehicle selection criteria.) When appropriate, to reduce the intersection area, consider accommodating for large vehicles instead of designing for them. This reduces the potential for vehicle/pedestrian conflicts, decreases pedestrian crossing distance, and controls the speeds of turning vehicles. Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify the design.
1310.02(6) Sight Distance For stopping and decision sight distance criteria, see Chapter 1260. Intersection sight distance criteria are discussed in Section 1310.02(10).
1310.02(7) Crossroads When the crossroad is a city street or county road, design the crossroad beyond the intersection area in cooperation with the local agency. When the crossroad is a state facility, design the crossroad according to the Design Manual. Continue the cross slope of the through roadway shoulder as the grade for the crossroad. Use a vertical curve that is at least 60 feet long to connect to the grade of the crossroad. Evaluate the profile of the crossroad in the intersection area. The crown slope of the main line might need to be adjusted in the intersection area to improve the profile for the cross traffic. Design the grade at the crosswalk to meet the requirements for accessibility. (See Chapter 1510 for additional crosswalk information.) In areas that experience accumulations of snow and ice for all legs that require traffic to stop, design a maximum grade of ±4% for a length equal to the anticipated queue length for stopped vehicles.
1310.02(8) Rural Expressway At-Grade Intersections Evaluate grade separations at all intersections on rural expressways. Design high-speed at-grade intersections on rural expressways as indirect left turns, split intersections, or roundabouts. The State Traffic Engineer’s approval is required for any new intersection or signal on a rural expressway.
1310.02(9) Interchange Ramp Terminals When stop control or traffic signal control is selected, the design to be used or modified is shown in Exhibit 1310-2. Higher-volume intersections with multiple ramp lanes are designed individually. Provide ramp terminal designs consistent with the speed of the crossroad.
WSDOT Design Manua M 22-01.22

Chapter 1310
Intersections
Where stop control or signal control is implemented, the intersection configuration criteria for ramp terminals are normally the same as for other intersections. One exception is that an angle point is allowed between an offramp and an on-ramp. This is because the through movement of traffic getting off the freeway, going through the intersection, and getting back on the freeway is minor. Another exception is at ramp terminals where the through movement is eliminated (for example, at a singlepoint interchange). For ramp terminals that have two wye connections, one for right turns and the other for left turns, and no through movement, the intersection angle has little meaning and does not need to be considered. Due to the probable development of large traffic generators adjacent to an interchange, width for a median on the local road is desirable whenever such development is expected. This allows for future left-turn channelization. Use median channelization when justified by capacity determination and analysis or by the need to provide a smooth traffic flow. Adjust the alignment of the intersection legs to fit the traffic movements and to discourage wrong-way movements. Use the allowed intersecting angles of 60° to 120° in designing the best alignment for efficiency and intersection operations. Exhibit 1310-2 Ramp Terminal Intersection Details
Notes: [1] For right-turn corner design, see Exhibit 1310-8. [2] Use turn simulation software to verify that the design vehicle can make the turn. [3] For taper rates, see Exhibit 1310-15, Table 1.
1310.02(10) Intersection Sight Distance (Eye Height – 3.5 ft, Object Height – 2.0 ft) Providing drivers the ability to see stop signs, traffic signals, and oncoming traffic in time to react accordingly will reduce the probability of conflicts occurring at an intersection. Avoiding conflicts is dependent on the judgment, abilities, and actions of all drivers using the intersection. The driver of a vehicle that is stopped and waiting to cross or enter a through roadway needs obstruction-free sight triangles in order to see enough of the through roadway to complete all legal maneuvers before an approaching vehicle on the through roadway can reach the intersection. Use Exhibit 1310-3 to determine minimum intersection sight distance along the through roadway.
WSDOT Design Manua M 22-01.22 
Page 1310-5
Chapter 1310
Intersections
The sight triangle is determined as shown in Exhibit 1310-4. Within the sight triangle, lay back the cut slopes and remove, lower, or move hedges, trees, signs, utility poles, signal poles, and anything else large enough to be a sight obstruction. Eliminate parking to remove vehicles that would be obstructions to sight distance. In order to maintain the sight distance, the sight triangle must be within the right of way or a state maintenance easement (see Section 510.03(2)(a)).
1310.02(10)(a) New or Existing Highways New intersections or existing highways require a setback distance of 18 feet from the edge of traveled way for the sight triangle. This represents the position of the driver’s eye when the vehicle is stopped 10 feet from the edge of traveled way. The driver is typically 8 feet or less from the front of the vehicle; therefore, 8 feet are added to the 10 foot setback. When the stop bar is placed more than 10 feet from the edge of traveled way, provide the sight triangle to a point 8 feet back of the stop bar. Provide a clear sight triangle for the SU-30 vehicle. If there is significant combination truck traffic, use the common WB vehicle rather than the SU-30. In areas where SU-30 or WB vehicles are minimal and right of way restrictions limit sight triangle clearing, only the P vehicle sight distance needs to be provided.
1310.02(10)(b) Existing Intersections At existing intersections, where sight obstructions within the sight triangle cannot be removed due to limited right of way, the setback distance may be reduced. Drivers who do not have the desired sight distance creep out until the sight distance is available; therefore, the setback may be reduced to 10 feet. Document the intersection location, available sight distance, and right of way width; and provide a brief analysis of the intersection sight distance clarifying the reasons for reduction. Verify and document that there is no identified crash trend at the intersection.
1310.02(10)(c) All Intersections (Section Rewritten 2023) For all intersections, if the intersection sight distance cannot be provided, use the stopping sight distance of the vehicles travelling on the major roadway and document with a Design Analysis. (See Chapter 1260 for required stopping sight distance.) This will require a Deign Analysis with a brief analysis of the intersection sight distance clarifying the reasons for having to rely on mainline vehicle stopping sight distance. Verify and record that there is no identified crash trend involving intersection sight distance.
1310.02(10)(d) Other Sight Distance Situations At intersections controlled by traffic signals, provide sight distance for right-turning vehicles. For intersections controlled by the geometry of roundabouts, see Chapter 1320. Designs for movements that cross divided highways are influenced by median widths. If the median is wide enough to store the design vehicle, with a 3-foot clearance at both ends of the vehicle, sight distances are determined in two steps. The first step is for crossing from a stopped position to the median storage. The second step is for the movement, either across or left into the through roadway. Design sight distance for ramp terminals as at-grade intersections with only left- and right-turning movements. An added element at ramp terminals is the grade separation structure. Exhibit 1310-4 gives the sight distance guidance in the vicinity of a structure. In addition, when the crossroad is an undercrossing, check the sight distance under the structure graphically using a truck eye height of 6 feet and an object height of 1.5 feet. Document a brief description of the intersection area, sight distance restrictions, and traffic characteristics to support the design vehicle and sight distances chosen.

1310.02(11) Wrong-Way Movement Countermeasures Wrong-way crashes, though infrequent, have the potential to be more serious than other types of crashes, especially on high-speed facilities. Crash data show that impaired and older drivers are overrepresented and that a high percentage of these crashes occur at night. Washington State data show approximately equal numbers of crashes on the Interstate and multilane urban principal arterial highways. Discourage wrong-way maneuvers at all stages of design.
1310.02(11)(a) Wrong-Way Driving Countermeasure Categories There are three categories of countermeasures used to discourage wrong-way driving:
•
•
•
Signing and delineation Intelligent transportation systems Geometric design
i Signing and Delineation Signing and delineation countermeasures include:
•
•
•
•
•
DO NOT ENTER and WRONG WAY signs. ONE WAY signs. Turn restriction signs. Guideposts with red delineation. Red-backed raised pavement markers (RPMs).
•
•
•
Directional pavement arrows. Yellow edge line on left and white edge line on right side of exit ramps. Pavement marking extension lines to direct drivers to the correct ramp.
DO NOT ENTER and WRONG WAY signs may be more effective when they are lowered to 4 feet above the edge of traveled way as they are better illuminated by low-beam headlights. Do not lower these signs when the height obscures intersection sight distance, interferes with pedestrian or bicyclists’ movements, or where snow or vegetation will block viewing of the sign.
ii Intelligent Transportation Systems Wrong-way ITS countermeasures are wrong-way detection and warning systems. Contact the region Traffic Office for assistance when considering an ITS wrong-way warning system.
iii Geometric Design Geometric countermeasures include separating wrong-way movements from other movements, discouraging wrong-way movements, encouraging right-way movements, and improving the visibility of the right-way movement. a. Separate On- and Off-Ramp Terminals Consider the separation of on- and off-ramp terminals, particularly at interchanges where the ramp terminals are closely spaced (for example, partial cloverleaf ramps combined with other ramps). Wider medians between off- and on-ramp terminals provide room for signing and allow the median end to be shaped to help direct vehicles onto the correct roadway. The minimum width of the raised median is 7 feet, face of curb to face of curb, to accommodate a 36-inch sign. Extend the raised median on a two-way ramp from the ramp terminal intersection to the split of the onand off-ramps. The median outside of the intersection area may be reduced to the width of a dual-faced mountable curb. (See Exhibit 1310-5 for an example of the minimum median at the terminal of a two-way ramp.)

Intersections
Exhibit 1310-5 Median at Two-Way Ramp Terminal
b. Reduced Off-Ramp Terminal Throat Width Reducing the width of the off-ramp throat has been a successful method of discouraging wrong-way movements. A smaller opening makes the wrong-way entry less inviting, particularly for closely spaced ramps. When off-ramp terminals have right-turn lanes, a raised island will reduce the potential for a wrong-way movement. c. Increased On-Ramp Terminal Throat Width Increasing the width of the on-ramp throat can encourage right-way movements. A larger opening for the on-ramp makes it easier to turn into. To increase the throat width of on-ramps, use flat radii for left- and right-turning traffic and remove islands.

Chapter 1310
Intersections
d. Intersection Balance When drivers make a left turn, they are required to leave the intersection in the extreme left-hand lane lawfully available. As a result, left-turning drivers tend to head for a point between 50% and 60% of the way through the intersection. At a two-way ramp terminal, the desirable throat width for the on-ramp roadway is not less than the offramp roadway width to accommodate this behavior (see Exhibit 1310-6). Much of this can be achieved by adjusting the stop bar position on the interchange cross street. Exhibit 1310-6 Intersection Balance Example
e. Visibility When drivers can see and recognize the roadway they want to turn onto, they are less likely to make a mistake and turn onto the wrong roadway. For two-way ramps and divided multilane roadways with barrier in the median, end the barrier far enough from the intersection that a left-turning driver can see and recognize the roadway going the correct direction. Drivers need to see the delineation pavement markings, curbs, or other elements to locate the correct roadway. f. Angular Corners on the Left of Off-Ramp Terminals Angular corners on the left side of off-ramp terminals will discourage wrong-way right turns. Provide a corner design as angular as feasible that will provide for the left turn from the off-ramp. Circular curves can look inviting for a wrong-way right turn onto the off-ramp (see Exhibit 1310-2).

•
•
•
•
•
Enlarged warning signs. Directional pavement arrows at ramp terminals. Redundant signing and pavement arrows. Roundabout ramp terminal intersections, where room is available. Red-backed RPMs.
ii One-Way Diamond Off-Ramp Diamond interchanges are common, and although drivers are familiar with them, they can still get confused and go the wrong way. In addition to signing and pavement markings for these interchanges, provide:
•
Angular corners to discourage wrong-way right turns.
iii Diamond Interchange with Advance Storage Diamond interchanges with advance storage have left-turn storage lanes that extend from the on-ramp past the off-ramp (see Exhibit 1310-7). This allows for a potential early left turn onto the off-ramp. Following are additional countermeasures for interchanges with advanced left-turn storage:
•
•
Provide a raised median to discourage the wrong-way left turn. Provide signing and directional arrows to direct traffic to the correct left-turn point.

iv Two-Way Ramps Two-way ramps have the on- and off-ramp adjacent to each other. They are used at partial cloverleaf, trumpet, and button hook interchanges. Because the on and off roadways are close to each other, they are more vulnerable to wrong-way driving. Also, when the separation between on and off traffic is striping only, the ramps are susceptible to drivers entering the correct roadway and inadvertently crossing to the wrong ramp. In addition to signing and delineation, the following are countermeasures for two-way ramps:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Separate the on- and off-ramp terminals. Reduce off-ramp terminal throat width. Increase on-ramp terminal throat width. Maintain intersection balance. Improve on-ramp visibility. Provide a raised median or dual-faced curb from the ramp terminal intersection to the gore nose.

v HOV Direct Access Ramps HOV direct access ramps are two-way ramps in the median; therefore, the ability to provide separation between the on and off traffic is limited by the width of the median. An additional concern is that HOV direct access ramps are left-side ramps. Drivers normally enter the freeway using a right-side ramp and they may mistakenly travel the wrong way on a left-side ramp. Review existing and proposed signing for inadvertent misdirection. (See Chapter 1420 for HOV direct access and countermeasures for wrong-way driving at HOV direct access ramps.)
vi Multilane Divided Roadways Wrong-way driving can also occur on multilane divided nonfreeway facilities. Wrong-way drivers may enter multilane divided facilities at driveways and at-grade intersections. Countermeasures for wrong-way driving on nonfreeway multilane divided highways include:
•
•
Wrong-way signing and delineation at the intersections. Right-in/right-out road approaches.
1310.02(12) Right-Turn Corners Exhibit 1310-8 shows initial ranges for right-turn corner designs using a simple curve with a taper. These are considered approximate pavement areas to ensure the design vehicles do not encroach into the adjacent lane at either leg of the curve. Other design considerations may include a combination of simple or compound curves, tapers at the beginning or end of the turn, and so on. Verify the design vehicle can make the turn using turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®). Depending on the context of the roadway and right-turn corner (which vehicles will be designed for, and which vehicles will be accommodated), there may be several design considerations. Consider vehicle-pedestrian conflicts; vehicle encroachment on the shoulder or adjacent same-direction lane at the exit leg; capacity restrictions for right-turning vehicles or other degradation of intersection operations; and the effects on other traffic movements.

1310.02(13) Left-Turn Lanes and Turn Radii Left-turn lanes provide storage, separate from the through lanes, for left-turning vehicles waiting for a signal to change or for a gap in opposing traffic. (See Section 1310.02(16) for a discussion on speed change lanes.) Design left-turn channelization to provide sufficient operational flexibility to function under peak loads and adverse conditions.
1310.02(13)(a) One-Way Left-Turn Lanes One-way left-turn lanes are separate storage lanes for vehicles turning left from one roadway onto another. One-way left-turn lanes may be an economical way to lessen delays and crash potential involving left-turning vehicles.

In addition, they can allow deceleration clear of the through traffic lanes. Provide a minimum storage length of 100 feet for one-way left-turn lanes. When evaluating left-turn lanes, include impacts to all intersection movements and users. At signalized intersections, use a traffic signal analysis to determine whether a left-turn lane is needed and the storage length. If the length determined is less than the 100-foot minimum, make it 100 feet (see Chapter 1330). At unsignalized intersections, use the following as a guide to determine whether or not to provide one-way leftturn lanes:
•
•
•
•
A traffic analysis indicates congestion reduction with a left-turn lane. On two-lane highways, use Exhibit 1310-9, based on total traffic volume (DHV) for both directions and percent left- turn traffic, to determine whether further investigation is needed. On four-lane highways, use Exhibit 1310-10 to determine whether a left-turn lane is recommended. A study indicates crash reduction with a left-turn lane. Restrictive geometrics require left-turning vehicles to slow greatly below the speed of the through traffic. There is less than decision sight distance for traffic approaching a vehicle stopped at the intersection to make a left turn.
A traffic analysis based on the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) may also be used to determine whether leftturn lanes are needed to maintain the desired level of service.

Design opposing left-turn design vehicle paths with a minimum 4-foot (12-foot desirable) clearance between opposing turning paths. Where one-way left-turn channelization with curbing is to be provided, evaluate surface water runoff and design additional drainage facilities if needed to control the runoff.

*Length from Exhibit 1310-10 and Exhibit 1310-11, Exhibit 1310-12, or Exhibit 1310-13. At signalized intersections with high left-turn volumes, double (or triple) left-turn lanes may be needed to maintain the desired level of service. For a double left-turn, a throat width of 30 to 36 feet is desirable on the exit leg of the turn to offset vehicle offtracking and the difficulty of two vehicles turning abreast. Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify that the design vehicle can complete the turn. Where the design vehicle is a WB 40 or larger, it is desirable to provide for the design vehicle in the outside lane and an SU30 vehicle turning abreast rather than two design vehicles turning abreast. Exhibit 1310-15 through Exhibit 1310-20 show left-turn lane geometrics, which are described as follows:
i Modifications to Left-Turn Designs The left-turn lane designs discussed above and given in Exhibit 1310-15 through Exhibit 1310-19 may be modified when determined by design element dimensioning (see Chapter 1106.) Document the benefits and impacts of the modified design, including changes to vehicle-pedestrian conflicts; vehicle encroachment; deceleration length; capacity restrictions for turning vehicles or other degradation of intersection operations; and the effects on other traffic movements. Provide a modified design that supports the design vehicle, and provide for the striping (see the Standard Plans and the MUTCD). Verify the design vehicle can make the turn using turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®); include a plot of the design and verification.

ii Widening It is desirable that offsets and pavement widening (see Exhibit 1310-15) be symmetrical about the centerline or baseline. Where right of way or topographic restrictions, crossroad alignments, or other circumstances preclude symmetrical widening, pavement widening may be on one side only.
iii Divided Highways Widening is not needed for left-turn lane channelization where medians are 11 feet wide or wider (see Exhibit 1310-16 through Exhibit 1310-18). For medians between 13 feet and 23 feet or where the acceleration lane is not provided, it is desirable to design the left-turn lane adjacent to the opposing lane (see Exhibit 1310-16) to improve sight distance and increase opposing left-turn clearances.

A median acceleration lane (see Exhibit 1310-17 and Exhibit 1310-18) may be provided where the median is 23 feet or wider. The median acceleration lane might not be needed at a signalized intersection. When a median acceleration lane is to be used, design it in accordance with Section 1310.02(16), Speed Change Lanes. Where medians have sufficient width, provide a 2-foot shoulder adjacent to a left-turn lane.
iv Minimum Protected Left Turn with a Median At intersections on divided highways where channelized left-turn lanes are not provided, provide the minimum protected storage area (see Exhibit 1310-19).
1310.02(13)(b) Two-Way Left-Turn Lanes Two-way left-turn lanes (TWLTLs) are located between opposing lanes of traffic. They are used by vehicles making left turns from either direction, from or onto the roadway. Use TWLTLs only on managed access highways where there are no more than two through lanes in each direction. Evaluate installation of TWLTLs where:
•
•
•
A crash study indicates reduced crashes with a TWLTL. There are existing closely spaced access points or minor street intersections. There are unacceptable through traffic delays or capacity reductions because of left-turning vehicles.
TWLTLs can reduce delays to through traffic, reduce rear-end crashes, and provide separation between opposing lanes of traffic. However, they do not provide refuge for pedestrians and can encourage strip development with additional closely spaced access points. Evaluate other alternatives (such as prohibiting midblock left turns and providing for U-turns) before using a TWLTL. (See Chapter 540 for additional restrictions on the use of TWLTLs, and Chapter 1230 for discussion of road diets, which commonly employ a center turn lane.) The basic design for a TWLTL is illustrated in Exhibit 1310-20. Additional criteria are as follows:
•
•
•
•
The desirable length of a TWLTL is not less than 250 feet. Provide illumination in accordance with the guidelines in Chapter 1040. Pavement markings, signs, and other traffic control devices must be in accordance with the MUTCD and the Standard Plans. Provide clear channelization when changing from TWLTLs to one-way left-turn lanes at an intersection.

1310.02(14) Islands An island is a defined area within an intersection between traffic lanes for the separation of vehicle movements or for pedestrian refuge. Pedestrian refuge islands can be beneficial because they minimize the pedestrian crossing distance, reduce the conflict area, and minimize the impacts on vehicular traffic. Within an intersection, a median is considered an island. Design islands to clearly delineate the traffic channels to drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists. When designing islands, speeds can be reduced by designing the turning roadway with a taper or large radius curve at the beginning of the turn and a small radius curve at the end. This allows larger islands while forcing the turning traffic to slow down. Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify the design. Traffic islands perform the following functions:
•
•
•
•
•
Channelization islands control and direct traffic movements. Divisional islands separate traffic movements. Refuge islands provide refuge for pedestrians and bicyclists crossing the roadway. Islands can provide for the placement of traffic control devices and luminaires. Islands can provide areas within the roadway for landscaping.
WSDOT Design Manua M 22-01.22 
Page 1310-29
Chapter 1310
Intersections
Traffic islands can create a right turn slip lane where traffic control can differ from the traffic control used for other vehicular movements through the intersection. Slip lanes introduce an additional area where pedestrians and bicyclists are exposed to motor vehicle traffic. Designing intersections without traffic islands, removing existing slip lanes, or enhancing the design of slip lanes can provide benefits for pedestrians and bicyclists. Where traffic islands and associated slip lanes are deemed necessary, active transportation design elements may be available to manage speed (see Section 1510.10), reduce exposure, and increase the conspicuity of vulnerable users crossing these features. Consult with HQ Active Transportation Division for design recommendations when evaluating traffic islands and slip lanes.
1310.02(14)(a) Size and Shape Divisional islands are normally elongated and at least 4 feet wide and 20 feet long. Channelization islands are normally triangular. In rural areas, 75 ft2 is the minimum island area and 100 ft2 is desirable. In urban areas where posted speeds are 25 mph or slower, smaller islands are acceptable. Use islands with at least 200 ft2 if pedestrians will be crossing or traffic control devices or luminaires will be installed. Design triangular-shaped islands as shown in Exhibit 1310-21 through Exhibit 1310-23. The shoulder and offset widths illustrated are for islands with vertical curbs 6 inches or higher. Where painted islands are used, such as in rural areas, these widths are desirable but may be omitted. (See Chapter 1240 for desirable turning roadway widths.) Island markings may be supplemented with reflective raised pavement markers. Provide barrier-free access at crosswalk locations where raised islands are used. For pedestrian refuge islands and barrier-free access requirements, see Chapter 1510.
1310.02(14)(b) Location Design the approach ends of islands so they are visible to motorists. Position the island so that a smooth transition in vehicle speed and direction is attained. Begin transverse lane shifts far enough in advance of the intersection to allow gradual transitions. Avoid introducing islands on a horizontal or vertical curve. If the use of an island on a curve cannot be avoided, provide sight distance, illumination, or extension of the island.

1310.02(14)(c) Compound Right-Turn Lane To design large islands, the common method is to use a large-radius curve for the turning traffic. While this does provide a larger island, it also encourages higher turning speeds. Where pedestrians are a concern, higher turning speeds are undesirable. An alternative is a compound curve with a large radius followed by a small radius (see Exhibit 1310-22). This design forces the turning traffic to slow down.

In general, except to meet one of the uses listed above, it is desirable not to use curbs on facilities with a posted speed of 45 mph or above. Avoid using curbs if the same objective can be attained with pavement markings. Refer to Chapter 1230 for additional information and design criteria on the use of curbs. Exhibit 1310-23 Traffic Island Designs
Notes: [1] For shoulder width at curbs, see Chapter 1230. For additional information on shoulders at turn lanes, see Section 1310.02(18). [2] Small traffic islands have an area of 100 ft2 or less; large traffic islands have an area greater than 100 ft2. General: Provide an accessible route for pedestrians (see Chapter 1510).
1310.02(15) Right-Turn Lanes Right-turn movements influence intersection capacity even though there is no conflict between right-turning vehicles and opposing traffic. Right-turn lanes might be needed to maintain efficient intersection operation. Use the following to determine when to consider right-turn lanes at unsignalized intersections:
•
•
•
•
•
•
For two-lane roadways and for multilane roadways with a posted speed of 45 mph or above, when recommended by Exhibit 1310-24. A crash study indicates an overall crash reduction with a right-turn lane. The presence of pedestrians requires right-turning vehicles to stop. Restrictive geometrics require right-turning vehicles to slow greatly below the speed of the through traffic. There is less than decision sight distance for traffic approaching the intersection. For unsignalized intersections, see Section 1310.02(16) for guidance on right-turn lane lengths. For signalized intersections, use a traffic signal analysis to determine whether a right-turn lane is needed and what the length is (see Chapter 1310).

A capacity analysis may be used to determine whether right-turn lanes are needed to maintain the desired level of service. Where adequate right of way exists, providing right-turn lanes is relatively inexpensive and can provide increased operational efficiency. The right-turn pocket or the right-turn taper (see Exhibit 1310-25) may be used at any minor intersection where a right-turn lane is not provided. These designs reduce interference and delay to the through movement by offering an earlier exit to right-turning vehicles. If the right-turn pocket is used, Exhibit 1310-25 shows taper lengths for various posted speeds.
Exhibit 1310-24 Right-Turn Lane Guidelines
Notes: [1] For two-lane highways, use the peak hour DDHV (through + right-turn). For multilane, highways (posted speed 45 mph or above), use the right-lane peak hour approach volume (through + right-turn). [2] When all three of the following conditions are met, reduce the right-turn DDHV by 20: o The posted speed is 45 mph or below o The right-turn volume is greater than 40 VPH o The peak hour approach volume (DDHV) is less than 300 VPH [3] For right-turn corner design, see Exhibit 1310-8.

1310.02(16) Speed Change Lanes A speed change lane is an auxiliary lane primarily for the acceleration or deceleration of vehicles entering or leaving the through traveled way. Speed change lanes are normally provided for at-grade intersections on multilane divided highways with access control. Where roadside conditions and right of way allow, speed change lanes may be provided on other through roadways. Justification for a speed change lane depends on many factors, including speed; traffic volumes; capacity; type of highway; design and frequency of intersections and crash history. When either deceleration or acceleration lanes are to be used, design them in accordance with Exhibit 1310-26 and Exhibit 1310-27. When the design speed of the turning traffic is greater than 20 mph, design the speed change lane as a ramp in accordance with Chapter 1360. When a deceleration lane is used with a left-turn lane, add the deceleration length to the storage length. A dedicated deceleration lane (see Exhibit 1310-26) is advantageous because it removes slowing vehicles from the through lane. An acceleration lane (see Exhibit 1310-27) is not as advantageous because entering drivers can wait for an opportunity to merge without disrupting through traffic. However, acceleration lanes for left-turning vehicles provide a benefit by allowing the turn to be made in two movements. WSDOT Design Manua M 22-01.22

1310.02(17) Drop Lanes A lane may be dropped at an intersection with a turn-only lane or beyond the intersection. Do not allow a lanereduction taper to cross an intersection or end less than 100 feet before an intersection. (See Chapter 1210 for lane reduction pavement transitions.) When a lane is dropped beyond signalized intersections, provide a lane of sufficient length to allow smooth merging. For facilities with a posted speed of 45 mph or higher, use a minimum length of 1,500 feet. For facilities with a posted speed lower than 45 mph, provide a lane of sufficient length that the advanced lane reduction warning sign can be placed not less than 100 feet beyond the intersection area. When a lane is dropped beyond unsignalized intersections, provide a lane beyond the intersection not less than the acceleration lane length from Exhibit 1310-27.
1310.02(18) Shoulders Shoulder width is controlled by its intended functional use and its contribution to achieving the desired safety performance when balanced with other design elements. See Exhibit 1239-2 for functional uses and recommended shoulder widths. Reducing the shoulder width at intersections facilitates the installation of turn lanes without unduly affecting the overall width of the roadway. A narrower roadway also reduces pedestrian exposure in crosswalks and discourages motorists from using the shoulder to bypass other turning traffic.
1310.02(19) U-Turns For divided multilane highways without full access control that have access points where the median prevents left turns, evaluate the demand for locations that allow U turns. Normally, U turn opportunities are provided at intersections. However, where intersections are spaced far apart, U-turn median openings may be provided between intersections to accommodate U-turns. Use the desirable U-turn spacing (see Exhibit 1310-28) as a guide to determine when to provide U-turn median openings between intersections. Where the U-turning volumes are low, longer spacing may be used. Locate U-turn median openings where intersection sight distance can be provided. Exhibit 1310-28 U-Turn Spacing Urban/Rural

When designing U-turn median openings, use Exhibit 1310-30 as a guide. Where the median is less than 40 feet wide, with a large design vehicle, provide a U-turn roadway (see Exhibit 1310-29). Design A, with the U-turn roadway after the left-turn, is desirable. Use Design A when the median can accommodate a left-turn lane. Use Design B only where left-turn channelization cannot be built in the median. Exhibit 1310-29 U-Turn Roadway
Design A
Design B
*Design on- and off-connections in accordance with Chapter 1360. Document the need for U-turn locations, the spacing used, and the selected design vehicle. If the design vehicle is smaller than the largest vehicle using the facility, provide an alternate route. U-turns at signal-controlled intersections do not need the acceleration lanes shown in Exhibit 1310-30. For new U-turn locations at signal-controlled intersections, evaluate conflicts between right-turning vehicles from side streets and U-turning vehicles. Warning signs on the cross street might be appropriate.

1310.03 Designing for Active Transportation (New Section 2023) Design intersections to provide accommodation for pedestrian and bicycle movement at and through intersections on facilities where they are legally allowed. This includes new or reconstructed intersections at locations where completes streets does not apply. Accommodation of pedestrian and bicycle movements at intersections is achieved through incorporation of various design strategies that benefit one or more of the six functional characteristics that affect active transportation user’s comfort and safety. These functional characteristics include exposure, speed, delay, conspicuity, predictability, separation in space, and separation in time. Improve the safety and comfort of active transportation users by:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Decreasing pedestrian/bicyclist exposure to points of conflict with motor vehicle traffic; Decreasing motor vehicle operating speed; Increasing pedestrian/bicyclist user conspicuity; Increasing the predictability of movements of different user groups through the intersection; Increasing separation in space between motorists and pedestrians/bicyclists; and/or Increasing separation in time between motorists and pedestrians/bicyclists.
Intersection designs may not be able to incorporate design strategies that benefit all functional characteristics. Review the project for possible improvements to individual functional characteristics and apply engineering judgement as to which bullets are appropriate and to what extent they will be addressed (see Section 1310.03(1)). For more complex or innovative intersection layouts such as Diverging Diamond Interchanges, Displaced Left Turns, Single Point Urban Interchanges, etc., contact the HQ Transportation Operations Office for support. For additional information for roundabouts see Section 1320.05 and 1320.06.
1310.03(1) Design Process (New Section 2023) The identification of appropriate bicycle and pedestrian design features for all intersections along a corridor or at an individual intersection is informed by the corridor’s existing or planned bicycle and pedestrian facilities and other design elements (e.g., parking). The appropriateness of various design feature may be limited by geometric constraints (e.g., sufficient width). Moreover, the effectiveness of specific design features may be diminished if they are not supported by complementary corridor infrastructure and/or violate driver expectancy. Some features may not be conducive to a given corridor, while others may not be conducive to an individual intersection application. When designing for pedestrian and bicycle movements under a complete streets (CS) project, although a minimum Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) value of 2 or better is the standard for bicyclists and pedestrians, interpretation of that standard at intersections is still in development. In the interim, the CS requirements for intersections will be met if you follow the design table and implement appropriate strategies as outlined below. Design decisions made relative to the corridor will be reflected in the intersection and will therefore meet CS requirements. The approach to determining the appropriate intersection treatments for bicycle and pedestrian facilities focuses on matching selected intersection treatments to the corridor’s linear bike/pedestrian facilities and providing treatments that support local agency plans and WSDOT project goals.

When used in conjunction with the table in Exhibit 1310-31, intersection treatments selected under this approach will support the LTS goals of the corridor. The table is designed to result in lower-stress intersection treatments that match lower-stress corridor facility types. The approach follows a five-step process: Step 1: Gather and review all pertinent active transportation goals and plans from local agency active transportation plans and/or comprehensive plans, the WSDOT Active Transportation Plan, and the project summary. Additional information may be provided in the Basis of Design and any design recommendations from the Region Complete Streets Team, where applicable. Step 2: Determine whether the project will include bicycle and pedestrian facility improvements. Most projects will include some form of bicycle and pedestrian facility improvements. A small selection of preservation projects in which complete streets does not apply might not include any bicycle or pedestrian facility improvements. If your project does not include any bicycle or pedestrian improvements, Step 2 is the last step in the process. For all other projects proceed to Step 3. Step 3: Determine the linear bicycle and pedestrian facility types that will be applied along your project corridor between intersections. For some projects the linear bicycle and pedestrian facilities will match existing facilities, and for others the project may propose new facility types to replace existing facilities (or to establish new facilities where none exist today). For intersection projects determine the linear bicycle and pedestrian facility types that exist leading up to the intersection. For all complete streets projects, the linear bicycle and pedestrian facility types will meet LTS 2. Step 4: Consult the table in Exhibit 1310-31. Find the columns under “Corridor Linear Bike/Ped Facility Types” that match the bicycle and pedestrian facilities determined in Step 3. Note that you will be tracking columns for both the bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Review and select any treatments from the “Intersection Treatments Applied at All Intersections Throughout Corridor” (orange group) that will support the corridor bicycle and pedestrian treatments determined in Step 3, local agency plans, and WSDOT project goals. Note that multiple treatments might be selected from this group in order to achieve a project’s goals. For corridor projects, the treatments selected from the orange group should be applied to all intersections in the corridor. Step 5: Next, review and select any treatments from the “Intersection Treatments Applied at Individual Intersections” (blue group) that will likewise support the corridor bicycle and pedestrian treatments determined in Step 3, local agency plans, and WSDOT project goals. As with the orange group, multiple treatments from the blue group might be selected in order to achieve a project’s goals. Repeat Step 5 for each individual intersection in the project. When reviewing potential treatments in the table, the cells marked “Yes” indicate that the treatment in the row is an appropriate treatment for the facility type in the column and should be considered for inclusion in the project. For the cells marked “No”, that treatment type should not be combined with the facility type in that column and therefore should not be used in the project.
WSDOT Design Manua M 22-01.22 
Page 1310-42
Chapter 1310
Intersections
For the cells marked “N/A”, the treatment type in that row does not have any relationship with the facility type in the column and is therefore not applicable to the decision about whether to use that treatment. Note that other facility types that might apply to your project could still indicate use of that treatment. An example of this is the “Bikecross Markings” treatment. For that treatment, the pedestrian facility type has no bearing on the decision about whether to use bikecross markings, since these markings are not connected to the pedestrian facilities and do not serve any function for pedestrians. Therefore, the cells under the pedestrian facility types are all marked “N/A” for this treatment; however, the bicycle facility type does drive the decision about whether or not to use bikecross markings, and for certain bicycle facility types bikecross markings cannot be used, so some bicycle facility types are marked “Yes” for this treatment and some are marked “No”. For the cells marked “Not Typical”, the treatment in the row is not usually used in conjunction with the facility type in the column; however, under certain limited circumstances there may be a reason to consider the treatment. These combinations are normally not used unless there is a specific contextual reason to do so. After completing all five steps, document your determinations and results in the DDP.

KEY: "Yes" = treatment is appropriate for this facility type; "No" = treatment is not appropriate for this facility type; "N/A" = treatment is not applicable in the evaluation for this facility type—use other determinants for evaluation of potential use of treatment; "Not Typical" = not a typical treatment for this facility type, but can be considered if circumstances warrant use. Notes: [1] If a treatment is selected for use from this group, apply at all intersections; however, individual intersections within a project may not require certain treatments. [2] Treatments in this group are evaluated on an intersection-by-intersection basis; can be used at any or all intersections in a project. [3] To evaluate appropriate intersection treatments, typically select one column from the bicycle facility type group and one column from the pedestrian facility type group, and review potential treatments with consideration for both. [4] "None" means there are no facilities dedicated to bicycle use in the right of way (i.e., no bike lanes, no Neighborhood Greenway, no shared use path). This type includes locations with only sharrows in traffic lanes, as sharrows do not establish dedicated space for cyclists. [5] Green colored pavement markings can be applied as a conspicuity enhancement to bike lanes, bikecross markings, two-stage turn boxes, and leading bike boxes. [6] The use of median diverters is evaluated at the corridor-wide network level, but applied at individual intersections. [7] Marked crosswalks and pedestrian signal features are primarily intended for pedestrian use; however, at some high-conflict intersections bicyclists may be directed to use pedestrian crossing facilities. [8] "Ohio DOT Guide" is the 2022 Ohio DOT Multimodal Design Guide. Discuss this treatment with your ASDE when considering this guidance.

1310.03(2) Protected Intersection (New Section 2023) A protected intersection is a comprehensive design approach that incorporates a suite of design features to address all of the functional characteristics listed in Section 1310.03. This suite of design features can be applied to one or more corners of an intersection. A protected intersection is a geometric treatment that keeps bicyclists physically separated from drivers up to the intersection, including the corners. As such, they are typically implemented as a continuation of a separated bike lane facility, including two-way separated bike lanes. Protected intersections also provide benefits for pedestrians. The term protected in this context refers to the separation provided between vehicle lanes and pedestrians and bicyclists. Protected intersections include the following standard set of treatment countermeasures:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Corner island Bike queue area Bikeway setback and driver yield zone Pedestrian refuge island Pedestrian crossing of the bike lane Pedestrian curb ramp Bicyclist crossing of travel lanes Pedestrian crossing of travel lanes
Protected intersection features are applied at signalized and unsignalized intersections. When used at a signalized location, they sometimes include specialized signal phasing. Protected intersection features can be applied to one or more intersection legs. In a protected intersection, the separated nature of roadway bike lane and a pedestrian walkway at the intersection is created or preserved. In addition, a standard set of treatments is provided that are intended to improve the crossing for pedestrians and bicyclists. The design seeks to minimize shared space between bicyclists and vehicles, ideally to a single point where the motor vehicle turns across the bike lane and pedestrian crossing. The speed of each mode at this conflict point is controlled using geometric design techniques. Crossings are also offset from the physical corner to improve sight distance and decision time. Where feasible, transition the bike lane buffer to a minimum of 6 feet wide as it approaches and departs the intersection. This allows space for a motorist to stop for bicyclists and pedestrians without blocking traffic, improves a motorist’s view of approaching bicyclists by creating a crossing that is more perpendicular, and can potentially provide more time for all users to identify the point of conflict and react as needed (Exhibit 1310-32, #9). Use corner islands to influence the speed of right-turning motor vehicles and reduce crossing distances for bicyclists and pedestrians, minimizing exposure to turning traffic (Exhibit 1310-32, #1). (See Section 1510.09(5)(a)) Corner islands also provide positive separation between motor vehicles and bicycles up to the point of crossing. Restricting right turn on red can also reduce inadvertent encounters between travel modes. At locations where a small radius corner is desirable to control speeds of passenger vehicle traffic, but provisions must be made for occasional use by larger vehicles, truck aprons may be used in conjunction with corner islands (Exhibit 1310-32, #3; see also Exhibit 1510-16).

Chapter 1310
Intersections
At locations where there are sufficient buffer widths, such as streets with parking lanes, provide advance bicycle queuing areas (Exhibit 1310-32, #2) to improve visibility of cyclists and allow them to enter the intersection before turning motorists. These queue areas should be at least 6 feet long to fit a typical bicycle. At locations where advance queuing areas cannot be provided the bike lane stop bar should be placed ahead of the crosswalk on the approach. Use delineator islands to separate bicycle and pedestrian crossings and help guide pedestrians to the crosswalk and curb ramps. Design elements include: Exhibit 1310-32 Protected Intersection Design Elements (from the AASHTO Bike Guide 2021 Draft) (New Exhibit 2023)
1. Corner island and minimize radius - to define a path that encourages a low vehicle turning speed (see Section 1510.09(5)(a)) 2. Forward bicycle queuing area – to improve visibility and exclusive area for waiting to reduce conflict 3. Corner island truck apron – to accommodate a vehicle larger than the design vehicle 4. Pedestrian refuge median – to improve gap acceptance and comfort for pedestrians 5. Pedestrian crossing of the separated bike lane – to improve conspicuity and comfort for pedestrians 6. Pedestrian curb ramp – to meet ADA standards (see Chapter 1510) 7. Bicycle crossing of travel lanes – to indicate joint usage with motor vehicles and priority for bicycles 8. Pedestrian crossing of travel lanes - to indicate joint usage with motor vehicles and priority for bicycles 9. Car in motorist yield zone – to provide a space for waiting to reduce conflicts * Consider mountable truck apron (see Chapter 1510) based on an analysis of occurrence.

1310.04 Signing and Delineation Use the MUTCD and the Standard Plans for signing and delineation criteria. Provide a route confirmation sign on all state routes shortly after major intersections. (See Chapter 1020 for additional information on signing.) Painted or plastic pavement markings are normally used to delineate travel paths. For pavement marking details, see the MUTCD, Chapter 1030, and the Standard Plans. Contact the region or HQ Traffic Office for additional information when designing signing and pavement markings.
1310.05 Procedures Document design decisions and conclusions in accordance with Chapter 300. For highways with limited access control, see Chapter 530.
1310.05(1) Approval An intersection is approved in accordance with Chapter 300. Complete the following items, as needed, before intersection approval:
•
•
•
Intersection Control Type Approval (see Chapter 1300) Design Analyses approved in accordance with Chapter 300 Approved Traffic Signal Permit (DOT Form 242-014 EF) (see Chapter 1330)
1310.05(2) Intersection Plans Provide intersection plans for any increases in capacity (turn lanes) at an intersection, modification of channelization, or change of intersection geometrics. Support the need for intersection or channelization modifications with history; school bus and mail route studies; hazardous materials route studies; pedestrian use; public meeting comments; etc. For information to be included on the intersection plan for approval, see the Intersection/ Channelization Plan for Approval Checklist on the following website: Design - Support | WSDOT (wa.gov)
1310.05(3) Local Agency or Developer-Initiated Intersections Intersections in local agency and developer projects on state routes must receive the applicable approvals in Section 1310.05(1) as part of the intersection design process. The project initiator submits an intersection plan and the documentation of design decisions that led to the plan to the region for approval. For those plans requiring a Design Analysis, the Design Analysis must be approved in accordance with Chapter 300 prior to approval of the plan. After the plan approval, the region prepares a construction agreement with the project initiator (see the Utilities Manual).
1310.06 Documentation Refer to Chapter 300 for design documentation requirements.

1320.01 General Modern roundabouts are near-circular intersections at grade. They are an effective intersection type with fewer conflict points and lower speeds, and they provide for easier decision making than other intersection types. They also require less maintenance than traffic signals. Well-designed roundabouts have been found to reduce crashes (especially fatal and severe injury collisions), traffic delays, fuel consumption, and air pollution. They also have a traffic-calming effect by reducing vehicle speeds using geometric design rather than relying solely on traffic control devices.
Roundabout
Roundabout design is an iterative process. A well-designed roundabout achieves a balance of safety and efficiency. Good design is a process of creating the smooth curvature, channelization, and deflection required to achieve consistent speeds, well-marked lane paths, and appropriate sight distance. The decision to install a roundabout is the result of an Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) (see Chapter 1300) approved by the region Traffic Engineer or other designated authority. New roundabouts and changes to existing roundabouts that either add or reduce capacity, or change the geometric configuration require a Peer Review (see Section 1320.12)

Roundabouts
1320.02 Roundabout Types There are five basic roundabout types: mini, compact, single-lane, multilane, and teardrop described in the following sections.
1320.02(1) Mini-Roundabouts Mini-roundabouts are small single-lane roundabouts generally used in 25 mph or less urban/suburban environments. Because of this, mini-roundabouts are typically not suitable for use on higher-volume (greater than 6,000 AADT) state routes. In retrofit applications, mini-roundabouts are relatively inexpensive because they normally require minimal additional pavement at the intersecting roads. A 2-inch mountable curb for the splitter islands and the central island is desirable because larger vehicles might be required to cross over it. A common application is to replace a stop-controlled or uncontrolled intersection with a mini-roundabout to reduce delay and increase capacity. With mini roundabouts, the existing curb and sidewalk at the intersection can sometimes be left in place.
1320.02(2) Compact Roundabouts Compact roundabouts are a hybrid of attributes found in mini- and single-lane roundabouts. Similar to a miniroundabout, a compact roundabout may require minimal additional pavement, has a completely mountable center island, and in many cases existing curb or sidewalk can be left in place. As a result, compact roundabouts rarely require the purchase of right of way. Compact roundabouts are similar to single-lane roundabouts regarding design vehicle assumptions, ability to process traffic volumes, and signing.

1320.02(3) Single-Lane Roundabouts Single-lane roundabouts have single-lane entries at all legs and one circulating lane. They typically have mountable raised splitter islands, a mountable truck apron, and a landscaped central island.
Single-lane roundabout
1320.02(4) Multilane Roundabouts Multilane roundabouts have at least one entry or exit with two or more lanes and more than one circulating lane. The operational practice for trucks negotiating roundabouts is to straddle adjacent lanes.

Roundabouts
1320.02(5) Teardrop Roundabout Teardrops are usually associated with ramp terminals at interchanges: typically, at diamond interchanges. Teardrop roundabouts allow the “wide node, narrow link” concept. Unlike circular roundabouts, teardrops do not allow for continuous 360° travel resulting in less vehicle conflicts as traffic traveling on the crossroad (link) between ramp terminal intersections (nodes) does not encounter a yield as it enters the teardrop intersections. At higher ADT locations this lack of conflicting vehicles can result in a higher throughput but can also result in limited gaps for the off-ramp approach. Consult HQ or region Transportation Operations Office for guidance.

1320.03 Capacity Analysis Use the capacity analysis completed as part of the Intersection Control Evaluation (see Chapter 1300) to verify the number of lanes required for every individual movement in the design year.
1320.04 Geometric Design 1320.04(1) Selecting Shape and Placement Roundabout shape is an important decision, because the shape can affect design elements that affect safety performance and operation of the roundabout.
1320.04(1)(a) Circular The circular shape is the most desirable roundabout shape when constraints allow. If a circular shape is not feasible, contact the region Transportation Operations Office to investigate other shapes described below. Sometimes a circular shape can be used by slightly offsetting the placement of the roundabout.

1320.04(1)(b) Non-Circular A non-circular roundabout is a good choice when constraints such as right of way, existing roadway alignments, buildings, and/or environmentally sensitive areas influence the shape. Experiment with different roundabout sizes and radii and use design vehicle turning software (such as AutoTURN®) to refine the shape to find the best operation while retaining desired speeds.

1320.04(2)(a) Curbing All curbing within a roundabout should be drivable. The type of curbing appropriate for a roundabout is shown in the Standard Plan Roundabout Cement Concrete Curbs: F-10.18. Exception: existing curb untouched as part of a mini or compact roundabout installation may remain.
1320.04(2)(b) Truck Apron A truck apron is the mountable portion of a central island which helps minimize the overall footprint of the roundabout by allowing the turning path of commercial vehicles to traverse the truck apron. Generally, the truck tractor can traverse the roundabout in the circulating lane while the trailer is allowed to off track onto the apron. The apron is slightly raised vertically above the circulating travel path with a different pattern or color to provide lane guidance to drivers in the circulating lane. A truck apron’s width is based on the needs of the design vehicle. If a bus uses the intersection for any movement routinely, the designer should try to minimize apron use of the bus, however this is not a requirement. Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to fine tune the width of apron needed, so as not to design too large of an apron width that won’t be used. There are rare circumstances where a combination of frequent low clearance trucks such as lowboys, roadway grades or other roadway features may lead to consideration of a truck apron height of less than 3 inches. Contact with HQ Transportation Office for guidance. Changing the apron height from 3” requires a Design Analysis. The apron color should be distinguishable in contrast with the adjacent circulating roadway and pedestrian facilities. WSDOT practice generally includes encouraging the use of a red color with brick texturing. The use of grey or darker colors alone does not provide adequate contrast. However, designs using a mixture of color, textures, and geometric shapes such as incorporation of central island landscaping, or chevron patterns can provide desirable contrast to the adjacent circulating roadway. Work with the region Landscape Architect (HQ Roadside and Site Development Section for regions without a Landscape Architect) and HQ Transportation Operations Office for color, texture, and design options.

Roundabouts
1320.04(2)(c) Central Island The central island is the portion of the roundabout that is inside of the circulating roadway and typically includes an inside truck apron and a landscaped area (except for mini-roundabouts and compact roundabouts, which have no landscaped area and are entirely mountable). Central island shape is a function of the site-specific needs of a roundabout intersection. It doesn’t have to be an identical shape of the inscribed circle diameter (ICD) dimensions but should support the design principles of deflection and low speeds, and the accommodation of the design vehicle. Roundabouts present opportunities to create community focal points, landscaping, and other gateway features within an intersection. The central island may include enhancements (such as landscaping, sculptures, or fountains), which serve both an aesthetic purpose and provide visual indication of the intersection for approaching motorists (this is particularly important for high-speed approaches). Ideal central island treatments fit the context and result in minimal consequence to any vehicle that may encroach on the non-mountable portion of the central island. These treatments should not attract pedestrians to the central island, as pedestrians should never cross the circulating roadway. Work with the region Landscape Architect (HQ Roadside and Site Development Section for regions without a Landscape Architect) for central island features. See Chapter 950 for policy and guidance.
1320.04(2)(d) Splitter Island A splitter island is the raised island at each two-way leg between entering and exiting vehicles, designed primarily to control the entry and exit speeds by providing deflection. They also discourage wrong-way movements, and provide pedestrian refuge. Splitter islands can have different shapes based on entry angle requirements and exit design speeds. Raised channelization, or the appearance of raised curbing, is important, as research shows that drivers will slow down when they perceive that the driving width is narrowing.
Splitter Island
The length of the splitter island will vary (typical lengths: 30 ft. to 350 ft.) based on the terrain, access considerations, site-specific mainline and crossroad operational speeds and the stepdown speeds to the final desired entry speed, which is usually 15–25 mph. (See 1320.04(3)(a) for using chicanes on higher-speed roadways.) WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1320-8
Chapter 1320
Roundabouts
Try to maximize the splitter island width adjacent to the circulating roadway. The larger achieved width, the better a driver approaching the roundabout can perceive whether a driver in the circulating lane will exit or continue inside the roundabout. This results in better gap acceptance. This may also support a better pedestrian refuge design. The splitter island should be distinguishable in contrast with the adjacent roadway and pedestrian facilities. See discussion and guidance for truck aprons in Section 1320.04(2)(b).
1320.04(2)(e) Inscribed Circle Diameter The Inscribed Circle Diameter (ICD), that is, the overall outside diameter of a roundabout, is determined by the variables design vehicle, design speed, and the number of circulatory lanes. The ranges of ICD in Exhibit 1320-1 are only suggestions to start a roundabout design. The ICD for noncircular shapes should be defined with dimensions along the X and Y axis.

1320.04(2)(f) Entry 1. Deflection Ideal alignment offers an entry design that provides deflection, speed control, and reasonable view angles to drivers while balancing property impacts and costs. While most intersections are at 90º angles and most through movements are straight, deflection contributes to the safety performance of a roundabout. Deflection is primarily achieved with the central island and supporting it with splitter islands on all entries to the roundabout. 2. Alignment Offset There are three alignment choices for attaching entry legs to the circulatory roadway:
•
•
•
The offset left alignment is preferred. It constrains the entry, slowing a vehicle’s approach speed, and opens up the exit for efficient egress. The symmetrical alignment (if needed) is acceptable for lower speed contexts such as 30 mph. The offset right alignment tends to allow faster entry speeds and constrains the exit; it is undesirable.

Chapter 1320
Roundabouts
Offset left alignment (preferred)
3. Entry Angle To achieve the proper amount of deflection for each approach to a roundabout, there is a range of angle values that are desirable. This range is usually between 20 and 40 degrees. The purpose of entry angle is so vehicles don’t hit broadside. 4. Entry Width Entry width is determined by the turning template of the design vehicle turning through the entry curve at the desired entry speed. The ranges of entry widths in Exhibit 1320-1 are only suggestions to start a roundabout design.
Entry angle and width
5. Path Overlap In a multilane roundabout, if the vehicles in the entry are aligned toward the central island or the truck apron, the vehicle on the right is pointed toward the inside lane and tends to go in that direction, while the vehicle on the left tends to be squeezed to the right toward the vehicle on the right. Avoid path overlap. Avoid a design that aligns an entering vehicle at the incorrect lane in the circulatory roadway. As a vehicle enters the circulating roadway it should be headed directly toward its respective lane within the circulating roadway. For multilane roundabouts, if inside lane is pointing at truck apron this is also considered to be path overlap. If right entry lane is pointing to left circulatory lane, then there is path overlap.

1320.04(2)(g) Right-Turn Slip Lanes Right-turn slip lanes are a proven way to increase the “life” of an intersection by removing traffic that would otherwise enter the roundabout and reduce the available capacity to other movements. If a right-turn movement has 250 vehicles/hour or more, or if over 40% of the total approach volume is taking right turns, a slip lane should be considered. The conflicting volume of vehicles on the merge will influence the length of merge lane prior to termination. Speeds can be very low and vehicles can take turns at these low speeds. Multimodal considerations will influence the length based on crosswalk location and bicycle use.

Roundabouts
1320.04(3) Speed Control Roundabout operation performance is dependent on low, consistent vehicle speeds. Low and consistent operating speeds facilitate appropriate gap acceptance by an entering driver. Design for travel path operating speeds between 15 mph and 25 mph (see Section 1320.04(3)(b)). Design to have low-speed differentials (12 mph or under) between entering and circulating traffic. Multilane roundabouts might have higher speeds along their respective travel paths, but generally 30 mph or less. The ideal design speed mechanism has the entry and circulating speeds being similar. This varies due to size, shape and context of the roundabout. The vehicle then moves into and through the circulation lane, being controlled all along by the design speed of the circulating lane. The circulating design speed controls the exit speed; therefore, the exit design speed, as calculated in the Travel Path section below, is not as critical. Designing geometric entry speed control encourages lower speeds and lower speed differentials at conflict points, which reduces the potential for collisions.
1320.04(3)(a) Chicanes Chicanes are a type of horizontal deflection used in traffic calming to reduce the speed of vehicles. Research has shown that chicanes have value in slowing down higher approach speeds.
Chicane
Consider chicanes where posted speeds near the roundabout are 45 mph or higher. Design chicane curves with successively smaller radii in order to successively reduce vehicle speeds approaching the roundabout entry. Use Exhibit 1320-2 to determine the radii-speed relationship (the radii are measured using the offsets recommended in the Travel Paths section). The normal cross slope (superelevation in Exhibit 1320-2) is 2% however, site conditions may require more based on how you tilt the plane of the roundabout for site specific conditions. A minus (-) 2% drains toward the central island. Also, consider the grade of the roadways that enter the roundabout, because a vehicle can more easily slow down on an upgrade than on a downgrade. Adjust the length of the deceleration based on the “Adjustment Factors for Grades Greater Than 3%” in Design Manual Exhibit 1360-11.

1320.04(3)(b) Travel Paths Travel path calculations can be used on all roundabout designs to get an understanding of speeds for different paths throughout the roundabout. A travel path is the shortest path through the roundabout, no closer than 5 feet from any curb face or lane line as shown. Use Exhibit 1320-2 and R1 through R5 to determine Travel Path speeds.

1320.04(5) Circulatory Roadway Profile and Cross Slope The preferred profile grades of the circulatory roadway of a roundabout are ±4% or flatter radially around the circulatory lane(s). Profile grades steeper than ±4% require justification. It is preferred to bench the roundabout if practicable to reduce profile grade.
Preferred grades and cross slopes
The preferred circulatory roadway cross slope may range from 1.5% to 4.0% (2.0% preferred), away from the central island to promote lower circulating speeds, improve central island visibility, minimize breaks in cross slope of entry and exit lanes, and facilitate drainage of water to the outside of the roundabout.
Drawing shows preferred cross slopes. Site conditions and drainage may require slopes outside these ranges.
1320.04(6) Design Tools During the scoping or preliminary geometric design process, do not to use truck turning paths alone as a constraint to eliminate a roundabout at an intersection. There are several design tools available to aid in the design of a roundabout. It is important to understand how the software works, its default settings, and its application to the design process.
1320.04(6)(a) Vehicle Swept Path Flexibility Managing vehicle speeds is a goal in roundabout design. Therefore, selection of a design vehicle that fits the transportation and land use context while balancing vehicle speed and accommodation is a key first step. Section 1103.03(4), states, “WSDOT policy provides flexibility when choosing the intersection design vehicle. The purpose for this policy is to balance user needs and avoid the unnecessary expense of oversizing intersections.” Once vehicle(s) have been selected for both design and accommodation, there are certain assumptions that must be made with software programs that replicate vehicle swept paths. Determine which defaults are to be

Roundabouts
used or modified so that different movements can be modeled. Every effort should be made to minimize swept paths using modeling software. Swept paths of infrequent vehicles also have the added benefit of drivable curbing that adds flexibility and redundancy to designs. See Section 1103.03(4) and 1310.02(5) for guidance on determining modal priority and design vehicles.
1320.04(6)(b) Truck Swept Path In some cases, roundabouts of the perfect circular variety with symmetrical roadway attachments require less specific knowledge of truck-turning software and its applications. However, when looking at a non-circular shaped roundabout where the combination of the truck’s speed, its turning angle settings, its rear axle locations, and its alignment are the critical design elements to address, a mastery of the software is required. Designers that are unfamiliar with how to apply the software inputs accurately to model a truck’s swept path need to contact HQ Transportation Operations Office for guidance. Poor alignment of a truck swept path can result in unnecessarily large roundabout footprints, higher than desired Travel Path speeds, or uncomfortable driving maneuvers by the freight community. Assume that a truck will travel much slower through a roundabout than the Travel Path speed calculated for passenger vehicles (see Section 1320.04(3)(b)). Adjust the software input to allow a slower truck speed in order to make a good engineering judgment about how fast a truck may use a roundabout (for example, for AutoTURN® use 5 mph). Design tool default settings don’t necessarily allow the maximization of the tool and can prohibit the designer from getting a good, balanced design between passenger car speeds and truck accommodation.
Single lane roundabout - Truck using the truck apron
When using a truck-turning software tool like AutoTURN® on multilane roundabouts, assume a truck’s travel path will occupy (straddle) parts of two adjacent lanes.

1320.04(7) Sight Distance Sight distance is an important design consideration at roundabouts. Restricting sight distance across the central island with strategic landscaping may enhance the intersection by making the intersection a focal point and encouraging lower speeds. Work with the region Traffic Engineer and Landscape Architect (HQ if there is no region contact) to determine this balance. Provide sight triangle plan sheets for consideration of landscape design.
1320.04(7)(a) Stopping Use the design stopping sight distance in Chapter 1260. Anticipated speeds throughout the roundabout can be calculated using Exhibit 1320-2, based on the Travel Path radius and direction of the particular curve. The design stopping sight distance is measured along the vehicle’s path as it follows the curvature of the roadway; it is not measured as a straight line.
Sight distance – Approach and Exit
1320.04(7)(b) Intersection Provide minimum intersection sight distance. Longer sight distances can lead to higher vehicle speeds that reduce gap opportunities for entering vehicles. For intersection sight distance at roundabouts, provide entering vehicles a clear view of traffic on the circulating roadway and on the immediate upstream approach in order to aid in judging an acceptable gap. The intersection sight distance at roundabouts is given in Exhibit 1320-3. The S1 intersection sight distance is based on the average of the entering and circulating speeds, and the S2 intersection sight distance is based on the left-turning speed. The sight distance may also be calculated using the intersection sight distance equation given in Chapter 1310 using a time gap (tg) of 4.5 seconds.

1320.04(8) Railroad Crossings Although it is undesirable to locate any intersection near an at-grade railroad crossing, this situation exists at many locations on the highway system. Experience shows that a roundabout placed near a crossing has some operational advantages. If there is a railroad crossing near the roundabout contact HQ Transportation Operations Office for further guidance.
1320.05 Pedestrians As part of the approved ICE it has already been determined whether pedestrians will use the roundabout and, if so, which legs (see Chapter 1300). With the knowledge of where pedestrian facilities are needed, design the roundabout while keeping in mind the ADA requirements for crosswalks, sidewalks, paths, and other pedestrian facilities.

Chapter 1320
Roundabouts
1320.05(1) Crossing Location The pedestrian crossing located on the entry side of a roundabout leg should be about 20 feet from the yield line so that a pedestrian can walk behind a vehicle that is waiting at the yield line. The crossing located in the exit side of the roundabout leg can be closer to the roundabout, because as the vehicles leave the roundabout, they accelerate and make it harder to find a break in traffic. As speed increases, drivers are less likely and less able to stop. Verify that stopping sight distance is provided throughout the roundabout, based on operating speed.
1320.05(2) Splitter Island Pass Through Design the splitter island pass through a minimum of 5 feet wide, or the width of the sidewalk, whichever is greater. The length of the pass through (measured back of curb to back of curb of the splitter island) is to be a minimum of 6 feet long measured along the shortest section of the pedestrian path. Consider a “V” shape pass through as shown.
Splitter island pass through
1320.05(3) Buffers Wherever feasible, separate sidewalks from the curb with a buffer. Landscaping or colored concrete are acceptable for the buffer. See WSDOT Standard Plan F10-18 for dimension details. Do not compromise required vehicle sight triangle needs. The buffer discourages pedestrians from crossing to the central island or cutting across the circulatory roadway of the roundabout. It also helps guide pedestrians with vision impairments to the designated crosswalks and can be used by the occasional inexperienced truck driver who encroaches up onto a curb while traversing through the roundabout.
1320.05(4) Curb Ramps Roundabouts with buffers typically have combination-type curb ramps; otherwise, parallel curb ramps are normally used. (See Chapter 1510 and the Standard Plans for curb ramp information.) WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

1320.05(5) Sight Triangles A vehicle sight triangle specific to pedestrians (see Section 1320.04(7)) must include the whole curb ramp, including the landing, where pedestrians are likely to wait to cross. It is also important that pedestrians are also able to see approaching vehicles.
1320.05(6) Pedestrian Beacons On multilane roundabouts, consider installing pedestrian beacons to warn drivers when a pedestrian wants to cross the roadway. Work with the region Traffic Engineer on types and locations of pedestrian beacons.

1320.06 Bicycles Provide bicyclists with similar options to negotiate roundabouts as they have at other intersections. Consider how they navigate either as motor vehicles or pedestrians depending on the size of the intersection, traffic volumes, their experience level, and other factors. Bicyclists are often comfortable riding through single-lane roundabouts in low-volume environments in the travel lane with motor vehicles, as speeds are comparable and potential conflicts are low. At larger or busier roundabouts, cyclists may be more comfortable using ramps connecting to a sidewalk around the perimeter of the roundabout as a pedestrian. Where bicycle lanes or shoulders are used on approach roadways, they should end before the geometry changes the approach to the roundabout. Contact the HQ Design Office for bicycle ramp design options.

1320.07 Signing The graphic shown is an example of potential signing for a single-lane roundabout. For additional information, refer to the MUTCD, Plan Sheet Library, and the Standard Plans for details on signing. A preliminary sign plan is developed to identify existing and proposed signing on state highways. Sign plans on state routes are to be reviewed and approved by the region Traffic Engineer and then furnished to the HQ Transportation Operations Office for review. The plan provides an easily understood graphic representation of the signing, and it provides statewide uniformity and consistency for regulatory, warning, and guide signs at roundabouts on the state highway system. For roundabouts located near a port, industrial area, or route that experiences oversize loads, consider using perforated square steel posts.

1320.08 Drainage Features (New Section 2023) The type, frequency, and placement of drainage features in a roundabout can influence operational performance and cause the drainage features to be damaged by vehicles. For example, vehicles in a multi-lane roundabout may shy away from drain inlets placed in the traveled way thus compromising the roundabout’s optimal performance of channelizing vehicles and speed control. Consult with the Region Hydraulics Engineer early in the project development process to identify the best design characteristics that both facilitates drainage features and optimizes roundabout performance.

1320.09 Pavement Marking See Standard Plan M-12.10 for roundabout pavement marking details. Consult region Traffic on traffic pavement markings and materials.
1320.10 Illumination Provide illumination for each of the conflict points between circulating and entering traffic in the roundabout and at the beginning of the raised splitter islands. Illuminate raised channelization or curbing. Position the luminaires on the upstream side of each crosswalk to improve the visibility of pedestrians. Light the roundabout from the outside in toward the center. This improves the visibility of the central island and circulating vehicles to motorists approaching the roundabout. Ground-level lighting within the central island that shines upward toward objects in the central island can also improve their visibility. Consult with the region Transportation Operations Office for illumination design. (See Chapter 1040 for additional information on illumination.) On higher-speed approaches, consider internally illuminated bollards (IIB) in lieu of other illumination.
1320.11 Road Approach, Parking, and Transit Facilities Road approach (road or driveway) connections to the circulating roadway are not allowed at roundabouts unless they are designed as a leg to the roundabout. It is desirable that road approaches are not located on the approach or departure legs within the length of the splitter island. The minimum distance from the circulating roadway to a road approach is controlled by corner clearance using the outside edge of the circulating roadway as the crossroad. When minimum corner clearance cannot be met, document the decision in accordance with Chapter 530 and Chapter 540. If a parcel adjoins two legs of the roundabout, it is acceptable to provide a right-in/right-out driveway within the length of the splitter islands on both legs. Roadways between roundabouts may have restrictive medians with left-turn access provided with U-turns at the roundabouts. Parking is not allowed in the circulating roadway or on the entry or exit roadway within the length of the splitter island. Transit stops are not allowed in the circulating roadway, in the approach lanes, or in the exit lanes prior to the crosswalk. Locate transit stops on the roadway before or after the roundabout, in a pullout, or where the pavement is wide enough that a stopped bus does not block the through movement of traffic or impede sight distance.

1330.01 General Traffic control signals are automated traffic control devices that warn or direct motorists to take a specific action. Traffic control signals are used to control the assignment of right of way at locations where conflicts with motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians exist or where passive devices such as signs and markings do not provide the necessary flexibility of control to move motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians in an efficient manner. The decision to install a traffic signal is the result of an Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) (see Chapter 1300) that is approved by the region Traffic Engineer or other designated authority.
1330.02 Procedures 1330.02(1) Traffic Signal Permit State statutes (RCWs) require WSDOT approval for the design and location of all conventional traffic signals and some types of beacons located on city streets forming parts of state highways. Approval by WSDOT for the design, location, installation, and operation of all other traffic control signals installed on state highways is required by department policy. The Traffic Signal Permit (DOT Form 242-014 EF) is the formal record of the signal warrant analysis required by the MUTCD and the department’s approval of the installation and type of signal. Permits are required for the following types of signal installations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Conventional traffic signals Emergency vehicle signals Intersection control beacons Lane control signals Movable bridge signals Queue-cutter traffic signals

Traffic Control Signals
The Permit and its supporting data must be included in the Design Documentation Package (DDP.) The permit is completed by the requesting agency and submitted, complete with supporting data, through the region Traffic Office to the approving authority for approval. See Section 1330.02(1)(a) for Signal Warrant information required as part of the supporting documentation. The approving authority is the Regional Administrator or authorized delegate. The approving authority approves or denies the application and sends it back to the region Traffic Office. The region Traffic Office retains a record of the approved permit and supporting data and forwards a copy of the Permit and the supporting data to the State Traffic Engineer at WSDOT Headquarters (HQ). Preserve the approved permit as required by Section 1330.07 Documentation. Emergency vehicle signals require annual permit renewal. The region Traffic Office reviews the installation for compliance with requirements. If satisfactory, the permit is renewed by the Regional Administrator with a letter to the operating agency. A copy of this letter is also sent to the State Traffic Engineer. Permits are not required for portable traffic signals, speed limit sign beacons, stop sign beacons, or lane assignment signals at toll facilities. A new permit application is required when the level of control is increased, such as changing from an intersection control beacon to a conventional traffic signal or adding an approach to an existing signal system. For a reduction in the level of control, such as converting a conventional signal to a flashing intersection beacon or removal of the signal, submit the “Report of Change” portion of the traffic signal permit, complete with supporting data, to the approving authority, with a copy to the region Traffic Office and State Traffic Engineer. If experimental systems are proposed, region Traffic Engineer review and approval is required. The region Traffic Office will send the approved proposal to the State Traffic Engineer for review and approval. The State Traffic Engineer will forward the approved proposal to FHWA for their approval. A copy of the approval from FHWA will be returned and must be preserved as required by 1330.07 Documentation. Any signal system requiring a permit, with the exception of Ramp Meter signals, also requires Preliminary Signal Plan approval from the WSDOT HQ Traffic Office (see Section 1330.05).
1330.02(1)(a) Signal Warrants A signal warrant is a minimum condition that is to be met before a signal may be considered for installation. Satisfying a warrant does not mandate the installation of a traffic signal. The warranting condition(s) supports the inclusion of a traffic signal for consideration as part of the ICE performed during the scoping of the project (see Chapter 1300). For a list of the traffic signal warrants and information on how to use them, see the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). Contact the region Traffic Engineer for region specific practices. Address all warrants listed in the currently adopted MUTCD as part of the Signal Warrant Analysis. Mark warrants which do not apply as “Not Applicable” and include a basic supporting statement or similar justification. Include the Signal Warrant Analysis in the Signal Permit supporting data. For Warrant 7, the three year period must be used for all traffic signals installed on state highways as described in FHWA Interim Approval IA-19 (https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interim_approval/ia19/index.htm).

1330.02(2) Responsibility for Funding, Construction, Maintenance, and Operation Responsibility for the funding, construction, maintenance, and operation of traffic signals on state highways has been defined by legislative action and Transportation Commission resolutions (see Exhibit 1330-1). Responsibilities vary depending on location, jurisdiction, and whether or not limited access control has been established. Limited access as used in this chapter refers to full, partial, or modified limited access control that has been established as identified in the Access Control Tracking System. The following is a summary of the typical areas of responsibility: a) Inside the corporate limits of cities with a population of 30,000 or greater where there is no established limited access control: The city is responsible for the funding, construction, maintenance, and operation of traffic signals. Population figures can be found at: www.ofm.wa.gov/pop/ b) Inside the corporate limits of cities with a population of less than 30,000: WSDOT is responsible for funding, construction, maintenance, and operation of traffic signals. Population figures can be found at: www.ofm.wa.gov/pop/ c) Inside the corporate limits of cities with a population of 30,000 or greater where there is established limited access control: WSDOT is responsible for funding, construction, maintenance, and operation of traffic signals. Population figures can be found at: www.ofm.wa.gov/pop/ d) Outside the corporate limits of cities and outside established limited access control areas: WSDOT is responsible for funding, construction, maintenance, and operation of a traffic signal when a new state highway crosses an existing county road. When a new county road intersects an existing state highway, WSDOT is responsible for only the maintenance and operation of a traffic signal. The county is responsible for the construction costs of the traffic signal and associated illumination. When it is necessary to construct a traffic signal at an existing county road and state highway intersection, the construction cost distribution is based on the volume of traffic entering the intersection from each jurisdiction’s roadway. The county’s share of the cost, however, is limited to a maximum of 50%. The state is responsible for maintenance and operation (WAC 468-18-040). e) Outside the corporate limits of cities and inside established limited access control areas: WSDOT is responsible for funding, construction, maintenance, and operation of traffic signals. f) Emergency vehicle signals: The emergency service agency is responsible for all costs associated with emergency vehicle signals. g) Third party agreement signals: At those locations where WSDOT is responsible for traffic signals and third-party activity justifies the installation of a traffic signal, as determined by an ICE, the following rules apply: o The third party is responsible for funding the design and construction of the traffic signal system, unless another arrangement is agreed upon with WSDOT. o The third party obtains a traffic signal permit. o The third party agrees to design and construct the traffic signal in conformance with WSDOT’s guidelines and requirements. o The third party agrees to submit the design and construction documents to WSDOT for review and approval by the region Traffic Engineer. o Preserve all third party provided documents and any third-party agreement(s) as required by Section 1330.07 Documentation.

1330.03 Intersection Design Considerations Signalized intersections require different design considerations than non-signalized intersections. These elements should be considered as early as the ICE process (see Chapter 1300 and Chapter 1310 for further guidance.) This Section discusses basic intersections with relatively simple geometry. For more complex or innovative intersection layouts such as Diverging Diamond Interchanges, Displaced Left Turns, or Single Point Urban Interchanges, contact the WSDOT HQ Traffic Office for support. Consider providing an unrestricted through lane on the major street of a T intersection (sometimes referred to as a Continuous Green “T” (CGT) intersection). This design allows for one traffic movement to flow without restriction. When this is used on through roadways with a posted speed of 45 MPH or greater, the through lane must be separated by a physical barrier or the through movement must also be signalized. If there is a crosswalk across the through lane, the through lane must be signalized. Exhibit 1320-2 shows an example of a CGT intersection.

Traffic Control Signals
Exhibit 1330-2 Example Continuous Green “T” Intersection Layout
1330.03(1) Left Turns It is recommended that a left turn storage lane be provided for all main line roadways where left turns are allowed. This helps to avoid having stopped traffic in a through lane with a green through signal display. This also helps to support potential future changes in left turn operations. See Section 1330.06(1) for additional discussion. Left-turning traffic can operate more efficiently when the opposing left-turn lanes are directly opposite each other. When a left-turn lane is offset into the path of an opposing through lane, the left-turning driver may assume the opposing vehicles are also in a left-turn lane and fail to yield. To prevent this occurrence, less efficient split phasing may be necessary. (See Chapter 1310 for guidance on lane offsets and opposing left-turn clearance.) Where there are opposing through lanes but no opposing left turn lane, install a striped or raised median area opposite the left turn lane if possible. Place stop lines so that they are out of the path of conflicting left turns. Check the geometric layout by using turning templates or a computerized vehicle turning path program (such as AutoTURN®) to determine whether the proposed layout and phasing is sufficient for the design vehicles. Also, check the turning paths of opposing left-turn movements. In many cases, the phase analysis might recommend allowing opposing left turns to run concurrently, but the intersection geometrics are such that this operation cannot occur. The intersection should be large enough to provide opposing left turning vehicle paths with a 4-foot minimum (12-foot desirable) separation between them. Where this separation cannot be achieved, less efficient signal phasing may be required to provide adequate space for opposing left turns. Some intersections may have multi-lane left turns. At locations with closely spaced intersections, a multi-lane left-turn storage area might be the only solution to reduce the potential for the left-turn volume to back up into an adjacent intersection. As with single left turn lanes, the intersection should be large enough to provide opposing left turning vehicle paths with a 4-foot minimum (12-foot desirable) separation between them. Where this separation cannot be achieved, less efficient signal phasing may be required to provide adequate space opposing left turns. At smaller intersections, the opposing single-lane left-turn movement might not be able to turn during the twolane left-turn phase and it might be necessary to reposition this lane. If the opposing left turns cannot time together, the reduction in delay from the two-lane left-turn phase is likely to be nullified by the requirement for a separate opposing left-turn phase. Exhibit 1330-3 shows two examples of two-lane left turns with opposing single-left arrangements.

Traffic Control Signals
Two receiving lanes are required for two-lane left-turn movements. In addition, these receiving lanes are to extend well beyond the intersection before reducing to one lane. A lane reduction immediately beyond the intersection can cause delays and backups into the intersection because the left-turning vehicles usually move in dense platoons, which may make merging and lane changes difficult. (See Chapter 1310 for guidance on lane reductions on intersection exits.) Exhibit 1330-3 Left-Turn Lane Configuration Examples

Traffic Control Signals
1330.03(2) Right Turns Large right-turn curb radii at intersections sometimes have impacts on traffic signal operation. Larger radii allow faster turning speeds and might move the pedestrian entrance point farther away from the intersection area. Pedestrian crossing times are increased because of the longer crossing, thereby reducing the amount of time available for vehicular traffic. (See Chapter 1310 for guidance on determining these radii.) At intersections with large right-turn radii, consider installing raised traffic islands. These islands are primarily designed as pedestrian refuge areas. (See Chapter 1510 for pedestrian refuge islands and traffic island designs.) Traffic islands may decrease the required pedestrian clearance intervals; however, large radii and raised traffic islands may make it difficult for pedestrians to navigate the intersection. Where pedestrians are expected to cross a right turn lane to a traffic island, it is recommended to use a compound right turn-lane design as shown in Chapter 1310.
1330.03(3) Pedestrian Features See Chapter 1510.
1330.03(4) Road Approaches and Driveways If roadway approaches and driveways are located too close to an intersection, the traffic from these facilities can affect signal operations. Consider eliminating the accesses or restricting them to “right in/right out”. If a driveway or road approach is directly opposite a leg of the intersection, that approach may be signalized. If the approach is signalized, it must be signalized as if it were a standard intersection leg, and the pedestrian crossing across the approach must also be signalized as if it were a standard crosswalk. Management of driveways and road approaches should be determined early (preferably no later than scoping) so that they can be considered and addressed in the design. (See Chapter 530 and Chapter 540 for further guidance.) Consider shifting the location of advance detection upstream to clear an access point so that vehicles entering from the access point will not affect detection and operation of the signal.
1330.03(5) Skewed Intersections Skewed intersections, because of their geometry, are challenging to signalize and delineate. Where feasible, modify the skew angle to provide more normal approaches and exits. In many cases, the large, paved areas for curb return radii at skewed intersections can be reduced when the skew angle is reduced. (See Chapter 1310 for requirements and design options.) Visibility of pedestrians is of particular concern and must also be taken into consideration.
1330.03(6) Transit Stops Transit stops and pullout locations should be located on the far side of the intersection to minimize their impacts on signal operation. (See Chapter 1730 for transit stop and pullout designs.)
1330.03(7) Railroad Crossings Where railroad preemption is used at a signalized intersection, install left and right turn lanes for the movements leading to the leg of the intersection with the railroad crossing if possible. This greatly improves the efficiency of the signal during railroad preemption when turns are restricted. Also consider providing a left-turn lane for the minor leg opposing the railroad crossing. This will allow for more effective signal operations during long periods of railroad preemption. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Where there is less than 40 feet between the nearest rail and the normal location of the stop line, do not install a stop line between the tracks and the intersection. Use the same stop line for the traffic signal and the rail crossing instead. Exhibit 1330-4 shows recommended intersection features for intersections near rail crossings. Contact the WSDOT HQ Traffic Office for assistance with standalone queue-cutter signals. Exhibit 1330-4 Recommended Features for Intersections near Rail Crossings
1330.04 Conventional Traffic Signal Design 1330.04(1) General The goal of any traffic signal design is to assign right of way in the most efficient manner possible and still be consistent with traffic volumes, intersection geometrics, and safety. An advanced signalized intersection warning sign may be required when the sight distance to the signal is not met. A beacon assembly with the sign to warn motorists of a signalized intersection shall be included when directed by Region Traffic Engineer if either of the two following conditions exists: a) The visibility requirements in the MUTCD are not achievable. b) The posted speed is 55 mph or higher and the previous signalized intersection is more than 2 miles away; this does not apply to freeway off-ramps. This warning sign and beacon assembly consists of a W3-3 sign with Type IV reflective sheeting and one or two continuously flashing beacons. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-8
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
Where two beacons are used, the beacons should flash alternately instead of simultaneously. Locate the sign in advance of the intersection in accordance with Table 2C-4 (Condition A) of the MUTCD. The warning sign and beacon assembly may be omitted with approval from the region Traffic Engineer.
1330.04(2) Signal Phasing With some exceptions, the fewer the traffic signal phases, the more efficient the operation of the traffic signal. The number of phases required for efficient operation is related to intersection geometrics, traffic volumes, composition of traffic flow, turning movement demands, and desired level of driver comfort. The traffic movements at an intersection have been standardized to provide consistency in both traffic signal design and driver expectations. (See Exhibit 1330-5 for standard intersection movements, signal head (display) numbering, and standard phase operation.)

Traffic Control Signals
For WSDOT operated signals, the region Signal Operations Engineer will develop the signal phasing plan or review proposed phasing for systems designed by others. For signals operated by other jurisdictions, the operating jurisdiction should be involved in signal phasing development. Phasing development is addressed in Section 1330.06 Operational Considerations for Design. Phasing development should begin as soon as the decision is made to install a traffic signal and may begin as early as the intersection control evaluation. Provide the proposed channelization plans and traffic count data to the region Signal Operations Engineer or phasing designer as early as possible, as phasing information is required to complete the signal system design. For WSDOT owned and operated signals, vehicle and pedestrian movement phase numbering is standardized to provide uniformity in signal phase numbering, signal display numbering, preemption channel identification, detection numbering, and circuit identification. For signals owned and operated by other jurisdictions, refer to that jurisdiction’s guidelines for phase and equipment numbering. The following are general guidelines for the WSDOT numbering system: 1. Phases 2 and 6 are normally assigned to the major street through movements, with phase 2 assigned to the northbound or eastbound direction of the major street. This results in phase 2 being aligned with the direction of increasing mileposts. 2. Phases 1 and 5 are normally assigned to the major street protected left-turn movements. 3. Phases 4 and 8 are normally assigned to the minor street through movements, with phase 4 normally assigned to the approach to the left of the phase 2 approach (as viewed from the phase 2 stop line). 4. Phases 3 and 7 are normally assigned to the minor street protected left-turn movements. 5. Phasing on new signals installed within an already signalized corridor should be assigned to match the existing corridor phasing – even if it doesn’t follow the standard phasing conventions listed above. 6. At T intersections, the movement on the stem of the T is normally assigned to either phase 4 or phase 8. Which phase is used will normally depend on the major street phase assignments. 7. At intersections where split phasing is used (opposing directions time separately) assign phases normally but show the split phase phasing diagram, unless otherwise directed by maintenance and operations staff. 8. Signal displays are numbered as follows: a. The first number indicates the signal phase, and the second number is the number of the signal head, counting from centerline (or left edge line) to the right edge line of the approach. For example, signal displays for phase 2 are numbered, as viewed from left to right, 21, 22, 23, and so on. If the display is an overlap, the designation is the letter assigned to that overlap. For example, signal displays for overlap A are number A1, A2, A3, and so on. b. If the display is protected/permissive, the display is numbered with the phase number of the through display followed by the phase number of the left-turn phase. For example, a protected/permissive signal display for phase 1 (the left-turn movement) and phase 6 (the compatible through movement) is numbered 61/11. For overlap right turns, the protected portion may either be an overlap phase, or it may be the same phase as the complementing left turn phase. 9. With a conventional protected/permissive left-turn display, the circular red, yellow, and green displays are connected to the through phase (phase 6, in this example) controller output and the steady yellow and green arrow displays are connected to the left turn phase (phase 1, in this example) controller output.

Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
10. When a flashing yellow arrow display is used, coordinate with the Signal Operations Engineer and signal maintenance group to determine appropriate wiring. For new cabinets, always specify an auxiliary output rack when protected/permissive phasing will be used. 11. Pedestrian displays and detectors are numbered with the first number indicating the signal phase and the second number as either an 8 or 9. For example, pedestrian displays and detectors 28 and 29 are assigned to phase 2. If there are more than two displays or detectors for a single pedestrian phase, use letter suffixes for additional displays and detectors (28A / 29A, 28B / 29B, etc.). 12. Vehicle detector numbering depends on the type of detection: a. Induction loop detectors use three-digit numbers for designation. The first number represents the phase. The second number represents the lane number, starting from the left lane and moving towards the right edge line. The third number represents the loop number counting from the stop line back. For example, detection loops for phase 2 detectors are numbered 211, 212, 213 for lane 1; 221, 222, 223 for lane 2; and so on. For loops tied together in series for a single detection channel, such as a three-loop series stop line detector, the individual loops in the series use a letter suffix. For a stop line detector in lane 1 for phase 2, using three loops in series, the loops would be designated 211A, 211B, and 211C. b. b. Video detectors are designated V#, where “#” is the through phase number for that approach, even if it will cover additional phases (such as left turn or overlap) for that approach. If the video detector is for advance detection, the suffix “A” is added. For example, the advance video detector for phase 6 would be V6A. Video detection zones may be drawn on the contract plans if desired, but these will normally be field established and adjusted and may not end up as shown in the plans. If used, video detection zones are labeled the same as loop detectors, but with a “V” suffix. For example, the stop line video detection zone for phase 5 would be 511V. c. Radar detectors are designated similar to video detectors but use an “R” prefix in place of the “V”. For example, the advance radar detector for phase 4 would be R4A. d. Wireless in pavement sensors use the same numbering scheme as induction loops but add a “W” suffix. For example, the phase 7 stop line sensor would be 711W. e. Exhibit 1360-6 shows examples of standard detector numbering. 13. Emergency vehicle detectors use letter designations: Channel A detectors cover phase 2 and phase 5; Channel B detectors cover phase 4 and phase 7; Channel C detectors cover phase 1 and phase 6; and Channel D detectors cover phase 3 and phase 8. When there are multiple detectors for the same channel, the first detector uses the letter, and all other detectors use a number suffix (C, C1, C2, etc.).

1330.04(3) Vehicle Signal Displays Signal displays are the devices used to convey right of way assignments and warnings from the signal controller to the motorists and pedestrians. When selecting display configurations and locations, the most important objective is the need to present these assignments and warnings to the motorists and pedestrians in a clear, concise, and uniform manner. The use of ball, steady arrow, or flashing yellow arrow displays is dependent upon the signal phasing. Use the approved signal phasing diagram to determine which display types can be used for which movements. Typical vehicle signal displays are shown in Exhibit 1330-7 through Exhibit 1330-14. In addition to the display requirements contained in the MUTCD, the following also apply: 1. A minimum of two indications for the through movement, if one exists at an intersection, must be provided - even if it is not the primary (predominant) movement. Provide a minimum of two indications for the major signalized turn movement of an intersection if no through movement exists, such as on the stem of a T intersection. These signal faces are to be spaced a minimum of 8 feet apart. At a T intersection, select the higher-volume movement as the primary movement and provide displays accordingly. A green left-turn arrow on a primary display and a green ball on the other primary display do not comply with this rule. At an intersection where left turns are prohibited, the leftmost through display may use a green up arrow in place of the green ball display. At an intersection where right turns are prohibited, the rightmost through display may use a green up arrow in place of the green ball display. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

2. All displays for an approach, regardless of phase served, are to be a minimum of 8 feet apart. 3. Locate displays directly overhead and centered over the associated lane of the applicable vehicular traffic as it moves through the intersection. (See Exhibit 1330-7 through Exhibit 1330-14 for signal head locations.) For intersections with a skew for through traffic, locate signal displays for through traffic in one of the following ways: a. Over the center of the outbound (far side) lane b. Over a line drawn between the center of the approaching lane and the center of the associated outbound lane, ending at the stop lines Left turn displays may either be located relative to the through displays or in line with approaching traffic, dependent on ability to mount the display(s). (See Exhibit 1330-15 for skew placement examples.) 4. Locate displays a minimum of 50 feet and a maximum of 180 feet from the stop line. The preferred location of the signal heads is between 60 and 120 feet from the stop line. When the nearest signal face is located between 150 and 180 feet beyond the stop line, engineering judgment of conditions, including worst-case visibility conditions, is to be used to determine whether the provision of a supplemental or nearside signal face would be beneficial. When it is not physically possible to locate displays at least 50 feet from the stop line, the distance to the displays may be reduced as follows: a. 3-section vertical and 5-section cluster (doghouse) displays may be located between 40 and 50 feet from the stop line. b. 4-section vertical displays may be located between 41 and 50 feet from the stop line. c. 5-section vertical displays may be located between 45 and 50 feet from the stop line. The distances listed above are the minimums required to maintain 16.5 feet of clearance over the roadway with a backplate installed. Overhead displays should always be located on the far side of the crossing roadway for the best visibility. Locating overhead displays on the near side of the roadway results in issues with visibility and driver compliance with stop lines. When an overhead display is located on the near side of the crossing roadway, the stop line typically has to be pushed back so that the minimum visibility distance is met. However, this also pushes the stop line back too far for drivers to see cross traffic, resulting in drivers creeping past the stop line towards the intersection – especially for turning traffic. This results in both the driver being stopped past the stop line and being unable to see the signal displays. For ramp meter signals, place Type RM signal standards and displays at the stop line. 5. Use vertical vehicle-signal display configurations. Horizontal displays are not allowed unless clearance requirements cannot be achieved with vertical displays or unless they are being installed at an intersection to match other displays in the intersection. Approval by the State Traffic Engineer is required for the installation of horizontal displays. 6. Use 12-inch signal sections for all vehicle displays except the lower display for a post mounted ramp meter signal.

Traffic Control Signals
7. Provide displays for turning movements with dedicated lanes as follows: a. For protected movements, use all arrow displays. b. For protected / permissive movements, use four section arrow displays. Alternatively, a shared five section cluster (doghouse) display may be used for both the turn lane and the adjacent through lane. Note: A three section arrow display, with bi-modal flashing yellow arrow / steady green arrow may be used in cases where windload or vertical roadway clearance will not allow for the use of a four-section display. If vertical clearance can be provided through adjustments to the signal display mount, such as mounting the Type M mount between different display sections, a four-section arrow display should be used. c. For permissive right turns, a three-section arrow display with flashing yellow arrow (Exhibit 1330-13) is optional. This display is highly recommended where there are concerns regarding permissive right turns and the conflicting pedestrian crossing movement, such as known incidents or high volumes of both pedestrian crossings and right turn movements. 8. Use steady green arrow indications only when the associated movement is completely protected from conflict with other vehicular and pedestrian movements. This includes conflict with a permissive left-turn movement. At T intersections, steady green arrow displays may not be used for a movement that has a conflicting pedestrian movement. 9. Use either Type M or Type N mountings for vehicle display mountings on mast arms, as directed by the region maintenance staff or owning agency. Provide only one type of mounting for each signal system. Mixing mounting types at an intersection is not acceptable except for supplemental displays mounted on the signal standard shaft. 10. Use backplates for all overhead-mounted displays for new, updated, or rebuilt signal faces. Add backplates to all existing signal displays that do not already have them. 11. Use Type E mountings for pedestrian displays mounted on signal standard shafts unless otherwise approved by region maintenance staff or the owning agency. 12. Include supplemental signal displays when the approach is in a horizontal or vertical curve and the intersection visibility requirements of this section and the MUTCD cannot be met, unless approved otherwise by the region Traffic Engineer. Supplemental far side displays are recommended at intersections with higher truck volumes, as the trucks will frequently block visibility of overhead displays for following drivers. Supplemental far side protected left turn displays are recommended for long left turns.

The minimum mounting height for overhead signal displays is 16.5 feet from the roadway surface to the bottom of the signal housing, including the backplate. There is also a maximum height for signal displays allowed by the MUTCD, since the roof of a vehicle can obstruct a motorist’s view of a signal display. The maximum heights from the roadway surface to the bottom of the signal display housing with 12-inch displays are shown in Exhibit 1330-9.

At signalized intersections with railroad preemption, install blankout signs for turning movements that do not have a dedicated signal display (3-section arrow display). Blankout signs are 36” x 36” and will display either a No Right Turn symbol (R3-1) or No Left Turn symbol (R3-2) when activated, as appropriate. Blankout signs should be placed the same as equivalent static signs.
1330.04(4) Pedestrian Equipment Pedestrian equipment consists of pedestrian signal displays and pedestrian detectors (pushbuttons). New signal systems are required to use countdown displays and Accessible Pedestrian Signal (APS) pushbuttons. See Section 1330.04(4)(a) for pedestrian display and detection requirements for existing signal systems. No intersection may have a mix of APS and non-APS pushbuttons, nor may any intersection have a mix of countdown and non-countdown pedestrian displays. Pedestrian displays are required to be installed with the bottom of the display housing no less than 7 feet or more than 10 feet above the sidewalk surface. Pedestrian displays are required to be installed to provide maximum visibility at the beginning of the controlled crosswalks. To accomplish this, pedestrian displays should be located no more than 5 feet from the outside edge of the crosswalk, as measured on a line perpendicular to the crosswalk centerline (See Exhibit 1330-17). This distance may be increased up to a maximum of 10 feet from the outside edge of the crosswalk if physical constraints prevent the display from being placed no more than 5 feet from the outside edge of the crosswalk.

Exhibit 1330-17 Pedestrian Display Placement Requirements
Pedestrian pushbuttons (PPBs) are required to be located within a certain distance of the crosswalk being served and oriented such that the sign on the pushbutton is parallel to the crosswalk served. Pedestrian pushbutton location requirements are as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
The PPB setback distance is measured from one of the following: o The face of curb, where sidewalk or curb is present. o The edge line of the roadway, where there is no sidewalk or curb present. o Or the edge of pavement, where there is no edge line, sidewalk, or curb present. The preferred PPB setback distance is 6 feet but may be increased up to a maximum 10 feet. Contact the HQ Traffic Office if the PPB setback distance cannot be kept to 10 feet or less. The minimum PPB setback distance is 4 feet. If a planter strip or similar buffer strip is present, with justification, the minimum PPB setback may be reduced to 1.5 feet from the curb face or edge line. The PPB setback distance shall not be less than 1.5 feet. The PPB should be located as close to the outside edge of the crosswalk line as possible, so that for APS PPBs, the button and sign face towards the core of the intersection, rather than back down the adjacent approaching roadway. The PPB may be located no more than 5 feet outside either edge of the crosswalk line. If possible, PPBs should be located on separate poles and be separated by a minimum of 10 feet. See Exhibit 1330-18 for recommended and allowed PPB placement locations.

Exhibit 1330-18 PPB Placement Requirements
PPBs are required to be located so that the actual button, not just the assembly, is within 9 inches horizontally of a level all-weather surface (generally sidewalk or paved road shoulder) as described in Chapter 1510. To accomplish this, certain criteria must be met depending on the type of pole upon which the pushbutton is installed: a. For vertical shaft poles (Type PPB, PS, I, FB, or RM), the center of the pole shall be no more than 9 inches from the edge of the level clear space. The pushbutton shall not be oriented more than 90 degrees from facing the level clear space. (See Exhibit 1330-19.) b. For larger signal standards (Type II, III, IV, IV, or SD), the button must face the level clear space, with the edge of the pole baseplate no more than 6 inches from the edge of the level clear space. It is recommended that the pole either be in the sidewalk, or the edge of the pole base plate be installed as close to the back of sidewalk as possible. (See Exhibit 1330-20.) Some minor rotation of the button on the pole is possible, but even smaller angles may quickly exceed the allowed reach limit – particularly on larger poles. 60-inch by 36-inch clear space shown in Exhibit 1330-19 and Exhibit 1330-20 for reference only – see Section 1510.12(1)(b) for clear space requirements.

60-inch by 36-inch clear space shown in Exhibit 1330-19 and Exhibit 1330-20 for reference only – see Section 1510.12(1)(b) for clear space requirements. In all cases, it is recommended that the pole be installed in the sidewalk for maximum accessibility. However, the pole and the pushbutton itself are obstructions and must not encroach upon the required minimum pedestrian access route widths (see Chapter 1510). PPBs are required to be installed at 42 inches above the level clear space, as measured to the center of the actual button. Existing pushbuttons do not require a height adjustment if the center of the actual button is within a range of 36 to 48 inches above the level clear space. Where there is a median or center island with a pedestrian refuge, consult with signal operations to determine if a pushbutton should be installed in the pedestrian refuge area. This may be justified for locations with particularly long crossings or slower moving pedestrians. For WSDOT owned systems, pedestrian signal equipment may not be installed on light standards. Do not install pedestrian signal equipment on light standards for systems owned by other jurisdictions unless directed to do so by that jurisdiction.
1330.04(4)(a) Accessible Pedestrian Signals and Countdown Pedestrian Displays Accessible Pedestrian Signals consist of a pedestrian pushbutton with integrated vibro-tactile and audible versions of the visual indications presented by pedestrian signal displays. APS are required at any location with a pedestrian display – even if there was no pedestrian detection previously.

Traffic Control Signals
This is due to the requirement to provide non-visual indication of the pedestrian phase. All new construction traffic signals are required to include APS. Countdown pedestrian displays are displays which use a combination of an overlapping person (walk) and hand (don’t walk) indication and an adjacent two-digit countdown timer display. The timer counts down the seconds remaining in the pedestrian clearance phase (flashing don’t walk). For WSDOT owned traffic signals, all new construction traffic signals are required to include countdown pedestrian displays. For new construction traffic signals owned by other jurisdictions, countdown pedestrian displays are required unless directed otherwise by the owning jurisdiction. For existing signalized intersections where pedestrian equipment was not previously installed, the installation of APS and countdown pedestrian displays is required for the entire intersection. This may require new or relocated poles, as well as additional ramp and sidewalk work beyond that necessary for basic sidewalk and ramp ADA compliance. At signalized intersections with existing pedestrian equipment, the following criteria determine when APS pushbuttons and countdown pedestrian displays shall be installed: 1. The following are considered minor signal upgrades, and do not require the installation of APS pushbuttons or countdown pedestrian displays at that intersection: a. Where pushbuttons are only being adjusted in height or orientation. b. Where pushbuttons are being relocated on a single corner, including to a new pole, and no other work (including sidewalk or ramp work) is taking place at any other corner, pushbuttons may be relocated or replaced with the same type of pushbutton as currently exists at that intersection. Countdown pedestrian displays are not required to be installed at that intersection. New pole location(s) must meet accessibility requirements for pedestrian pushbuttons (see Section 1510.11). Accessibility for any affected poles must be evaluated for both existing pushbuttons and future APS pushbuttons. 2. The following types of work shall include the installation of APS pushbuttons and countdown pedestrian displays as described below: a. At any signalized intersection included in a project that is designated as an alteration project, as defined in Section 1510.03(2): i. For WSDOT owned traffic signal systems, install APS pushbuttons and countdown displays. For any project which has completed its scoping phase before August 1, 2018, consult with your ASDE to determine if APS pushbuttons and countdown pedestrian displays can be added to the project – documentation is not required if the project cannot support the expanded scope of work. ii. For traffic signal systems owned by other agencies, install APS pushbuttons and countdown displays if funded by the owning agency. b. At any signalized intersection where APS pushbuttons are being installed in response to a public request, replace all pushbuttons and pedestrian displays with APS pushbuttons and countdown pedestrian displays at that intersection. Additional poles may be required, and ramp and sidewalk work may be necessary to support access to new APS locations / orientations.

Traffic Control Signals
c. For any other project, not previously described, which requires traffic signal system work affecting pedestrian pushbuttons, replace all pushbuttons and pedestrian displays with APS pushbuttons and countdown pedestrian displays. This may require additional ramp and sidewalk work to provide required accessibility to and for APS locations / orientations beyond that already required for other ADA compliance efforts. APS pushbuttons are required to include the following features: 1. Audible and vibrotactile indications of the WALK interval. 2. A locator tone which operates only during the DON’T WALK and flashing DON’T WALK intervals. 3. A tactile arrow on the pushbutton (control surface) indicating the crossing direction served. This arrow must be high contrast with the rest of the button – either light on dark or dark on light. 4. An integral 9” x 15” R10-3e sign. 5. If additional crossing time will be provided as part of an extended press feature, a supplemental R10-32P sign is required to be installed adjacent to or integral with the APS PPB.
1330.04(5) Signal Standards (Supports) Signal standards consist of five main types of supports: Vertical Steel Shaft, Cantilevered Steel Mast Arm, Steel Strain Pole, Wood Strain Pole, and Signal Bridge. The type of support selected will depend on required placement of vehicle signal displays and the ability of the support to reach that location. The MUTCD states that the preferred location for signal displays is overhead on the far side of the intersection. Signal displays may also be mounted to bridges where clearance will not allow an alternate signal standard type. Installation on bridges requires approval of both the region Traffic Engineer and the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. Signal Standards shall be considered in the following order of preference: 1. Cantilevered Steel Mast Arm. These are the standard support type for permanent systems and should be used whenever possible. Mast arm installations are preferred because they generally provide better placement of the signal displays, greater stability for signal displays in high-wind areas, and reduced maintenance costs. Mast arm lengths are limited to 65 feet from center of pole to farthest display mount – if additional length is needed, an alternate support type must be used. 2. Span Wire System (Steel or Wood Strain Poles). These systems may be used when displays are needed at a greater distance than a mast arm system can support, or if a system is expected to be in place for less than 5 years. Steel poles are required to be used for permanent signal systems. Temporary signal systems (systems to be removed under the same contract as installation) may use wood poles. The use of wood poles beyond the end of a contract or for longer than 5 years requires the approval of the region Traffic Engineer. Individual spans have a limit of 150 feet – longer spans require design by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. 3. Signal Bridge. Signal bridges shall only be used when no other alternative can physically be installed, and support displays in the required locations. Diagonal signal bridges may not be used for WSDOT signal systems – only signal bridges across a single approach may be used. Diagonal signal bridges are extremely difficult to maintain and result in displays being too close to at least one of the two cross streets, resulting in poor display visibility, and any structural failure will result in the loss of the entire signal system, rather than just one or two directions. Single Point Urban Interchanges (SPUIs) where a signal bridge is required across the center of the intersection are not considered a diagonal span and may be used.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-29
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
4. Vertical Steel Shaft. Vertical steel shaft supports should only be used for supplemental vehicle displays or pedestrian equipment. In special cases (such as in a small historic town), vertical steel shaft supports may be used without overhead signal displays if approved by the region Traffic Engineer, as allowed by the MUTCD. Justification shall be provided for the use of vertical steel shaft signals without any overhead signal displays, as displays are too easily obstructed from view. When placing signal standards, the primary consideration is the visibility of signal faces. Place the signal supports as far as feasible from the edge of the traveled way without adversely affecting signal visibility. (The MUTCD provides additional guidance on locating signal supports.) Initially, lay out the location for supports for vehicle display systems, pedestrian detection systems, and pedestrian display systems independently to determine the optimal location for each type of support. Consider the need for future right-turn lanes or intersection widening when choosing the final location of the signal standards. Poles should also be located outside of sight triangles for turning traffic. See Section 1600.03(2)(e) for more information and documentation requirements. If conditions allow and optimal locations are not compromised, pedestrian displays and pedestrian detectors can be installed on the vehicular display supports. However, pole placement cannot encroach on pedestrian access route or maneuvering space requirements. Pole mounted appurtenances, such as pushbuttons, terminal cabinets, and displays, need to be taken into consideration regarding their encroachment into accessible spaces. Another important consideration that can influence the position of signal standards is the presence of overhead and underground utilities. Verify the location of these lines during the preliminary design stage to avoid costly changes during construction: a. Underground Utilities: Underground utilities must be located, marked, and surveyed. If any underground utility is within 10 feet of any foundation, consider potholing for the utility to find its actual location. Field locates are rarely precise and must be verified if a potential conflict exists. b. Overhead Utilities: Signal standards may be located within close proximity to overhead communications lines (phone, cable, fiber-optic), but the lines should not touch the any part of the signal system and should not pass in front of any displays. Overhead power lines require a minimum 10-foot circumferential clearance for lines rated at 50kV (50,000 V) or below, including the neutral. For lines rated over 50kV, the minimum clearance is 10 feet plus 0.4 inches for each kV over 50kV. Overhead utilities may have to be relocated if a suitable location for signal equipment cannot be found. Once pole locations have been selected, a soils investigation is required to determine the lateral bearing pressure, the friction angle of the soil, and whether groundwater may be encountered. Standard foundations may be used if the soil lateral bearing pressure is at least 1,000 psf, the friction angle is at least 17°, and the ground slope is 2H:1V or flatter. Standard foundation information is found in the Standard Plans, and depends on the type of support system being used. Special foundation designs are required if the soil lateral bearing pressure is less than 1,000 psf, the friction angle is less than 17°, or the ground slope is steeper than 2H:1V. The region materials group works with the HQ Materials Laboratory to determine the bearing pressure and friction angle of the soil at the proposed foundation locations. If soils do not meet these minimum values for lateral bearing pressure and friction angle, the signal standard charts and soil conditions report (summary of geotechnical conditions for foundations) must be forwarded to the HQ Bridge and Structures Office with a request for special foundation design. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office designs foundations for the regions and reviews designs submitted by others.

Where poles are installed on structures, the anchorage must be designed by the Bridge designer. Coordinate with the Bridge designer for placement and design of pole anchorages on structures. Do not place any signal standard in a median area. The sole exception is a Type PS or Type PPB signal standard as required for median refuge areas for pedestrians. Coordinate with all stakeholders (Maintenance, Signal Operations, Civil Design Engineer, Drainage Engineer, and so on) in the placement of signal equipment to avoid any possible conflicts. Arrange field reviews with the appropriate stakeholders as necessary.
1330.04(5)(a) Mast Arm Signal Standards and Foundation Design Mast arm signal standards are designated by the following types:
•
•
•
Type II: Single mast arm with no luminaire mount. Type III: Single mast arm with luminaire mount. Type SD: Double mast arm, with or without luminaire mount.
Mast arm signal standards are normally located on the far-right corner of the intersection from approaching traffic. A typical mast arm signal standard only has one mast arm, however two may be used. If the angle between the two arms is not exactly 90 degrees, the design must be sent to the bridge and structures office. In most cases, two arms at 90 degrees can support the necessary display positioning. Additionally, signal standards on mast arms may be rotated up to 30 degrees from center. Do not allow a mast arm for one direction to cross in front of the mast arm for a different direction if possible, as it results in a visual obstruction of the signal displays. Where two double arm signal standards are installed on opposite corners, the preferred location for the two poles are the far-right corners of the mainline roadway. This way, the mast arms for the mainline traffic will not cross in front of each other. Mast arm signal standards have a typical arm attachment point of 18 to 20 feet in height. This height range needs to be taken into consideration when placing signal displays in order to ensure that the display height requirements shown in Section 1330.04(3) are met. The attachment point height may be adjusted throughout this range as necessary but increments of 0.5 feet are recommended for ease of fabrication. Connection points outside of this range are a special design and require design support from the Bridge and Structures Office. Mast arm signal standards are designed based on the total wind load moment on the mast arm. The moment is a function of the surface area of each appurtenance (signal display or sign), X * Y, and the distance between the vertical centerline of each appurtenance and the vertical centerline of the signal pole Z. This determines the total wind load moment, referred to as an XYZ value and measured in cubic feet, which is used to select the appropriate mast arm fabrication plan and foundation design. Preapproved mast arm fabrication plans are available at https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/all-manuals-and-standards/plan-sheetlibrary/illumination-signals-and-its, and will be listed in the Contract Provisions. To determine the XYZ value for a signal standard, the XYZ value of each appurtenance must be calculated. These values are then totaled to determine the overall XYZ value for the signal standard. For signal standards with two mast arms at 90 degrees apart, the larger of the two XYZ values calculated for each mast arm is used for the overall pole XYZ value. When determining the XYZ values, use the worst-case scenarios for signal display and sign placements. All signal displays and mast arm-mounted signs, including street name signs, must be included in this calculation. Emergency preemption detectors, preemption indicator lights, cameras, and radar detectors are negligible and are not included in determining the XYZ values. For mast arm-mounted signs, use the actual sign area (in square feet) to determine the XYZ value.

Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
For poles with luminaire supports, the luminaire and arm are also included in the total XYZ calculation. Surface areas for vehicle displays are shown in Exhibit 1330-21. Signs are limited in size as follows:
•
•
•
Street name signs may be a maximum of 36 inches in height and 36 square feet in total area. Design the mast arm to support the widest sign that will fit within these limits (up to 144 inches wide), regardless of the actual sign size needed. This allows for future changes to the street name sign. Street name signs are mounted such that the edge of the pole is no less than 1 foot but no more than 2.5 feet from the vertical pole centerline, as shown in the Standard Plans. Use the offset necessary for the largest possible sign in the signal standard chart for the XYZ value, but refer to the Standard Plans for actual sign installation requirements using construction notes in the Contract Plans. Other mast arm mounted signs may not exceed 36 inches in height and 7.5 square feet in area. Signs mounted on the vertical pole may not exceed 36 inches in width and 15 square feet in area. These signs are not included in the XYZ calculation.
After calculating the total XYZ value, adjust the total XYZ value as follows: If the total XYZ value is less than or equal to 2850 ft3, round the XYZ value up to the next standard foundation XYZ value or 2850 ft3, whichever is lower, to determine the design XYZ value. The design XYZ builds in some flexibility for future modifications.
•
If the total XYZ value exceeds 2850 ft3, use the calculated XYZ value. There is limited opportunity for future increased wind load when the XYZ value exceeds 2850 ft3.

After the total XYZ value is determined, if a standard foundation may be used, select the correct foundation depths for the XYZ values from the table in the Standard Plans, using the next higher total XYZ value. For WSDOT systems, only the 700, 1350, 1900, 2600, and 3000 columns may be used. All five foundation options should be provided unless there is a known constraint preventing the use of one of the options, such as insufficient space for 4 ft diameter foundation or expected loose soil requiring the use of the Alternate 2 foundation construction.
1330.04(5)(b) Span Wire Signal Standards and Foundation Design Span Wire Systems use poles and aerial wires to support signal displays, signs, and emergency preemption equipment. Cameras, radar detectors, and street name signs are installed on the vertical strain poles. When laying out span wires, the preferred layout is similar to mast arm supports. Displays for an approach should be installed on a span on the far side of the intersection, with poles on the two far corners. Do not use diagonal spans unless absolutely necessary, as they are extremely difficult to maintain and if the wire is broken, the entire signal system is lost and blocks the entire intersection, rather than the equipment for only one approach. Span wire signal standards include both steel and timber strain poles. Steel and timber strain poles are designated by pole class, which is based on the horizontal tension load the pole will support. The loads and resultant forces imposed on strain poles are calculated and a pole class greater than that load is specified. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-32
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
Steel Pole Classes and their allowed tension loads are listed in the Standard Plans. Exhibit 1330-22 lists the pole classes and tension loading available for timber strain poles. Headquarters Traffic and Headquarters Bridge and Structures office support is required for determining span tension load and pole classes. Provide the pole and span layout, the locations and sizes of all signal displays and span wire mounted signs, and the soils report. Span wire mounted signs are limited to a maximum of 36 inches in height and 7.5 square feet in area. Emergency preemption equipment locations do not need to be submitted, as they are not included in load calculations. Spans should not exceed 150 feet, if possible, in order to reduce the complexity of the design. After the pole classes are provided by the Headquarters Bridge and Structures office, select the appropriate foundation information from the Standard Plans using the pole classes and soil conditions. If a standard foundation cannot be used, a foundation design will be provided along with the pole class information. Exhibit 1330-22 Timber Strain Pole Classes Pole Class

1330.04(5)(c) Special Case Signal Supports Special case signal supports include signal bridges and structure (typically bridge) mounts. These should only be selected if absolutely necessary, as they are difficult to design, construct, and maintain, and they frequently result in signal display locations that are difficult for drivers to see. Use of these types of supports requires approval from the Headquarters Traffic Office. Signal bridges function the same as a diagonal span wire system, with the two supports on opposite corners of the intersection. Signal bridges require windload calculations similar to mast arm signal standards, so display and sign locations and offsets must be provided. Signal bridge foundations must be designed by the Headquarters Bridge and Structures office. Signal displays and other equipment may be installed on structures when there is insufficient clearance below the structure to allow for a different type of signal support. Coordinate with the Bridge designer to place mounts and determine routing paths for conduit and wiring out of the structure. Structure mounts are not desirable, as they typically cannot be modified without reconstruction of the structure itself, and any equipment embedded in the structure is inaccessible after the structure is complete. Signal displays may not be installed on sign structures such as cantilever sign structures or sign bridges. Signal displays also may not be installed on railroad cantilever structures unless the signal system and the railroad are owned by the same jurisdiction and maintained by the same staff.

1330.04(5)(d) Vertical Steel Shaft Supports Vertical steel shaft supports include the following types of signal standards: a) Type PPB: Sometimes referred to as a “stub pole”, this pole is typically 5 feet tall and 3 inches in diameter. It is used strictly to support pedestrian pushbuttons. Due to the frequency of damage, regardless of location, it is recommended that breakaway bases always be used. b) Type PS, I, RM, and FB: These poles are effectively identical, with the difference being the total height to the slipfitter top. o Type PS are 8 ft tall and may only have pedestrian displays mounted on the top. o Type I are 10 ft tall and may have vehicle displays mounted on the top and pedestrian displays mounted on the side. Type RM are identical to Type I but are used for ramp meter systems only. o Type FB are 14 feet tall and may be used like Type I when additional height is needed for the vehicle display(s). Placement of vertical steel shaft supports will depend on visibility requirements for displays and accessibility requirements of pedestrian features. Generally, these supports should be located at back of sidewalk, as they are farther from traffic and more likely to be out of both the pedestrian access route and the path of any users. Fixed bases should be used when located at the back of sidewalk but slip bases may be used if circumstances recommend it. Supports located within sidewalk (includes planter strips) or in locations with only paved shoulders should always use slip bases.
1330.04(6) Vehicle Detection Systems Vehicle detection systems are necessary for the efficient operation of traffic signals. By responding to the presence of traffic, signal systems do not have to use fixed timing. This improves efficiency by removing unnecessary delay and not providing service to an approach or movement with no traffic.
1330.04(6)(a) Vehicle Detection Zone Placement The vehicle detection system at a traffic-actuated signal installation provides the control unit with information regarding the presence or movement of vehicles, including motorcycles and bicycles. Vehicle detection systems perform two basic functions: queue clearance and the termination of phases. Depending on the specific intersection characteristics, either of these functions can take priority. The merits of each function are considered, and a compromise might be necessary. There are two basic types of detection zones: stop bar and advance. Stop bar detection is a zone that extends from the stop line to a point 30 to 40 feet in advance of that location. Advance detection is a discrete zone (or zones) placed in advance of the stop line at a distance dependent on vehicle speed. Basic vehicle detection requirements depend upon the speeds of the approaching vehicles: a) When the posted speed is below 35 mph, provide stop bar detection or one advance detection zone. See Exhibit 1330-23 for advance detection zone distances. b) When the posted speed is at or above 35 MPH, provide stop bar detection and at least two advance detection zones. Multiple advance detection zones are normally required to adequately provide decision zone detection.

Page 1330-34
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
c) Side street advance detection is not required for WSDOT owned signal systems but may be provided through means that do not require equipment to be installed off of WSDOT right of way. For signals owned by other jurisdictions, the use of side street advance detection is at the discretion of the owning jurisdiction. For posted speeds of 35 MPH or higher, there are two options for placing advance detectors to address the decision zone: 1. Fixed locations based on posted speed, which is generally the 85th percentile speed. Place loops according to the table in Exhibit 1330-23. 2. Calculated locations based on calculated decision zone detection design. This design increases the opportunity for a range of vehicles from the 90th percentile speed vehicle to the 10th percentile speed vehicle to either clear the intersection or decelerate to a complete stop before reaching the intersection. The method of calculating the decision zone and the required detection loops is shown in Exhibit 1330-24. Although the exhibits reference loops, advance detectors may be of any approved type. For new intersection construction where there is no existing traffic, the fixed locations based on posted (target design) speed are to be used. Fixed locations based on posted speed use the same methods as the calculated decision zone detection design but set V90 at 5 MPH above posted speed and V10 at 5 MPH below posted speed. Engineering judgment based on similar intersections (such as geometrics and traffic volumes) may justify modifying the V90 and V10 speeds used in the calculation, with concurrence from the region Signal Operations Engineer. Both methods require a study of the approach speeds at the intersection. For intersection approaches, conduct the speed study as follows:
•
•
•
•
Collect data at the approximate location or just upstream of the decision zone; Collect data during off-peak hours in free-flow and favorable weather conditions; Collect data during regular commuting hours in a high-volume signalized corridor during favorable weather conditions Only document the speed of the lead vehicle in each platoon.
It is important that the person conducting the speed study remain inconspicuous, so they do not influence drivers to slow down. Normal driving patterns are needed for proper speed studies. Prior speed-study information obtained at this location may be used if it is less than 18 months old and driving conditions have not changed significantly in the area. Preserve detection zone placements and any supporting calculations as required by Section 1330.07 Documentation.

Traffic Control Signals
1330.04(6)(b) Vehicle Detector Types There are two basic categories of vehicle detectors:
•
•
Non-Invasive: These are detectors installed outside of the roadway, typically overhead in a strategic location. These include camera (optical and infra-red) and radar systems. In-Pavement: These are detectors which are installed in the road itself. These include induction loops and wireless in-pavement sensors.
Non-invasive detection is generally recommended over in-pavement detection, due to the ability to revise noninvasive detection at any time and the ease of installation, repair, and replacement – particularly when supporting traffic control and impacts are taken into account. Additionally, pavement damage due to regular wear or construction activities will disable in-pavement detection, whereas non-invasive detectors will continue to function, and can even be adjusted to support revised lane configurations. Stop line detection should use non-invasive systems for detection. Although induction loop detectors are typically the most reliable for detecting cars and trucks, they do not consistently detect bicycles and motorcycles. RCW 47.36.025 specifically requires that vehicle-activated traffic control signals be capable of detecting motorcycles and bicycles. Advanced detection may be either non-invasive or in-pavement, as these improve efficiency of the signal systems but are not as critical as stop line detection. Non-invasive detection is recommended for posted speeds of 45 MPH or lower, as they are currently only effective for up to about 600 feet from the location of the detector. The advantage is that advance detection can be installed at the intersection, rather than trenching long distances to place advanced detectors in pavement. For speeds over 45 MPH, non-invasive detection systems may be considered, but in-pavement systems will probably be more effective. Advance detection does not need to detect bicycles. Selection of detector types will depend on a variety of environmental factors and locations available for placement. 1. Radar Detectors Radar detectors are located on either the signal mast arms or the signal vertical strain poles, depending on lane configuration, detector type, and location availability. Radar detectors are not affected by weather and are typically minimally affected by mast arm motion in high wind. Consult the detector manufacturer’s installation guidance for placement details. One detector can normally cover all lanes of an approach for that type of detection (stop line or advance). 2. Video Detectors Placement of video detectors depends on the function of the detector. Both infra-red and optical cameras are available, but WSDOT systems may not use optical cameras due to the adverse effects of rain, snow, fog, sun glare, and sharp shadows on their effectiveness. Infra-red cameras may still be affected by heavy fog or other major thermal events, but it is more of a rare occurrence than with optical cameras. All video detection may be affected by mast arm motion due to high winds. 3. Exhibit 1330-25 provides placement examples. Stop line detectors should be installed on the same mast arm as the vehicle displays for that approach. The detector should be placed on an extension of the wide line between the left turn and through lanes, if present; if there is no wide line, the detector should be centered on the through lanes. One detector can cover all lanes of an approach for that type of detection (stop line or advance). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-38
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
Advance detectors should be installed on a luminaire arm, preferably on the adjacent corner to the approaching lanes, as the effectiveness of the advance detection depends on height. Consider requiring a luminaire arm even if no luminaire is needed, in order to provide an optimal installation site for the detector. Advance detectors may be installed on a mast arm but will typically have less effective range. Both infra-red and optical cameras are available, but WSDOT systems may not use optical cameras due to the adverse effects of rain, snow, fog, sun glare, and sharp shadows on their effectiveness. Infra-red cameras may still be affected by heavy fog or other major thermal events, but it is more of a rare occurrence than with optical cameras. All video detection may be affected by mast arm motion due to high winds.

3. Induction Loops Induction Loops are coils of wire in the roadway that use the magnetic properties of vehicles to detect them. Induction loops can last a very long time when undisturbed. However, induction loops require bicycles to be in a very specific location in order to be detected and may not detect carbon fiber bicycles. Induction loops must be installed with one per lane per detection zone – stop line WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-40
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
loops may be larger or series loops. Where induction loops are used, loops need to be numbered in order to keep track of the wiring and lanes they are detecting. See Section 1330.04(2) for detector numbering requirements. 4. Wireless In-Pavement Sensors Wireless in-pavement sensors are compact detectors installed in pavement and use either radar or magnetics to detect vehicles. They use a wireless connection to the signal cabinet. The sensors rely on a battery for operation and require replacement of the entire unit when they fail. Sensor placement is similar to induction loops – one per lane per detection zone. The magnetic versions are subject to the same difficulties with bicycles as loop detectors. All wireless sensors are also subject to various factors that affect wireless signals such as range, signal obstructions, and possible signal interference from other radios depending on the frequency used. Non-invasive detectors are preferred with concrete (Portland cement concrete pavement) roadway surfaces. Inpavement detectors installed in concrete panels typically cannot be revised or replaced until all affected concrete panels are replaced. In-pavement detectors installed in bridge decks must be installed when the bridge deck is constructed and cannot be replaced unless the bridge deck is replaced. Non-invasive detection is also useful for approaches where advance detection is desired, but the approach is outside the jurisdiction of the agency that owns the signal, or for non-standard approaches such as driveways. Temporary detection should be installed for all stop lines where existing detection will be disabled or ineffective (such as lane shifts) during construction. Temporary advance detection is recommended for 45 MPH or higher approaches where the decision zone detection will be disconnected for an extended period of time. Consult with the Signal Operations Engineer to determine if temporary advance detection should be used. Temporary advance detection zone placement should take into account any temporary speed limit revisions.
1330.04(7) Preemption Systems 1330.04(7)(a) Emergency Vehicle Preemption Emergency vehicle preemption (EVP) is required for all traffic signals unless approved otherwise by the region Traffic Engineer. WSDOT is responsible for installing EVP detection equipment at new and rebuilt signalized intersections on state highways. At existing signalized intersections that do not have EVP detection equipment, or where an emergency service agency requests additional equipment beyond the basic required equipment, the emergency service agency is responsible for all material and installation costs. The emergency service agency is responsible for preemption emitters in all cases. Optically activated EVP systems are used to ensure compatibility with all area emergency service agency emitters. Approval by the State Traffic Engineer is required for the installation of any other type of emergency vehicle preemption system. Locate optical detectors facing each approach to the intersection – only one detector per approach – with a clear view of the approaching roadway. Detectors have a cone of vision of approximately 8 degrees, and an effective range of 200 to 2500 feet. Detectors should have an unobstructed view of the approach for a minimum of 1800 feet. Primary detectors are normally installed on the same support as the vehicle displays for that approach. Place the detector between the left turn lane and through lane displays on approaches with left turn lanes, or centered on the approaching lanes where left turn lanes are absent.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-41
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
When the approach is in a horizontal or vertical curve, or there are other sight obstructions, non-standard placement of the primary detector or additional supplemental detectors may be necessary. Primary detectors may be located on other signal display supports (arms or spans) or vertical strain poles, depending on visibility requirements. Supplemental detectors may also be located on separate Type I or Type FB poles in advance of the intersection. On higher speed roadways, supplemental detectors can provide extended detection range – one mile in advance of the intersection is usually sufficient. Preserve any documentation associated with the EVP system, including system type selected and any associated agreements or approvals, as required by Section 1330.07 Documentation.
1330.04(7)(b) Railroad Preemption Railroad preemption is used when a railroad is in close proximity to a signalized intersection. If railroad tracks are within 1/4 mile of a signalized intersection, then a Railroad Crossing Evaluation Team is formed to determine the need (if any) for railroad preemption, interconnection, simultaneous preemption, advanced preemption, and so on. The Railroad Crossing Evaluation Team should consist of region and HQ Signal Design Engineers, region and HQ Signal Operations Engineers, HQ Railroad Liaison, HQ Rail Office representative, region Utilities Engineer, region Traffic Design Engineer, region Maintenance Superintendent, and the affected railroad representative. Where the signal is owned, operated, or maintained by a local agency, a local agency representative should also be included. The Railroad Crossing Evaluation Team will determine what design considerations are needed at all signalized intersections near railroad crossings. For locations where the railroad tracks are located greater than 500 feet from the signalized intersection, and it can be demonstrated that the 95% maximum queue length(s) will not extend to within 200 feet of the tracks, railroad preemption may be omitted with the approval of the Railroad Crossing Evaluation Team. Include the demonstration and approval in the documentation required by Section 1330.07 Documentation. Railroad preemption and interconnection are recommended when any of the following conditions occurs:
•
•
•
•
The distance from the stop bar to the nearest rail is less than or equal to 200 feet. There is no dedicated left turn lane and the distance from the stop bar to the nearest rail is less than or equal to 500 feet. The 95% maximum queue lengths from the intersection stop bar are projected to cross the tracks. (Use a queue arrival/departure study or a traffic analysis “micro-simulation model” to determine 95% maximum queue lengths.) The 95% maximum queue lengths from the railroad are projected to affect an upstream traffic signal. (Use a queue arrival/departure study or a traffic analysis “micro-simulation model” to determine 95% maximum queue lengths.)
If it is determined that advanced preemption is needed, the HQ and region Signal Operations Engineers will calculate the amount of railroad preemption time required using the WSDOT Railroad-Traffic Signal Preemption Timing Worksheet.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-42
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
The addition of a pre-signal is recommended when any of the following conditions occurs:
•
•
•
The distance from the stop bar to the nearest rail is less than 88 feet but is at least 40 feet. (For reference, the 88 feet is derived from: the longest design vehicle permitted by statute (75 feet) + front overhang (3 feet) + rear overhang (4 feet) + downstream clear storage (6 feet)). The distance from the stop bar to the nearest rail is > 88 feet and < 120 feet and there are no gates for the railroad crossing. The sight distance triangle in Chapter 1350, Exhibit 1350-1 (Sight Distance at Railroad Crossing), cannot be met, and the railroad crossing does not have active control (lights or gates).
When pre-signals are used, two stop lines are used: one for the rail crossing, and one for the intersection. The pre-signal displays stop traffic at the rail crossing stop line, and the second set of signal displays stop traffic at the intersection. Use louvers on the intersection displays so that they are not visible from the stop line for the rail crossing. Optically programmed displays may be used in place of louvers, but are not recommended due to the limited benefits, complexity of installation and maintenance, and high cost. Where the distance between the normal location for the stop bar and the approach is less than 40 feet, the same stop bar should be used for both the traffic signal and the rail crossing. Install vehicle displays on the near side of the intersection, but on the far side of the tracks from the stop line, to improve visibility and discourage drivers from stopping between the tracks and the intersection. Do not install vehicle displays on the far side of the intersection. Exhibit 1330-26 shows examples of the distances and typical system layouts referenced above. The Railroad Crossing Evaluation Team has final review and approval authority for all PS&E documents for signal design and operation at all signalized intersections near railroad crossings. All documentation associated with railroad preemption and a memo with each team member’s concurrence with the PS&E documents must be preserved as required by Section 1330.07 Documentation.

1330.04(7)(c) Transit Priority Preemption Transit Priority Preemption allows for transit operations to influence signal timing, similar to emergency vehicle preemption. This can be included in mobility projects, but the transit agency assumes all costs for providing, installing, and maintaining this preemption equipment. WSDOT’s role is limited to approving preemption operational strategies (phasing, timing, software, and so on) and verifying the compatibility of the transit agency’s equipment with the traffic signal control equipment. Preserve all transit priority preemption decisions and agreements as required by Section 1330.07 Documentation.
1330.04(8) Control Equipment The standard WSDOT Signal Controller type for traffic signals is the Type 2070 Controller. Some agencies use National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) controllers (Type TS1 or TS2). Although not normally used for new construction, WSDOT Ramp Meters and some older systems still use Type 170 Controllers. All traffic signal controllers have the following basic functions:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Dual ring phase operation Eight vehicle phases Four pedestrian phases Four overlap phases Four emergency vehicle preemption channels Railroad preemption Start and end daylight savings time dates Transit preemption (some older controllers may not support this)
Type 2070 controllers and newer NEMA controllers are functionally equivalent for basic signal operations. However, Type 2070 controllers and NEMA controllers use different operating software and communications protocols, and therefore cannot be interconnected together. The type of controller should be specified as follows: 1. For WSDOT traffic signals, specify Type 2070 controllers, unless: a. The signal is interconnected with other signals. If the other controllers in the interconnected system are not being replaced, specify a controller (2070, NEMA, or other) that matches the rest of the interconnected system. b. The signal is operated by another agency. In this case, work with WSDOT and the other agency’s maintenance staff to determine the appropriate controller type. 2. For traffic signals owned by other agencies, specify the controller type used by that agency. The region or operating agency will determine the controller brand and operating software, which are included in the cabinet specifications. Each region or operating agency will provide specifications for their cabinets and the equipment contained therein. For 2070 controllers, double-width cabinets (two racks) should be specified if physically possible to allow for future communications and ITS equipment. It is often beneficial for one of the agencies to assume responsibility for the operation of the traffic signals. This is accomplished by negotiating an agreement with the other agency. The designer needs to check region policy and make sure someone initiates the process for setting up an operational agreement with the other agency or modifying an existing agreement when applicable. See the Agreements Manual for more information on signal systems and maintenance agreements (Consultants: Please contact your WSDOT Project Manager for access to the Agreements Manual). At a new intersection, where the state owns the signal, but WSDOT has agreed to let

Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
another agency operate the signal, the controller should be compatible with that agency’s system. When installing a new controller in an existing interconnected corridor, the controller should be capable of operating with the existing controllers in the corridor. In situations where it is necessary to coordinate the traffic movements with another agency, it is important that the agencies work together. Intersections within ½ mile of each other on state highways should be interconnected. Perform an operational analysis to determine need for interconnection where intersections are within 1 mile of each other on state highways with a posted speed of 45 MPH or higher. The preferred method for interconnection is fiber optic cable, but other methods such as IP over copper or wireless interconnect may be considered after discussion with maintenance staff and approval by the region Traffic Engineer. Where fiber optic cable is used, it must be routed through pull boxes and cable vaults – bending fiber optic cable through standard junction boxes typically results in the cable being broken. Consider using a separate pull box or vault for coiling the fiber optic interconnect cable to allow for the large-bend radii. Add a construction note in the plans stating to coil additional cable in the adjacent pull box or vault, not the controller cabinet. This will save on space in the controller cabinet and provides additional cable in case an errant vehicle hits the cabinet. Coordinate with the operations and maintenance staff to determine the optimum controller cabinet location and the cabinet door orientation. The controller cabinet is positioned to provide the best maintenance access and clearest view of the intersection possible. Preferred visibility allows for as many signal displays and roadway approaches visible as possible from a single location. Cabinets should not be placed where they might block the view of turning traffic (intersection sight triangle). If possible, position the controller where it will not be affected by future highway construction. Cabinets require a minimum of 36 inches of level space in front of each door, including the concrete pad. Do not place cabinets where flooding might occur or where the cabinet might be hit by errant vehicles. If there is a steep down slope or drop off near the cabinet, personnel fall protection (such as fencing) is required in accordance with standards established by the Department of Labor and Industries. Fall protection may not encroach on the required clear space for the cabinet. The location must also have adequate room for a maintenance vehicle to park near the cabinet. Sufficient space for a bucket truck to park is preferable. If a telephone line (voice or DSL), fiber optic, wireless, or other connection is desired for remote access to the equipment in the cabinet, provide the appropriate equipment in the controller cabinet and/or nearby junction box or cable vault with separate conduits and junction boxes for the remote communications equipment. Communications connections to outside utilities require their own separate conduit and box/vault system. Consult with maintenance and operations staff to determine if a backup power source, such as an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) or backup generator, is needed for the signal cabinet. Install the backup power supply on the same concrete pad as the signal cabinet. Service and other cabinets may also be installed on the same concrete pad as the signal cabinet (see the Standard Plans for concrete cabinet pad layouts). Refer to Chapter 1040 for electrical service types, overcurrent protection, and descriptions and requirements for other components.
1330.04(9) Wiring, Conduit, and Junction Boxes Consider cost, flexibility, construction requirements, and ease of maintenance when laying out the electrical circuits for the traffic signal system. Consolidate roadway crossings (signal, illumination, ITS conduits, and so on) whenever possible to minimize the number of crossings and take advantage of single crossing construction (joint trenches or consolidated directional boring). Include all electrical design calculations in the Project File.

Traffic Control Signals
1330.04(9)(a) System Wiring Traffic signal systems use multi-conductor cables to connect most of the equipment. Single conductor cable is limited to cabinet power and street lighting circuits. The following describes typical WSDOT wire type selection:
•
•
•
•
•
•
5c cables for signal displays. One 5c per signal phase may connect the signal cabinet to the terminal cabinet on the pole. Separate 5c cables should connect each signal display to the terminal cabinet. Protected / permissive displays may either use one 7c cable or two 5c cables (one for each phase on the shared display). 5c cables for pedestrian displays. Consult with region maintenance to determine if the same 5c cable is used for associated pedestrian detection. 3cs cables for emergency preemption detectors. 2c cables for induction loop detectors. Shielded cable is not required for modern loop detector cards. Older systems may still need shielded cable (2cs), but it is recommended to replace the loop detector cards instead. Manufacturer specified cables for video and radar detectors. Video detectors typically use a combined RG9/5c (#18) cable. Radar detectors typically use proprietary 6c and 8c cables. These cables are roughly the size of 7c cables (for calculating conduit fill). Use 2c cables for isolated pedestrian detectors (separate pole from associated pedestrian display). For connecting 4-wire APS units, a 7c cable may be used between the PPB post and the signal pole with the pedestrian display (where the APS control unit is located).
To simplify potential repairs for smaller signal standards (Type FB and smaller), consider routing signal display and detection conductors through terminal cabinets on larger signal standards (Type II and larger) before connecting to smaller signal standards. This reduces the amount of wire which may need to be replaced if a smaller signal standard is knocked down and the wiring damaged.
1330.04(9)(b) Conduit Refer to the Standard Specifications for conduit installation requirements. At existing intersections, where roadway reconstruction is not proposed, conduits are to be placed beyond the paved shoulder or behind existing sidewalks to reduce installation costs. All conduits shall be a minimum of 2 inches in size, with the following exceptions: 1. Conduits entering Type PPB signal standards shall be 1 inch. This may be increased to 1 1/4 inch when two APS PPBs are installed on the same pole. 2. Lighting conduits entering pole foundations (signal or light standards) shall be a minimum of 1 inch. See Chapter 1040 for additional requirements for light standards with slip bases. 3. Conduits entering Type PS, I, RM, and FB poles may be a minimum of 1-inch and a maximum of 2-inch. 4. The conduit for the service grounding electrode conductor may be a minimum of ½-inch. Install spare conduits at all road crossings. Spare conduits at road crossings should be a minimum of one 3-inch conduit or two 2-inch conduits. Install a minimum 2-inch (preferably 3-inch) spare conduit into the controller cabinet.

It is recommended to use full inch conduit sizes to simplify construction and reduce the different types of conduits required for the system. This helps to provide future capacity and reduce costs through bulk material purchasing. Size all conduits to provide 26% maximum conductor fill for new signal installations. A 40% fill area can be used when installing conductors in existing conduits. (See Exhibit 1330-27 for conduit and signal conductor sizes.)

Minimize roadway crossings whenever possible. Usually only three crossings are needed (one main line) for a four-leg intersection, and only two roadway crossings are needed for a T intersection. In most cases, the conduit should cross both the main line and side street from the corner where the controller is located. Directional boring should normally be used when crossing the state route (main line). Open cut trenching may only be used to install conduits under the following circumstances: 1. Existing roadways where the roadway is being resurfaced. 2. Existing roadways where substantial obstacles under the roadway will be encountered. 3. Where there is insufficient room for jacking or boring pits at the edges of the roadway. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-48
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
Open cut trenching is not permitted across limited access roadways unless the entire pavement surface is being replaced. Sign or signal bridges may not be used for roadway crossings.
1330.04(9)(c) Junction Boxes Provide junction boxes at the following locations:
•
•
•
•
•
Adjacent to the signal cabinet. A pull box or larger vault may be used in place of multiple junction boxes. Adjacent to each signal pole. One box may serve multiple poles. The distance from a pole to the first junction box should not exceed 10 feet without concurrence from maintenance staff. Pole bases may not be used as junction boxes. Adjacent to each set of detector loops. These boxes contain the detector loop splices. One box may serve multiple lanes, but the box should be no more than 50 feet from the detector loop. At the end of each road crossing. In the middle of conduit runs where the number of bends would equal or exceed 360°.
Where possible, locate junction boxes out of paved areas and adjacent to (but not in) sidewalks. New junction boxes may not to be placed in the pedestrian curb ramp or ramp landing of a sidewalk. If a new junction box must be placed within sidewalk, locate it at the edge of the sidewalk and designate it to be slip-resistant. Existing junction boxes located within new or existing sidewalk, including ramps or landings, must be revised as follows:
•
•
•
•
Existing junction boxes containing power conductors for the traffic signal (not including street lighting), or wiring for the signal displays, may remain in place, even if they will be within a sidewalk ramp or ramp landing. Existing junction boxes containing detector wiring may remain in sidewalks but must be relocated outside of sidewalk ramps and ramp landings. Designate that the relocation work, including conduit adjustments and rewiring, be completed within a single shift or provide temporary detection using another conduit path. All junction boxes which will be within sidewalk, sidewalk ramps, or ramp landings, must be slipresistant junction boxes. This includes replacing existing junction boxes with slip-resistant junction boxes. Under no circumstances may a junction box be located in a grade break for a sidewalk ramp. Either the ramp must be redesigned or additional accommodations made in construction to allow for the box to be relocated.
The fundamental principle is that if relocating a junction box requires shutting down a traffic signal system, the junction box may remain in its existing location but must be replaced with a slip-resistant junction box. See Chapter 1510 for additional ADA requirements. Do not place junction boxes within the traveled way unless absolutely necessary. Make every effort to locate new junction boxes and to relocate existing junction boxes outside the travel lane or paved shoulder. If there is no way to avoid locating the junction box in the traveled way or paved shoulder, heavy-duty junction boxes must be used. Avoid placing junction boxes in areas of poor drainage. Do not place junction boxes within 2 feet of ditch bottoms or drainage areas, or within vegetative filter strips or similar water treatment features which may be present. The maximum conduit capacities for various types of junction boxes are shown in the Standard Plans.

1330.05 Preliminary Signal Plan All traffic signal work which installs or modifies detection or display equipment, with the sole exception of projects where induction loops are being removed and replaced in the same location, requires a preliminary signal plan for the Project File. The type of preliminary signal plan depends on the type of work being performed. For a new traffic signal system or complete system replacement, a Full Preliminary Signal Plan is required. For all other work, a Basic Preliminary Signal Plan is required. Include a brief discussion of the issue that is being addressed by the project. Provide sufficient level of detail on the preliminary signal plan to describe all aspects of the signal installation, including proposed channelization modifications. The plan scale should not be smaller than “1 inch = 30 feet” (“1 inch = 20 feet” is preferable) – plans may be reduced to “1 inch = 40 feet” with prior approval. Submit a copy of the preliminary signal plan to the State Traffic Engineer for review and comment. A preliminary signal plan must be submitted to the State Traffic Engineer regardless of the originator of the design. Allow two to three weeks for review of the preliminary signal plan. After addressing all review comments, finalize the plan and preserve as required by Section 1330.07 Documentation. Prepare the contract plans in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual. If HQ Traffic is preparing the contract Plans, Specifications, and Estimate (PS&E) package for the signal system portion of the project, submit the following items with the preliminary signal plan: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.
Contact person. Charge numbers. Critical project schedule dates. Existing and proposed utilities, both underground and overhead. Existing intersection layout, if different from the proposed intersection. (Turning movement traffic counts (peak hour for isolated intersections) and a.m., midday, and p.m. peak-hour counts if there is another intersection within 500 feet. 7. Electrical service location, source of power, and utility company connection requirements. After the PS&E package for the signal system portion of the project is prepared, the entire package is transmitted to the region for incorporation into its contract documents.
1330.05(1) Basic Preliminary Signal Plan The Basic Preliminary Signal Plan includes the following elements, at a minimum: a. b. c. d. e.
All pavement markings. Sidewalks, curb ramp, and level landing areas. All pole types and locations. All vehicle and pedestrian display types and locations. All vehicle (car and/or bicycle) detector types and locations. Include detection zones for non-loop detectors. f. All pedestrian pushbutton types and locations. g. All emergency vehicle preemption (EVP) detector locations. h. Phase diagram, including pedestrian movements and EVP channel assignments.

Cabinet locations with door orientations. Traffic barrier (guardrail, concrete barrier, etc.) locations. Drainage items. Left-turn radii, including beginning and ending points. Corner radii, including beginning and ending points. Railroad preemption requirements.

(See Chapter 1040 for more information on illumination design requirements.) h. Traffic counts, including left-turn movements. i. Speed study information indicating 90th, 85th, and 10th percentile speeds for all approaches. For any new approach, or any approach where the existing speed will change, the design posted speed may be provided instead. j. Utilities information, for any potential overhead or underground utility conflicts.
1330.06 Operational Considerations for Design This section describes operational guidance for traffic signals. These operational requirements will directly affect the design of the traffic signal, particularly in regard to signal display types and locations. All traffic signals should be periodically re-evaluated, to determine if timing or phasing changes would result in more efficient operation of the traffic signal, or in the case of interconnected systems, the corridor or network. Changes in traffic volumes, posted speeds, or other factors may influence turning movement phasing operations (protected, protected/permissive, or permissive), green times, yellow change intervals, and other operational parameters.
1330.06(1) Left-Turn Phasing Left-turn phasing can either be permissive, protected/permissive, or protected. It is not necessary that the leftturn mode for an approach be the same throughout the day. Varying the left-turn mode on an approach among the permissive only, protected/permissive, and protected-only left-turn modes during different periods of the day is acceptable. Examples are included in the phase diagrams shown in Exhibit 1330-28 and Exhibit 1330-29. For permissive left turns, including the permissive portion of a protected/permissive left turn, the permissive left turn phase shall not terminate separately from the conflicting phase(s) (typically, the opposing through phase). This is to prevent placing left turning traffic in a yellow trap. 1. Permissive Left-Turn Phasing Permissive left-turn phasing requires the left-turning vehicle to yield to opposing through traffic and pedestrians. Permissive left-turn phasing is used when the following are true: a. Turning volume is minor. b. Adequate gaps occur in the opposing through movement. c. Adequate sight distance beyond the intersection is provided.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-51
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
This phasing is more effective on minor streets where providing separate protected turn phasing might cause significant delays to the higher traffic volume on the main street. On single-lane approaches with a posted speed of 45 mph or above, or where sight distance approaching the intersection is limited, channelization should include a separate left-turn storage lane for the permissive movement to reduce the potential for rear-end-type collisions and delay to through movements. Unless there is a dedicated left-turn lane, do not provide a separate display for permissive left turns. When there is a dedicated left-turn lane, a three-section flashing yellow arrow display (with steady red arrow, steady yellow arrow, and flashing yellow arrow displays) should be used for the left-turn lane, as this provides a more positive indication of the permissive turning movement. 2. Protected/Permissive Left-Turn Phasing Protected/permissive left-turn phasing provides both a protected phase and a permissive phase for the same lane, using the same signal display. Where left-turn phasing will be installed and conditions do not warrant protected-only operation, consider protected/permissive left-turn phasing. Protected/permissive left-turn phasing can result in increased efficiency at some types of intersections, particularly “T” intersections, ramp terminal intersections, and intersections of a two-way street with a one-way street where there are no opposing left-turn movements. Protected/permissive left-turn phasing is NOT allowed under the following conditions: a. For new signals, on an approach where Warrant 7 is met (see Section 1330.02(1)(a)) and there are five or more left-turning collisions on that approach included in the warranting collisions. This condition requires protected left turn phasing. b. For existing signals, when documentation shows that existing protected left-turn phasing was installed due to left-turn collisions. c. When sight distance for left-turning vehicles, as outlined in AASHTO’s A Policy on the Geometric Design of Highways and City Streets, cannot be met. d. On intersection approaches where the opposing approach has three or more lanes (including right-turn lanes) and either the posted speed limit or 85th percentile speeds for the opposing approach are at or above 45 mph. e. On intersection approaches that have dual left-turn lanes, including approaches with left only and through-left lanes. Where there is a separate left-turn lane, protective/permissive displays may use either of the following display arrangements:
•
•
A dedicated four-section arrow display, with steady red arrow, steady yellow arrow, flashing yellow arrow, and steady green arrow displays (four-section FYA). A three-section display with a bi-modal flashing yellow arrow / steady green arrow may only be used if the signal support does not have sufficient capacity for a four-section signal display. A shared five-section cluster (doghouse) display, placed over the wide line between the left turn lane and the adjacent through lane. Cluster displays may not be used for WSDOT signal systems.
Where there is no separate left-turn lane, only a five-section vertical (recommended) or cluster display may be used. The five-section display is used in place of the left of the two required through displays for that approach.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-52
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
Protected/permissive displays may run as lead or lag. The display cycle will depend on the display type and whether the protected left leads or lags: o o
o o
Leading 4-section FYA: steady green arrow, steady yellow arrow, steady red arrow, flashing yellow arrow, steady yellow arrow, steady red arrow. Leading 5-section: green arrow, yellow arrow, red ball, green ball, yellow ball, red ball. Option: green ball may come up with green arrow, but the arrow and ball displays should cycle to yellow and red together (similar to lagging 5-section) Lagging 4-section FYA: flashing yellow arrow, steady green arrow, steady yellow arrow, steady red arrow Lagging 5-section: green ball, green ball with green arrow, yellow ball with yellow arrow, red.
3. Protected Left-Turn Phasing Protected left-turn phasing provides the left-turning vehicle a separate phase, and conflicting movements are required to stop. Use protected left-turn phasing under the following conditions: a. Multi-lane left turn movements, including left and through-left from the same approach. b. The left-turn is onto a roadway with a rail crossing. c. Where Warrant 7 is met and there are five or more left-turning collisions on that approach included in the warranting collisions. Protected left-turn phasing is recommended even when there are as few as three left-turning collisions on that approach. This includes left-turning collisions involving pedestrians. d. Where the peak-hour turning volume exceeds the storage capacity of the left-turn lane and one or more of the following conditions is present: i. The posted speed or the 85th percentile speed of the opposing traffic is 45 mph or higher. ii. The sight distance to oncoming traffic is less than 250 feet when the posted or 85th percentile speed is 35 mph or below, or less than 400 feet when the posted or 85th percentile speed is above 35 mph. iii. The left-turn movement crosses three or more lanes (including right-turn lanes) of opposing traffic. iv. Geometry or channelization is confusing, such as skewed intersections, offset-T intersections, or intersections which require unusual maneuvers to traverse. There are three typical operational arrangements for protected left turns: o
o
o
Leading Lefts: The left turns are served before the associated through movements. This is the most common operational arrangement. Example: Phases 1 and 5 (major street lefts) are served first, then phases 2 and 6 (major street throughs) are served. Lagging Lefts: The left turns are served after the associated through movements. Example: Phases 4 and 8 (minor street throughs) are served first, then phases 3 and 7 (minor street lefts) are served. Offset (or Lead/Lag) Lefts: One left turn is served before the associated through movements, and the opposing left turn is served after the associated through movements. Example: Phase 1 (one major left turn) is served first (phase 6 may be served at the same time), then phases 2 and 6 (major throughs) are served, and then phase 5 (opposing major left turn) is served (phase 2 may still be served with phase 5).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-53
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
Check that all turning movements provide turning clearance for opposing turn phases. If the opposing leftturning vehicle paths do not have 4-foot minimum—12-foot desirable—separation between them, split or offset (lead/lag) phasing will have to be used.
1330.06(2) Right-Turn Phasing Right turns typically do not operate with their own phasing unless there is a dedicated right turn lane. When there is no dedicated right turn lane, right turns are normally a permissive movement from the right most through lane, depending on pedestrian phases in use. When there is a dedicated right turn lane, right-turn phasing effectively operates the same as left-turn phasing. Dedicated right turn lanes may be operated the same as left turn lanes: permissive, protected/permissive, or protected. However, right turn phase operation needs to take into account any pedestrian crossing on the receiving side of the right turn. If there is a conflicting pedestrian phase – typically a pedestrian phase running concurrent with the through phase from which the right turn is being made – the right turn phase may only be operated as permissive. Dedicated right turn lanes operated as permissive and protected/permissive shall have their own displays, to avoid any confusion when indications are shared with the adjacent through lane, unless justification for not providing a separate display is given. Dedicated right turn lanes operated as protected must use their own display. Right turn displays are arranged and operated the same as those listed for left turns in Section 1330.06(1). As with left turns, a permissive right turn phase shall not terminate separately from the conflicting phase(s) (typically, the opposing through phase). Separate right turn phasing also needs to consider some additional operational modes and issues: 1. Right-Turn Overlapped Phasing A right turn overlap is when a protected right turn is allowed at the same time as a complementary protected left turn and is recommended when the lane and phase configuration will support this operation. When this operation is used, the left turn must be signed that U-turns are prohibited. When right turn overlaps are used, the wiring of the right turn displays will depend on the operating mode of each display section:
•
•
Permissive: Connect permissive display sections to the same terminals as the associated through phase. Protected: Protected display sections may either be: (a) Connected to the complementary left turn phase. Use this arrangement when the protected right turn will only be run concurrent with the complementary left turn phase. (b) Connected to an overlap phase. Use this arrangement when the protected right turn will be run with both the complementary left turn phase and with the through phase associated with the right turn.

Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
2. Multiple-Lane Right-Turn Phasing Multiple-lane right turns may be run independent or overlapped as described above. Multiple-lane right turns can cause operational challenges when “right turn on red” is permitted at the intersection. Verify that there is adequate sight distance and adequate receiving lanes are available to minimize the possibility of collisions. In most cases, a single unrestricted “right-turn-only” lane approach with a separate receiving lane (auxiliary lane) will have a similar capacity as the two lane right-turn phasing.
1330.06(3) Typical Signal Phasing Arrangements The following diagrams show typical phasing diagrams for four-way and three-way intersections. Exhibit 1330-28 Phase Diagrams: Four-Way Intersections

1330.06(4) Phasing at Railroad Crossings Traffic signals near railroad crossings have additional special phasing arrangements. To provide for efficient signal operations during a rail crossing, ensure that there are dedicated turn lanes for movements turning onto the tracks. These turn lanes should be on their own dedicated phases, so that they may be omitted from the signal timing (held in red) during the rail crossing. This allows for as many of the other intersection movements as possible to continue to operate – a timing scheme referred to as “Limited Service Operation” (LSO). Just prior to LSO, when railroad preemption is used, the traffic signal will shift to a “Track Clearance Green” (TCG) phase. TCG shifts non-conflicting phases to green to allow vehicles to clear the railroad tracks. Examples of a TCG phase and LSO are shown in Exhibit 1330-30. Standalone queue cutter signals do not have a TCG phase – contact the HQ Traffic Office for operational guidance on standalone queue cutter signals. Exhibit 1330-30 Phasing at Railroad Crossings

1330.06(5) Accessible Pedestrian Signals Accessible Pedestrian Signals (APS) are required to be operated as follows: 1. All APS at an intersection must use either rapid tick or speech messages – mixed operations at a single intersection are not allowed. 2. Street names in speech messages shall be limited to the basic street name. Do not include cardinals (N, S, E, etc.) or street type (street, avenue, road, etc.) unless needed to avoid confusion where two streets have the same name, such as 2nd Avenue and 2nd Street or Center Drive at Center Way. 3. Walk messages shall be in the format “Walk sign is on to cross <street>”. 4. Button press messages during flashing or solid DON’T WALK phases shall be in the following formats: a. Short press: “Wait”. b. Long press: “Wait to cross <street1> at <street2>”. Street names shall use the same format described above. c.

1340.01 General For the purpose of this chapter, and to remain consistent with WSDOT’s Standard Plans and AASHTO terminology, the terms “access” and “approach” will be referred to as “driveway.” An access on a managed access highway is defined as an “access connection,” while an access on a limited access highway is defined as an “approach.”
Driveways are as much about access as they are about driveway design. This chapter describes the pertinent access criteria along with the design guidelines, including two design templates based on design vehicle, sidewalks, and sight distance criteria, for driveway connections on the state highway system. WSDOT controls driveways on all limited access state highways and regulates driveways on all managed access state highways outside the incorporated limits of a city or town. RCW 47.50.030 states that cities and towns, regardless of population size, are the permitting authority for managed access state highways within their respective incorporated city and town limits. The RCW also requires those cities and towns to adopt standards for access permitting on managed access state highways that meet or exceed WSDOT standards, provided those adopted standards are consistent with WSDOT standards.
1340.02 Access Control Limited access highways are roadways to which WSDOT has acquired the access rights from abutting property owners. Driveways, if they have been allowed, are documented and recorded in the deed and right-of-way limited access plan. Chapter 530 describes the three levels of limited access highways: full, partial, and modified. Any change to the number, type, and use of a limited access driveway must be approved by Headquarters through the process outlined in Chapter 530 and Chapter 550.

Chapter 1340
Driveways
A general permit is required to allow any new construction or repairs for a deeded road approach on a limited access highway. Access connection permits are not issued on limited access highways. Any state highway that is not a limited access highway is a managed access highway. Chapter 540 describes the five classes of managed access highways: Class 1 (most restrictive) to Class 5 (least restrictive). In addition to the five access control classes, there are also corner clearance criteria that must be used for access connections near intersections (see Section 540.04 and Exhibit 540-2). An access connection permit is required to allow the use, operation, and maintenance of a driveway connection on a managed access highway, outside incorporated cities, where WSDOT is the access permitting authority. Check with Development Services to ascertain where WSDOT has permitting authority (such as tribal lands or National Parks). When evaluating access connections or approaches on a project, review existing driveways for possible alterations, relocations, consolidations, or closures. The first step in that process is to determine the legality of each driveway. The region Development Services Office can provide a list of the permitted driveway connections on a managed access highway, noting that, per RCW 47.50.080, Permit removal, “Unpermitted connections to the state highway system in existence on July 1, 1990, shall not require the issuance of a permit and may continue to provide access to the state highway system, unless the permitting authority determines that such a connection does not meet minimum acceptable standards of highway safety.” As a result, driveway connections on a managed access state highway can be considered to be permitted, grandfathered, or unpermitted as described below:
•
•
•
Permitted driveways hold a valid permit and shall remain valid until modified or revoked. Grandfathered driveways that were in existence and in active use consistent with the type of connection on July 1, 1990, may continue to provide connection to the state highway system. The term “Grandfathered” driveway, or connection, is not a term defined in statute or rule. It is a commonly used term to define legal connections to managed access state highways, in place prior to July 1, 1990. They do not require the issuance of a new permit and may continue to provide access to the state highway system, unless the permitting authority determines that such a connection does not meet minimum acceptable standards of highway safety. Unpermitted driveways are not allowed. The permitting authority may initiate action to close the unpermitted driveway in compliance with the applicable chapters of 47.50 RCW and 468-51 and 468-52 WAC. These are driveways that do not have a permit and were constructed after July 1, 1990.
If a WSDOT project proposes to alter, relocate, consolidate, or close a driveway—regardless of whether the driveway is permitted, grandfathered, or unpermitted—it is required that a new access connection permit be issued for any driveways that are to remain. If a driveway is to be removed, formal notification to the property owner will be provided as specified in WAC 468-51-040. Unless determined otherwise, the affected property owners of driveways that will be altered, relocated, consolidated, or closed will not have the right of an Adjudicative Hearing. Additional information regarding this process can be obtained by contacting your region’s Development Services Office. On limited access highways, both the region Development Services and Real Estate Services offices may provide assistance to determine the legality of an existing driveway. Federal Highway Administration approval is required for driveway modifications on Interstate facilities.

Driveways
1340.03 Driveway Design The design of a driveway is based on the usage, design vehicle, and traffic volumes anticipated for the driveway. Driveways should be designed for the largest design vehicle that will regularly use the driveway so that it can stay in the lane and not intrude into other traffic. Determine the specific footprint of the driveway based on the turning path width of the design vehicle and in coordination with the access permit. For example, a residential driveway connection will typically have smaller radii and a narrower access width than a higher-volume commercial driveway; however, if the property owner regularly has larger-wheelbase vehicles using the driveway, such as a home-based work vehicle, recreational vehicle, or truck and boat trailer combination, then a larger driveway may be appropriate. Justification is required to design the driveway when the design vehicle stays within the paved surface but is allowed to intrude into other traffic lanes. See section 1310.02(5) for additional information pertaining to accommodating vs. designing for design vehicles. However, if the property owner regularly has larger-wheelbase vehicles using the driveway, such as a homebased work vehicle, recreational vehicle, or truck and boat trailer combination, then a larger driveway may be appropriate. Conversely, some driveways, such as a rural locked and gated, utility, farm, or logging access that larger vehicles sometimes use, may be better served with a smaller and narrower access. This is based on infrequent use and to prevent unauthorized use or dumping of debris on or near the driveway. Other design considerations are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Prevent stormwater from flowing onto the roadway from the driveway. Properly size culverts under the driveway to adequately accommodate the conveyance of stormwater in the roadway ditches and swales. Provide driveway sight distance. Accommodate for mailbox placement. Ensure surfacing materials and depths are appropriate. Generally, extend paving to the right of way line depending on the location/purpose of the driveway. The desirable intersection angle of the driveway is 90°, with 60° to 120° allowed. Where driveways intersect sidewalks, bike lanes, shared-use paths, or trails especially near schools, consider narrowing the driveway and/or reducing the radii to the minimum required by the design vehicle. Narrower driveway width and/or smaller driveway radii can reduce exposure and speed differentials between vehicles entering / exiting the driveway and pedestrians or bicycles.
1340.03(1) Design Templates There are two driveway design templates for use where there is no adjacent sidewalk. When a driveway connection has or will have adjacent sidewalk, see Section 1340.04. In both template designs, the sideslopes of the driveway shall not be steeper than 6H:1V. These templates may be used on both limited access and managed access state highways. If an Interstate limited access driveway is allowed, it must be gated. Use the design template dimensions that will accommodate the intended use of the driveway and will not adversely affect the operations of the traveled way of the state highway. See Chapter 530 and Chapter 550 for documentation requirements for access approaches to limited access facilities. Design driveways with as small a footprint as possible for the design vehicle specific to that driveway. Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify the driveway design will support the largest vehicle that will regularly use the driveway. Considering the context of use, Exhibit 1340-1 is generally used for private, special use, and low volume commercial driveways with design vehicles of SU-30, BUS, and smaller. Exhibit 1340-2 is generally used for low volume commercial and special use driveways with design vehicles of SU-30, BUS, and larger. WSDOT Design Manual M 22.01.22

Driveways
1340.03(3) Sight Distance A driver on the highway needs to see far enough ahead to understand, react, and take actions appropriate for the conditions, such as a vehicle entering or leaving the highway at a driveway. In addition, drivers entering the highway from a driveway need to see enough of the highway, left and/or right, so they can enter the highway in a reasonably safe manner. Design and locate driveways such that the sight distances, based on an eye height of 3.5 feet and an object height of 3.5 feet, meet or exceed the distances shown in Exhibit 1340-3; these distances may require an approaching vehicle to reduce speed or stop to prevent a collision. In addition, provide decision sight distance for through traffic at all utility and special-use driveways on facilities with limited access control (see Chapter 1260). The sight triangle areas created by the sight lines should be clear of sight obstructions that might block or affect a driver’s view of potentially conflicting vehicles. See Exhibit 1340-3. Use intersection sight distance (see Section 1310.02(10)) for road approaches with greater than 1,500 (estimated) average weekday vehicle trip ends (AWDVTE) both entering and exiting the development at full build out.

1340.03(4) Stormwater and Drainage Slope driveways away from the highway to prevent stormwater and other debris from flowing onto the highway traveled lanes and shoulders. Use of curbs, catch basins, or other measures may be needed to divert stormwater where it is not feasible to slope the driveway away from the highway. Locate catch basins outside of the vehical paths of the driveway.
Install beveled end culverts sized in accordance with the Hydraulics Manual if the driveway traverses an existing ditch or swale in the state highway right of way. Contact either the Region Hydraulic Engineer or the applicable Region Maintenance Office for assistance. Consider placing quarry spalls at each end of the open culvert to prevent erosion. Profile the road approach as shown in Exhibit 1340-1 or Exhibit 1340-2 while ensuring that roadway runoff is not a problem. Locate culverts as far from the traveled way as possible. In Exhibit 1340-1 and Exhibit 1340-2, roadway runoff can be a concern if the grade from the edge of shoulder to the right of way line and the slope parallel to the mainline is a flat or minus grade. If needed, a curb may be placed and if needed, a catch basin can also be placed as shown in Exhibit 1340-2. When considering a curb, see Chapter 1239 as allowable curb locations, heights, and offset distances can vary based on mainline speed. Construct road approaches and related areas such that they do not impair drainage within the right of way or alter the stability of the roadway subgrade.

1350.01 General Highway-rail grade crossings (“grade crossings”) are the intersection of two modes of transportation with very different physical and operational characteristics. Because of the inherent limitations associated with train operations, RCW 46.61.350 gives train traffic the right of way at grade crossings, thereby assigning motorists the primary responsibility to avoid collisions. There are many variables that influence a motorist’s ability to react appropriately at grade crossings, including what information is available to them as they approach the crossing and human factors such as competing decisions, distractions, and impaired driving. Primary factors in the design of grade crossings are roadway and railway geometry; available sight distance; highway and railway speeds; competing decisions or visual distractions; and the types of warning devices at the grade crossing. Another aspect of grade crossing design is coordination of highway traffic signal operations with grade crossing active warning devices (“railroad preemption”) when signalized intersections are located near grade crossings. In such instances, railroad preemption is designed to clear the tracks of any vehicles that may be stopped as a result of the highway traffic signal when a train is approaching the grade crossing. Further guidance on railroad preemption requirements is provided in Chapter 1330. Grade crossings are also unique due to their multijurisdictional nature. Highway authorities and railroad companies are each legally responsible for different elements at grade crossings. Additionally, the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) is the state regulatory agency with oversight of public grade crossings in Washington, except within the limits of first class cities in accordance with RCW 81.53.240. Establishing new crossings, altering existing crossings, or closing crossings all require WUTC approval. Therefore, highway projects that include a grade crossing will generally require close coordination with both the railroad company and the WUTC. Projects that include grade crossings will generally require execution of construction and maintenance agreements between the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and the railroad company. These agreements specify the design elements of the crossing, work that the railroad will perform on behalf of the project, payment terms, and legal provisions. It may also be necessary for WSDOT to obtain easements from the railroad company for new grade crossings on railroad property. The Headquarters (HQ) Railroad Liaison is responsible for facilitating highway project coordination with railroad companies, including developing agreements and obtaining WUTC approvals. Obtaining necessary approvals from the railroad company may take several months. Contact the HQ Railroad Liaison early in the design phase so that all necessary design and agreement coordination can be completed according to project schedules.

Railroad Grade Crossings
More information about general railroad coordination and WUTC requirements is provided in Chapter 3 of the Utilities Manual.
1350.02 Plans 1350.02(1) Proposed Improvements Include plans for proposed improvements to existing crossings and any new crossings in the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) package. In addition to basic roadway dimensions, signs, and markings, indicate the angle of crossing; number of tracks; location of signals and other railway facilities (such as electrical/communications lines and control boxes); and the limits of property ownership by the railroad company at the crossing location. For any project proposing to alter the horizontal or vertical alignment at a grade crossing, including grade separations, show the alignment and profile for both the railroad and the roadway for a minimum of 500 feet on all legs of the crossing. Show all other important features that might affect the safety, operation, and design of the crossing, such as nearby crossroads, driveways/entrances, buildings, and highway structures on the plans.
1350.02(1)(a) Sight Distance A railroad grade crossing is comparable to the intersection of two highways where a sight triangle is kept clear of obstructions (including vegetation) and may be protected by a traffic control device. When designing for these locations, provide for both corner and clearing sight distance. Corner sight distance allows a driver, traveling towards the crossing, to see an approaching train at a distance that allows the vehicle to stop in advance of the crossing. (see Exhibit 1350-1, Case A). Clearing sight distance allows a driver stopped at a crossing to see far enough down the tracks that they may decide to proceed and cross those tracks before a train, approaching at its maximum allowable speed, reaches the crossing (see Exhibit 1350-1, Case B.) For Cases A and B, the minimum distance for removing signs, brush and timber in the vicinity of the grade crossing that obstruct the view of an approaching train is 100 feet, measured along the tracks from the crossing. Among the challenges associated with providing sight distance at railroad grade crossing locations are topography, seasonal crops or other vegetation, and structures or other obstructions in properties that the sight lines cross, including the railroad. Evaluate, with HQ Railroad Liaison, and document the need to install active devices (such as signals or signals and gates) at locations where the distances in Exhibit 1350-1 cannot be provided or maintained over time. Contact the HQ Railroad Liaison to engage the subject railroad and the WUTC in the evaluation.
1350.02(1)(b) Highway Grade and Crossing Angle Construct highway grades so that low-clearance vehicles do not hang up on tracks or damage them. (See Chapter 1220 for information on vertical alignment at railroad grade crossings.) Whenever possible, design the roadway to cross grade crossings at right angles. If bicycle traffic uses the crossing (this can be assumed for most roads), provide a shoulder through the grade crossing at least as wide as the approach shoulder width. If a skew is unavoidable, wider shoulders may be needed to permit bicycles to maneuver to cross the tracks at right angles. See Chapter 1520 for information on bikeways crossing railroad tracks. Consider installation of advance warning signs indicating the presence of a skewed crossing for crossings where engineering judgment suggests a benefit. Include any engineering studies or sight distance measurements in the Design Documentation Package (DDP). WSDOT Design Manual M 22.01.22

1350.03 Traffic Control Systems 1350.03(1) Traffic Control System Elements There are two categories of railroad warning devices: “passive” and “active.” Passive devices include all signs and pavement markings. Active devices include flashing light signals, railroad warning gates, and active advance warning systems, all of which are activated by approaching trains.
1350.03(1)(a) Passive Elements The following signing elements are shown in the MUTCD, Part 8, Traffic Control for Highway-Rail Grade Crossings:
•
Highway-Rail Grade Crossing (Crossbuck) sign: Crossbuck signs identify the location of the grade crossing and convey the same meaning as a yield sign. The railroad is responsible for installation and maintenance of Crossbuck signs.
Note: Railroads are required to upgrade standard Crossbuck signs at passive grade crossings to “Crossbuck Assemblies” by December 31, 2019. Crossbuck Assemblies are Crossbuck signs mounted in conjunction with STOP or YIELD signs. Any projects that establish new passive crossings or result in reconstruction of passive crossings should include design of Crossbuck Assemblies. (See Chapter 8 of the MUTCD for additional guidance.)
•
•
•
•
Supplemental Number of Tracks (inverted “T”) sign: This sign is mounted below the Crossbuck sign to indicate the number of tracks when two or more tracks are involved. The railroad is responsible for installation and maintenance of these signs. Grade Crossing Advance Warning sign (W10 sign series): The road authority is responsible for installation and maintenance of these signs. Exempt sign: This is a supplemental sign that, when authorized by the WUTC, may be mounted below the Crossbuck sign. When this sign is approved, certain classes of vehicles, otherwise required to stop before crossing the tracks, may proceed without stopping, provided no train is approaching. The road authority is responsible for installation and maintenance of these signs. Do Not Stop on Tracks sign: This sign is used where it is determined that additional emphasis is needed to remind motorists of this legal requirement, such as where nearby roadway intersections result in queuing back across the tracks. The road authority is responsible for installation and maintenance of these signs.
Pavement markings on all paved approaches are the responsibility of the road authority and consist of RR Crossing markings in accordance with the Standard Plans, No Passing markings, and Pullout Lanes, as appropriate. Consider the installation of illumination at and adjacent to railroad crossings where an engineering study determines that better nighttime visibility of the train and the grade crossing is needed. For example, where:
•
•
•
A substantial number of railroad operations are conducted at night. Grade crossings are blocked for long periods at night by slow-speed trains. Collision history indicates that drivers experience difficulty seeing trains during hours of darkness.

1350.03(1)(b) Active Elements Railroad Flashing Light Signals and Gates: These are active devices intended to warn motorists of approaching trains and impose a stopping requirement. The railroad is responsible for installation and maintenance of these devices. Traffic Signal Interconnection (also known as “railroad preemption”): These provide linkage between the railroad signals and adjacent traffic signals to allow vehicles to clear the tracks at a traffic signal as a train approaches. They are typically funded by the road authority and require cooperation with the railroad for installation. The formation of a Railroad Crossing Evaluation Team is required to determine signal railroad preemption requirements. (See Chapter 1330 for further guidance.) Pre-Signals: These are traffic control signal faces that control roadway traffic approaching a grade crossing in conjunction with the traffic control signal faces that control traffic approaching a roadway-roadway intersection beyond the tracks. Pre-signals are typically used where the clear storage distance is insufficient to store one or more design vehicles. Active Advance Warning Systems: These are supplemental flashing yellow beacons mounted along with the grade crossing advance warning signs that are interconnected to the railroad active warning devices. Activation of the railroad active warning devices activates the beacons to provide motorists with an advance indication that a train is approaching or occupying the crossing. Active advance warning systems are typically used where roadway geometry prevents a clear view of the grade crossing ahead, or where higher highway speeds may require advance notification of an impending stopping requirement. Use a plaque stating “Train When Flashing” as part of such systems. Supplemental Safety Devices: Supplemental safety devices are typically used at locations where it is known that motorists frequently drive around gates, where deemed appropriate due to unique local conditions, or as part of railroad quiet zones where trains are not required to sound the locomotive horn. (For more information about quiet zones, see https://railroads.dot.gov/elibrary/quiet-zone-locations-city-and-state-1.) Typical supplemental safety devices include:
•
•
Four-Quadrant Gate Systems: These are additional gates placed on the opposite side of the roadway from the primary railroad warning gates that, when lowered, make it impossible for motorists to drive around the lowered gates. (See Chapter 8 of the MUTCD for additional information on four-quadrant gate systems. Median Separators: This is a system of raised delineators extending along the roadway centerline back from the tip of a lowered railroad warning gate that prevents motorists from being able to drive around the lowered gates. Make median separators at least 60 feet in length where sufficient space is available.
1350.03(1)(c) Selection of Grade Crossing Warning Devices At a minimum:
•
•
All public grade crossings are required to be equipped with Crossbuck signs, a supplemental plaque indicating the presence of multiple tracks (if applicable), and advance warning signs. Railroad pavement markings are required at all crossings where active warning devices are present or the posted legal speed limit is 40 mph or higher.
Passive warning devices notify drivers that they are approaching a grade crossing and to be on the lookout for trains. In general, consider stand-alone passive warning devices at grade crossings with low volumes and speeds on both the highway and railway, and where adequate sight distances exist. WSDOT Design Manual M 22.01.22 
Page 1350-5
Chapter 1350
Railroad Grade Crossings
Active warning devices are to be considered at all other crossings. No national or state warrants have been developed for installation of traffic control devices at grade crossings. Furthermore, due to the large number of significant variables that need to be considered, there is no single system of active traffic control devices universally applicable for grade crossings. Warning systems at grade crossings should be based on an engineering and traffic investigation, including input from the railroad and the WUTC. Primary factors to consider in selecting warning devices are train and highway volumes and speeds; highway and railway geometry; pedestrian volume; accident history; and available sight distance. Evaluate railroad signal supports and gate mechanisms as roadside features to be considered for mitigation. Use traffic barrier or impact attenuators as appropriate (see Division 16).
1350.04 Nearby Roadway Intersections Operations at roadway intersections located near grade crossings can present significant challenges for grade crossing safety. In particular, vehicle queues originating from the roadway intersection and extending back to the grade crossing must be clear of the tracks before the arrival of any trains. While RCW 46.61.570 prohibits motorists from stopping on any railroad tracks, it is not uncommon for motorists to stop on tracks when focusing on the downstream highway intersection rather than the immediate grade crossing. For signalized highway intersections where vehicle queues result from a red signal indication, clearance of vehicles from the grade crossing is accomplished through traffic signal interconnection with the railroad warning signals (“railroad preemption”). When railroad preemption is in place, an approaching train will initiate a special mode within the highway traffic signal specifically designed to clear any vehicles from the tracks prior to the arrival of the train at the grade crossing. Railroad preemption design involves a specialized analysis that considers the distance between the roadway intersection and grade crossing; queue clearance times; train speeds; the capabilities of the railroad active warning devices; and other traffic signal phases. Where the distance between the grade crossing and the roadway intersection is not sufficient to store a design vehicle, a pre-signal may be considered to prevent subsequent vehicles from entering the grade crossing limits during the track clearance phases of the downstream highway signal. Additionally, whenever a signalized roadway intersection is located 500 feet from a grade crossing, a Railroad Crossing Evaluation Team, which includes representatives from both WSDOT and the railroad company, will jointly determine the need for and design of railroad preemption systems. (See Chapter 1330 for further guidance on railroad preemption requirements.) Vehicle queues over the tracks can also result from operations at nonsignalized roadway intersections; for example, where there is a short distance between the grade crossing and a roadway intersection controlled by a STOP or YIELD sign. A “Do Not Stop on Tracks” sign should be installed at locations where the distance between the grade crossing and the roadway intersection is not sufficient to store a design vehicle or it is otherwise determined that vehicle queues originating from the roadway intersection routinely extend back to the grade crossing. To determine whether or not to consider a highway traffic signal in such instances, refer to MUTCD Traffic Signal Warrant 9.
1350.05 Pullout Lanes In accordance with RCW 46.61.350, certain vehicles are required to stop at all railroad crossings unless the grade crossing is flagged or an “Exempt” sign is posted. Evaluate the installation of “pullout” lanes when grade crossings have no active protection. Some school districts have a policy that school buses must stop at all grade crossings regardless of the type of control.

Railroad Grade Crossings
Consider the installation of pullout lanes at any public grade crossing used regularly by school buses or by trucks transporting flammable cargo or explosives and at which they must stop. Contact the local school district for school bus information. Contact the Truck Freight Program and Policy Manager at the WSDOT HQ Freight Systems Division about truck freight operations in the project vicinity. Design pullout lane geometrics in accordance with Exhibit 1350-2. The minimum shoulder width adjacent to the pullout lane is 3 feet. Exhibit 1350-2 Typical Pullout Lane at Railroad Crossing

1350.06 Crossing Surfaces Railroads are responsible for the maintenance of crossing surfaces up to 12 inches outside the edge of rail (WAC 480-62-225). Crossing surfaces can be constructed of a number of different materials, including asphalt, concrete, steel, timber, rubber, or plastic. The most common surface types used on state highway crossings are asphalt, precast concrete, and rubber. Timbered crossings are frequently used for low-volume roads and temporary construction crossings. The life of a crossing surface depends on the volume and weight of highway and rail traffic using it. Highway traffic not only dictates the type of crossing surface, but it also has a major influence on the life of the crossing. Rough crossing surfaces impact the motoring public far more than the railroad. Therefore, when a highway project passes through a railroad grade crossing, consider the condition of the crossing surface. While the existing condition might not warrant railroad investment in replacing it, the surface might have deteriorated sufficiently to increase vehicle operating costs and motorist inconvenience.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22.01.22 
Page 1350-7
Chapter 1350
Railroad Grade Crossings
In such cases, it may be effective to partner with the railroad to replace the crossing as part of the highway project. Such partnerships typically consist of the state reimbursing the railroad for all or a portion of the cost of the work.
1350.07 Crossing Closure The MUTCD states, “Any highway-rail grade crossing that cannot be justified should be eliminated.” Coordination with the appropriate railroad and the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission is required before any grade crossing can be closed. If a state route grade crossing appears unused, consult the HQ Railroad Liaison before taking any action. Close at-grade crossings that are replaced by grade separations.
1350.08 Traffic Control during Construction and Maintenance Provide work zone traffic control for projects at highway-rail grade crossings, which need protection from train traffic. When highway construction or maintenance activities affect a railroad crossing, the railroad company must be notified at least ten days before performing the work (WAC 480-62-305(4)). Furthermore, whenever highway construction or maintenance crews or equipment are working within 25 feet of an active rail line or grade crossing, consult the railroad to determine whether a railroad flagger is required. Current contact numbers for railroads may be obtained by contacting your region Utilities Engineer or the HQ Railroad Liaison. Railroad flaggers differ from highway flaggers in that they have information on train schedules and can generally communicate with trains by radio. When flaggers are required, the railroad generally sends the road authority a bill for the cost of providing this service. Do not allow work zone traffic to stop or queue up on a nearby rail-highway grade crossing unless railroad flaggers are present. Without proper protection, vehicles might be trapped on the tracks when a train approaches. (See the MUTCD for more detailed guidance.) For projects requiring temporary access across a set of railroad tracks, contact the HQ Railroad Liaison early in the design process since a railroad agreement or permit will likely be required.
1350.09 Railroad Grade Crossing Petitions and WUTC Orders The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) is authorized by statute (Title 81 RCW) to have regulatory authority over railroad crossings. Establishing new crossings, closing existing crossings, or modifying existing grade crossings must be approved by the WUTC (WAC 480-62-150). WUTC authority does not apply within the limits of first class cities, in accordance with RCW 81.53.240. This is accomplished by submitting a formal petition to the WUTC for a formal order. The HQ Railroad Liaison will assist in the preparation and submittal of this petition. Include a copy of the petition and WUTC findings and order in the Design Documentation Package.
1350.10 Grade Crossing Improvement Projects The HQ Highways and Local Programs Office (H&LP) administers the federal (Section 130) Grade Crossing Safety Improvement Program. Project proposals are submitted by local agencies, railroads, and WSDOT. Contact H&LP or the HQ Railroad Liaison in the Utilities, Railroads, and Agreements Section for more information.

1350.11 Light Rail Light rail transit systems have been implemented and will continue to be developed in some urban areas of the state. For the most part, criteria for light rail transit crossings are very similar to those for freight and passenger rail with the exception of locations where light rail shares a street right of way with motor vehicles. The MUTCD now includes guidance devoted exclusively to light rail transit and can be consulted as the situation warrants.

1360.01 General The primary purpose of an interchange is to reduce conflicts caused by vehicle crossings and minimize conflicting left-turn movements. Provide interchanges on all Interstate highways and freeways, and at other locations where traffic cannot be controlled efficiently by intersections at grade. For additional information, see the following: Chapter 520 Access control
Chapter 1240 Turning widths
Chapter 530 Limited access
Chapter 1250 Cross Slope and Superelevation
Chapter 550 Access Revision Report
Chapter 1310 Intersections
Chapter 1103 Design controls
Chapter 1410 HOV lanes
Chapter 1106 Design element dimensions
Chapter 1420 HOV direct access connections
1360.02 Interchange Design 1360.02(1) General The configuration of an interchange is determined using traffic analysis and inter-agency coordination following the Access Revision Report (ARR) process (if needed) as described in Chapter 550. Consult Chapter 550 for direction when constructing or modifying an interchange and to determine if an ARR is needed and the scope of the ARR. All freeway exits and entrances, except HOV direct access connections, are to connect on the right of through traffic. Deviations from this will be considered only for special conditions. HOV direct access connections may be constructed on the left of through traffic when they are designed in accordance with Chapter 1420.

Chapter 1360
Interchanges
Provide complete ramp facilities for all directions of travel wherever possible. However, give primary consideration to the basic traffic movement function that the interchange is to fulfill. Complications are rarely encountered in the design and location of rural interchanges that simply provide a means of exchanging traffic between a limited access freeway and a local crossroad. Carefully consider the economic and operational effects of locating traffic interchanges along a freeway through a community, particularly with respect to local access, to provide convenient local service without reducing the capacity of the major route(s). Where freeway-to-freeway interchanges are involved, do not provide ramps for local access unless they can be added conveniently and without detriment to efficient traffic flow or reduction of capacity, either ramp or freeway main line. When exchange of traffic between freeways is the basic function, and local access is prohibited by access control restrictions or traffic volume, separate interchanges for local service may be needed.
1360.02(2) Interchange Patterns Basic interchange patterns have been established that can be used under certain general conditions and modified or combined to apply to many more. Consider alternatives in the design of a specific facility; however, the conditions in the area and on the highway involved govern the final design of the interchange. The patterns most frequently used for interchange design are those commonly described as directional, semi directional, cloverleaf, partial cloverleaf, diamond, and single point (urban) interchange (see Exhibit 1360-1). Selection of the final design is based on a study of projected traffic volumes, site conditions, geometric controls, criteria for intersecting legs and turning roadways, driver expectancy, consistent ramp patterns, continuity, and cost.
1360.02(2)(a) Directional A directional interchange is the most effective design for connection of intersecting freeways. The directional pattern has the advantage of reduced travel distance, increased speed of operation, and higher capacity. These designs eliminate weaving and have a further advantage over cloverleaf designs in avoiding the loss of sense of direction drivers experience in traveling a loop. This type of interchange is costly to construct, commonly using a four-level structure.
1360.02(2)(b) Semi directional A semi directional interchange has ramps that loop around the intersection of the highways. This results in multiple single-level structures and more area than the directional interchange.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1360-2
Chapter 1360
Interchanges
1360.02(2)(c) Cloverleaf The full cloverleaf interchange has four loop ramps for the left-turning traffic. Outer ramps provide for the right turns. A full cloverleaf is the minimum type interchange for a freeway-to-freeway interchange. Cloverleaf designs often incorporate a C-D road to minimize signing difficulties and remove weaving conflicts from the main roadway. The principal advantage of this design is the elimination of all left-turn conflicts with one single-level structure. Because all movements are merging movements, it is adaptable to any grade line arrangement. The cloverleaf has some major disadvantages. The left-turn movement has a circuitous route on the loop ramp, the speeds are low on the loop ramp, and there are weaving conflicts between the loop ramps. The cloverleaf also needs a large area. The weaving and the radius of the loop ramps are a capacity constraint on the left-turn movements.
1360.02(2)(d) Partial Cloverleaf A partial cloverleaf (PARCLO) has loop ramps in one, two, or three quadrants that are used to eliminate the major left-turn conflicts. These loops may also serve right turns for interchanges where ramp cannot be built in one or two quadrants. Outer ramps are provided for the remaining turns. Design the grades to provide sight distance between vehicles approaching these ramps.
1360.02(2)(e) Diamond A diamond interchange has four ramps that are essentially parallel to the major arterial. Each ramp provides for one right-turn and one left-turn movement. Because left turns are made at grade across conflicting traffic on the crossroad, intersection sight distance is a primary consideration. The diamond design is the most generally applicable and serviceable interchange configuration and usually has a smaller footprint than any other type. Consider this design first unless another design is clearly dictated by traffic, topography, or special conditions.
1360.02(2)(f) Single Point Urban A single point urban interchange (SPUI) is a modified diamond with all of its ramp terminals on the crossroad combined into one signalized at-grade intersection. This single intersection accommodates all interchange and through movements. A single point urban interchange can improve the traffic operation on the crossroad with less right of way than a typical diamond interchange, but a larger structure.

1360.02(3) Spacing To avoid excessive interruption of main line traffic, consider each proposed facility in conjunction with adjacent interchanges, intersections, and other points of access along the route as a whole. The minimum spacing between adjacent interchanges is 1 mile in urban areas, 3 miles on the Interstate in rural areas, and 2 miles on non-Interstate in rural areas (see Exhibit 1360-2). In urban areas, spacing less than 1 mile may be used with C-D roads or grade-separated (braided) ramps. Interchange spacing is measured along the freeway centerline between the centerlines of the crossroads. The spacing between interchanges may also be dependent on the spacing between ramp connections. The minimum spacing between the gore noses of adjacent ramps is given in Exhibit 1360-3. Exhibit 1360-2 Interchange Spacing
Notes: [1] As a minimum, provide length for weaving and signing, but not less than given in Exhibit 1360-3. [2] 3 miles on the Interstate System. Consider either frontage roads or C-D roads to facilitate the operation of near-capacity volumes between closely spaced interchanges or ramp terminals. C-D roads may be needed where cloverleaf loop ramps are involved or where a series of interchange ramps have overlapping speed change lanes. Base the distance between successive ramp terminals on capacity. Check the intervening sections by weaving analyses to determine whether capacity, sight distance, and effective signing can be provided without the use of auxiliary lanes or C-D roads. Provide justifications for existing interchanges with less-than-desirable spacing or ramp connection spacing to remain in place.
1360.02(4) Route Continuity Route continuity is providing the driver of a through route a path on which lane changes are minimized and other traffic operations occur to the right. In maintaining route continuity, interchange configuration may not favor the heavy traffic movement, but rather the through route. In this case, design the heavy traffic movements with multilane ramps, flat curves, and reasonably direct alignment.

Interchanges
1360.02(5) Drainage Avoid interchanges located in proximity to natural drainage courses. These locations often result in complex and unnecessarily costly hydraulic structures. The open areas within an interchange can be used for stormwater detention facilities.
1360.02(6) Uniformity of Exit Pattern While interchanges are of necessity custom-designed to fit specific conditions, it is desirable that the pattern of exits along a freeway have some degree of uniformity. From the standpoint of driver expectancy, it is desirable that each interchange have only one point of exit, located in advance of the crossroad.

1360.03 Ramps 1360.03(1) Ramp Design Speed The design speed for a ramp is based on the design speed for the freeway main line. It is desirable that the ramp design speed at the connection to the freeway be equal to the free-flow speed of the freeway. Meet or exceed the upper range values from Exhibit 1360-4 for the design speed at the ramp connection to the freeway. Transition the ramp design speed incrementally to provide a smooth acceleration or deceleration between the mainline and the cross street. For example, if the design speed at the cross street is 25 and the mainline design speed is 70, increase the on-ramp design speed through the curves from 25 to 50 to 60 and transition to 70; reverse the speed transition for off-ramp design. These design speed guidelines do not apply to the ramp in the area of the ramp terminal at-grade intersection. In the area of the intersection, use a design speed of 15 mph for turning traffic or 0 mph for a stop condition. Use the allowed skew at the ramp terminal at-grade intersection to minimize ramp curvature. For freeway-to-freeway ramps and C-D roads, the design speed at the connections to both freeways is the upper range values from Exhibit 1360-4; however, with justification, the midrange values from Exhibit 1360-4 may be used for the remainder of the ramp. When the design speed for the two freeways is different, use the higher design speed. Existing ramps meet design speed criteria if acceleration or deceleration criteria are met (see Exhibit 1360-10 or Exhibit 1360-11) and superelevation meets the criteria in Chapter 1250.

1360.03(4) Cross Section 1360.03(4)(a) Ramp Widths Provide the ramp widths given in Exhibit 1360-6. Ramp traveled ways may need additional width when operational needs exist. The minimum total ramp width for a single lane ramp is 20 feet. If when designing up the ramp width the total ramp width is less than 20 feet, add the difference to the right shoulder width or the left shoulder width whichever is best. The minimum total ramp width for a one-way two-lane ramp is 30 feet (the minimum Traveled way and minimum shoulder widths added together). Ramp shoulders may be used by accommodated vehicles for offtracking and by design vehicles passing stalled vehicles. Evaluate the need to pave shoulders full depth for accommodated vehicle offtracking using turn simulation software on one-way ramps.

[4] The minimum two-way ramp median width (including shoulders) is given. Wider medians may be required for signs or other traffic control devices and their respective clearances. When either the on- or off-ramp is singlelane, use the one-lane column. If both directions are two lanes, use the two-lane column. [5] Use the mode/function/performance approach described in Chapter 1106 and Section 1239.02 for shoulders and Section 1239.08 for medians to choose between the range of widths given. [6] For metered shoulders, see Exhibit 1239-2 and Chapter 1440.
1360.03(4)(b) Ramp Cross Slope Cross slope and superelevation criteria for ramp traveled ways and shoulders are as given in Chapter 1250 for roadways. At ramp terminals, the intersection lane and shoulder width design guidance shown in Chapter 1310 may be used. Whenever feasible, make the ramp cross slope at the ramp beginning or ending station equal to the cross slope of the through lane pavement. Where space is limited and superelevation runoff is long, or when parallel connections are used, the superelevation transition may be ended beyond (for on-ramps) or begun in advance of (for off-ramps) the ramp beginning or ending station, provided that the algebraic difference in cross slope at the edge of the through lane and the cross slope of the ramp does not exceed 4%. In such cases, provide smooth transitions for the edge of traveled way.

Interchanges
1360.03(5) Two-Way Ramps Two-way ramps are on- and off-ramps on a single roadway. Design two-way ramps as separate one-way ramps. Provide a raised median to physically separate the on- and off- ramps. Wider medians than given in Exhibit 1360-6 may be required for signing or other traffic control devices and their clearances. (For signs, it is sign width plus 4 feet.) Where wider medians are required, provide a 2-foot clearance between the face of curb and the edge of traveled way. Where additional width is not required, the raised median width may be reduced to a double-faced mountable or extruded curb. Traffic barrier or a depressed median may be provided in place of the raised median.
1360.03(6) Ramp Lane Increases When off-ramp traffic and left-turn movement volumes at the ramp terminal at-grade intersection cause excessive queue length, it may be desirable to add lanes to the ramp to reduce the queue length caused by congestion and turning conflicts. Make provision for the addition of ramp lanes whenever ramp exit or entrance volumes are expected to result in an undesirable mobility or safety performance. (See Section 1210.05 for pavement transitions.)
1360.03(7) Ramp Meters Ramp meters are used to allow a measured or regulated amount of traffic to enter the freeway. When operating in the “measured” mode, they release traffic at a measured rate to keep downstream demand below capacity and improve system travel times. In the “regulated” mode, they break up platoons of vehicles that occur naturally or result from nearby traffic signals. Even when operating at near capacity, a freeway main line can accommodate merging vehicles one or two at a time, while groups of vehicles will cause main line flow to break down. The location of the ramp meter is a balance between the storage and acceleration criteria. Locate the ramp meter to maximize the available storage and so that the acceleration lane length, from a stop to the freeway main line design speed, is available from the stop bar to the merging point. With justification, the average main line running speed during the hours of meter operation may be used for the highway design speed to determine the minimum acceleration lane length from the ramp meter. (See Section 1360.04(4) for information on the design of on-connection acceleration lanes.) Driver compliance with the signal is required for the ramp meter to have the desired results. Consider enforcement areas with metered ramps. A metered ramp lane may have insufficient storage capacity to handle the on-ramp’s traffic volume. In these situations, a metered shoulder may be a viable option that utilizes the shoulder approaching a ramp meter as a temporary additional lane for storage and metered throughput during the ramp meter’s operational period. See Chapter 1440. Consider HOV bypass lanes with ramp meters. See Chapter 1410 for design data for ramp meter bypass lanes.
1360.04 Interchange Connections To the extent practicable, provide uniform geometric design and uniform signing for exits and entrances in the design of a continuous freeway. Do not design an exit ramp as an extension of a main line tangent at the beginning of a main line horizontal curve. Provide spacing between interchange connections as given in Exhibit 1360-3.

Interchanges
Avoid on-connections on the inside of a main line curve, particularly when the ramp approach angle is accentuated by the main line curve, the ramp approach results in a reverse curve to connect to the main line, or the elevation difference will cause the cross slope to be steep at the nose. Keep the use of mountable curb at interchange connections to a minimum. Provide justification when curb is used adjacent to traffic with a design speed of 40 mph or higher. Exhibit 1360-7 Lane Balance
*Note: Number of lanes (F) may increase by one lane, when the lane is an auxiliary lane between closely spaced entrance and exit ramps.
1360.04(1) Lane Balance Design interchanges to the following principles of lane balance:
1360.04(1)(a) Entrances At entrances, make the number of lanes beyond the merging of two traffic streams not less than the sum of all the lanes on the merging roadways less one (see Exhibit 1360-7).
1360.04(1)(b) Exits At exits, make the number of approach lanes equal the number of highway lanes beyond the exit plus the number of exit lanes less one (see Exhibit 1360-7). Exceptions to this are:
•
•
At a cloverleaf. At closely spaced interchanges with a continuous auxiliary lane between the entrance and exit.
In these cases, the auxiliary lane may be dropped at a single-lane, one-lane reduction off-connection (Exhibit 1360-22), with the number of approach lanes being equal to the sum of the highway lanes beyond the exit and the number of exit lanes. Closely spaced interchanges have a distance of less than 2,100 feet between the end of the acceleration lane and the beginning of the deceleration lane. Maintain the basic number of lanes, as described in Chapter 1210, through interchanges. When a two-lane exit or entrance is used, maintain lane balance with an auxiliary lane (see Exhibit 1360-8). The exception to this is when the basic number of lanes is changed at an interchange.

Exhibit 1360-8 Lane Balance
1360.04(2) Main Line Lane Reduction The reduction of a basic lane or an auxiliary lane may be made at a two-lane exit or may be made between interchanges. When a two-lane exit is used, provide a recovery area with a normal acceleration taper. When a lane is dropped between interchanges, drop it 1,500 to 3,000 feet from the end of the acceleration taper of the previous interchange. This allows for signing but will not be so far that the driver becomes accustomed to the number of lanes and will be surprised by the reduction (see Exhibit 1360-9). Reduce the traveled way width of the freeway by only one lane at a time.
1360.04(3) Sight Distance Locate off-connections and on-connections on the main line to provide decision sight distance for a speed/path/direction change as described in Chapter 1260.

1360.04(4) On-Connections On-connections are the paved areas at the end of on-ramps that connect them to the main lane of a freeway. They have two parts: an acceleration lane and a taper. The acceleration lane allows entering traffic to accelerate to the freeway speed and evaluate gaps in the freeway traffic. The taper is for the entering vehicle to maneuver into the through lane. On-connections are either tapered or parallel. The tapered on-connection provides direct entry at a flat angle, reducing the steering control needed. The parallel on-connection adds a lane adjacent to the through lane for acceleration with a taper at the end. Vehicles merge with the through traffic with a reverse curve maneuver similar to a lane change. While less steering control is needed for the taper, the parallel is narrower at the end of the ramp and has a shorter taper at the end of the acceleration lane.
1360.04(4)(a) Acceleration Lane Provide the minimum acceleration lane length, given in Exhibit 1360-10, for each ramp design speed on all onramps. When the average grade of the acceleration lane is 3% or greater, multiply the distance from the Minimum Acceleration Lane Length table by the factor from the Adjustment Factor for Grades table. The acceleration lane is measured from the last point designed at each ramp design speed (usually the PT of the last curve for each design speed) to the last point of the ramp width. Curves designed at higher design speeds may be included as part of the acceleration lane length.
1360.04(4)(b) Gap Acceptance For parallel on-connections, provide the minimum gap acceptance length (Lg) to allow entering motorists to evaluate gaps in the freeway traffic and position their vehicles to use the gap. The length is measured beginning at the point that the left edge of traveled way for the ramp intersects the right edge of traveled way of the main line to the ending of the acceleration lane (see Exhibit 1360-17 and Exhibit 1360-18). The gap acceptance length and the acceleration length overlap, with the ending point controlled by the longer of the two.

1360.04(4)(c) Single-Lane On-Connections Single-lane on-connections may be either tapered or parallel. Design single-lane tapered on-connections as shown in Exhibit 1360-16 and single-lane parallel on-connections as shown in Exhibit 1360-17.
1360.04(4)(d) Two-Lane On-Connections For two-lane on-connections, the parallel is desirable. Design two-lane parallel on-connections as shown in Exhibit 1360-18. A capacity analysis will normally be the basis for determining whether a freeway lane or an auxiliary lane is to be provided. Justify the use of a two-lane tapered on-connection. Design two-lane tapered on connections in accordance with Exhibit 1360-19.
1360.04(5) Off-Connections Off-connections are the paved areas at the beginning of an off-ramp, connecting it to a main lane of a freeway. They have two parts: a taper for maneuvering out of the through traffic and a deceleration lane to slow to the speed of the first curve on the ramp. Deceleration is not assumed to take place in the taper. Off-connections are either tapered or parallel. The tapered is desirable because it fits the normal path for most drivers. When a parallel connection is used, drivers tend to drive directly for the ramp and not use the parallel lane. However, when a ramp is on the outside of a curve, the parallel off-connection is desirable. An advantage of the parallel connection is that it is narrower at the beginning of the ramp.
1360.04(5)(a) Deceleration Lane Provide the minimum deceleration lane length given in Exhibit 1360-11 for each design speed for all off-ramps. Also, provide deceleration lane length to the end of the anticipated queue at the ramp terminal. When the average grade of the deceleration lane is 3% or greater, multiply the distance from the Minimum Deceleration Lane Length table by the factor from the Adjustment Factor for Grades table. The deceleration lane is measured from the point where the taper reaches the selected ramp lane width to the first point designed at each ramp design speed (usually the PC of the first curve for each design speed). Curves designed at higher design speeds may be included as part of the deceleration lane length.

1360.04(5)(b) Gores Gores (see Exhibit 1360-13 and Exhibit 1360-14) are decision points. Design them to be clearly seen and understood by approaching drivers. In a series of interchanges along a freeway, it is desirable that the gores be uniform in size, shape, and appearance. The paved area between the physical nose and the striped gore nose is the reserve area. It is reserved for the installation of an impact attenuator. The minimum length of the reserve area is controlled by the design speed of the main line (see Exhibit 1360-13 and Exhibit 1360-14). In addition to striping, raised pavement marker rumble strips may be placed for additional warning and delineation at gores. (See the Standard Plans for striping and rumble strip details.) Keep the unpaved area beyond the physical gore nose as free of obstructions as possible to provide a clear recovery area. Grade this unpaved area as nearly level with the roadways as possible. Avoid placing obstructions such as heavy sign supports, luminaire poles, and structure supports in the gore area. When an obstruction is placed in a gore area, provide an impact attenuator (see Chapter 1620) and barrier (see Chapter 1610). Place the beginning of the attenuator as far back in the reserve area as possible, desirably after the physical gore nose.
1360.04(5)(c) Single-Lane Off-Connections For single-lane off-connections, the tapered is desirable. Use the design shown in Exhibit 1360-20 for tapered single-lane off-connections. Justify the use of a parallel single-lane off-connection, as shown in Exhibit 1360-21.
1360.04(5)(d) Single-Lane Off-Connection with One Lane Reduction The single-lane off-connection with one lane reduction, shown in Exhibit 1360-22, is used when the conditions from lane balance for a single-lane exit, one-lane reduction, are met.
1360.04(5)(e) Tapered Two-Lane Off-Connection The tapered two-lane off-connection design, shown in Exhibit 1360-24, is desireable where the number of freeway lanes is reduced or where high-volume traffic operations will be improved by the provision of a parallel auxiliary lane and the number of freeway lanes is unchanged.

1360.04(6) Collector-Distributor Roads A Collector-Distributor (C-D) road can be within a single interchange, through two closely spaced interchanges, or continuous through several interchanges. Design C-D roads that connect three or more interchanges to be two lanes wide. Other C-D roads may be one or two lanes in width, depending on capacity. Consider intermediate connections to the main line for long C-D roads. a. Exhibit 1360-27 shows the designs for collector-distributor outer separations. Use Design A, with concrete barrier, when adjacent traffic in either roadway is expected to exceed 40 mph. Design B, with mountable curb, may be used when adjacent posted speed does not exceed 40 mph. b. The details shown in Exhibit 1360-28 apply to single-lane C-D road off-connections. Design a twolane C-D road off-connection, with the reduction of a freeway lane or an auxiliary lane, as a normal two-lane off-connection in accordance with Section 1360.04(5). c. Design C-D road on-connections in accordance with Exhibit 1360-29.
1360.04(7) Loop Ramp Connections Loop ramp connections at cloverleaf interchanges are distinguished from other ramp connections by a lowspeed ramp on-connection, followed closely by an off-connection for another low-speed ramp. The loop ramp connection design is shown in Exhibit 1360-30. The minimum distance between the ramp connections is dependent on a weaving analysis. When the connections are spaced far enough apart that weaving is not a consideration, design the on-connection in accordance with Section 1360.04(4) and the off-connection in accordance with Section 1360.04(5).
1360.04(8) Weaving Sections Weaving sections may occur within an interchange, between closely spaced interchanges, or on segments of overlapping routes. Exhibit 1360-15 gives the length of the weaving section for preliminary design. The total weaving traffic is the sum of the traffic entering from the ramp to the main line and the traffic leaving the main line to the exit ramp in equivalent passenger cars. For trucks, a passenger car equivalent of two may be estimated. Use the Highway Capacity Manual for the final design of weaving sections. Because weaving sections cause considerable turbulence, interchange designs that eliminate weaving or remove it from the main roadway are desirable. Use C-D roads for weaving between closely spaced ramps when adjacent to high-speed highways. C-D roads are not needed for weaving on low-speed roads.

1360.05 Ramp Terminal Intersections at Crossroads Design ramp terminal intersections at grade with crossroads as intersections at grade (see Chapter 1300). Whenever possible, design ramp terminals to discourage wrong-way movements. Locate ramp terminal intersections at grade with crossroads to provide signal progression if the intersection becomes signalized in the future. Provide intersection sight distance as described in Chapter 1310 or Chapter 1320.
1360.06 Interchanges on Two-Lane Highways Occasionally, the first stage of a conventional interchange will be built with only one direction of the main roadway and operated as a two-lane two-way roadway until the ultimate roadway is constructed. The design of interchanges on two-lane two-way highways may vary considerably from traditional concepts due to the following conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
The potential for cross-centerline crashes due to merge conflicts or motorist confusion. The potential for wrong-way or U-turn movements. Future construction considerations. Traffic type and volume. The proximity to multilane highway sections that might influence a driver’s impression that these roads are also multilane.
Provide the deceleration taper for all interchange exit ramps on two-lane highways. Design the entering connection with either the normal acceleration taper or a “button hook” configuration with a stop condition before entering the main line. Consider the following items:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Design the stop condition connection in accordance with a tee (T) intersection as shown in Chapter 1310. Use this type of connection when an acceleration lane is not possible. Provide decision sight distance as described in Chapter 1260. Since designs may vary from project to project, analyze each project for the most efficient signing placement, such as one-way, two-way, no passing, do not enter, directional arrows, guideposts, and traffic buttons. Prohibit passing through the interchange area on two-lane highways by means of signing, pavement marking, or a combination of both. The desirable treatment is a 4 foot median island, highlighted with raised pavement markers and diagonal stripes. When using a 4-foot median system, extend the island 500 feet beyond any merging ramp traffic acceleration taper. The width for the median can be provided by reducing each shoulder 2 feet through the interchange (see Exhibit 1360-31). Include signing and pavement markings to inform both the entering and through motorists of the twolane two-way characteristic of the main line. Use as much of the ultimate roadway as possible. Where this is not possible, leave the area for future lanes and roadway ungraded. Design and construct temporary ramps as if they were permanent unless second-stage construction is planned to rapidly follow the first stage. Design the connection to meet the needs of the traffic.

1370.01 General This chapter provides guidance for locating and designing median crossovers. Median crossovers are provided at locations on divided highways for crossing by maintenance, traffic service, emergency, and law enforcement vehicles. The use of all median crossovers is restricted to these users. Crossovers may be provided:
•
•
•
•
Where main line safety will not be compromised by providing a crossover. Where access through interchanges or intersections is not practical. As part of region maintenance operations. As necessary for law enforcement and emergency services functions.
For information about median openings to provide turning movements for public access to both sides of the roadway, see Chapter 1310, Intersections at Grade.
1370.02 Analysis A list of existing median crossovers is available from the Headquarters (HQ) Access and Hearings Section. The Statewide Master Plan for Median Crossovers website is: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-accessrequests-training The general categories of vehicles recognized as legitimate users of median crossovers are law enforcement, emergency services, traffic incident response, and maintenance vehicles. In urban areas with a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane adjacent to the median, crossovers may be considered for law enforcement (see Chapter 1410). In areas where there are 3 or more miles between access points, providing an unobtrusive crossover can improve emergency services or improve efficiency for traffic services and maintenance forces. Maintenance crossovers may be needed at one or both ends of an interchange for the purpose of winter maintenance operations and at other locations to facilitate maintenance operations. In general:
•
•
•
Existing crossovers may remain at their current locations. New crossovers should not be located closer than 1,500 feet to the end of a ramp taper or to any structure. This distance may be decreased to improve winter maintenance efficiency based on an operational analysis. Include an operational analysis in the Design Documentation Package (DDP). Crossovers should be located only where stopping sight distance is provided and preferably should not be located on superelevated curves.

Adequate median width at the crossover location is required to allow the design vehicle to complete a U-turn maneuver without backing. Use of the shoulder area is allowed for the execution of the U-turn maneuver. Typical design vehicles for this determination are a passenger car and a single-unit truck. When median barrier is placed in the vicinity of a median crossover, position the barrier to minimize the potential for errant vehicles to cross through the median. (See the Standard Plans for typical barrier layout.) Consider the types of vehicles using the median crossover. The minimum recommended throat width is 30 feet. Use grades and radii that are suitable for all authorized user vehicles (see Chapter 1340). In most cases, 10-foot inside paved shoulders are adequate for deceleration and acceleration lanes. Consider full 10-foot shoulders for a distance of 450 feet upstream of the crossover area to accommodate deceleration, and extend downstream of the crossover area for a distance of 600 feet to allow acceleration prior to entering the travel lane. In cases where the median width is narrower than the design vehicle turning path, widening shoulders may not provide a benefit. Document decisions to provide inside shoulders of less than 10 feet. Provide adequate stopping sight distance for vehicles approaching the crossover area. This is due to the unexpected maneuvers associated with these inside access points and the higher operating speeds commonly experienced in the inside travel lanes (see Chapter 1260). Provide adequate intersection sight distance at crossover locations where authorized user vehicles must encroach on the travel lanes (see Chapter 1310). For the crossing, use sideslopes no steeper than 10H:1V. Grade for a relatively flat and gently contoured appearance that is inconspicuous to the public. Consider impacts to existing drainage. Do not use curbs or pavement markings. Flexible guideposts may be provided for night reference, as shown in the Standard Plans. Consider the terrain and locate the crossover to minimize visibility to the public. Use vegetation to minimize the visibility of the crossover. Low vegetation with a 3-foot year-round maximum height is recommended for this purpose (see Chapter 900). In locations where vegetation cannot be used to minimize visibility by the traveling public, and there is a high incidence of unauthorized use, use appropriate signing such as “No U-Turns” to discourage unauthorized use. A stabilized all-weather surface is required. Paving of crossings is determined on a case-by-case basis.
1370.04 Plan Updates and Approvals All approved crossover locations will be designated on the Statewide Master Plan for Median Crossovers. Contact the HQ Access and Hearings Section for the following:

Plan updates and approvals involve coordination between the Assistant Regional Administrator for Operations or Project Development, the Washington State Patrol (WSP), the HQ Access and Hearings Section, the appropriate Assistant State Design Engineer (ASDE), and the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) Area Engineer (or their designees). Once locations are identified, the region will send a package to the HQ Access and Hearings Section, which should include: a strip map showing MP locations of, and spacing between, existing and/or planned crossovers and interchanges; a justification for the crossover(s); a copy of any requests for crossovers from the WSP, emergency services, or maintenance; and a red and green marked-up plan sheet showing locations. Approval will be given by the ASDE. Construction may not proceed prior to approval. After notification of approval, the HQ Right of Way Plans Section sends the region a reproducible revised right of way or limited access plan that includes the approved crossover location.

Managed Lanes Exhibit 1400-1 Managed Lane Types
1400.01 General As roadways become more congested, many factors—including increased construction costs, right-of-way constraints, environmental concerns, and societal impacts—contribute to the challenge of adding new generalpurpose lanes especially in developed urban areas. One strategy to alleviate traffic congestion and delay is to create a managed lane. A managed lane is a lane or shoulder that is utilized to improve mobility and increase transportation efficiency by controlling the use of the lane or shoulder either dynamically or statically. Use of the managed lanes is restricted by vehicle categories (e.g., bus only, passenger vehicles), vehicle occupancy, time of day, level of congestion, pricing, points of access, or a combination of these restrictions. Research and experience show that implementing a managed lane offers more opportunities to improve mobility and increase transportation efficiency than simply adding a new general-purpose lane. Because every traffic corridor has its own unique operating characteristics, the success of a managed lane project depends on the effectiveness of the operating strategy that addresses one or more of these characteristics:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Improving the capability of traffic corridors to move more people by increasing the number of people per vehicle. Increasing person throughput, particularly during peak hours. Deceasing travel time for all users. Providing travel options for the traveling public. Providing more efficient, safer (less fatal and severe injury crashes), and timely operations including maintenance, emergency services, and enforcement. Improving scheduled arrival for transit, paratransit, carpool, and/or other HOV services.
Stakeholders of a corridor work together to define roles and responsibilities of each stage of managed lane facility development including operations and maintenance of the facility. The managed lane facility type should be determined, agreed upon, and documented by the stakeholder team before the design phase, and early in the planning / scoping phases of project development. Document all decisions made before and throughout the project development process. These decisions are documented when the decisions are made and by whom they are made.

1400.02 Managed Lane Selection Managed lane systems provide more options for managing demand. Emerging best practices in managed lanes focus on operational flexibility such as distance-based pricing, time-of-day or occupancy-based restrictions, reversible lanes, and multiple access points. The selection of the appropriate managed lane strategy and configuration should reflect the corridors mobility needs, contextual considerations, and ability for the existing facility to accommodate the managed lane. Coordinate with Region Traffic, Region Management, and local stakeholders (e.g., local transit agency) to assess and identify the appropriate managed lane strategy that can best address the mobility needs, contextual and design considerations. This may require traffic modelling (e.g., VISSIM, DynaMeg, etc.) to fully understand operational benefits and limitations. Best practices that are helpful in understanding the context, needs, and viable alternatives include:
•
•
•
•
•
Establish the travel demand and capacity in order to determine the appropriate design options for managed lanes, Establish the anticipated peak hour vehicle and passenger demand volume for the facility for both existing conditions and design year. Determine the best-managed lane type. Determine the following operational parameters: o Operational period, o Static or dynamic control, o Any vehicular use restrictions; and, o The managed lane’s termini (i.e., location and length). Evaluate the existing cross sections (lane and shoulder widths) to identify opportunities for suitable roadway segments.
1400.03 Managed Lane Design and Operational Considerations The design of specific managed lane strategies reflect the operational parameters, existing infrastructure and design criteria associated with the selected manage lane strategy. The following sections provide information regarding major design elements and/or operational considerations for managed lanes. Additional design criteria and operational considerations for various managed lanes options are provide in various Design Manual chapters.
1400.03(1) Design Standards for NHS Routes The underlying design criteria for NHS routes is provided by AASHTO which does not include guidance associated with some manage lanes. As such, various design elements associated with the managed lane may not meet minimum AASHTO criteria and could require additional documentation and approval. Additional discussion regarding this issue as it pertains to specific manage lane options is provided in their respective Design Manual chapters. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1400-3
Chapter 1410
Managed Lanes
1400.03(2) Ingress and Egress Access considerations such as the design of specific entrance and exit points or allowing continuous access affects the operating conditions within a managed lane and affects the operating agency's ability to modify operating strategies. For example, the I-5 Express Lanes act as a pipeline with a limited number of entrance and exit points, which simplifies operation. When planning ingress and egress for a managed lane, all of the affected stakeholders should be part of the determination of the type of access and if specific entrance and exit locations provide equitable access. New or changed access points to or from a limited access facility may require additional review and approval by HQ Design and/or FHWA. See Chapter 550 Freeway Access Revision to determine if an Access Revision Report is necessary. When introducing multiple access locations and/or changing rules of access, determine the need for providing guidance to the driver, emergency services, and enforcement of the changing rules for use of the facility. Analyze the operational and safety characteristics at terminal access points, as well as where merges and weaves are introduced, in order to guide facility design, facility operations, and mitigation strategies. Additional future access arrangements beyond that provided at the facility termination points should be described in planning or scoping documents. Evaluate the benefits and tradeoffs associated with these additional access features. For example: providing direct access between a park & ride and an HOV lane may be desirable from an efficiency standpoint, but the expense may not be warranted from a benefit cost perspective or exceeds the current budget. Direct access options are discussed in Chapter 1420.
1400.03(3) Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Design Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) collect data, manage traffic, and make this information available to the public through changeable message signs, radio, and internet. ITS’s objective is to make more efficient use of our transportation network. Incorporate ITS into dynamically controlled managed lanes in order to optimize facility operation. In particular, determine how ITS will address management of incidents that may interrupt facility operation, since vehicle breakdowns and crashes typically have a significant impact on facility operations and safety. (For more information on ITS, see Chapter 1050.) Dynamic Message Signs (DMS) are a key part of ITS and are typically used to alert drivers of conditions on the roadway or inform them of anticipated travel times. A dynamically controlled managed lane design typically involves a combination of standard roadway signage and DMS as part of a communication strategy designed to inform the driver about changes in facility access rules, cost of lane, etc. For example, Standard roadway signage can describe where toll lanes start and stop and DMSs can notify drivers of the current toll rates that can change. Any communication strategy about managed lanes needs to take into account that this decision can be challenging for drivers who are unfamiliar with the corridor. A more complex operations strategy can also be employed, such as information on vehicle occupancy, access location, and/or pricing. In the case of electronic toll collection technology, it is also necessary to inform drivers that vehicles must be equipped with a transponder in order to access the facility. Managed lanes may use a combination of price, vehicle eligibility, or access location to manage demand on the facility. The goal is to use DMS (among other communication strategies) to communicate this information to drivers in a clear, concise manner, while avoiding information overload.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1400-4
Chapter 1410
Managed Lanes
For example, information that can be communicated may include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Entrance and exit locations (if specific ingress/egress points are specified) Occupancy requirements (Transit only, HOV lanes, etc.) Operating hours (HOV, part time shoulder, etc.) Toll amounts (toll facilities) Open/Closed indications (Express Lanes) Vehicle characteristics. (Transit only, Trucks prohibited, etc.)
1400.03(4) Enforcement Area Design Enforcement is necessary for the success of a managed lane. Where enforcement infrastructure is missing or inadequate, drivers can be discouraged from obeying the managed lane rules making enforcement more difficult. For example, buffer-separated and non-separated HOV lanes are easy for violators to enter and exit the HOV lane at will, which makes identifying violators difficult. On facilities that use pricing as a management tool, enforcement protects the integrity of the facility operation. Where managed lane rules can change, provide for enforcement strategies that can notify authorities and adapt to those changes. Coordinate with the Washington State Patrol (WSP) and other law enforcement agencies to establish enforcement design objectives, the need for visually verified enforcement, and other design elements that support enforcement. Design features typically associated with enforcement include, gaps in median barrier that allow law enforcement to turn around, roadway shoulders wide enough for traffic stops, and observation points. These features are also useful for emergency services, roadside assistance, and maintenance. Consider the effects of these features on the safety and visibility of the overall facility during the planning and design of enforcement infrastructure. As technology advances, it is anticipated that enforcement of managed lanes will become more consistent and accurate.
1400.03(5) Active Travel Demand Management (ATDM) Managed lanes can be designed to utilize Active Travel Demand Management (ATDM) equipment, which can inform drivers when there is a planned or unplanned change in the managed lane operating rules. For example, the part-time shoulder along northbound I-405 corridor utilizes dynamic signs to indicate when the managed lane is open based on real-time traffic conditions. Where time-of-day rules are part of a managed lanes facility design, evaluate the advantages of ATDM systems, especially with respect to compliance and operational effectiveness.
1400.03(6) Integrated Transportation Opportunities When a combination of interagency strategies are implemented together, management of the entire transportation network is typically improved. For example, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and carpool programs can be combined with managed lane facility design to better accommodate local travel demand.
1400.03(7) Technology With the development of standards for Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC), specifically related to the 5.9 GHz band, integration of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and toll collection will further support the proactive operation of managed lanes.

However, in short-term applications, current technology could limit operational characteristics. For example, with current technology the detection and enforcement of vehicle occupancy rule violations on HOV facilities remains a role for law enforcement.
1400.04 Documentation Use the Basis of Design (BOD) to document the:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Existing situation. Identified needs. Design controls. Managed lane design options analyzed. Preferred option choice. Ways the preferred managed lane option will meet the identified needs.
Documentation is done as decisions are made and by whom they are made. It is best practice that the BOD process is all but complete before it is passed on to the design phase. Refer to Chapter 300 for design documentation requirements and approving authorities.

1410.01 General High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities are a Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) strategy that includes separate HOV roadways, HOV lanes, transit lanes, HOV direct access ramps, and flyer stops. The objectives for the HOV facilities are:
•
•
•
Improve the capability of corridors to move more people by increasing the number of people per vehicle. Provide travel time savings and a more reliable trip time to HOV lane users. Provide travel options for HOVs without adversely affecting the general-purpose lanes.
Plan, design, and construct HOV facilities that provide intermodal linkages. Give consideration to future highway system capacity needs. Whenever possible, design HOV lanes so that the level of service for the general-purpose lanes is not degraded. In urban corridors that do not currently have planned or existing HOV lanes, complete an analysis of the need for HOV lanes before proceeding with any projects for additional general-purpose lanes. In corridors where both HOV and general-purpose facilities are planned, construct the HOV lane before or simultaneously with the construction of new general-purpose lanes. For additional information, see the following: Chapter 1230 Geometric cross section Chapter 1240 General-purpose turning roadway widths Chapter 1420 HOV direct access
1410.02 Preliminary Design and Planning 1410.02(1) Planning Elements for Design In order to determine the appropriate design options for an HOV facility, establish the travel demand and capacity, identify suitable corridors, evaluate the HOV facility location and length, and estimate the HOV demand. A viable HOV facility satisfies the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
It is part of an overall transportation plan. It has the support of the community and public. It responds to demonstrated congestion or near-term anticipated congestion: Level of Service E or F for at least one hour of peak period (traffic approaching a capacity of 1,700 to 2,000 vehicles per hour per lane) or average speeds less than 30 mph during peak periods over an extended distance. Except for a bypass of a local bottleneck, it is of sufficient length to provide a travel time saving of at least five minutes during the peak periods.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1410-1
Chapter 1410
•
•
High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
It has sufficient numbers of HOV users for a cost-effective facility and avoids the perception of underutilization (HOV volumes of 400 to 500 vehicles per hour on nonseparated lanes and 600 to 800 on separated facilities). It provides a safe, efficient, and enforceable operation.
A queue or bottleneck bypass can be effective without satisfying all of the above. An isolated bypass can be viable when there is localized, recurring traffic congestion, and such treatment can provide a travel time saving to a sufficient number of HOV users. The efficiency of the HOV facility can be affected by the access provisions. Direct access between park & ride/transit facilities and an HOV lane is the most desirable, but it is also an expensive alternative. Direct access options are discussed in Chapter 1420. Document the need for the HOV lane and how the proposed lane will meet those needs.
1410.02(2) HOV Facility Type Make a determination as to the type of HOV lane. The three major choices are: separated roadway, bufferseparated lane, and nonseparated HOV lane.
1410.02(2)(a) Separated Roadway The separated roadway can be either a one-way reversible or a two-way operation. The directional split in the peak periods, available space, and operating logistics are factors to be considered. A separated HOV roadway may be located in the median of the freeway, next to the freeway, or on an independent alignment. Separated HOV facilities are more effective for:
•
•
•
Large HOV volumes. Large merging and weaving volumes. Long-distance HOV travel.
Reversible separated roadways operate effectively where there are major directional splits during peak periods. Consider potential changes in this traffic pattern and design the facility to accommodate possible conversion to a two-way operation. The separated roadway is normally more efficient, provides for the higher level of safety, and is more easily enforced. However, it is generally the most expensive type of HOV facility.
1410.02(2)(b) Buffer-Separated Lane A buffer-separated HOV lane is similar to a freeway nonseparated HOV lane on the left, but with a buffer between the HOV lane and the general-purpose lanes. The addition of a buffer provides better delineation between the lanes and controls access between the HOV lane and general-purpose lanes to improve operations.
1410.02(2)(c) Nonseparated Lane Nonseparated HOV lanes operate in the same direction and immediately adjacent to the general-purpose lanes. They are located either to the left (desirable) or to the right of the general-purpose lanes. Nonseparated HOV lanes are normally less expensive and easier to implement, and they provide more opportunity for frequent access. However, the ease of access can create more problems for enforcement and a greater potential for conflicts.

High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
1410.02(3) Freeway Operational Alternatives For an HOV lane on a limited access facility, consider the following operational alternatives:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Inside (desirable) or outside HOV lane Lane conversion Using existing shoulder— permanent operations requires a design analysis HOV direct access ramps Queue bypasses Flyer stops Hours of operation
When evaluating alternatives, consider a combination of alternatives to provide the optimum solution for the corridor. Also, incorporate flexibility into the design in order not to preclude potential changes in operation, such as changing an outside lane to an inside lane or a reversible facility to two-way operations. Access, freeway-to-freeway connections, and enforcement will have to be accommodated for such changes. Document the operational alternatives.
1410.02(3)(a) Inside vs. Outside HOV Lane System continuity and consistency of HOV lane placement along a corridor are important, and they influence facility development decisions. Other issues include land use, trip patterns, transit vehicle service, HOV volume, ramp volume, congestion levels, enforcement, and direct access to facilities. The inside (left) HOV lane is most appropriate for a corridor with long-distance trip patterns, such as a freeway providing mobility to and from a large activity center. These trips are characterized by long-distance commuters and express transit service. Maximum capacity for an effective inside HOV lane is approximately 1,500 vehicles per hour. When HOVs weaving across the general-purpose lanes cause severe congestion, consider providing HOV direct access ramps, separated HOV roadways, or a higher-occupancy designation. Inside lanes are preferred for HOV lanes on freeways. The outside (right) HOV lane is most appropriate for a corridor with shorter, more widely dispersed trip patterns. These trip patterns are characterized by transit vehicle routes that exit and enter at nearly every interchange. The maximum capacity for an effective outside HOV lane is reduced and potential conflicts are increased by heavy main line congestion and large entering and exiting general-purpose volumes.
1410.02(3)(b) Conversion of a General-Purpose Lane The use of an existing general-purpose lane for an HOV lane is an undesirable option; however, conversion of a lane to an HOV lane might be justified when the conversion provides greater people-moving capability on the roadway. Use of an existing freeway lane as an HOV lane will be considered only with a Design Analysis. Given sufficient existing capacity, converting a general-purpose lane to an HOV lane can provide for greater people moving capability in the future without significantly affecting the existing roadway operations. The fastest and least expensive method for providing an HOV lane is through conversion of a general-purpose lane. Restriping and signing are sometimes all that is needed. Converting a general-purpose lane to HOV use will likely have environmental benefits. This method, however, is controversial from a public acceptance standpoint. Public support might be gained through an effective Community Engagement program (see Chapter 210).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1410-3
Chapter 1410
High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
Do not convert a general-purpose lane to an HOV lane unless it enhances the corridor’s people-moving capacity. Conduct an analysis that includes:
•
•
•
•
Public acceptance of the lane conversion. Current and long-term traffic impacts on the adjacent general-purpose lanes and the HOV lane. Impacts to the neighboring streets and arterials. Legal, environmental, and safety impacts.
1410.02(3)(c) Use of Existing Shoulder When considering the alternatives in order to provide additional width for an HOV lane, the use of the existing shoulder is an undesirable option. Use of the shoulder on a freeway or freeway ramp as an HOV lane requires a Design Analysis. Another alternative is to use the shoulder as a part time shoulder. This managed lane strategy allows vehicles to utilize the roadway’s inside or outside shoulder as a travel lane during specified periods and then revert back to a shoulder. See Chapter 1730. The use of the shoulder creates special signing, operational, and enforcement issues. An agreement may be required with the transit agency to limit transit vehicle use of the shoulder to peak hours or to help ensure drivers adhere to conditions associated with use of the part time shoulder. Such conditions may include the maximum speed and/or speed differential between buses and adjacent traffic lanes. Provide signing that clearly defines the use of the shoulder. Institute special operations to clear the shoulder for the designated hours. The existing shoulder pavement is often not designed to carry heavy volumes of vehicles, especially transit vehicles. As a result, repaving and reconstruction of the shoulder might be required.
1410.02(3)(d) HOV Direct Access Ramps To improve the efficiency of an HOV system, exclusive HOV access connections for an inside HOV lane may be considered. (See Chapter 1420 for information on HOV direct access connections.) Direct access reduces the need for HOVs to cross the general-purpose lanes from right-side ramps. Transit vehicles will be able to use the HOV lane and provide service to park & ride lots, flyer stops, or other transit stops by the HOV direct access ramps.
1410.02(3)(e) Queue Bypass Lanes A queue bypass lane allows HOVs to save time by avoiding congestion at an isolated bottleneck. Consider a queue bypass if the time savings for bypassing HOVs is one minute or more. Typical locations for queue bypasses are at ramp meters, signalized intersections, toll plazas or ferry approaches, and locations with isolated main line congestion. Queue bypass lanes can be built along with a corridor HOV facility or independently. In most cases, they are relatively low cost and easily implemented. Where an HOV bypass is being considered at a ramp metering site, consult the Region Traffic Engineer prior to implementation. When an HOV bypass is constructed at a ramp metering site, the ramp meter system should be designed to allow for metering the HOV bypass lane as well. At a minimum, an overhead signal support (Type II) with a tenon position for a signal display for the HOV bypass lane, and sufficient space in the conduit system for additional wiring, should be provided.
1410.02(3)(f) Flyer Stops Flyer stops reduce the time required for express transit vehicles to serve intermediate destinations. However, passengers must travel greater distances to reach the loading platform. (See Chapter 1420 for information on flyer stops.) WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1410-4
Chapter 1410
High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
1410.02(3)(g) Hours of Operation An HOV designation on freeway HOV lanes 24 hours a day provides benefits to users during off-peak periods, minimizes potential confusion, makes enforcement easier, and simplifies signing and striping. However, 24-hour operation also might result in a lane not used during off-peak periods, negative public opinion, and the need for full-time enforcement.
1410.02(4) Arterial Street Operational Alternatives Arterial street HOV lanes also have a variety of HOV alternatives to be considered. Some of these alternatives are site-specific or have limited applications. Arterial HOV lanes differ from freeway HOV lanes in slower speeds, little access control (turning traffic can result in right-angle conflicts), and traffic signals. Arterial HOV lanes are occasionally designated for transit vehicles only, especially in cities with a large concentration of transit vehicles. When evaluating alternatives, consider traffic signal queues and managed access highway class. The alternatives include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
Type of lane Left-side or right-side HOV lane Hours of operation Spot treatments Bus stops
When evaluating alternatives, consider a combination of alternatives to provide the optimum solution for the corridor. Also, incorporate flexibility into the design in order not to preclude potential changes in operation. Document the operational alternatives.
1410.02(4)(a) Type of Lane Lanes can be transit-only or include all HOVs. Transit-only lanes are desirable where bus volumes are high with a high level of congestion. They increase the speed of transit vehicles through congested areas and improve the reliability of the transit service. Lanes that allow use by all HOVs are appropriate on corridors with high volumes of carpools and vanpools. They can collect carpools and vanpools in business and industrial areas and connect them to the freeway system.
1410.02(4)(b) Left-Side or Right-Side HOV Lane Continuity of HOV lane location along a corridor is an important consideration when making the decision whether to locate an arterial street HOV lane on the left or right side of the street. Other issues include land use, trip patterns, transit vehicle service, safety, enforcement, and presence of parking. The right side is desirable for arterial street HOV lanes on transit routes with frequent stops. It is the most convenient for passenger boarding at transit stops. It is also the most common location for HOV lanes on arterial streets. General-purpose traffic must cross the HOV lane to make a right turn at intersections and to access driveways. These turns across the HOV lane can create conflicts. Minimizing access points that create these conflict locations is recommended. Other issues to consider are on-street parking, stopping areas for delivery vehicles, and enforcement areas. Left-side arterial street HOV lanes are less common than right-side lanes. HOV lanes on the left eliminate the potential conflicts with driveway access, on-street parking, and stopping areas for delivery vehicles. The result is fewer delays and higher speeds, making left-side arterial street HOV lanes appropriate for longer-distance trips. The disadvantages include the difficulty providing transit stops and the need to provide for left-turning generalpurpose traffic. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1410-5
Chapter 1410
High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
1410.02(4)(c) Hours of Operation An arterial street HOV lane can either operate as an HOV lane 24 hours a day or during peak hours only. Factors to consider in determining which to use include type of HOV lane, level of congestion, continuity, and enforcement. HOV lanes operating 24 hours a day are desirable when congestion and HOV demand exists for extended periods throughout the day. The 24-hour operation provides benefits to users during off-peak periods, minimizes potential confusion, makes enforcement easier, and simplifies signing and striping. The disadvantages include negative public opinion if the lane is not used during off-peak periods, the need for full-time enforcement, and the loss of on-street parking. Peak period HOV lanes are appropriate for arterial streets with HOV demand or congestion existing mainly during the peak period. Peak period HOV lanes provide HOV priority at the critical times of the day, lessen negative public perception of the HOV lane, and allow on-street parking or other shoulder uses at other times. The disadvantages include possible confusion to drivers, more difficult enforcement, increased signing, and the need to institute special operations to clear the shoulder or lane for the designated period.
1410.02(4)(d) Spot Treatments An HOV spot treatment is used to give HOVs priority around a bottleneck. It can provide time savings, travel time reliability, and improved access to other facilities. Examples include a short HOV lane to provide access to a freeway on-ramp, one lane of a dual turn lane, a priority lane at ferry terminals, and priority at traffic signals. Signal priority treatments that alter the sequence or duration of a traffic signal are techniques for providing preferential treatment for transit vehicles. The priority treatments can range from timing and phasing adjustments to signal preemption. Consider the overall impact on traffic. Preemption would normally not be an appropriate treatment where traffic signal timing and coordination are being utilized or where there are high traffic volumes on the cross streets.
1410.02(4)(e) Bus Stops Normally, with arterial HOV lanes, there is not a shoulder suitable for a bus to use while stopped to load and unload passengers without blocking the lane. Therefore, bus stops are either in-lane or in a pullout. In-lane bus stops are the simplest type of bus stop. However, stopped buses will block the HOV lane; therefore, in-lane bus stops are only allowed in transit lanes. Bus pullouts provide an area for buses to stop without blocking the HOV lane. Disadvantages include higher cost, reduced width for the sidewalk or other roadside area, and possible difficulty reentering the HOV lane. (See Chapter 1730 for additional information on bus stop location and design.)

Chapter 1410
High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
1410.03 Operations 1410.03(1) Vehicle Occupancy Designation Select the vehicle occupancy designation to provide the maximum movement of people in a corridor, provide free-flow HOV operations, reduce the empty lane perception, provide for the ability to accommodate future HOV growth within a corridor, and be consistent with the regional transportation plan and the policies adopted by the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO). Establish an initial occupancy designation. It is WSDOT policy to use the 2+ designation as the initial occupancy designation. Consider a 3+ occupancy designation if it is anticipated during initial operation that the volumes will be 1,500 vehicles per hour for a left-side HOV lane, or 1,200 vehicles per hour for a right-side HOV lane, or that a 45 mph operating speed cannot be maintained for more than 90% of the peak hour.
1410.03(2) Enforcement Enforcement is necessary for the success of an HOV facility. Coordination with the Washington State Patrol (WSP) is critical when the operational characteristics and design alternatives are being established. This involvement ensures the project is enforceable and will receive their support. Provide both enforcement areas and observation points for high-speed HOV lanes and ramp facilities. Barrier-separated facilities, because of the limited access, are the easiest facilities to enforce. Shoulders provided to accommodate breakdowns may also be used for enforcement. Reversible facilities have ramps for the reverse direction that may be used for enforcement. Gaps in the barrier may be needed so emergency vehicles can access barrier-separated HOV lanes. Buffer-separated and nonseparated HOV lanes allow violators to easily enter and exit the HOV lane. Provide strategically located enforcement areas and observation points. Consider the impact on safety and visibility for the overall facility during the planning and design of enforcement areas and observation points. Where HOV facilities do not have enforcement areas, or where officers perceive that the enforcement areas are inadequate, enforcement on the facility will be difficult and less effective.
1410.03(3) Intelligent Transportation Systems The objective of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) ), which is a subcategory of Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) strategy, is to make more efficient use of our transportation network. This is done by collecting data, managing traffic, and relaying information to the motoring public. It is important that an ITS system be incorporated into the HOV project and that the HOV facility fully utilize the ITS features available. This includes providing a strategy of incident management since vehicle breakdowns and crashes have a significant impact on the efficient operation of the HOV facilities. (For more information on ITS, see Chapter 1050.)

High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
1410.04 Design Criteria 1410.04(1) Design Procedures 1410.04(2) Design Considerations HOV lanes are designed to the same criteria as the facilities to which they are attached. Design nonseparated and buffer-separated HOV lanes to match the vertical alignment, horizontal alignment, and cross slope of the adjacent lane.
1410.04(3) Adding an HOV Lane The options for adding an HOV lane are: reconstruction, restriping, combined reconstruction and restriping, and possibly lane conversion.
1410.04(3)(a) Reconstruction Reconstruction involves creating roadway width. Additional right of way may be required.
1410.04(3)(b) Restriping Restriping involves reallocating the existing paved roadway to create enough space to provide an additional HOV lane.
1410.04(3)(c) Combined Reconstruction and Restriping Reconstruction and restriping can be combined to maximize use of the available right of way. For example, a new lane can be created through a combination of median reconstruction, shoulder reconstruction, and lane restriping. Handle each project on a case-by-case basis. Generally, consider the following reductions in order of preference:
•
•
•
•
•
Reduction of the inside shoulder width, provided the enforcement and safety mitigation issues are addressed. (Give consideration to not precluding future HOV direct access ramps by over-reduction of the available median width.) Reduction of the interior general-purpose lane width to 11 feet. Reduction of the outside general-purpose lane width to 11 feet. Reduction of the HOV lane to 11 feet. Reduction of the outside shoulder width to 8 feet.
1410.04(3)(d) Lane Conversion If lane width adjustments are made, thoroughly eradicate the old lane markings. It is desirable that longitudinal joints (new or existing) not conflict with tire track lines. If they do, consider overlaying the roadway before restriping.
1410.04(4) Design Criteria for Types of HOV Facilities 1410.04(4)(a) Separated Roadway HOV Facilities The separated HOV facility can be single-lane or multilane and directional or reversible (see Exhibit 1410-2).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1410-8
Chapter 1410
High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
Lane Widths For traveled way width (WR) on turning roadways, see Exhibit 1410-1.
Shoulder Widths The shoulder width requirements are as follows:
•
•
•
The minimum width for the sum of the two shoulders is 12 feet for one-lane facilities and 14 feet for two-lane facilities. Provide a width of at least 10 feet for one of the shoulders for disabled vehicles. The minimum for the other shoulder is 2 feet for one-lane facilities and 4 feet for two-lane facilities. The wider shoulder may be on the left or the right. Maintain the wide shoulder on the same side throughout the facility.
Total Widths To reduce the probability of blocking the HOV facility, make the total width (lane width plus paved shoulders) wide enough to allow an A BUS to pass a stalled A BUS. For single-lane facilities, the traveled way widths (WR), given in Exhibit 1410-1, plus the 12-foot total shoulder width will provide for this passing for radii (R) 100 feet or greater. For R of 75 feet, a total roadway width of 33 feet is needed, and for R of 50 feet, a total roadway width of 41 feet is needed to provide for the passing.

1410.04(4)(b) Nonseparated Freeway HOV Lanes For both inside and outside HOV lanes, the minimum lane width is 12 feet and the minimum shoulder width is 10 feet (see Exhibit 1410-2).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1410-9
Chapter 1410
High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
When a left shoulder less than 10 feet wide is proposed for distances exceeding 1.5 miles, provide enforcement and observation areas at 1- to 2 mile intervals (see Section 1410.04(7)). Where left shoulders less than 8 feet wide are proposed for lengths of roadway exceeding 0.5 mile, provide safety refuge areas at 0.5- to 1-mile intervals. These can be in addition to or in conjunction with the enforcement areas. Allow general-purpose traffic to cross HOV lanes at on- and off-ramps.
1410.04(4)(c) Buffer-Separated HOV Lanes Design buffer-separated HOV lanes the same as for inside nonseparated HOV lanes, except for a buffer 2 to 4 feet in width or 10 feet or greater in width with pavement marking, with supplemental signing, to restrict crossing. For buffer-separated HOV lanes with a buffer at least 4 feet wide, the left shoulder may be reduced to 8 feet. Buffer widths between 4 and 10 feet are undesirable because they may appear to be wide enough for a refuge area, but they are too narrow. Provide gaps in the buffer to allow access to the HOV lane.
1410.04(4)(d) Arterial Street HOV Lanes The minimum width for an arterial street HOV lane is 12 feet. Allow general-purpose traffic to cross the HOV lanes to turn at intersections and to access driveways (see Exhibit 1410-2). For right-side HOV lanes adjacent to curbs, provide a 4-foot shoulder between the HOV lane and the face of curb. The shoulder may be reduced to 2 feet with justification. For HOV lanes on the left, a 1-foot left shoulder between the HOV lane and the face of curb is required. When concrete barrier is adjacent to the HOV lane, the minimum shoulder is 2 feet.
1410.04(4)(e) HOV Ramp Meter Bypass An HOV bypass may be created by widening an existing ramp, constructing a new ramp where right of way is available, or reallocating the existing pavement width (provided the shoulders are full depth). For ramps with a single general purpose lane and an HOV bypass, consider installing an overhead signal support to allow for the installation of an overhead sign (7.5 square feet maximum) and a ramp meter display for the HOV bypass. For ramps with two general-purpose lanes and an HOV bypass, provide an overhead signal support capable of supporting the installation of a sign (7.5 square feet maximum) and a ramp meter display for the HOV bypass. Ramp meter bypass lanes may be located on the left or right of metered lanes. Typically, bypass lanes are located on the left side of the ramp. Consult with local transit agencies and the region Traffic Office for guidance on which side to place the HOV bypass. Consider the existing conditions at each location when designing a ramp meter bypass. Design a single-lane ramp with a single metered lane and an HOV bypass as shown in Exhibit 1410-4. Make the total width of the metered and bypass lanes equal to a 2-lane ramp (see Chapter 1240 and Chapter 1360). Design a ramp with two metered lanes and an HOV bypass as shown in Exhibit 1410-5. Make the width of the two metered lanes equal to a 2-lane ramp (see Chapter 1240 and Chapter 1360) and the width of the bypass lane as shown in Exhibit 1410-3. The design shown in Exhibit 1410-5 requires that the ramp operate as a single-lane ramp when the meter is not in operation. Both Exhibit 1410-4 and Exhibit 1410-5 show an observation point/enforcement area. Document any other enforcement area designs in the design documentation package. An alternative is to provide a 10 foot outside shoulder from the stop bar to the main line.

1410.04(5) HOV Direct Access Ramps HOV direct access ramps provide access between an HOV lane and another freeway, a local arterial street, a flyer stop, or a park & ride facility. Design HOV direct access ramps in accordance with Chapter 1420.
1410.04(6) HOV Lane Termination Locate the beginning and end of an HOV lane at logical points. Provide decision sight distance, signing, and pavement markings at the termination points. The desirable method of terminating an inside HOV lane is to provide a straight through move for the HOV traffic, ending the HOV restriction and dropping a general-purpose lane on the right. However, analyze volumes for both the HOV lanes and general-purpose lanes, as well as the geometric conditions, to optimize the overall operational performance of the facility.
1410.04(7) Enforcement Areas Enforcement of the inside HOV lane can be done with a minimum 10-foot inside shoulder. For continuous lengths of barrier exceeding 2 miles, a 12-foot shoulder is recommended for the whole length of the barrier. For inside shoulders less than 10 feet, locate enforcement and observation areas at 1 to 2-mile intervals or based on the recommendations of the WSP. These areas can also serve as refuge areas for disabled vehicles (see Exhibit 1410-6 and Exhibit 1410-7). Provide observation points approximately 1,300 feet before enforcement areas. They can be designed to serve both patrol cars and motorcycles or motorcycles only. Coordinate with the WSP during the design stage to provide effective placement and utilization of the observation points. Median openings give motorcycle officers the added advantage of being able to quickly respond to emergencies in the opposing lanes (see Exhibit 1410-7). The ideal observation point places the motorcycle officer 3 feet above the HOV lane and outside the shoulder so the officer can look down into a vehicle. Locate the enforcement area on the right side for queue bypasses and downstream from the stop bar so the officer can be an effective deterrent (see Exhibit 1410-4 and Exhibit 1410-5). An optional signal status indicator for enforcement may be placed at HOV lane installations that are metered. The indicator faces the enforcement area so that a WSP officer can determine whether vehicles are violating the ramp meter. The indicator allows the WSP officer to simultaneously enforce two areas: the ramp meter and the HOV lane. Consult with the WSP regarding use at all locations. For additional information on enforcement signal heads, see the Traffic Manual regarding HOV metered bypasses.
1410.04(8) Signs and Pavement Markings 1410.04(8)(a) Signs Provide post-mounted HOV preferential lane signs next to the HOV lane or overhead-mounted signs over the HOV lane. Make the sign wording clear and precise, stating which lane is restricted, the type of HOVs allowed, and the HOV vehicle occupancy designation for that section of road. The sign size, location, and spacing are dependent upon the conditions under which the sign is used. Roadside signs can also be used to convey other HOV information such as the HERO program, carpool information, telephone numbers, and violation fines. Some situations may call for the use of variable message signs.

Place overhead signs directly over the HOV lane to provide maximum visibility. Use a sequence of overhead signs at the beginning and end of freeway HOV facilities. Overhead signs can also be used in conjunction with roadside signs along the roadway.
1410.04(8)(b) Pavement Markings Provide pavement markings that conform to the Traffic Manual and the Standard Plans.
1410.04(8)(c) Interchanges In the vicinity of interchange on- and off-connections where merging or exiting traffic crosses an HOV lane, make provisions for general-purpose traffic using the HOV lane. These provisions include signing and striping that clearly show the changes in HOV versus general traffic restrictions. (See the Standard Plans for pavement markings and signing.)

1420.01 General This chapter provides WSDOT design guidance for left-side direct access facilities for high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs) between freeway HOV lanes and flyer stops within the freeway right of way or facilities outside of the right of way. Design right-side HOV-only access facilities in accordance with Chapter 1360. Direct access eliminates the need for left-side HOV lane users to cross the general-purpose lanes to right-side general-purpose ramps. Also, transit vehicles can use the HOV lane and provide service to the HOV direct access facility. Providing the HOV user access to the inside HOV lane without mixing with the general-purpose traffic saves the user additional travel time and aids in safety, enforcement, incident handling, and overall operation of the HOV facility. Locations for direct access ramps include HOV facilities on intersecting routes, park & ride lots, flyer stops, and locations with a demonstrated demand. Coordinate with the local transit agencies to identify these key locations. Give priority to locations that serve the greatest number of transit vehicles and other HOVs.
1420.01(1) Practical Design Under WSDOT practical design (see Chapter 1100 and Division 11) an important function of alternative solution formulation is to identify alternatives that address the baseline need while balancing the performance trade-offs identified in the process. Since HOV direct access connections are often added to existing corridors, performance tradeoffs to mainline GP lanes or other elements may be needed and acceptable to provide the new HOV connections. Document performance tradeoffs according to Chapter 1100 and Division 11.
1420.01(2) Reviews, Studies, and Reports The practical design project development process is to be followed when developing an HOV direct access project (see Chapter 1100). Despite the nature of the projects that are the focus of this chapter, most facets of the project development process remain unchanged. For example, early coordination with others is a vital part of developing a project. There are also environmental considerations, Community Engagement, and value engineering studies (see Chapter 310). There may also be reviews, studies, and reports required by agreements with regional transit authorities or other agencies. Provide an Access Revision Report (ARR) (see Chapter 550) when there is a proposal to add, delete, or change an access point. Provide the operational analysis from the report for all flyer stops. For left-side connections, include the commitment that the connection will be used solely by HOVs or will be closed.

Chapter 1420
HOV Direct Access
Throughout the project development phase, make sure the project:
•
•
•
•
•
Need Statement (see Chapter 1101) and cost estimate are correct. Development process is on schedule. Documents are biddable. Will be constructible. Will be maintainable.
Constructability of HOV direct access facilities is an important consideration during the design phase. These facilities will typically be constructed on existing highways with traffic maintained on-site. Key goals are to:
•
•
•
•
Provide a project that can be built. Plan a construction strategy. Provide a safe work zone. Minimize construction delays.
Consider access to these facilities by maintenance crews. Avoid items that require a significant maintenance effort and might result in lane closure for routine maintenance or repair.
1420.01(3) Left-Side Connections Left-side connections are allowed only when they serve HOVs exclusively and connect to an HOV lane. The higher traffic volume associated with general-purpose traffic is not acceptable for left-side connections. If the demand for an HOV direct access decreases to the point that the HOV direct access connection is no longer desirable, the connection must be closed.
1420.02 HOV Access Types and Locations To provide direct access for high-occupancy vehicles from the HOV lane to a passenger loading facility, there are many options and many constraints. Following are some of the options (selected as being usable on Washington’s freeways) and constraints regarding their use. To select an option, first establish the need, choose possible locations, evaluate site features (such as terrain, existing structures, median widths), and evaluate existing HOV information (such as lanes, park & ride facilities, transit routes and schedules, and origin and destination studies). Choose a location that meets access point spacing requirements and will not degrade traffic operations on the main line. Important constraints to transit stop designs are:
•
•
•
Passenger access routes and waiting areas are separated from freeway traffic. Passenger access to a bus is on its right side only. Passenger access to a loading platform must accommodate individuals with disabilities.
1420.02(1) Freeway Ramp Connection Locations 1420.02(1)(a) Spacing For minimum ramp connection spacing, see Chapter 1360. When evaluating the spacing of left-side direct access ramps, include only left-side connections. Traffic operations can be degraded by the weaving caused by a left-side on-connection followed closely by a right-side off-connection (or a right-side on-connection followed by a left-side off-connection).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1420-2
Chapter 1420
HOV Direct Access
As a general rule, if the spacing between the HOV direct access ramp and the general-purpose ramp is less than one gap acceptance length (see Section 1420.03(6)(c)) per lane, make the HOV lane buffer-separated (see Chapter 1410). Conduct an analysis to make certain that the new ramp will not degrade traffic operations. (See Chapter 550 for the studies and report required for a new access point.) When an off-connection follows an on-connection, provide full speed-change lane lengths and tapers or at least sufficient distance for full speed-change lanes that connect at full width with no tapers (see Sections 1420.03(6) and 1420.03(7)). An auxiliary lane can be used to connect full-width speed-change lanes if there is not sufficient distance for both tapers.
1420.02(1)(b) Sight Distance Locate both on- and off-connections to the main line where decision sight distance exists on the main line (see Chapter 1260).
1420.02(2) Ramp Terminal Locations 1420.02(2)(a) Local Streets and Roads Access to the HOV lane can be provided by a ramp that terminates at a local street or road. The local street or road may incorporate HOV lanes, but they are not required. (See Section 1420.05 for signing and pavement markings.) Consider traffic operations on the local road. Locate the terminal where:
•
•
•
•
•
It has the least impact on the local road. Intersection spacing criteria are satisfied. Queues from adjacent intersections do not block the ramp. Queues at the ramp do not block adjacent intersections. Wrong-way movements are discouraged.
When off-ramps and on-ramps are opposite each other on the local road, consider incorporating a transit stop with the intersection.
1420.02(2)(b) Park & Ride Lots HOV direct access ramps that connect the HOV lane with a park & ride lot provide easy access for express transit vehicles between the HOV lane and a local service transit stop at the park & ride facility. Other HOV traffic using the access ramp enters through the park & ride lot, which can create operational conflicts.
1420.02(2)(c) Flyer Stops Median flyer stops do not provide general access to the HOV lane. Access is from the HOV lane to the transit stop and back to the HOV lane. No other vehicle access is provided. Ramps to and from the flyer stops are restricted to transit vehicles only.

1420.02(3) Ramp Types 1420.02(3)(a) Drop Ramps Drop ramps are generally straight, stay in the median, and connect the HOV lane with a local road or flyer stop. Following is a photo and an example of a drop ramp.

1420.02(3)(b) T Ramps A T ramp is a median ramp that serves all four HOV access movements and comes to a T intersection within the median, usually on a structure. The structure then carries the HOV ramp over the freeway to a local road or directly to a park & ride lot. Through traffic is not permitted at the T ramp; therefore, flyer stops are not allowed. A photo and an example of a T ramp are shown for reference. Also, refer to Section 1420.03(10) for added design information.

1420.02(3)(c) Flyover Ramps A flyover ramp is designed to accommodate high-speed traffic by using flat curves as the ramp crosses from the median over one direction of the freeway to a local road, a park & ride lot, or an HOV lane on another freeway. A photo and an example of a flyover ramp are shown.
Flyover ramp photograph from FHWA/PB HOV Interactive 1.0 High Occupancy Vehicle Data Base from the U.S., Canada, and Europe
1420.02(4) Transit Stops 1420.02(4)(a) Flyer Stops Flyer stops are transit stops inside the limited access boundaries for use by express transit vehicles using the freeway. They may be located in the median at the same grade as the main roadway or on a structure, on a ramp, or on the right side of the main line. The advantage of a median flyer stop is that it reduces the time for express transit vehicles to serve intermediate destinations. A disadvantage is that passengers travel greater distances to reach the loading platform.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1420-6
Chapter 1420
HOV Direct Access
With left-side HOV lanes, flyer stops located on the right side increase the delay to the express transit vehicles by requiring them to cross the general-purpose lanes. However, these stops improve passenger access from that side of the freeway. For additional design information, see Chapter 1730. 1. Side-Platform Flyer Stops Side-platform flyer stops are normally located in the median and have two passenger loading platforms: one on each side between the bus loading lane and the through HOV lane. This design provides the most direct movement for the express transit vehicle and is the desirable design for median flyer stops. This design is relatively wide. Where space is a concern, consider staggering the loading platforms longitudinally. Consider tall barrier to divide the directions of travel or staggering the loading platforms to discourage unauthorized at-grade movement of passengers from one platform to the other (see Section 1420.05(1)). The side platform flyer stop with grade-separated access to each platform is the preferred design.

Chapter 1420
HOV Direct Access
2. At-Grade Passenger Crossings This design is similar to the side-platform flyer stop, except that passengers are allowed to cross, from one platform to the other, at grade. This design might eliminate the need for passenger access to one of the loading platforms with a ramp or an elevator, and it simplifies transfers. The passenger crossing necessitates providing a gap in the barrier for the crosswalk. Only transit vehicles are allowed. Passenger/ pedestrian accommodations must comply with the ADA. Consider an at-grade passenger crossing flyer stop only when passenger volumes are expected to be low. Design at-grade passenger crossing flyer stops as the first stage of the stop, with the ultimate design being sideplatform flyer stops with grade-separated access to both platforms.

HOV Direct Access
3. Ramp Flyer Stops When ramp flyer stops are located on an HOV direct access drop ramp, the delay for the express transit vehicle will not be much more than for a median stop, and passenger access and connectivity to local service transit routes, on the local street or road, are improved. A flyer stop on a right-side ramp works well with right-side HOV lanes and diamond interchanges in which express transit vehicles can use the off-ramp to connect with a bus route on the local road and the on-ramp to return to the HOV lane. However, a stop on a general-purpose right-side ramp with a left-side HOV lane will increase the delay by requiring the express transit vehicle to use the general-purpose lanes and possibly degrade main line traffic operations by increasing weaving movements.
1420.02(4)(b) Off-Line Transit Stops i Park & Ride Stops Transit stops located at park & ride lots provide transfer points between the express transit system and the local transit system, and there is convenient passenger access to the park & ride lot. When a direct access ramp is provided, express transit delays from the HOV lane to the stop are reduced. These delays can be reduced more by providing a median flyer stop with passenger access facilities connecting the park & ride lot to the flyer stop; however, this might be more inconvenient for the passengers.

HOV Direct Access
ii Stops at Flyer Stop Passenger Access Points To minimize the passenger travel distance between express and local service transit stops, locate local system transit stops near passenger access facilities for the flyer stops.
1420.02(5) Enforcement Areas Enforcing the vehicle occupancy requirement helps the HOV facilities function as intended. Law enforcement officers need areas for observation that are near pull-out areas, where both the violator and the officer can pull safely out of the traffic flow. Consider locating observation and pull-out areas near any point where violators can enter or exit an HOV direct access facility. Examples of potential locations are:
•
•
Freeway on- and off-connections for HOV direct access ramps. HOV direct access ramp terminals at parking lots.
For freeway HOV lanes, locate enforcement areas on the adjacent shoulders so officers and violators are not required to cross several lanes of traffic. Enforcement area guidance and designs are in Chapter 1410.
1420.03 Direct Access Geometrics HOV direct access ramps are different than other ramps because they are usually on the left side of the through lanes and they have a high percentage of buses. Design right-side HOV direct access using the procedures given in Chapter 1360. The following procedures are for the design of left-side HOV direct access. Because left-side ramps are rare and therefore less expected, signing is an important issue. (For signing guidance, see Section 1420.05(2).)
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1420-10
Chapter 1420
HOV Direct Access
When the bus percentage is high, there are several considerations:
•
•
•
When a bus enters the through lanes from the left, the driver has a relatively poor view of the through traffic. A bus requires a longer distance to accelerate than other vehicles. A bus requires a longer deceleration length for passenger comfort.
1420.03(1) Design Vehicles Use the following design vehicles for left-side HOV direct access facilities:
•
•
•
Use AASHTO’s A BUS vehicle for horizontal design. Use AASHTO’s SU-30 vehicle for vertical design. Use AASHTO’s P vehicle for stopping sight distance.
Refer to Chapter 1300 and Chapter 1730, and the AASHTO Green Book for vehicle descriptions and dimensions. Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify turning movements.
1420.03(2) Design Speeds Refer to Chapter 1360 for the design speeds for ramps. Use the design speed of the general-purpose lanes for the main line design speed.
1420.03(3) Sight Distance Provide stopping sight distance in accordance with Chapter 1260. This provides sight distance for an automobile. The longer distance needed for a bus to stop is compensated for by the greater eye height of the driver, with the resulting vertical curve length about equal to that for an automobile. Sag vertical curves may be shortened where necessary. (See Chapter 1220 for guidance.)
1420.03(4) Grades Grades for ramps are covered in Section 1360.03(3). A design analysis will be considered for:
•
•
Downgrade on-ramps with grades increased by an additional 1%. Upgrade off-ramps with grades increased by an additional 2%.
These increased grades help when geometrics are restricted, and they assist transit vehicles with the acceleration when entering and the deceleration when exiting the freeway.
1420.03(5) Ramp Widths 1420.03(5)(a) Lane Widths Use widths for separated roadway HOV facilities. (See Minimum Traveled Way Widths for Articulated Buses in Chapter 1410.) On tangents, the minimum lane width may be reduced to 12 feet.

Ramp shoulder width criteria are modified as follows:
•
•
•
The minimum width for the sum of the two shoulders is 10 feet for one-lane ramps and 12 feet for two or more lanes. The minimum width for one of the shoulders is 8 feet for disabled vehicles. The minimum width for the other shoulder is 2 feet. (See Chapter 1239 for lateral clearance to curb and barrier.) The wider shoulder may be on the left or the right. Maintain the wide shoulder on the same side throughout the ramp.
1420.03(5)(c) Total Ramp Widths When an A-BUS is the intersection design vehicle at the ramp terminal, make the total width of the ramp (lane width plus shoulders) wide enough to allow an A-BUS to pass a stalled A-BUS. This width has two components:
•
•
The vehicle width (U = 8.5 feet on tangent) for each vehicle Lateral clearance (C = 2 feet) for each vehicle
The vehicle width and the lateral clearance are about the width of an A-BUS from edge of mirror to edge of mirror. The table above gives the minimum ramp width (WR), including shoulders, at various radii (R) for an articulated bus. For ramp locations on a tangent section or on a curve with a radius greater than 150 feet, consider the WR width when requesting a reduced lane or shoulder width. For ramp curves with a radius less than 150 feet, check the total ramp width and, if necessary, widen the shoulders to provide the WR width.

HOV Direct Access
1420.03(6) On-Connections 1420.03(6)(a) Parallel On-Connections For left-side on-connections, use the parallel on-connection. A parallel on-connection adds a parallel lane that is long enough for the merging vehicle to accelerate in the lane and then merge with the through traffic. This merge is similar to a lane change and the driver can use side and rear view mirrors to advantage.
Notes: [1] For acceleration lane length LA, see Section 1420.03(6)(b). Check LA for each ramp design speed. [2] Lg is the gap acceptance length. Begin Lg at the beginning of the parallel lane, as shown, but not before the end of the acceleration lane LA. (See Section 1420.03(6)(c) for the length Lg.) [3] Point Ⓐ is the point controlling the ramp design speed or the end of the transit stop zone or other stopping point. [4] For ramp lane and shoulder widths, see Section 1420.03(5). [5] A transition curve with a minimum radius of 3,000 ft is desirable. The desirable length is 300 ft. When the main line is on a curve to the right, the transition may vary from a 3,000 ft radius to tangent to the main line. The transition curve may be replaced by a 50:1 taper with a minimum length of 300 ft. [6] Angle point for width transitions, when required. (See Chapter 1210 for pavement transitions.) [7] For ramp shoulder width, see Section 1420.03(5)(b). [8] The 10 ft left shoulder is the minimum width; 14 ft is desirable. Maintain this shoulder width for at least 500 ft; 1,000 ft is desirable. [9] Radius may be reduced when concrete barrier is placed between the ramp and main line. General: For striping, see the Standard Plans. Ramp lane width shown for illustrative purposes. Determine lane width according to Section 1420.03(5). Verify ramp width selection with transit providers that may utilize these connections.

1420.03(6)(b) Acceleration Lanes The table below gives the minimum acceleration lane length (LA) for left-side HOV direct access on-connections. The buses using HOV direct access ramps merge with high-speed traffic. Acceleration lanes that are longer than normally used are needed. For left-side on-connections, consider at least the normal 10-foot-wide (14-foot desirable) left shoulder for the main line for a minimum length of 500 feet (1,000 feet desirable) beyond the end of the on-connection taper. This gives additional room for enforcement, merging, and erratic maneuvers.

1420.03(8) Vertical Clearance Vertical clearance for a structure over a road is measured from the lower roadway surface, including the usable shoulders, to the bottom of the overhead structure. Refer to Chapter 720 for information on vertical clearance. The minimum vertical clearance for a pedestrian grade separation over any road is 17.5 feet.
1420.03(9) Flyer Stops Design flyer-stop ramp on-connections as given in Section 1420.03(6), and design off-connections as given in Section 1420.03(7). Flyer stop connections are included in the access point spacing discussed in Section 1420.02(1)(a). Design the ramp to the flyer stop in accordance with Sections 1420.03(3), 1420.03(4), and 1420.03(5). The minimum width for the roadway at a flyer stop is 24 feet. When a flyer stop is in the median, provide enough median width for the flyer stop roadway, passenger facilities, and barrier separation without reducing the width of the through lanes or shoulders (see Section 1420.04). The approval of a flyer stop requires the operational analysis portion of the Access Revision Report (see Chapter 550).

Provide a staggered traffic arrow to better describe the left and right turns. Provide pavement marking extensions, using wide lines, through intersections. Use redundant directional pavement arrows at ramp terminals. Paint or use reflective sheeting to highlight barrier terminals. Locate the left barrier end to provide good visibility for left-turning traffic for both the barrier terminal and the on-ramp roadway. Extend the right barrier as far as feasible while providing a 4-foot clearance for the left-turning exiting design vehicle. Provide redundant signing. Provide enlarged warning signs.

1420.04 Passenger Access When designing transit stops, include accessibility (compliance with the ADA), safety, and the comfort of passengers. Minimize pedestrian/vehicle conflict points. Design the whole facility with security in mind by keeping lines of sight as open as possible. Traffic barriers, fencing, illumination, landscaping, seating, windscreens, shelters, enclosed walkways, telephones, and posted schedules are examples of items that contribute to passenger safety and well-being. (See Chapter 1730 for passenger amenities at transit stops.)
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1420-19
Chapter 1420
HOV Direct Access
1420.04(1) Passengers To encourage use of the passenger access facility for an express transit stop, provide a route that is the shortest distance to travel from the park & ride lot or local transit stop. Failure to do so might generate the use of undesirable shortcuts. To encourage local use of the passenger access facilities, provide direct access from surrounding neighborhoods. Provide grade separations for pedestrian access to transit stops in the median. Consider stairways, ramps, elevators, and escalators, but provide at least one access for the disabled at every loading platform, as required by the American with Disabilities Act of 1990. (See Chapter 1510 for guidance when designing pedestrian grade separations.) The ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities states, “Platform edges bordering a drop-off and not protected by platform screens or guard rails shall have a detectable warning … 24 inches wide running the full length of the platform drop-off.” (See the Standard Plans for the detectable warning pattern.) At transit stops, at-grade crosswalks are only permitted in the at-grade crossing flyer stop layout described in Section 1420.02(4)2. Use traffic calming techniques, such as horizontal alignment, textured pavement and crosswalk markings, barrier openings, and other treatments, to channelize pedestrian movements and slow the transit vehicle’s movements. Illuminate transit stop crosswalks (see Chapter 1040). Where at-grade crosswalks are not permitted, take steps to minimize unauthorized at-grade crossings. Fencing, taller concrete traffic barrier, enclosed walkways, and ramps are examples of steps that may be taken.
1420.04(2) Bicycles Bike lanes on nearby streets, separate bike paths, and shared-use paths encourage people to bicycle from surrounding neighborhoods. Provide these bicyclists direct access to passenger access facilities. Design bicycle access facilities in conjunction with the access for the disabled (see Chapter 1510, Chapter 1515, and Chapter 1520). Locate bicycle parking outside of the passenger walkways (see Chapter 1730). Locations near colleges and universities and locations with good bicycle access, especially near trails, will attract bicyclists. Contact the region Bicycle Coordinator for information on the predicted number of bicycle parking spaces needed and the types of bicycle racks available.
1420.05 Traffic Design Elements Traffic design elements are critical to the safe and efficient use of HOV direct access facilities. The following discusses the elements of traffic design that might be different for HOV direct access facilities.
1420.05(1) Traffic Barriers Separate the main line from the HOV direct access facilities with a traffic barrier. Whenever possible, separate opposing traffic lanes in the facility by using traffic barrier (see Chapter 1610). This is especially important in areas where opposing traffic is changing speeds to or from main line speeds. Concrete barrier is generally desirable on these facilities due to lower maintenance requirements. Provide crashworthy end treatments to the approach ends of traffic barriers (see Chapter 1620). When the operating speed is 25 mph or lower, and where an at-grade pedestrian crossing transit stop has an opening in a concrete barrier, a sloped-down end as shown in the Standard Plans is acceptable.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1420-20
Chapter 1420
HOV Direct Access
When providing a break in the barrier for turning maneuvers, consider sight distance (see Chapter 1260) when determining the location for stopping the barrier. In areas where headlight glare is a concern, consider glare screens such as taller concrete barrier. Other glare screen options that mount on the top of a barrier tend to be high-maintenance items and are discouraged. Taller barrier might also be desirable in areas where pedestrian access is discouraged, such as between opposing flyer stops or between a flyer stop and the main line.
1420.05(2) Signing Design and place HOV signing to clearly indicate whether the signs are intended for motorists in the HOV lane or the general-purpose lanes. The purposes of the signs are to:
•
•
•
•
Enhance safety. Convey the message that HOV lanes are restricted to HOVs. Provide clear directions for entrances and exits. Define vehicle occupancy requirements or other restrictions.
Because HOV facilities are not found in many regions, the signing not only considers the commuter but also the occasional user of the facility who might be unfamiliar with the HOV facility and its operation.
1420.05(2)(a) Safety Much of HOV signing relates to enhancing safety for motorists. Not only are geometrics often minimized due to the lack of right of way, but there are unusual operational characteristics such as the differential speed between the HOV vehicle and the adjacent general-purpose traffic. To allow for the lack of passing opportunities in the HOV lane and the necessity for frequent merging and weaving actions, use messages that are clear and concise, and use symbols wherever possible. Because left-side off-connections are unusual, advance warning signing alerting motorists that an exit is on the left becomes more important. For T ramps, provide traffic control at the T to assign priority to one of the turn movements and to avert wrongway movements.
1420.05(2)(b) Diamond Symbols The diamond symbol is used to designate HOV facilities where carpools are allowed. For all signs, whether regulatory, guide, or warning, the symbol is white on a black background to convey the restrictive nature of the HOV lane and to make the signs more uniformly recognizable. The use of the symbol with all HOV signs also informs drivers that the message is intended for HOVs. The diamond symbol is only for HOV lanes where carpools are allowed; it is not used for bus, taxi, or bicycle preferential lanes.
1420.05(2)(c) Selection and Location The signing details given throughout this section provide for the HOV geometric configurations used within the right of way. Signing for other types of HOV facilities (such as those used for reversible-flow and for HOV direct access between freeways and temporary HOV lanes used during construction) is designed on a case-by-case basis and requires consultation with the appropriate Headquarters and region traffic personnel. In addition to the normal regulatory signs, include HOV guide signs, both advance and action, in the design of signing for HOV direct access between freeways.

Notes: Place signs in accordance with the MUTCD. For non-HOV sign details, see the Sign Fabrication Manual.
1420.05(2)(d) Regulatory Signs Regulatory signs for HOV facilities follow the normal regulatory signing principles: black legend with a white reflective background on a rectangular panel. Keep in mind that messages conveyed by the HOV signs (such as signs concerning violations and those indicating the beginning of an HOV lane downstream) are not necessarily intended only for the HOV vehicle. Therefore, it might be prudent to place additional signs on the right side of the freeway when doing so conforms to sound engineering practice.

1420.05(2)(e) Guide Signs Guide signs for HOV facilities are generally used at intermediate on and off locations to inform HOV motorists of upcoming freeway exits and the appropriate location to exit the HOV lane. For HOV direct access to and from arterials, guide signs are used in a fashion similar to normal arterial interchange signing practice. The guide signs for HOV facilities have a black nonreflective legend on a white reflective background. The exception is the diamond, where the white reflective symbol is on a black nonreflective background. For all HOV-related guide signs, the diamond is placed in the upper left-hand corner of the sign. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Fully utilize available ITS elements in the design of HOV direct access facilities. Need for ITS elements varies depending on project features, such as facility design and operation, and whether the site has existing ITS components. ITS elements that might be applicable to HOV direct access facilities include: closed circuit television surveillance; ramp metering; data collection; exit queue detection and override; dynamic signing; transit signal priority; and automatic vehicle identification and location. Guidance on the development of ITS elements is found in Chapter 1050. Include the region Traffic Office, transit operator, and affected local agency in the coordination for the design and implementation of ITS.

Part-time Shoulder Exhibit 1430-1 Part Time Shoulder Layout [1] Exhibit 1430-2 Considerations for Part-Time Shoulder Utilization [1]
1430.01 General Part-time shoulders are managed lanes that allow vehicles to utilize the roadway’s inside or outside shoulder as a travel lane during specified periods to reduce delays and increase the roadway’s overall person throughput. This is a relatively low-cost Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) strategy that capitalizes on existing infrastructure and often requires minimal investment to implement. Typically, part-time shoulders are utilized at specific locations or along corridors that are experiencing routine congested periods coupled with a lack of sufficient capacity and where a larger capital improvement may be infeasible or cost prohibitive. Part-time shoulders are typically associated with freeway facilities but can be used on other roadways classifications, such as arterials. The operational periods of the part-time shoulders can be statically or dynamically controlled which are described later in this chapter. Access can be limited to certain vehicle classes (e.g., buses only, high occupancy vehicles, no trucks, etc.). Part-time shoulders do not have a minimum or maximum design length. The design length of the part-time shoulder can be adjusted to meet desired operational needs and should reflect logical termini conducive to the roadway’s characteristics. The operational period of the part-time shoulder use can be adjusted to meet desired operational needs and should reflect the solution needed to resolve or help resolve congestion for the target vehicles. The implementation of part-time shoulder will require a Design Analysis. This documentation level is explained in more detail later in the chapter.
1430.02 Viability Assessment Although a part-time shoulder can be an effective, low-cost operational enhancement, this managed lane option may not be conducive to all locations or corridors. When considering a part-time shoulder, conduct an assessment of the corridor’s existing infrastructure within the proposed operational limits to ensure that the facility can cost effectively accommodate or be made to accommodate a part-time shoulder operation. Existing physical features such as shoulder widths, vertical clearances, pavement depths, clear zone, barrier locations, interchange ramps and other roadway features can be important considerations that may influence the relative feasibility and costs of the proposed part-time shoulder. This assessment should include the operational parameters, safety performance, possible environmental considerations, and long term operational and maintenance costs of the proposed part-time shoulder. For example, prior to opening part time shoulder maintenance crews are often required to inspect and clear the shoulder of debris that may otherwise prohibit the use of the shoulder. The introduction of part-time shoulder operations has the potential to shift the type and frequency of crashes along the corridor. Include potential mitigation strategies in the viability assessment (see Section 1430.05(2) for more information). Based on factors like these, the viability assessment may conclude that a part-time shoulder is not a feasible or reasonable option due to existing physical features and associated cost implications.

1430.03 Operational Parameters The following operational parameters provide fundamental functional characteristics for any given part-time shoulder:
•
•
•
•
Operational Period - when the part-time shoulder(s) is operable, Static or Dynamic Control - how operation periods are controlled, Vehicular Use Restrictions – which vehicles can or cannot access the part-time shoulder; and, Termini - the beginning and end of the managed lane.
These operational parameters are described in greater detail below and will affect various design elements associated with the managed lane. Coordinate with the Region Traffic Office, Region Management, and any potential local partners that are affected by the proposed managed lane (e.g., transit agency) to establish optimal operational parameters for a potential part-time shoulder.
1430.03(1) Operational Period The operational period is the specified time(s) when the part-time shoulder is active, and vehicles are allowed to access the shoulder. The operational period(s) of a part-time shoulder can be established based on certain times, traffic conditions, levels of congestion, desired operational characteristics, and/or benefits for the facility. The operational period can be statically or dynamically controlled as described below.
1430.03(2) Static or Dynamic Control The part-time shoulder’s operational period can be statically or dynamically controlled. Both static and dynamic part time shoulder’s provide benefits to peak-period congestion and person through-put; however, dynamic control provides enhanced reliability as the part time shoulder can be opened (or remain closed) on-demand in response to real-time levels of congestion or incidents. The selection of static or dynamic control reflects the Region’s desired level flexibility in operational control/responsiveness and ability to invest in infrastructure and associated operational costs. Coordinate with Region Traffic office affected stakeholders when determining a strategy for a part-time shoulder.
1430.03(2)(a) Static Control Static control restricts use of the part-time shoulder to fixed (non-changing) conditions, such as a re-occurring operational period(s) reflecting historically congested peak periods. Other operational attributes such as operational speed and class of vehicles allowed or excluded can also be fixed. Static controls are communicated via static signing strategically placed throughout the part-time shoulder’s corridor. A statically controlled parttime shoulder does not reflect or adjust to changing needs of the roadway or incidents that block the use of the shoulder (e.g., disabled vehicle or snow storage) and may limit the overall efficacy and/or effectiveness.
1430.03(2)(b) Dynamic Control A dynamically controlled part-time shoulder adjusts the operational period, allowable vehicular classifications access and/or operational speeds to reflect the current operational demand. Such systems can also be used in response to an incident (such as a crash) as part of a Region’s Active Transportation Management (ATM) response strategy. A dynamically controlled system will require additional investment into ATM systems, power, hardware, and associated maintenance/operational costs.

Chapter 1430
New Chapter Part-Time Shoulder
1430.03(3) Vehicle Use Restrictions Use of part-time shoulder can be open to all vehicles or limited to certain vehicle classifications and/or occupancies. The geometric design requirements associated with the part-time shoulder are different depending on the vehicle classification allowed to access the managed lane. Therefore, the selection of allowable vehicle classification should take into consideration the part-time shoulder’s operational needs and underlying purpose (e.g., to reduce overall congestion, promote transit ridership, reduce delay, etc.).
1430.03(4) Termini Termini are the beginning and ending points (or limits) of the part-time shoulders. These should be established based on operational needs and physical characteristics of the roadway. Typically, there are trade-offs between the benefits associated with a part-time shoulder and physical constraints already existing in a corridor. For example, a part-time shoulder on a freeway could start at the end of an on-ramp merge or at the end of a drop lane, and the managed lane could end prior to the next off ramp. Consult with the Region Traffic Office, State Patrol HQ & District office, local transit agencies and other local partners to help determine the best apparent termini for the part-time shoulder.
1430.04 Design Criteria Design criteria outlined in the following sections are allowed with a Design Analysis. The underlying design criteria for the Design Manual is provided by AASHTO, which does not include guidance associated with parttime shoulders. During the part-time shoulder’s operational period, the use of the shoulder for the managed lane will result in shoulders and other design elements not meeting minimum AASHTO criteria. Consult with your ASDE for more information.
1430.04(1) Inside or Outside Shoulder Use A part Part-time shoulder can utilize either the outside or inside shoulder on a separated roadway, such as a freeway. Typically, part-time shoulders utilize a roadway’s outside shoulder since the outside shoulder is often wider than the inside shoulder. On the other hand, inside shoulders have less conflicts with interchange ramps. In locations with barrier, an inside shoulder alignment can help a driver feel more comfortable travelling next to a barrier on the left side of the vehicle.

Chapter 1430
New Chapter Part-Time Shoulder
The selection of the most suitable shoulder for use should assess the various benefits and trade-offs between an inside or outside shoulder alignment. Consult with the Region Traffic Office, Region Management and any affected stakeholders when assessing the preferred alignment.
1430.04(2) Existing Shoulder Width During operations, vehicles will be using a facility’s existing shoulder for added capacity or through-put. The available shoulder is comprised of two parts: 1) the part-time shoulder vehicle operation width, and 2) the lateral clearance or distance to edge of pavement. See Exhibit 1430-1. Exhibit 1430-1 Part Time Shoulder Layout [1]
[1] Outside shoulder (right side) alignment shown. Inside shoulder (left side) alignment is allowable. [2] Lateral clearance or distance to edge of pavement when barrier is not present.
1430.04(3) Vehicle Operation Width For part-time shoulders, the vehicle operation width is the area of the part-time shoulder that functions as the traveled way during the operational period. See Exhibit 1430-1. Consult with local transit agencies to ensure adequate width is provided if buses are anticipated to utilize the part-time shoulder.
1430.04(4) Lateral Clearance Lateral clearance is the distance from the vehicle operation width to the edge of pavement or to a roadside object (e.g., concrete barrier, or guardrail) whichever is closer. See Exhibit 1430-1.
1430.04(5) Design Speed The design speed for the part-time shoulder is the maximum operating speed that will be allowed during operations and is another parameter that needs to be determined for part-time shoulder operation. Although this can match the posted speed of the facility, the part-time shoulder’s operating speed is typically slower than posted speed on freeway facilities. Slower operating speeds provide the following advantages: 1. Better accommodate the narrower width more commonly provided by the existing shoulder; and, 2. Diminish potential speed differential between the part-time shoulder and adjacent lane of travel that is usually moving slower or stopped. The design speed will influence the part-time shoulder’s allowable shoulder width, stopping sight distance and other critical design elements. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

[1] A Design Analysis will be needed for shoulder width, lane width and other elements. See Section 1430.04. [2] Minimum width of existing shoulder designated as part time shoulder. [3] Includes vehicle operating width plus lateral clearance or distance to edge of pavement. See Exhibit 1430-1. [4] 13 ft minimum for new construction. When transit buses are allowed to use the part-time shoulder, consider entering into an operational agreement with a local transit agency to help ensure drivers adhere to conditions associated with use of the part-time shoulder. These conditions dictate when buses are allowed to access the shoulder. Such conditions may include operational hours in which transit vehicles may occupy the part-time shoulder and/or the maximum operating speed of the bus and/or speed differential between buses and adjacent traveled lanes. For instance, some parttime shoulder applications have interagency agreements with local transit agencies that allow buses to enter the shoulder when the mainline traffic speed is slower than 35 mph and operate in the part-time shoulder at a speed not greater than 15 mph above the current speed of traffic in the adjacent traveled lane. Such operational agreements can diminish potential operational issues associated with the use of a shoulder next to the lane of traffic.
1430.04(6) Stopping Sight Distance As vehicles using a part-time shoulder occupy the existing shoulder and are inherently closer to roadside features, the presence of barriers and/or roadside objects may adversely affect horizonal and/or vertical stopping sight distance. Drivers may also encounter disabled vehicles or low-profile debris blocking the shoulder, or unauthorized pedestrians in urban areas. Assess the part-time shoulder’s stopping sight distances. A Design Analysis is required for stopping sight distances lower than applicable standards. See Design Manual Chapter 1260 Sight Distance for more information.
1430.04(7) Vertical Clearance Assess the available vertical clearance within the limits of the part-time shoulder to ensure adequate vertical clearance is provided. Per Exhibit 720-3, a Design Analysis will be required at any locations not meeting applicable Design Manual requirements.

New Chapter Part-Time Shoulder
1430.04(8) Drainage For roadways with an enclosed drainage system, drainage structures are typically located along the facilities shoulders. Drainage structures may be slightly recessed which can be problematic for vehicles and/or unable to handle loading associated with a higher volume of traffic. Additionally, shoulders may experience ponding and/or gutter line flows may extend into the part-time shoulder’s operational width. A roadway’s drainage system needs to be assessed for compatibility or possible adjustment when considering a part-time shoulder.
1430.04(9) Pavement Depth The existing shoulder’s pavement structure may not have been designed to handle an increased volume of traffic. Verify that the shoulder’s existing pavement structure depth is suitable for additional loading associated with a part-time shoulder and adjust accordingly. Consult with the Region Materials Engineer for more information about required pavement depth for this use.
1430.04(10) Interchanges and Intersections Interchanges allow traffic to enter and exit freeway facilities. Outside (right side) part-time shoulders at interchanges can introduce potential conflicts between the part-time shoulders through movements and vehicles attempting to use the interchange’s on or off ramps. Similarly, part-time shoulders, on either side, along arterials that cross intersections may introduce potential conflicts with turning movements especially turning movements with dedicated turning movement lanes. If a proposed part-time shoulder will cross on/off ramps or an intersection’s turning movements, consult with the Region Traffic Office to determine if there are any acceptable/effective forms of mitigation.
1430.04(11) Pavement Markings Pavement markings for a part-time shoulder are the same as for a standard roadway shoulder with a few additional considerations to better accommodate the managed lane. Continuous striping running along the edge of pavement or barrier may indicate the part-time shoulder is a general-purpose lane and may not be appropriate in most applications. Consult with Region Traffic Office to determine appropriate pavement markings, document the recommendations and the final design.
1430.04(11)(a) Termini Striping The termini of the part-time shoulder can be delineated with skip striping.

New Chapter Part-Time Shoulder
1430.04(11)(b) Delineating Fixed Objects As part-time shoulders are utilizing the existing shoulder to function as a traveled lane, traffic will be closer to existing barrier or curb. Consider using a supplementary short pavement marking (e.g., limited white stripe) immediately prior to the beginning of the barrier to help alert drivers to fixed object.
1430.04(11)(c) Wide Areas Consider providing hatching at locations where the existing shoulder is wider than the nominal part-time shoulder width. This will help dissuade drivers from occupying or drifting into this additional area.
1430.04(11)(d) Additional Pavement Markings Based on site conditions and/or operational needs, additional pavement markings may be deemed appropriate for use with part-time shoulder. Consult with the Region Traffic Office when assessing appropriate pavement markings.

Chapter 1430
New Chapter Part-Time Shoulder
1430.04(12) Signing Additional signing will be necessary to alert motorist to the presence of the part-time shoulder, provide instruction and manage operations. A dynamically controlled part-time shoulder will require appropriate dynamic signing that reflects changing operational needs. Consult with the Region Traffic Office when assessing appropriate signing.
1430.04(13) Clear zone As vehicles will be occupying the shoulder during the part-time shoulder’s operational period, the part-time shoulder’s functional traveled way is closer to fixed objects or obstructions. Assess the Design Clear Zone for part-time shoulders longer than 400 feet in accordance with Section 1600.02. For intermediate and high-speed facilities, the design speed for a part-time shoulder is typically slower than the roadway’s posted speed. This can result in the part-time shoulder’s clear zone being narrower than the adjacent traveled lane’s clear zone. In these situations, the effective clear zone for the facility is the part-time shoulder’s clear zone or the clear zone of the adjacent through traffic lane, whichever is greater.
1430.04(14) Roadway Cross Slope and Superelevation The roadway’s cross slope or superelevation of the shoulder may be different than the adjacent lane. Verify that the proposed part-time shoulder’s cross slope or superelevation is not more than 2% different than the adjacent lane. See Chapter 1250 for more information.
1430.04(15) Disabled Vehicles and Enforcement Areas The shoulder allows for disabled vehicles and law enforcement to occupy the shoulder under typical operations; however, during the part-time shoulder’s operation period, the shoulder will be unavailable for these critical functions. Where possible and deemed appropriate, provide additional width to accommodate disabled vehicles and law enforcement activities. Consult with law enforcement and maintenance when considering the location and frequency of possible/desirable sites. See Exhibit 1239-2 for more information.
1430.04(16) Rumble Strips Remove existing rumble strips when converting a shoulder to a part-time shoulder. Consult with Region Materials Engineer as to the best method and requirements.
1430.05 Other Considerations 1430.05(1) Environmental Although a part-time shoulder typically utilizes existing pavement, some projects may require minor widening. In either case, environmental considerations need to be assessed and documented appropriately. Environmental issues that are likely to warrant consideration for part-time shoulders utilizing the existing roadway pavement may include, but are not limited to, air quality and noise. Consult with Region Environment staff to ensure the appropriate environmental considerations are fully assessed and documented.

1430.05(2) Safety Considerations Part-time shoulder may contribute to a shift in the type and frequency of crashes along the corridor. Congestion related crashes (e.g., rear ends associated with queueing) may decrease while the risk of crashes associated with driver behavior and geometry may increase. Evaluate the safety performance in accordance with the Safety Analysis guide. Use the WSDOT Safety Analysis Guide Section 7.2.1. Mobility Projects for the analysis.

Metered Shoulder Exhibit 1440-1 Metered Shoulder Layout [1] Exhibit 1440-2 Considerations for Metered Shoulder Utilization [1]
1440.01 General A ramp meter uses a traffic signal at a freeway entrance ramp that allows a measured or regulated amount of traffic to enter the freeway. Drivers are required to stop at the specialized traffic signal before they are allowed to enter the freeway facility, usually being limited to one car per green light. Ramp meters are a relatively lowcost Transportation System Management and Operations (TSMO) alternative for freeways experiencing regular, reoccurring congestion that helps merging traffic enter the facility more efficiently by spreading the merging traffic and introducing gaps. For more information on ramp meters see Section 1360.03(7). Periodically, ramp meter locations have insufficient storage capacity to handle the on-ramp’s traffic volume. In these situations, a metered shoulder may be a viable option that utilizes a shoulder approaching a ramp meter as a temporary additional lane for storage and metered throughput during the ramp meter’s operational period. This can promote the ramp meter’s operational efficiency/flow and help prevent the ramp meter’s queueing from adversely affecting the interchanges overall operations (e.g., ramp meter queue overspill into the ramp terminal intersection and onto local street). A metered shoulder is a low-cost TMSO alternative that utilizes existing infrastructure to add capacity and promote ramp meter operations during peak periods while avoiding a larger capital investment to construct an additional on-ramp lane. Additionally, using the shoulder during peak times allows a narrower ramp and removes a lane merge condition during off-peak times which is most of the time.
1440.02 Design Considerations Design criteria outlined in the following sections are allowed with a Design Analysis. Underlying design criteria for the Design Manual is provided by AASHTO, which does not include guidance associated with part time shoulders. During the metered shoulder’s operational period, the use of the shoulder for the managed lane will result in shoulders and other design elements not meeting minimum AASHTO criteria. Consult with your ASDE for more information.

Chapter 1430
Part-Time Shoulder
1440.02(1) Inside or Outside Shoulder Use A metered shoulder can utilize either inside or outside shoulder of a ramp. Often, metered shoulders are placed on the outside shoulder because the outside shoulders are typically wider and can more readily accommodate the managed lane. Consider the ramp terminal intersection’s layout, driver behavior and potential effects on the ramp’s geometric configuration when selecting which shoulder to use (e.g., if a right turn slip lane or other features tends to direct drivers towards a particular side of the ramp then the opposite shoulder may be more appropriate to use as metered shoulder).
1440.02(2) Shoulder Width During operations, vehicles will be using a facility’s shoulder for added storage capacity. The shoulder therefore comprises both the metered shoulder’s vehicle operation width and lateral clearance or distance to edge of pavement. See Exhibit 1440-1. Exhibit 1440-1 Metered Shoulder Layout [1]

[3] Includes vehicle operating width plus lateral clearance or distance to edge of pavement. [4] Increase vehicle operating width as necessary for design vehicle over tracking on ramps with tight radius, as required.
1440.02(3) Vehicle Operation Width For a metered shoulder, the vehicle operation width is the area of the metered shoulder that functions as the traveled way and is occupied by the vehicle during the ramp meter’s operational period. See Exhibit 1440-1 and Exhibit 1440-2. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1440-2
Chapter 1430
Part-Time Shoulder
1440.02(4) Lateral Clearance For a metered shoulder, the lateral clearance is the distance from the vehicle operation width to a roadside object (e.g., concrete barrier, guardrail). See Exhibit 1440-1 and Exhibit 1440-2. Due to the stop condition associated with the ramp meter, the metered shoulder will only be operated in low-speed conditions. In these situations, drivers are typically more comfortable driving closer to barrier or curb.
1440.02(5) Turning Roadway Width Increase the lane width of the metered shoulder as necessary for over tracking associated with the design vehicle on the ramp’s curve(s) (see Chapter 1240). Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify design.
1440.02(6) Disabled Vehicle and Observation/Enforcement Area The shoulder allows for disabled vehicles and law enforcement to occupy the shoulder under typical operations; however, during the metered shoulder’s operation period the shoulder will be unavailable for these critical functions. Where possible and deemed appropriate, provide additional width to accommodate disable vehicles and law enforcement. See Exhibit 1410-4, Exhibit 1410-5, and Exhibit 1239-2 for more information.
1440.02(7) Signing Additional signing is necessary to appropriately delineate and regulate use of the metered shoulder and should be posted as deemed appropriate. Coordinate with Region Traffic to develop and locate appropriate signing.
1440.02(8) Clear Zone Clear zone is available for use by errant vehicles and includes considerations for the probable distance that an errant vehicle may travel under free flow conditions. Ramp meters are typically utilized during congested periods in which operating speeds are lower than free flow conditions and control the on-ramp’s traffic flow with a stop condition. Therefore, clear zone does not need to be assessed based on vehicles utilizing the metered shoulder, unless otherwise determined by the Region Traffic Engineer. Coordinate with Region Traffic Engineer to assess the potential need for mitigation measures.

1510.01 General Pedestrian travel is a vital transportation mode. Nearly everyone uses it at some point in every trip and it is a critical link to everyday life for many. Designers must be aware of the various physical needs and abilities of pedestrians in order to ensure facilities provide universal access. The pedestrian facilities included in a project are determined during the planning phase based on: access control of the highway; local transportation plans; comprehensive plans and other plans (such as Walk Route Plans developed by schools and school districts); the roadside environment; adherence to the Complete Streets legislation; pedestrian volumes; user age group(s); and the continuity of local walkways along or across the roadway. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) require pedestrian facilities to be designed and constructed so they are readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. This chapter provides accessibility criteria for the design of pedestrian facilities that meet applicable state and federal standards.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1510-1
Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
When developing pedestrian facilities within a limited amount of right of way, designers can be faced with multiple challenges. It is important that designers are trained to understand the ADA accessibility criteria to appropriately balance intersection design with the diversity of pedestrians and other roadway users’ needs. Similar to the roadway infrastructure, pedestrian facilities (and elements) require periodic maintenance in order to prolong the life of the facility and provide continued usability. Title II of the ADA requires that all necessary features be accessible and maintained in operable working condition for use by individuals with disabilities.
1510.02 Policy 1510.02(1) General WSDOT seeks to provide appropriate pedestrian facilities along and across sections of state routes as an integral part of the transportation system. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and WSDOT policy is that bicycle and pedestrian facilities be given full consideration in the planning and design of new construction and reconstruction highway projects, except where bicycle and pedestrian use is prohibited. Use a performancebased approach to select and design the appropriate solution to address the need to accommodate pedestrian uses, including those uses associated with projects that are providing for a Complete Streets facility. See Section 1510.02(5).
1510.02(2) Jurisdiction Proposed projects in public rights of way must address ADA compliance as described in this chapter. (See Section 1510.03 for ADA requirements by project type.) Regardless of which public agency has jurisdiction within the right of way, the public agency that is sponsoring the project is responsible for ensuring ADA compliance is addressed on its project. On all state routes outside of incorporated cities and on those with limited access (full, partial, and modified) within incorporated cities, jurisdiction remains with the state unless modified by a maintenance agreement. In turnback areas where the turnback agreement has not been completed, the state maintains full jurisdiction (see Chapter 510, Chapter 520, and Chapter 530). When project work occurs on a managed access state route inside an incorporated city that has jurisdiction beyond the curbs (RCW 47.24.020), design pedestrian facilities using the city design standards adopted in accordance with RCW 35.78.030 and the most current ADA requirements. Document the coordination with the city in the Basis of Design (BOD). Refer to Chapter 300 for information about the documentation.
1510.02(3) Transition Planning Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA require all public entities to conduct a self-evaluation of their programs and activities, including sidewalks, curb ramps, and other pedestrian facilities and elements within the public right of way, to determine if barriers exist that prevent people with disabilities from being able to access programs, services, and activities. If barriers are identified, agencies with 50 or more employees must develop and implement a transition plan that describes the barriers, the modifications needed, and a schedule for when the needed work will be accomplished. Questions about ADA transition plans should be directed to the ADA compliance team in the Office of Equity & Civil Rights (OECR).

Pedestrian Facilities
1510.02(4) Maintenance (Section Rewritten 2023) Similar to the roadway infrastructure, pedestrian facilities (and elements) require periodic maintenance in order to prolong the life of the facility and provide continued usability. Title II of the ADA requires that all necessary features be accessible and maintained in operable working condition for use by individuals with disabilities. Designers must coordinate with the appropriate maintenance disciplines and consider maintenance input as outlined in Chapter 301.
1510.02(5) Design Performance Metrics – Level of Traffic Stress (New Section 2023) The Level of Traffic Stress performance metric applies to Complete Streets projects. When selecting the crosssection layout and dimensions for a Complete Street, first determine the level of traffic stress (LTS) and Route Directness Index (RDI) in both the existing and design (final) condition. The design goal is to provide for LTS of 1 or 2, and a maximum RDI value of 2. See Chapter 1520 for guidance on Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress (BLTS).
1510.02(5)(a) Pedestrian Level of Traffic Stress (New Section 2023) Use the following tables to determine the existing Pedestrian Level of Traffic Stress (PLTS) for the project vicinity, and to determine the type and dimension of pedestrian facilities and buffers or separations required for the design to achieve PLTS 1 or 2. This is called the Level of Traffic Stress. Note that speed referred to in the tables is posted speed. To achieve the required LTS, provide a separated pedestrian facility where the existing or proposed posted speed is greater than 30 mph. Separation can be provided by adding a physical barrier such as curb or traffic barrier or providing a separate facility for pedestrians such as a shared use path.

1510.02(5)(b) Refined Pedestrian Level of Traffic Stress (New Section 2023) Once the Basic PLTS for a project is determined per the tables in Section 1510.02(5) and a design is selected that meets the required PLTS 1 or 2, examine the additional issues in the list below to consider the need to provide design treatments in addition to those described in the Basic PLTS solutions. Most of the issues in the list do not provide a quantitative basis for examining the existing or proposed (design) condition. Therefore, work with Subject Matter Experts to consider each category listed and determine options for addressing each issue in order to reduce travel stress in the design for bicycles and pedestrians. The refined PLTS is considered complete when a design approach to addressing the travel stress issues listed below have been determined and documented through a collaborative process (normally during pre-design), with the intention that those approaches will be incorporated into the design. The designer documents that the Basic PLTS has now been upgraded to the Refined (and final) PLTS for the design.

1510.02(5)(c) Route Directness Index for Pedestrians (New Section 2023) Route directness is measured in terms of a Route Directness Index (RDI). Major roadways present crossing barriers for active travelers that can impose significant out of direction travel burdens. An RDI of one means direct travel is possible. An RDI of 2 means the traveler must go twice the line-of-sight distance to reach a destination because of a lack of crossing opportunities (or because an available crossing is high LTS and/or imposes undo delay). Research shows that pedestrians are unwilling to travel far out of direction to reach a destination. RDI’s greater than 2 strongly reduce the utility of active trips by increasing the travel time, physical effort, and weather exposure a traveler experiences. A minimum RDI threshold value of 2 for state routes is proposed in the WSDOT Active Transportation Plan. While this threshold for RDI has been established in the Active Transportation Plan, the process for evaluating it is still in development. In the meantime, consult Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) on the best approach to incorporating RDI concepts into the project design.

1510.03 ADA Requirements by Project Type Wherever pedestrian facilities are intended to be a part of the transportation facility, federal regulations (28 CFR Part 35) require that those pedestrian facilities meet ADA guidelines. All new construction or alteration of existing transportation facilities must be designed and constructed to be accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. FHWA is one of the federal agencies designated by the Department of Justice to ensure compliance with the ADA for transportation projects.
1510.03(1) New Construction Projects New construction projects address the construction of a new roadway, interchange, or other transportation facility where none existed before. For these projects, pedestrians’ needs are assessed and included in the project. All pedestrian facilities included in these projects must fully meet the accessibility criteria when built.
1510.03(2) Alteration Projects Any project that affects or could affect the usability of a pedestrian facility is classified as an alteration project. Alteration projects include, but are not limited to, renovation; rehabilitation; reconstruction; historic restoration; resurfacing of circulation paths or vehicular ways; and changes or rearrangement of structural parts or elements of a facility. Where existing elements or spaces are altered, each altered element or space within the limits of the project shall comply with the applicable accessibility requirements to the maximum extent feasible. The following are some examples of project types that are classified as alteration projects and can potentially trigger a variety of ADA requirements:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
HMA overlay or inlay Traffic signal installation or retrofit Roadway widening Realignment of a roadway (vertical or horizontal) Sidewalk improvements PCCP panel repair/replacement Bridge replacement Raised channelization
The following are not considered alterations:
•
•
•
Spot pavement repair Liquid-asphalt sealing, chip seal (BST), or crack sealing Lane restriping that does not alter the usability of the shoulder
If there is uncertainty as to whether a project meets the definition of an alteration project, consult with the Regional ADA Liaison. The following apply to alteration projects:
•
•
All new pedestrian facilities included in an alteration project that are put in place within an existing developed right of way must meet applicable accessibility requirements to the maximum extent feasible. All existing pedestrian facilities disturbed by construction of an alteration project must be replaced. The replacement facilities must meet applicable accessibility requirements to the maximum extent feasible.

Pedestrian Facilities
An alteration project shall not decrease or have the effect of decreasing the accessibility of a pedestrian facility or an accessible connection to an adjacent building or site below the ADA accessibility requirements in effect at the time of the alteration. Within the construction impact zone of an alteration project, any existing connection from a pedestrian access route to a crosswalk (marked or unmarked) that is missing a required curb ramp must have a curb ramp installed that meets applicable accessibility requirements to the maximum extent feasible. (See Section 1510.08(2) for curb ramp accessibility criteria.) A crosswalk served by a curb ramp must also have an existing curb ramp in place on the receiving end unless there is no curb or sidewalk on that end of the crosswalk (RCW 35.68.075). If there is no existing curb ramp in place on the receiving end, an accessible curb ramp must be provided. This requirement must be met regardless of whether the receiving end of the crosswalk is located within the project’s limits. Within the construction impact zone of an alteration project, evaluate all existing curb ramps to determine whether curb ramp design elements meet the accessibility criteria. (See Section 1510.08(2) for curb ramp accessibility criteria.) Modify existing curb ramps that do not meet the accessibility criteria to meet applicable accessibility requirements to the maximum extent feasible. This may also trigger modification of other adjacent pedestrian facilities to incorporate transitional segments in order to ensure specific elements of a curb ramp will meet the accessibility criteria. Within the construction impact zone of an alteration project that includes hot mix asphalt overlay (or inlay) of an existing roadway and does not include reconstruction, realignment, or widening of the roadway, evaluate all existing marked and unmarked crosswalks. (See Section 1510.09(2) for crosswalk accessibility criteria.) If it is not possible to meet the applicable accessibility requirements for crosswalks, document this in the DDP. Within the construction impact zone of an alteration project that includes reconstruction, realignment, or widening of the roadway, evaluate all existing crosswalks (marked or unmarked) to determine whether crosswalk design elements meet the accessibility criteria. (See Section 1510.09(2) for crosswalk accessibility criteria.) Modify crosswalk slopes to meet the applicable accessibility requirements to the maximum extent feasible.
It may not always be possible to fully meet the applicable accessibility requirements during alterations of existing facilities. If such a situation is encountered, consult with the Regional ADA Liaison to develop a workable solution to meet the accessibility requirements to the maximum extent feasible. Cost is not to be used as a justification for not meeting the accessibility criteria. Physical terrain or site conditions that would require structural impacts, environmental impacts, or unacceptable impacts to the community in order to achieve full compliance with the accessibility criteria are some of the factors that can be used to determine that the maximum extent feasible is achieved. If it is determined to be virtually impossible to meet the accessibility criteria for an element, document the decision in one of the following ways, as applicable:
•
Within the construction impact zone of an alteration project that does not include reconstruction, realignment, or widening of the roadway, document the following deficient elements in the DDP: o Perpendicular curb ramp or parallel curb ramp landing cross slope that is constrained by the existing roadway gutter profile and exceeds 2%, but is less than or equal to 5%, that cannot be constructed to fully meet applicable accessibility requirements.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1510-8
Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
o
•
Flared side of a perpendicular curb ramp that is constrained by the existing roadway gutter profile and has a slope that exceeds 10%, but is less than or equal to 16.7%, that cannot be constructed to fully meet applicable accessibility requirements. For any deficient element that does not match the preceding description, document the decision via a stamped and signed Maximum Extent Feasible (MEF) document. The MEF document will be reviewed by the appropriate Assistant State Design Engineer (ASDE) and the Headquarters (HQ) ADA Compliance Manager. If acceptable, the MEF document will be approved and included in the DDP.
1510.03(2)(a) Requirements for Crossings with Pedestrian Pushbuttons Coordinate sidewalk and curb ramp work with signal system work so that signal poles with pedestrian equipment meet accessibility requirements for APS pushbuttons to the maximum extent feasible. See Section 1510.11 for additional information on pedestrian pushbutton accessibility. For existing signal systems only, the work required for each signal system location is determined as follows: 1. If no sidewalk ramp work is being performed at a signal system location, no work is required for that signal system as part of the project. 2. If any ramp is being reconstructed at a signal system location, and the traffic signal system is owned by WSDOT, then all poles with pedestrian equipment shall be made accessible for the entire traffic signal system at that location. This may require new or relocated poles, as well as additional ramp and sidewalk work beyond that previously described in Section 1510.03(2). 3. If any ramp is being reconstructed at a signal system location, and the traffic signal system is owned by another agency, only poles with pedestrian pushbuttons serving a crossing served by a ramp that is being reconstructed are required to be made accessible as part of the project. This may require reconstruction of the ramps, landings, or sidewalk areas at both ends of the crossing. The remaining crossings and poles may be addressed if the owning agency wishes to provide funding for the additional work. If APS pushbuttons are not being installed as part of a project, any revised pole locations shall be designed to meet accessibility requirements with a conventional pushbutton installed and with an APS pushbutton installed, so that the pole does not have to be relocated when the conventional pushbutton is replaced with an APS pushbutton. Typically a location that is accessible with an APS pushbutton installed will be accessible with a conventional pushbutton installed, but verification is required. Locations where these requirements cannot be fully met shall follow the procedures for maximum extent feasible documentation as previously described.
1510.04 Pedestrian Circulation Paths Pedestrian Circulation Paths (PCP) are prepared exterior or interior ways of passage provided for pedestrian travel. They include independent walkways, sidewalks, shared-use paths, and other types of pedestrian facilities. Pedestrian circulation paths can either be immediately adjacent to streets and highways or separated from them by a buffer. PCPs that are continuous pedestrians to connect to destinations and do not require them to make multiple street crossings due to incomplete facilities. Examples of PCP are shown in Exhibit 1510-5. When the PCP is located behind guardrail, address protruding bolts. Installing a rub rail or a “W-beam” guardrail on the pedestrian side of the posts can mitigate potential snagging and also serve as a guide for sight-impaired pedestrians.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1510-9
Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
Provide a smooth finish to vertical surfaces adjacent to a PCP to mitigate potential snagging or abrasive injuries from accidental contact with the surface. Where adjacent walkway segments diverge, such as can occur if a parallel curb ramp does not occupy the entire width of a PCP, any resulting drop-offs must be protected to prevent trips or falls. When relocation of utility poles and other fixtures is necessary for a project, determine the impact of their new location on all PCP. Look for opportunities to relocate obstructions, such as existing utility objects, away from the PCP. Exhibit 1510-5 Pedestrian Circulation Paths
Highway shoulders are an extension of the roadway and are not typically considered pedestrian facilities. Pedestrians are allowed to use many state highways. Although pedestrians are allowed to travel along the shoulder in these cases, its main purpose is to provide an area for disabled vehicles, a recovery area for errant vehicles, and positive drainage away from the roadway. Shoulders may serve as a pedestrian facility when sidewalks are not provided. If pedestrian generators, such as bus stops, are present and pedestrian usage is evident, a 4-foot-wide paved shoulder is adequate. Note that detectable warning surfaces should not be installed where a sidewalk ends and pedestrians are routed onto a shoulder since the shoulder is not a vehicular traveled way. Where pedestrian traffic is evident, consider a separate PCP during the planning and programming of the project. Consult with the State Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinator.
1510.04(1) Accessibility Criteria for Pedestrian Circulation Paths The following criteria apply across the entire width of the PCP, not just within the pedestrian access route.
1510.04(1)(a) Vertical Clearance
•
•
The minimum vertical clearance for objects that protrude into or overhang a pedestrian circulation path is 80 inches. If the minimum vertical clearance cannot be provided, railings or other barriers shall be provided. The leading bottom edge of the railing or barrier shall be located 27 inches maximum above the finished surface for cane detection.
Note: Per the MUTCD, the vertical clearance to the bottom of signs is 7 feet (84 inches.)
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
1510.04(1)(b) Horizontal Encroachment
•
Protruding objects on PCPs shall not reduce the clear width of the pedestrian access route to less than 4 feet, exclusive of the curb.
Note: If an object must protrude farther than 4 inches into a PCP at a height that is greater than 27 inches and less than 80 inches above the finished surface, then it must be equipped with a warning device that is detectable by a vision-impaired person who navigates with a cane. The minimum clear width of the PAR must still be provided.
1510.04(1)(c) Post-Mounted Objects
•
Objects mounted on posts, at a height that is greater than 27 inches and less than 80 inches above the finished surface, shall not protrude more than 4 inches into a pedestrian circulation path.
Note: If an object must protrude farther than 4 inches into a pedestrian circulation path at a height that is greater than 27 inches and less than 80 inches above the finished surface, then it must be equipped with a warning device that is detectable by a vision-impaired person who navigates with a cane. The minimum clear width of the pedestrian access route must still be provided.
•
Where a sign or other obstruction on a pedestrian circulation path is mounted on multiple posts, and the clear distance between the posts is greater than 12 inches, the lowest edge of the sign or obstruction shall be either 27 inches maximum or 80 inches minimum above the finished surface.
1510.05 Pedestrian Access Routes All PCPs are required to contain a continuous Pedestrian Access Route (PAR) (see Exhibit 1510-6) that connects to all adjacent pedestrian facilities, elements, and spaces that are required to be accessible. PARs consist of one or more of the following pedestrian facilities: walkways/sidewalks, crosswalks, curb ramps (excluding flares), landings, pedestrian overpasses/underpasses, access ramps, elevators, and platform lifts.

1510.05(1) Accessibility Criteria for Pedestrian Access Routes 1510.05(1)(a) Clear Width The minimum continuous and unobstructed clear width of a Pedestrian Access Route (PAR) within a Pedestrian Circulation Path (PCP) shall be 4 feet, exclusive of the width of the curb. PARs that are less than 5 feet in clear width, exclusive of the width of the curb, shall provide passing spaces at intervals no farther apart than 200 feet. Passing spaces shall be at least 5 feet wide, for a minimum distance of 5 feet. PARs that are less than 5 feet in clear width, exclusive of the width of the curb, shall provide passing spaces at intervals no farther apart than 200 feet. Passing spaces shall be 5 feet wide minimum, for a minimum distance of 5 feet. Exhibit 1510-7 Obstructed Pedestrian Access Route
Provide wheel stops or a wider sidewalk to address encroachments into the PAR.
1510.05(1)(b) Cross Slope and Grade The cross slope of a PAR shall be 2% maximum. Note: It is recommended that cross slopes be designed to be less than the allowed maximum to allow for some tolerance in construction. For example: design for a maximum 1.5% cross slope (rather than 2% maximum). Exceptions: 1. Midblock crosswalks – The cross slope of the crosswalk and any connected curb ramp is permitted to match street or highway grade. 2. Crosswalks without stop sign control – The cross slope of the crosswalk can be up to 5% maximum. Where a PAR is contained within the highway right of way, its grade shall not exceed the general grade established for the adjacent roadway. Exception: The maximum grade in a crosswalk (marked or unmarked) is 5%, measured parallel to the direction of pedestrian travel in the crosswalk. Where a PAR is not contained within the highway right of way, the maximum running slope allowed is 5% unless designed as an access ramp. (See Section 1510.15(2) for access ramp accessibility criteria.) For additional criteria when a PAR is supported by a structure, see Section 1510.14.

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
1510.05(1)(c) Surface The surface of the PAR shall be firm, stable, and slip resistant. Use hard surfaces like cement concrete or asphalt concrete. Crushed gravel and other non-pavement surfaces are not considered a firm or stable surface. Vertical alignment shall be planar within curb ramps, landings, and gutter areas within the PAR and within clear spaces for accessible pedestrian signals, street furniture, and operable parts. Grade breaks shall be flush. Surface discontinuities (see Exhibit 1510-8 and Exhibit 1510-9) on existing surfaces in the pedestrian access route (such as at the joints of settled or upheaved sidewalk panels) may not exceed ½ inch maximum. Vertical discontinuities between ¼ inch and ½ inch maximum shall be beveled at 2H:1V or flatter. Apply the bevel across the entire level change. Exception: No surface discontinuity is allowed at the connection between an existing curb ramp or landing and the gutter. This grade break must be flush. Exhibit 1510-8 Beveling Options

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
Exhibit 1510-9 Surface Discontinuities (Noncompliant)
Gratings, access covers, utility objects, and other appurtenances shall not be located on curb ramps, landings, or gutters within the PAR. Locate gratings, access covers, utility objects, and other appurtenances outside the PAR on walkways and sidewalks. Where this is not possible, ensure covers, grates, and lids are designed to be slip resistant and are installed flush with the surrounding surface (see the Standard Plans).
1510.05(1)(d) Horizontal Openings Any sidewalk joints or gratings that are in the PAR shall not permit passage of a sphere more than ½ inch in diameter. Elongated openings shall be placed so that the long dimension is perpendicular to the dominant direction of travel. Openings for wheel flanges at pedestrian crossings of nonfreight rail track shall be 2½ inches maximum (3 inches maximum for freight rail track). For additional requirements when a PAR crosses a railroad, see Section 1510.13.
1510.06 Linear Pedestrian Facilities (New Section 2023) Pedestrian facilities refer to constructed features built to accommodate pedestrian travel that run generally along the same direction as the vehicle route or street. They typically serve as the Pedestrian Circulation Path (See Section 1510.04 for PCP accessibility criteria). Sidewalks, at-grade walkways with biofiltration swale, and shared-use paths are three standard types of linear pedestrian facilities. Shared-use paths may have “trail” in their names, but they are not trails. Trails, (Exp. the Pacific Crest Trail), are intended to provide and support recreational experiences and do not provide the necessary infrastructure for ADA accessibility. Parts of trails might be accessible, but trails don't need to be accessible. Trails do not usually have a firm, stable, or slip resistant surfaces, nor do they usually have accessible cross slopes, or running slopes. See Section 1710.05(17) Trails. Shoulders may provide pedestrian access, but because of the nature of the shared use with vehicles, they are not considered dedicated pedestrian facilities.

Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian facilities (sidewalks and shared-use paths) are selected to provide the required level of traffic stress as well as connections to a network of facilities in order to access travel destinations. In addition to LTS, vehicle speed, volume, and number of travel lanes are also indicators that, in combination with input from subject matter experts, help inform the selection of facility type. The following table provides a summary of these factors and likely candidates for facilities to consider in consultation with the project advisory committee and subject matter experts.

1510.07 Sidewalks (Section Rewritten 2023) A sidewalk is an independent constructed facility along a highway, road, or street intended for use by pedestrians, which is usually elevated above the vehicle travelled way, and may or may not include a buffer. Sidewalks are one type of Pedestrian Circulation Path (PCP). (See Section 1510.04 for PCP accessibility criteria.) Plan the design of sidewalks carefully to include a PAR that provides universal access. (See Section 1510.05 for PAR accessibility criteria.) Sidewalk design elements are found in Exhibit 1510-13 and details for raised sidewalks are shown in the Standard Plans. Wherever appropriate, make sidewalks continuous and provide access to side streets. TA buffer is a space between the edge of the edge of pavement or back of curb and sidewalk that separates vehicle and pedestrian traffic and may be used to reduce the Pedestrian Level of Traffic Stress (PLTS) of the facility. Buffers often contain plantings, alternative type pavement, drainage treatments, and/or utilities.

1510.07(1) Designing Sidewalks and Buffers When designing sidewalks, first determine the required sidewalk and buffer widths to achieve the required level of traffic stress (LTS) (see Section 1510.02(5)). Plan the design of sidewalks to include a Pedestrian Circulation Path (PCP) (see Section 1510.05) and a Pedestrian Access Route (see Section 1510.05) enabling universal access. (See Section 1510.05 for PAR accessibility criteria.) Sidewalk design elements are found in Exhibit 1510-13 and details for raised sidewalks are shown in Standard Plans.

* If the dimensions shown exceed the dimensions given by the PLTS tables, then use the values in the PLTS table as the minimum allowable dimensions. The WSDOT minimum sidewalk width is 5 feet (excluding the curb), but providing wider sidewalks is encouraged. Wider sidewalks are desirable on major arterials, in central business districts, and along parks, schools, and other major pedestrian generators. See Exhibit 1510-2. When sidewalks abut storefronts, provide additional width to accommodate window-shoppers and to avoid conflicts with opening doors and pedestrians entering or leaving the buildings. When a buffer (vegetated as well as alternate pavement) is provided, the buffer should be at least 3 feet wide (excluding the curb). Document the decision to reduce a buffer width to less than 3 feet in the DDP. If trees or shrubs are included in a buffer, coordinate with the region or HQ Landscape Architect. Follow Design Clear Zone (see Chapter 1600) and Sight Distance (see Chapter 1260). Design subsurface infrastructure (such as structural soils) and select plants whose root systems do not cause sidewalks to buckle or heave. Coordinate buffer planting with maintenance personnel. Where possible, strive to accommodate snow storage while keeping the pedestrian route free of snow accumulation. Make sure maintenance access is not obstructed. Shoulders, bike lanes, and on-street parking are not considered buffers, but they do offer the advantage of further separation between vehicles and pedestrians.

Notes: If vertical drop is within the Design Clear Zone and the posted speed is > 35 mph, then barrier may be needed (see Chapter 1600). If vertical drop is > 2 feet 6 inches and barrier is not needed, then railing is indicated. If vertical drop is < 2 feet 6 inches and barrier is not needed, then a 4-inch curb at back of sidewalk is adequate. General: See the Standard Plan F-30.10 for details on slopes at back of sidewalk. See Section 1239.03 for selecting side slopes. Sidewalks may be sloped away from the roadway for stormwater treatment (see the Highway Runoff Manual).

1510.07(2) Sidewalks at Driveways Provide a Pedestrian Access Route (PAR) where driveways intersect a Pedestrian Circulation Path (PCP) (see Exhibit 1510-14). The Standard Plan F-80.10 shows details of driveway designs that provide a PAR. (See Section 1510.04 and Section 1510.05 for accessibility criteria.) When a driveway is signalized as part of an intersection, contact the Region ADA Liaison for guidance. Exhibit 1510-14 Typical Driveways
There are several types of driveway approach designs such as: drop curb (left picture), using a buffer (center picture), and a radius turnout (right picture).

Exhibit 1510-15 Driveway Approach Designs (New Exhibit 2023)
Sidewalks behind the buffer zone are the preferred design. This places the driveway’s grade transition within a buffer so the sidewalk path can remain free of grade changes along its course.
Wide sidewalks can function similar to sidewalks with buffers if they have sufficient room to accommodate a driveway ramp and also allow a full PAR width.
Where buffers or wide sidewalks can’t be provided, the sidewalk alignment can go around the sloped part of the driveway to maintain the running slope and the cross slope, although the deviation from the straight path is less convenient for pedestrians. Verify that the widths of the diagonal parts are at least as wide as the sidewalk.
Depressed sidewalks are the least desirable option as the pedestrian needs walk down and then back up. This design may be necessary in some locations due to local ordinances, or rightof-way or grade constraints.

1510.07(2)(a) Radius Turnout Driveways (New Section 2023) Driveways serving larger developments and commercial centers frequently function more like roadway intersections in terms of volume and complexity of turning movements. The curbs often turn in to the adjacent parcel at these locations similar to roadway intersections. Sidewalks intersecting radius turnout driveways must either provide a raised crosswalk (preferred) or descend to the level of the driveway via a curb ramp (See Section 1510.04 and Section 1510.05 for accessibility criteria). When a driveway is signalized as part of an intersection, contact the Region ADA Liaison for guidance. The characteristics of a radius turnout driveway may increase the PLTS of the PAR at that location, even if the PLTS along the rest of the route is low. Consult with the project advisory team to determine if an intersection crossing treatment (e.g., RRFBs, protection islands, etc.) may be used to maintain a low LTS at these locations.
1510.07(3) Shared-Use Paths (New Section 2023) A shared-use path is a pedestrian facility designed for both transportation and recreation purposes and are used by pedestrians, bicyclists, skaters, equestrians, and other users. See Chapter 1515 for more information about designing shared-use paths.
1510.07(4) Shoulders (New Section 2023) Highway shoulders are not pedestrian facilities; they are an extension of the roadway cross section with several functions (see exhibit 1239-2). Shoulders are not usually considered accessible due to typical cross slopes and profile grades; however, pedestrians can use shoulders where they’re not explicitly restricted.
1510.08 Curb Ramps Curb ramps provide an accessible connection from a raised sidewalk down to the roadway surface. A curb ramp, or combination of curb ramps, is required to connect PAR to crosswalks (marked or unmarked) where curbs and sidewalks are present, except where pedestrian crossing is prohibited. (See Section 1510.09(2)(c) for guidance on closed crossings and Exhibit 1510-25 for an example.) For new construction projects, provide a curb ramp oriented in each direction of pedestrian travel within the width of the crosswalk it serves. For alteration projects, a curb ramp oriented in each direction of pedestrian travel within the width of the crosswalk it serves is desirable. Every curb ramp must have a curb ramp at the other end of the crosswalk it serves unless there is no curb or sidewalk on that side (RCW 35.68.075). Curb ramps are also required at midblock crossings where curbs and sidewalks are present.
1510.08(1) Types of Curb Ramps Different types of curb ramps can be used: perpendicular, parallel, and combination. Carefully analyze and take into consideration drainage patterns, especially when designing a parallel or combination curb ramp installation.

1510.08(1)(a) Perpendicular Curb Ramp Perpendicular curb ramps (see Exhibit 1510-16 and Exhibit 1510-17) are aligned to cut through the curb and meet the gutter grade break at a right angle. The landing is to be located at the top of the curb ramp.
i Advantages
•
•
•
•
Having the path of travel aligned to cross the gutter grade break at a right angle facilitates usage by individuals with mobility devices. The height of the ramp run relative to the gutter elevation may facilitate drainage. The height of the ramp run relative to the gutter elevation discourages vehicular traffic from cutting across the corner. On small-radius corners, the ramp alignment may be more closely aligned with the alignment of the crosswalk markings, which facilitates direction finding for the visually impaired.
ii Disadvantages
•
•
•
The ramp run and landing might not fit within available right of way. On small-radius corners, the flares may not fit between closely spaced perpendicular curb ramps. On larger-radius corners, there will be less facilitation of direction finding for the visually impaired due to the requirement that the path of travel cross the gutter grade break at a right angle.

1510.08(1)(b) Parallel Curb Ramp Parallel curb ramps (see Exhibit 1510-18 and Exhibit 1510-19) are aligned with their running slope in line with the direction of sidewalk travel, parallel to the curb. The landing is located at the bottom of the curb ramp.
i Advantages
•
•
•
Requires minimal right of way. Allows ramps to be extended to reduce ramp grade within available right of way. Provides edges on the side of the ramp that are detectable to vision-impaired pedestrians who navigate with a cane.
ii Disadvantages
•
•
Depending on the style of parallel curb ramp, pedestrian through traffic on the sidewalk may need to negotiate two ramp grades instead of one, possibly making it more difficult to traverse for some. The installation of additional drainage features in the upstream gutter line may be necessary to prevent the accumulation of water or debris in the landing at the bottom of the ramp.

1510.08(1)(c) Combination Curb Ramp Combination curb ramps (see Exhibit 1510-20) combine the use of perpendicular and parallel types of curb ramps. Landings may be shared by multiple ramps in this application. Buffer areas and pedestrian curbing that define the pedestrian path of travel are inherent design elements for this type of curb ramp.
i Advantages
•
•
•
•
•
Allows the elevation difference between the sidewalk and the gutter line to be transitioned with multiple ramps. This can help achieve compliant ramp running slopes. Provides additional locations in the gutter line along the radius where drainage structures can be placed outside the pedestrian access route due to the well-defined pedestrian paths of travel. Can be constructed within available right of way when the right of way boundary is located at the back of the existing sidewalk, provided sufficient buffer width is available on the roadway side of the sidewalk. Provides a way to avoid the relocation of existing features such as utility poles, fire hydrants, and signal poles by incorporating those features into the buffer areas. The pedestrian curbing that defines the buffer areas and forms the curb returns for the perpendicular ramp connections facilitates direction finding for a vision-impaired person who navigates with a cane.
ii Disadvantages
•
•
Has a higher construction cost than other curb ramp types due to extensive use of curbing and a larger footprint. Due to generally flatter ramp grades and multi-tiered ramp elements, inadequate drainage and accumulatio
