irst 15 columns in the Risk Management Plan spreadsheet are devoted to IDENTIFY and ANALYZE: the first pillar of risk management (see Chapter 1). The remaining columns (16 thru 25) are devoted to the second pillar of risk management:
RESPONSE, MONITOR, and CONTROL.
In Chapter 5, we reviewed in some detail risk response actions; in this chapter, we follow up and follow through with monitoring and control. The way we “monitor and control” risk is to regularly review the effectiveness of the response. Are the response actions working? Are things getting better? Are we more confident about our ability to meet project objectives after the response actions have been implemented?
In effect, response, monitor, and control are natural components of our day-to-day project management activities (e.g., communicate with the project team and ascertain how things are going; make note in the Risk Management Plan and document the results).
Notice that Exhibit 6-1 lists only 5 risks. Most will agree this is not too many to manage, but is it enough to make a difference in our project? The answer is a resounding YES, and it is demonstrated in the example provided. Exhibit 6-4 depicts the bottom of the
RMP spreadsheet under column 11; notice that for these 5 risks, there is an expected value of $7.1M.
It should also be recognized that this project identified over 50 risks, 23 of which were deemed significant enough to warrant inclusion in the quantitative risk analysis model.
These 5 emerged as the top-ranked risks after the analysis and provided the Project
Manager a prioritized list of risks to manage. The other 40+ risks were not simply ignored; they provided “issues awareness” for various specialty groups and were dealt with as each specialty group deemed appropriate for relevant risks. These additional risks also acted as a “watch list” for the project.

Exhibit 6-5 depicts a performance measure for the effectiveness of risk management on this project.
Exhibit 6-5 Performance Measure of Risk Management for This Project
When reporting on the risk management efforts for this project, we can summarize as follows:
The total dollar amount planned for response actions was $0.6M, to achieve reduced project risk exposure by an estimated $3.8M (expected value of risk reduction). After implementing the response actions, we found the total cost of the response actions were $0.7M, which avoided an estimated $3.7M in project costs.
This example illustrates an excellent return on the dollar for risk management efforts.
Other benefits, less quantifiable, included: • ! Improved communication among team members and externally to stakeholders and the public. • ! Identified areas of concern for each specialty group as it helped develop the risk register during risk elicitation. • ! Greater confidence by the Project Manager and project team during project ! development. ! • ! Fewer surprises as upper management was informed of the issues. • ! More informed decision making, due to information gleaned from the overall risk workshop and risk management effort. !

Project Risk Management Plan-Example &
General
A project Risk Management Plan describes how a project team will incorporate the risk management process into its Project Management Plan. Particular emphasis should be given to how a team will respond to risks and monitor and control risk throughout the life of the project.
The example in Exhibit 7-1 offers an approach to developing a detailed Project Risk
Management Plan document. The example presents an approach and is a starting point.
Project teams must tailor their document to meet the needs of their project.

7-2
Project Risk Management Plan1
The process to: develop and document an organized, comprehensive, and interactive risk management strategy; determine the methods to be used to execute a risk management strategy; and plan for adequate resources. The project RMP may be specific in some areas and general in others. The key to this tool is its scalability. Every project should have a formal RMP, but the level of detail varies with project complexity. 7-2.1 What is a Project Risk Management Plan?
A document that gives a summary of the project and outlines the risk management approach.
The RMP employed will vary based on the complexity of the project, but most project
RMPs should include an outline similar to the following: 1. Introduction 2. Summary 3. Definitions 1 4. Organization and roles 5. Risk management strategy/approach 6. Risk identification 7. Risk assessment and analysis 8. Risk Response actions/allocations 9. Risk monitoring and control

Project Risk Management Plan-Example 7-2.2 Why Use a Project Risk Management Plan? &
It explains how a Project Manager and project team manages risk for their project. It provides guidance and requirements, and serves as a communication tool for those who wish to be informed of a project’s risk management approach. The plan formalizes the ideas presented during the risk management process and may clarify some of the assumptions the project team has regarding the risk management process. 7-2.3 What Does a Project Risk Management Plan Do?
It provides specific guidance for the project team members in all steps of the risk management process for their project. The RMP documents the processes to use throughout the project for identifying, assessing, and managing risk. 7-2.4 When Should You Develop and Use a Project Risk Management Plan?
The formal plan should be developed during the planning and scoping process and updated during subsequent project development phases (see Exhibit 7-2). 7-2.5 How Do You Use a Project Risk Management Plan?
The RMP is developed early in the project by collaboration with as many members of the team as possible. It should be consulted and revised throughout the project development process to guide the project through to completion.

Description
Cost Risk Assessment is an integral element of project risk management at WSDOT, and quantifies, within a reasonable range, the cost and schedule to complete a project. We will identify, assess, and evaluate risk that could impact cost and/or schedule during project delivery.
PM.04.20
CRA
Cost Risk Assessment (CRA) is a workshop process similar to, but less
Workshop intense than, CEVP®. The CRA workshop for this project is planned post-workshop activities are also included in the project schedule.
Note: Project teams add tasks, as appropriate, for their risk management activities. 3. Risk management is an agenda item at regularly scheduled project meetings.
Risk management is included as an agenda item on our monthly project meetings and is the number one agenda item each quarter. 4. Risk management expectations are communicated to the project team.
During Initiate and Align, Plan the Work, and Endorse the Plan, risk management has been communicated as an item of work for this project. Specifically, it is included in the Team Mission/Assignment and in our Roles and Responsibilities. 5. Risk are managed, documented, and reported.
Incorporated into the project schedule and monthly meetings is an item for reporting on status of risk response actions. In addition, this team will use the Risk
Management Plan spreadsheet for summarizing and tracking risk response action efforts for significant risks.
This project team is committed to aggressively and proactively manage risk. Project risk management is at the heart of project management and is an ongoing activity throughout the life of the project. The two pillars of risk management are embraced and responses to identified risks will be implemented and tracked.

Page 7-5 Project Risk Management Plan-Example
Chapter 7 7-3.2 Identify Risk Events
The project team will identify risks and build a risk register early in project development.
The Risk Manager will maintain the risk register in anticipation of the risk assessment workshops. The WSDOT Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS), provided in Chapter 2, is used for organizing risks, and for monitor, tracking and reporting on risk status.
An example of how to use the RBS is provided in Exhibit 7-3.
Exhibit 7-3 How to Use a Risk Breakdown Structure (Example) 7-3.3 Qualitative Risk Analysis
Initial analysis of risks will begin with a qualitative assessment; see Chapter 3.
Page 7-6 Chapter 7
Project Risk Management Plan-Example

7-3.4 Quantitative Risk Analysis
Quantitative analysis of risks will begin with our CRA workshop in January__________; see Chapter 4 for more detail on quantitative analysis. 7-4
Second Pillar of Risk Management (Respond, Monitor, and Control) 7-4.1 Risk Response Planning2
The project team3 is committed makes use of actionable information from risk identification and analysis.
Response actions will be developed and implemented promptly following identification and analysis. Risks have a shelf life, and Risk Management Plans can become stale if not monitored and updated regularly. We are committed to making use of information when it is fresh and keeping our Project Management Plans and Risk Management Plans up to date so they do not lapse into irrelevance because they have become outdated and obsolete.
Chapter 5 describes response actions for threats and opportunities. The project work plan, including the schedule and resource assignment, establishes points at which response actions to identified risks will be implemented, including immediately following the CRA workshop for this project. In addition, the members of this project team are reminded to be vigilant regarding risk for this project and to identify potential risk events as they think of them, so they can respond appropriately to risks encountered. 7-4.1.1 Residual Risks and Responses (primary and secondary risks)
As a project develops, its risk profile will change. Risks are identified, and response actions are implemented, which changes the nature of the project risk profile and new risks are identified. During risk identification, we identify risk events. The first time this is accomplished, it constitutes a list of primary risks; as actions are taken, secondary risks can emerge as a result of implementing the treatment response to the primary risk.
If it is possible, secondary risks should be dealt with as part of the primary risk response action. When developing our response actions, we will be vigilant in considering the ramifications of the response actions. We will take measures to include strategies that deal with the primary risk as well as secondary risks and endeavor to minimize or eliminate residual risk as part of risk response efforts. 7-4.2 Risk Monitoring and Control
Monitoring and control is not complete unless communication has occurred.
COMMUNICATION is the lynch-pin of effective project management and risk management.

Purpose
This document establishes consistency in the practice of risk-based estimating at the
Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and includes guidance for: project teams, Risk Leads, Cost Leads, region CRA Coordinators, and subject matter experts (SMEs). The Cost Risk Estimating Management (CREM) Unit, part of WSDOT’s
Strategic Analysis and Estimating Office (SAEO), delivers risk-based estimating workshops for the state. Projects vary in terms of size, location, and complexity; the process can be tailored to the needs of the project. The workshops are accomplished with the committed and diligent work and contributions of our partners in the consulting community and WSDOT staff who contributed to the development of these guidelines.
Three questions are fundamental to the search for a more accurate estimate on projects: (1) How much will it cost? (2) How long will it take? (3) Why?
One answer we found to these fundamental questions is that an estimate is more accurately expressed as a range, not as a single number. To determine an accurate estimate range for both cost and schedule, key risks must be identified and considered.
To present a comprehensive portrayal of a project in terms of cost and schedule, we must begin with a solid, well-prepared, and well-documented base estimate. Base cost is defined as the planned cost of the project; the base cost does not include contingency. A list of risks is created for both opportunities and threats, called a risk register. The risk assessment replaces general and vaguely defined contingency with explicitly defined risk events, which include their associated probability of occurrence and impact on project cost and/or schedule. The risk component, for projects over $10 million, is developed as part of a formal or informal cost risk workshop.
This process is consistent with the professional codes of ethics to which many of the workshop participants are bound. The agreements below represent fundamental aspects of estimating for public works projects, and are consistent with the nationally recognized codes of ethics for the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) (https://www.asce.org/career-growth/ethics/code-of-ethics) and the
Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering International (AACEI) (https://web.aacei.org/docs/default-source/governing-documents/canons-of-ethics_2021.pdf).

A note about risk, uncertainty, and estimating: “It is better to be approximately right rather than precisely wrong.”

Helpful Hints for Project Teams*
Be prepared: Know what is to be evaluated at the workshop; clearly describe the scope of the project; have a well-organized, up-to-date, and easy-to-present project schedule and cost estimate appropriate to the level of project development.
Submit workshop request form after it is clear what project alternatives and/or scenarios are to be evaluated. Allow at least 8 weeks advance notice from the time the workshop request form is submitted to when the first prep session will be held.
Use the project management process as outlined in the WSDOT Project Management Online
Guide.
Follow the guidance provided throughout this document.
Keep workshop attendance to a manageable size: An effective workshop has all of the necessary people present, but not more than is necessary. Too many people in a meeting can make it less effective, slow, and cumbersome. Read the sections on Pre-Workshops and Workshop Meetings in this document, particularly Cautionary Notes Regarding Workshop Dynamics.
Project Manager or Assistant Project Manager attends the workshop: It is crucial that someone able to speak from the owner’s perspective be present throughout the workshop.
Become familiar with the workshop process in advance of the workshop: The Strategic Analysis and Estimating Office can provide a representative from the CREM Unit to conduct training and orientation in advance of the workshop.
When the workshop is over, it’s over! The workshop is a “snapshot” examination of the project, and issues of concern should be brought up during the workshop. Elicitation of risks and their characteristics are completed by the end of the workshop. The modelers then need to complete the modeling and analysis of the information generated at the workshop, without interference and disruption due to post-workshop wrangling and debate. Following the completion of the analysis risk response, actions are to be developed and incorporated, by the project team, into the Risk Management Plan. Benefits of the process resonate for weeks and months following the workshop as the project team uses information gained from the workshop in their day-to-day decision-making and project development activities.

CRA-CEVP® Workshops
CRA and CEVP® Workshops: Statement of Purpose
Provide a useful, sound, and objective analysis and report that the project team will own and act upon to improve and/or validate project cost schedule estimates. Workshops, conducted collaboratively with cost-risk experts and the project team, will: 1. %Define and review or validate cost and schedule base estimates using a Lead Cost and schedule reviewer, subject matter experts, and WSDOT specialists. 2. %Document assumptions and constraints used in developing the estimated project cost and schedule range. 3. %Replace (or greatly reduce) the traditional project “contingency” with key identifiable risks that can be more clearly understood and managed. 4. %Under the direction of a Risk Lead, identify and quantify key events in a project that can cause a significant deviation from the base cost or schedule. This identification and quantification should begin prior to the workshop through advance elicitation meetings. 5. %Perform a Monte Carlo simulation analysis to model the collective impact of base and risk issues for the complete project as a system to produce an estimate of a reasonable range and distribution. 6. %Discuss and develop concepts for responses to risks to the schedule that could impact the cost of the project. Promote proactive risk management by project teams. Provide the project team with actionable information on risk events that allows them to manage the risks (threats/opportunities) on an ongoing basis, via mitigation strategies to better control project costs and schedules. 7. %Perform a “post-mitigation” analysis to ascertain the effectiveness of planned and/or implemented risk response actions.
A-1.3
CRA and CEVP® Seven-Step Process: 1. %Select the project and method. 2. %Structure the project team effort. 3. %Define and evaluate the base cost estimate and schedule. 4. %Assess uncertainty and risk. 5. %Quantify uncertainty in the project cost and schedule. 6. %Apply probabilistic analysis and document. 7. %Implement and measure risk response actions, monitor, and control.
A-1.4

Base and Risk Defined
The base cost represents the cost that can reasonably be expected if the project materializes as planned. The base cost estimate is unbiased and neutral.

Section A
A project risk is characterized quantitatively with the combination of the probability of an uncertain event and its consequences. A positive consequence presents an opportunity; a negative consequence poses a threat. In a project context, it is the chance of something happening that will have an impact upon project objectives.

Two Pillars of Risk Management
We can think of risk management as two pillars (depicted above): “IDENTIFY and
ANALYZE,” and “RESPOND, MONITOR, and CONTROL.”
Unless we incorporate the second pillar, we are not realizing the full value of risk management. When preparing the Project Management Plan and work activities for our project, we must include both pillars of risk management. • %The preparation activities before the workshop, the workshop itself, and the % analysis of the input comprise the first pillar. % • %The second pillar requires that the Project Manager and project team develop % response actions for the key risks, document the response actions, and % incorporate this information into their Risk Management Plan (as part of the %
Project Management Plan update). %
The Project Manager and team then track the risks and the effectiveness of the response actions. A follow-up analysis can be performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the response actions.

Workshop Teams and Participation
A-1.5.1
The Right Size and Participants
The main criterion for project workshop participation has to be “Who is absolutely critical to identify the problems we are dealing with?” The criterion of “criticalness” should include not only technical expertise and responsibility but also problem-solving and team skills. Workshop participants should: 1. Be involved 2. Be heard (in relation to their responsibility and/or expertise)
Recommended Participants

Preparation for the workshop may take one or several meetings depending on the project size and complexity, and the knowledge of the participants. The Project
Manager/project team should work with the workshop coordinator and cost-risk team to identify the best combination of participants at each meeting (see Exhibit A-2). All participants do not need to attend all meetings. The goal is to effectively use time for all parties in a manner that ensures a sound and objective analysis (see Exhibit A-3).

Internal subject matter experts (SMEs) work with external SMEs to review and validate project cost and schedule estimates. They provide objective review and comment regarding project issues, risks, and uncertainty. At the end of the workshop, the SMEs should provide a brief (i.e., one-page) summary of their thoughts about the workshop.
Conducts risk elicitation and manages meeting during risk elicitation; performs or directs the performance of the statistical analysis.
Assists with risk elicitation and meeting management during risk elicitation.
Conducts base cost and schedule review and validation; manages the meeting during the review.

Cost Lead Assistant
Assists the Cost Lead position, as appropriate.
CREM Workshop
Coordinator
Coordinates the agenda and participants’ discussions, works with the
Project Manager to ensure the success of the workshop. *These participants should also attend the prep session.

Pre-Workshops
Pre-Workshop: Determine Need, Process & Assemble Project Information
Strategy Session
Orientation Session
Assemble Project Info
Determine: Does the project need a risk-based estimating workshop? If yes, what type: informal, CRA, CEVP®, combined
VE-CRA? (See WSDOT directional document IL 4071.) Determine timing and scheduling of workshop events. This can typically be accomplished via telecon between the CREM Unit and the Project Manager.
Process: Participants must understand the process and their role in it. Formal training provides a comprehensive presentation of the process. However, there are varying levels of experience and proficiency with the CRA/CEVP® workshop process. Orientation sessions can be tailored to the project team and participants as appropriate.
Evaluate: The Project Manager and project team need to know what it is they are going to evaluate, and clearly communicate that to the workshop participants. The process provides an opportunity to examine more than one scenario, but it is not practical to evaluate “the universe of every conceivable concept.”
Conduct Prep Session
Prep sessions should be attended by the Risk Lead, the Cost Lead, and the core project team because they will be tasked to help develop the project flowchart, assemble initial project costs/durations, and develop a list of risks eligible for significant impact on the project schedule or cost. At this meeting, additional participants will be identified who should participate at the upcoming workshop. The identification of needed support from subject matter experts (SME) is an especially important outcome of the prep session.
Invite Participants
Determine who will be needed to attend the workshop and when they will be needed. Determine who will send the invitations; typically, the project team will schedule the rooms and invite region participants and specialists from Headquarters (HQ) with whom they have been working. The CREM Unit will invite the external cost-risk team members (consultants and other independent experts from HQ).
Review Estimate and Schedule
After the prep session and before the workshop, the Cost Lead and Cost SME review the project team’s base cost and schedule estimate and provide recommendations for their consideration. (See Section D for a sample of Cost Lead review questions that should be asked at this stage.) The estimate review and base cost validation should begin in advance of the workshop. The draft estimate and flowchart/schedule should be reviewed by affected project team disciplines prior to the workshop. The pre-workshop base cost estimate and flowchart/schedule must be submitted to the WSDOT region Risk Manager and all significant non-WSDOT stakeholders prior to the workshop.
Advance Elicitation Interviews
Prior to the workshop, the Risk Leads should meet with those specialty groups that elicit the most critical risks and are most crucial to project success; these are the risks that have significant effects on project objectives.

Note: The best workshops, in terms of being effective and efficient, are those that have had ample advance work conducted—particularly in the areas listed above.

Preparing Workshop Participants1
A-1.6
Prior to the actual workshop, participants need to know what to expect and what is expected of them. Participants are reminded to: (1) avoid bias and be impartial during the workshop discussions, (2) listen open-mindedly to all opinions, and (3) not advocate for a predetermined point of view.
The following sections describe procedures for preparing the project team and SMEs to ready themselves for the workshop. The Risk Leads and Cost Leads are expected to be aware of potential biasing as they conduct their respective portions of the workshop.
A-1.7
Preparing the Project Team – Overview for “Bias Reduction”
The CRA/CEVP® environment provides an opportunity for the project team to share their cost and schedule estimates with others. The assurance of an accurate project cost estimate and schedule begins when a project team initiates and aligns their team for the project.
Project teams work hard to maintain the quality of their estimates and schedules. They are often optimistic about their project, particularly early in project development. An optimistic estimate is generally a low estimate. A pessimistic or conservative estimate is generally an estimate that, in the judgment of the estimator, is intentionally high in order to make sure there is enough money for the project.
Project teams should guard against all forms of bias at all stages of project development. Optimistic bias has been observed, in some cases, to reverse itself as a project approaches completion of design. As the contract package begins to come together in advance of the advertisement date, Project Managers/engineers may become increasingly guarded about the financial needs of the project and give estimates for costs and schedule that are too high, thereby driving the project cost estimate higher.
Following the Process

The process, when properly followed, provides a sound base estimate and identifies risk events that
