WSDOT Pavement Policy Based on the deterministic analysis, the PCC alternative is slightly higher for the present value of agency costs (approximately 1.3 percent higher) than the HMA alternative. For the present value of user costs, the PCC alternative is slightly lower (approximately 1.00 percent lower) than the HMA alternative. Based on total present value costs, these two alternatives would be considered equivalent (PCC is approximately 0.8 percent lower than HMA).

Based on the cumulative probability distributions shown above, there is an 80 percent probability that the agency costs for the HMA alternative will be less than the PCC alternative as demonstrated by the narrowness of the spread in the probabilistic analysis. The above graph also shows that there is a lower risk of cost variation with the PCC alternative. The slopes of the cumulative risk profiles shown above are similar for the user costs and only a slight difference for the agency costs. The alternative with the steeper slope would have less variability and the means being similar, would also be the preferred alternative. Therefore, in this analysis the preferred option would be the PCC alternative.

APPENDIX 7 – PROJECT SPECIFIC DETAILS The following are examples of project specific details that may be considered: 
Air pollution impacts. Consider if either effects on traffic or effects during production affect the project or future preservation efforts

Non-user impacts. How are surrounding neighborhoods affected by the project? How do these impacts vary depending on the type of pavement selected? What are the impacts at the point of production?

Haul routes through neighborhoods. Consider the impacts both during initial construction and future preservation projects.

Future ability of plants to operate at night in urban areas and associated cost increases. Where are typical production plants located? Will night work continue to be feasible in the area of plant production or will urban growth affect this? What possible effect will urban growth have on making production plants move further away from the corridor?

Neighborhood impacts due to trip diversion during preservation projects. When a highway closure impacts the traveling public, many will divert to other routes to avoid delays. These diversions have associated costs, in and of themselves. Some of the costs come from backups and delays (user impacts) on these diversion routes; some of the costs come from impacts to neighborhoods, through increased traffic, noise, congestion, air pollution, safety and accident risks. Consider the level of user delays and the likelihood that diversions will occur and the level of impact these diversions could have on non-highway users.

Business impacts due to reduced or restricted access. This impact happens both due to direct impacts to users and to impacts due to diversion. The magnitude grows as an area urbanizes and increases the number of businesses that stay open for extended (mostly nighttime) hours of operation. Diversion through a neighborhood with extensive commercial business can greatly impact those businesses.

Effect of nighttime noise variances and risk of approval of noise variances. These two items tie in with the item noted above. As urban areas grow, nighttime noise variances become more difficult to obtain and more restrictive in their limitations. Review the corridor in question and the expected growth projections, to develop an idea of the risk associated with this non-user impact. Noise restrictions can limit hours of operations to the point of preventing work, or they can restrict noise levels below that achievable by state of the practice construction equipment. Noise restrictions apply also to vibration and noise generated by vibratory equipment and these restrictions can prevent the use of particular equipment within selected urban corridors. A single resident affected by nighttime noise can and has effectively shut down projects, forcing a move to day work and created huge impacts on highway users through delay and impacts.

Noise − Noise walls. Evaluate whether the corridor already has noise walls or is expected to have noise walls by the time of the project, and the impacts having or not having the walls might have on nonusers/residents, both for construction noise and pavement noise − Haul through neighborhoods at night. Haul though neighborhoods at night (and if you are hauling, you are traveling through someone’s neighborhood) should be considered as an impact. Sparsely populated areas will obviously have a smaller impact due to the noise of hauling vehicles than densely packed urban areas.
133
WSDOT Pavement Policy − −
Noise from diverted traffic and other impacts. Diverted traffic must drive through someone’s neighborhood to get to where they are going. At night, diverted traffic, especially involving large trucks, can have a significant noise impact on neighborhoods. Noise generation during preservation projects. When preservation projects are performed on any pavement, noise is generated and its impacts on the local community must also be considered, in addition to the impact of the noise from the initial construction.

Safety. − Public exposure to traffic control during lane closures. − Work exposure to traffic during lane closures. − Lane closures are a safety risk factor for both workers and the traveling public. Limited vision, nighttime lighting, temporary traffic control and other factors increase the risk of accidents to both motorists and to workers within the work zone. Evaluate the risk to both, given the nature of the corridor, the ADT, the degree of urbanization and the complexity of the facility. − Safety risks associated with maintenance by state forces between preservation projects.

Pavement type continuity within a corridor (similar to architectural choices for structures and wall-types within a corridor and landscape architectural choices for continuity within a corridor). It is generally not desirable to switch pavement types over relatively short stretches of highway. Maintenance needs change for each given pavement type, as do preservation needs. Further, the change in pavement type impacts the public in various ways, including aesthetics.

Environmental effects. − Runoff temperature due to heating effects depending on pavement type. Evaluate in conjunction with design of the storm sewer system.

PAVEMENT TYPE SELECTION
SR-3 Luoto Road to SR-305 MP 48.90 to MP 53.00
The Pavement Type Selection Committee has completed its review of the pavement type selection for the project SR-3 Luoto Road to SR-305, MP 48.90 to MP 53.00. The project consists of constructing the final two lanes of the ultimate four-lane facility from Luoto Road to SR-305. The pavement design analysis resulted in both pavement types (HMA and PCC) being viable. In the life cycle cost analysis, one PCC alternative was compared to one HMA alternative. In the life cycle cost analysis of the two alternatives, there is a cost advantage in the use of HMA over PCC of greater than 15 percent. The Committee approves the use of HMA on this project.

WSDOT Pavement Policy
APPENDIX 9 - BASIS OF WSDOT PAVEMENT DESIGN POLICY FOR DESIGN BUILD PROJECTS
INTRODUCTION WSDOT’s pavement design policy is a product of experience, research findings (state, national and international) and various analyses. The policy is based upon pavement design practices that WSDOT has found to produce serviceable and cost effective pavements for the conditions in Washington State. Generally, these practices follow conventional pavement design procedures. Practices that have shaped WSDOT’s pavement design policy include:
•
Designing pavement structures for long-life (50 years or more).
•
Designing HMA pavement to ensure that cracking occurs from the top down instead of from the bottom up,
•
Reusing the existing pavement structure as much as practical when rehabilitating an existing pavement, and
•
Incorporating pavement preservation at both the capital project level as well as the state forces maintenance level.
The purpose of this paper is to briefly explain the basis of WSDOT’s Pavement Design Policy and how this fits into the context of design-build projects. WSDOT PAVEMENT DESIGN PROCEDURES For most state highway agencies, including WSDOT, the current primary pavement design tool is the 1993 AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993 AASHTO Guide). While use of this empirical method has been successful, it has several acknowledged shortcomings including being based on a limited number of pavement sections at one location, one climate, one set of materials and truck loads from the late 1950s. It is a testament to this model’s robustness and the ingenuity of those who have worked on it that it can still be used to design reasonable pavement structures. Most users of the 1993 AASHTO Guide recognize its shortcomings and have developed workarounds to get results that match field performance.
139
WSDOT Pavement Policy AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design (AASHTOWare) has been proposed as the next generation of pavement design software. With its basis in empirical field and laboratory performance combined with mechanistic principles, the resulting designs are assumed to produce better thickness estimates than traditional empirical designs. While AASHTOWare is, in many respects, a much more sophisticated and detailed design approach, it does not model all the desired distress types and is unable (due to software bugs or otherwise) to predict others adequately for WSDOT. The major distress on WSDOT asphalt pavements is top-down alligator cracking which is not modeled in AASHTOWare. Likewise, the major distress on WSDOT Jointed Plain Concrete Pavement (JPCP), multiple cracked a panels, rutting/wear from studded tires and longitudinal cracking are not modeled in AASHTOWare. Ultimately, it is historical performance that provides the missing information and the assurance that model outputs are likely to be achieved during actual performance—for both AASHTOWare and the current WSDOT design approach. Knowledge of this led to the development of a pavement structural thickness design catalog for WSDOT based on a combination of prior models, new models (including AASHTOWare where applicable) and historical performance (Li et al, 2010). The resulting design catalog has been officially adopted by WSDOT and is included in this document. WSDOT currently uses Darwin 3.01 (based on the 1993 AASHTO Guide) as well as the new structural thickness catalog developed as a guide for regional designers. Other pavement design procedures have not been calibrated for performance and conditions experienced in Washington. DESIGN-BUILD PROJECT PAVEMENT DESIGN PROCEDURES In Washington, the specified pavement thickness is predicated on providing adequate pavement thickness to accommodate traffic, climate and future studded tire wear. On past design-build contracts, WSDOT has specified the pavement layer thicknesses. The question asked by design builders is “why can’t an alternate design sections utilizing the AASHTOWare or another pavement design procedure be proposed on design build projects?” Although WSDOT sees the AASHTOWare as a potentially useful tool to model pavement in the future, WSDOT currently does not use the software.
Without the software, WSDOT can only
evaluate the design using its present tools, WSDOT’s design catalog and the 1993 AASHTO Guide. Proposals relying on AASHTOWare often include design elements that are not adequately
140
WSDOT Pavement Policy modeled using the 1993 AASHTO Guide. These proposals cannot be approved since WSDOT has no way to determine if they are adequate. One of the reasons that WSDOT has not adopted AASHTOWare is the significant effort required to calibrate it to local conditions. The work required with local calibrations is tedious requiring 6 months to complete a single calibration. Software upgrades are released at least once a year requiring additional calibration.
Without local calibration, the software may not provide an
adequate pavement design. Currently design-builders do not use local calibration when the submit Alternate Technical Concepts (ATC) using AASHTOWare. Since there are is no local calibration, ATC’s developed using AASHTOWare will likely result in a difference between predicted and actual performance. For a design-builder to use local calibration with the software, WSDOT would need to do the local calibration and provide the calibration constants to the designbuilder. AASHTOWare does not currently model important distress types for Washington pavement (topdown alligator cracking in HMA pavement, multiple cracks in a panel, rutting/wear from studded tires and longitudinal cracking in portland cement concrete pavement (PCCP)). Without a way to model these distress types, the software will not be able to accurately predict the performance life of pavement in Washington. WSDOT is not alone in providing the pavement design for design-build project. In a report entitled Best Practices in Pavement Design for Design-Build Projects,” Minnesota Department of Transportation learned that specifying pavement types and pavement thicknesses is a common practice with state agencies (MnDOT, 2014). Some state agencies have allowed design-builders the ability to perform some aspects of pavement design. However, in all cases, the state agency provides approval for the requests and designs typically follow individual state minimum standards. The pavement design requirements in the WSDOT Pavement Policy results in pavements that perform well in Washington. The risk that pavement designed in accordance with the pavement policy will not perform well over the pavements life is minimal. Alternate designs proposed by the design-builder do not have the performance history of WSDOT designs. Designs that work well in other states also may not work well in Washington. Most of the risk in a pavement design depends on how well the pavement performs well over its life. New pavement sections are a
141
WSDOT Pavement Policy major investment for WSDOT and are expected to have a high reliability of lasting 50 years or more. This is most important in heavily congested corridors because early repair or reconstruction also affects the public. WSDOT cannot pass the long-term performance risk onto the designbuilder. If a pavement does not perform well, the cost to fix it will be WSDOT’s. Essentially, WSDOT owns the long-term risk when it comes to the long-term performance of pavements. WSDOT PAVEMENT TYPES FOR DESIGN BUILD CONTRACTS Design Build contracts constructed to date have mostly been PCCP or HMA reconstruction (Figure A9.1), however, there have been some opportunities for alternative pavement designs such as crack, seat and overlay, PCCP intersections for reconstruction and mill and fill or overlay for pavement rehabilitation work. As an example, during the proposal period a design-builder submitted an ATC to allow an unbonded overlay on a project with heavy interstate traffic. The unbonded overlay would replace PCCP reconstruction required by the Request for Proposal. The design-builder’s proposal reduced construction cost and saved time while still meeting WSDOT’s design criteria. Based on the recommendation of the State Pavement Office WSDOT approved the ATC.

WSDOT Pavement Policy PCCP WSDOT PCCP design policy grew out of the historical performance of PCCP in Washington. Paving concrete used in Washington has historically performed well structurally and has not suffered from any significant durability problems. The limiting failure mechanisms have therefore been those that do not involve the concrete material itself such as faulting, roughness and studded tire wear. The following describes the strategies used by WSDOT for each design element to design long life PCCP. PCCP Thickness Design WSDOT designed the PCCP constructed during the 1960’s and 1970’s as part of the original interstate construction with an 8 or 9 inch thickness.
Although these pavements performed well
they are under structured for today’s truck and bus traffic. Pavements constructed today will carry 3 to 5 times the number of ESALs carried by the original pavement over the next 50 years (Table A9.1). The increased ESALs will require additional pavement thickness to prevent cracking over a 50-year pavement life. Table A9.1 Past and Future ESALs on Interstate PCCP Approx.

The primary design tool for WSDOT structural design is the design catalogue in Table 5.1 contained in this policy document. The 1993 AASHTO Guide is the basis for the table; however, the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide 1 (MEPDG version 1.0) along with WSDOT pavement historical data and experience was used in the development and validation of the design tables. The 1993 AASHTO Guide results in PCCP that are thicker than required for 1 The Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide is the precursor to AASHTOWare.

WSDOT new PCCP design thicknesses are comparable to other states that design long life pavements. An FHWA Techbrief (Tayabji and Seungwook, 2007) which compared long life pavement designs for Illinois, Minnesota, Texas and Washington showed similar thicknesses for all four states. The techbrief described Illinois long life pavement as 14 inch thick continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP) over a 4 to 6 inch HMA stabilized base with a 30 to 40 year design life. Minnesota uses a design life of 60 years to design 11.5 to 13.5 inch thick doweled JPCP over aggregate base. The techbrief did not provide a thickness for Texas long life PCCP but it was stated that Texas uses the 1986 AASHTO procedure to design CRCP. The 1986 AASHTO procedure is similar to the 1993 AASHTO Guide used by WSDOT to develop the design table making it likely that Texas designs PCCP of similar thickness to WSDOT. WSDOT’s maximum PCCP thickness of 13 inches for its highest volume routes is similar to those used by these other states.
144
WSDOT Pavement Policy PCCP Materials In order for a pavement to perform over a 50-year life, all components of the design need to able to perform for 50 years (Jackson et al, 2014). This requires that materials used in the construction of the pavement to able to reliably last 50 years. Specific requirement for materials that allow a 50-year life are detailed as follows: Portland Cement Concrete PCCP in Washington have not suffered from significant durability problems. Damage caused by reactive aggregates and D cracking can limit pavement life in other parts of the country. The WSDOT Standard Specification requires the use of high quality aggregates and mitigation for alkali silica reactive aggregates. This and an ample supply of high quality aggregates allows the production of concrete that is capable of performing for 50 years or more. Dowel Bars A long pavement life necessitates that dowel bars be able to resist corrosion. Inspection of epoxy coated dowel bars removed from in service pavements revealed that they are susceptible to corrosion in Washington conditions. In order to achieve a long life WSDOT requires stainless steel or equivalent dowels in all new PCCP. Epoxy coated dowel bars are allowed in applications that do not have as long of a life such as dowel bar retrofits and replacing damaged panels in an existing PCCP. PCCP Base A primary form of distress on PCCP constructed as part of the original interstate system in Washington was joint faulting (Jackson et al, 2014). WSDOT overlaid substantial mileage of the original PCCP with HMA due to rough ride caused by faulting. Significantly more miles of faulted PCCP have been retrofitted with dowel bars and diamond ground. To prevent faulting and migration of fines under PCCP panels, WSDOT initiated the policy to use only HMA base under PCCP on high volume roadways. HMA prevents faulting, pumping and migration of fines by improving load transfer across joints, blocking the migration of fines underneath the PCCP panels and being resistant to erosion. Pavement performance data, research and WSDOT experience shows that an HMA base has outperformed other base material for PCCP. Performance on WSDOT highways shows that other base types were not be able to perform over a 50-year pavement life for the following reasons.
145
WSDOT Pavement Policy
•
Granular bases used in Washington have historically been susceptible to pumping and the migration of fines resulting in faulting and premature panel failure (Meunch et al, 2010).
•
Cement Treated Base (CTB) -PCCP placed on CTB have performed poorly relative to other base types in Washington. Erosion of the CTB results in voids under the panel that can quickly lead to panel failure (Meunch et al, 2010).
•
Asphalt Treated Base (ATB) has been the best performing base but is susceptible to stripping because of the low asphalt content in the mix. The stripping leads to loss of support and faulting (Meunch et al, 2010). ATB tended to be one of the best performing bases nationally and in Washington. The increased asphalt content in dense graded HMA will greatly reduce the risk of stripping further increasing the performance of PCCP for a small increase in cost.
•
Lean Concrete Base (LCB) has had limited use in Washington State (its use was the SPS-2 site on US 395) but has not performed well either nationally or within Washington State.
•
Permeable bases have performed poorly nationally and are no longer recommended (ACPA, 2007). Subsurface drainage issues are always considered by WSDOT but this solution is not long term.
HOT MIX ASPHALT PAVEMENT WSDOT design HMA pavement for a 50 year life. This requires a pavement structure that can carry the loads it will experience over 50 years and materials can resist stripping and other types of disintegration over the pavement life. Periodic surface renewals will be necessary to restore the pavement surface. HMA Pavement Thickness Design WSDOT designs HMA pavement based on the concept that cracking in thicker HMA sections will primarily be top down. Correcting surface distress on these thicker HMA pavements before it propagates into the lower layers preserves the underlying structure allowing the pavement to have a long life. Designing HMA pavements for a 50-year design life results in relatively thick HMA pavement structure that is adequate to carry the loads it will experience over the long pavement life. Preserving this thick HMA pavement involves milling off the cracked top lift of HMA and
146
WSDOT Pavement Policy inlaying with an equal thickness of new HMA. It is WSDOT’s experience that these practices results in HMA pavements than can perform well for more than the 50-years design life and that are cost effective. HMA Pavement Materials In order to achieve a long life the HMA base layers must be resistant to moisture damage. National research has found that smaller nominal maximum aggregate size gradations are less permeable for a given density that larger NMAS aggregates (Mallick et al, 2003). To reduce the likelihood of moisture damage WSDOT constructs all lifts using either ⅜ or ½ inch NMAS gradations. Larger NMAS mixes are not allowed by WSDOT even though they are included in the WSDOT Standard Specifications largely due to low density and water susceptibility issues. HMA Pavement Base WSDOT uses crushed surfacing base course under HMA pavement in areas that will be less than ½ the frost depth from the pavement surface. Crushed surfacing top course has been found to be susceptible to frost heave and is not used less than ½ the depth of maximum freezing.
