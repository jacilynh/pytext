CFST-to-Cap Reinforced Concrete Connections A circular reinforcing with headed longitudinal bars may be used to connect a CFST member to a concrete cap, where the steel casing is discontinued just below the cap. Terminating the steel casing below the cap, as opposed to terminating at the bottom of the cap or just inside the cap, reduces the chances of concrete spalling at relatively low demands. The reinforcing cage shall satisfy all of the requirements for a reinforced concrete connection, as well as the additional requirements in this section. 7.10.4.A
CFST Requirements
A steel ring shall be welded to the inside of the steel casing 3” below the top of casing as shown in Figure 7.10.4-1 to aid in transfer of forces from the reinforcement cage to the steel casing. A square bar the size of the steel casing wall thickness, or a maximum of 1”, is sufficient. The bar may be continuous or consist of discontinuous segments, however the total length shall be at least 75% of the steel casing circumference and shall be equally distributed as shown in Figure 7.10.4-2. Transverse reinforcing shall be used and shall extend into the concrete cap. Figure 7.10.4-1

RCFST-to-Column and CFST-to Column Connections Direct RCFST-to-column connections shall be designed as fully-restrained connections capable of resisting all load effects. The recommended RCFST shaft to reinforced concrete column connection is shown in Figure 7.10.5-1. All column reinforcement shall be extended into the RCFST shaft for a length greater than or equal to the length required for noncontact lap splices between columns and shafts. The contribution of steel casing to the structural resistance of RCFST’s varies from zero at the end of the tube to fully composite at the end of the transition zone. The transition zone length may be taken as 1.0D. The use of slip casing in determining the resistance for RCFST shafts is not permitted. RCFST-to-Column Connection

Partially-filled CFST The use of partially-filled steel tubes for bridge foundations requires the approval of the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer, and will only be used where conventional CFST members are grossly uneconomical or unconstructible. Design zones of partially filled steel piles and shafts are shown in Figure 7.10.6-1. Longitudinal and transverse reinforcement shall extend to at least the first point of zero moment along the member under the peak loading condition. Crosshole sonic log (CSL) testing or thermal integrity profiling (TIP) shall be performed in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 6-19.3(9). CSL tubes or thermal wires shall extend to the bottom of concrete. Corrosion losses shall be considered on each exposed surface of the steel tube. Figure 7.10.6-1

Construction Requirements For CFSTs with tubes installed open-ended, the insides of the tube shall be excavated and then cleaned with an appropriate tool to remove all adhering soil and other material. FIG. 7.10.6-1 When excavating, a nominal plug of soil shall be left at the bottom of the pile as determined by the State Geotechnical Engineer. The State Geotechnical Engineer shall be consulted to determine the method for computing axial compressive and uplift (if applicable) capacities of the CFSTs during design. In addition, the method for accepting CFSTs during construction, if installed as a driven pile, will need to be recommended by the State Geotechnical Engineer. When driving an open ended pile, the total resistance obtained consists of a contribution from end bearing, external side friction, and internal side friction. Also, depending on the pile diameter and soil conditions, the pile could drive

Chapter 7
with or without a soil plug. When excavating the soil from inside of an open-ended driven pile, the resistance can be altered from the as-driven condition due to loss of internal side friction. All of these factors need to be considered during the design and shall be based on recommendations from the State Geotechnical Engineer. Open-ended CFSTs installed using techniques similar to a drilled shaft shall be designed and constructed as a drilled shaft. Closed-ended CFSTs driven as a pile may be designed and accepted in the field similar to a closed-ended steel pile. Welding for pipe for CFST or RCFSTs shall conform to AWS D1.1/D1.1M, latest edition, Structural Welding Code, except that all weld filler metal shall be low hydrogen material selected from Table 4.1 in AASHTO/AWS D1.5M/D1.5:2010 Bridge Welding Code. All seams and splices shall be complete penetration welds. Welding and joint geometry for the seam shall be qualified in accordance with AWS D1.1/D1.1M, latest edition, Structural Welding Code. The Contractor may submit documentation of prior qualification to the Engineer to satisfy this requirement. For the fabrication of helical (spiral) seam submerged-arc welded pipe piles, the maximum radial offset of strip/plate edges shall be ⅛ inch. The offset shall be transitioned with a taper weld and the slope shall not be less than a 1-to-2.5 taper. The weld reinforcement shall not be greater than 3/16 inches and misalignment of weld beads shall not exceed ⅛ inch. If spirally welded pipe piles are allowed, skelp splices shall be located at least 1′-0″ away from the annular ring. Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) requirements for field welded splices shall be identified on the plans. The location of splices and NDE requirements shall be divided into 3 possible zones as determined by the Engineer:
7.10.8
1.
No splices permitted – highly stressed areas
2.
Splices permitted with 100 percent UT and visual inspection – moderately stressed areas
3.

Notes: 1. All values based on normal weight concrete with f'c = 4.0 ksi. 2. The basic splice length, Ls , is based on 1.7 times the tension development length Ld. Ld is calculated per Section 5.11.2.1.1 of the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications 7th Edition, 2015 Interim Revisions. The 1.7 (Class C lap splice) factor was maintained for the basic splice length calculations to be consistent with the original TRAC research for noncontact lap splices. This table does not apply when column longitudinal bars are bundled. 3. Development lengths are based on uncoated deformed bars. For epoxy coated bars add 0.2*Ls or 0.5*Ls to Lns depending on column bar spacing and clear cover. See AASHTO 5.11.2.1.2 for spacing and cover requirements. 4. The clearance between the column and shaft reinforcement, s, is based on an out-to-out dimension of the cages. Concrete cover to the column reinforcing is 2", and concrete cover to the shaft reinforcing is per Std. Spec. 6-19.3(5)C. Also, s has been increased by the allowable shaft construction tolerances in Std. Spec. 619.3(1)A. If an oversized cage is used in conjunction with an oversize casing, s may need to be increased further. 5. The reinforcement confinement factor, λrc, is assumed to be 0.4 for all cases and is based on the assumption that the column reinforcement is well confined with column transverse reinforcement, shaft transverse reinforcement, and in most cases a permanent shaft casing. 6. All noncontact splice lengths have been rounded up to the nearest 6". * Minimum common shaft diameter for specified column diameter to meet minimum clearance and construction tolerances.

Fixed Head vs. Free Head Spring Calculations Fixed Head If the shear and moment are creating deflection in OPPOSING directions where the spring is located, a fixed head boundary condition is required to model the loaded foundation in a finite element model. See Figure 7-B1-3 for the fixed head coordinate system assumed in the following spring calculations. Since applying load to a fixed end results in no reaction, a soil/structure interaction analysis will generally analyze the shear and moment simultaneously as a free head. Using the soil response results, a cross-couple correction term will be required in a FEM to produce the induced moment in the element modeling the fixed head condition. If accurate stresses in fixed head element are not required, the cross-couple term may be omitted. There are two ways to model fixed head pile group. The most common method for a column footing is to use a group spring to model a group of piles or shafts as one set of springs. This method uses six linear springs to represent the foundation behavior. Lateral loads resisted by Cross-couples terms do not apply and individual pile loads must be calculated from the FEM results. The second method would be to model the individual piles. This is more helpful for analyzing local stresses in the foundation cap element and for each pile. Cross-couple terms may be included and individual pile loads are generated in the FEM. Figure 7-B1-3

Likewise,  7-B-1 .10 3     the K66 and K44 rotational terms zero out and do not affect the moment reaction. This  7-B-1 .10 3   leaves the K61 and K43 cross-couple terms to generate induced moments based on the deflections in the X and Z directions. Designers should note, the cross-couple moments are applied to a fixed footing element and are resisted axially by the piles. This affects the local stress in the footing and axial loading of the pile much more than the column moment and shear, which is usually the primary focus for design.
K11 and K66 (or K33 and K44) alone do not predict the shape or reaction of the foundation element. The cross-couple term K16 (or K34) will add a shear force to correct the applied moment deflection.

8.1.1
General A retaining wall is a structure built to provide lateral support for a mass of earth or other material where a grade separation is required. Retaining walls depend either on their own weight, their own weight plus the additional weight of laterally supported material, or on a tieback system for their stability. Additional information is provided in the Geotechnical Design Manual Chapter 15. Standard designs for noise barrier walls (precast concrete, cast-in-place concrete, or masonry), and geosynthetic walls are shown in the Standard Plans. The Region Design PE Offices are responsible for preparing the PS&E for retaining walls for which standard designs are available, in accordance with the Design Manual M 22-01. However, the Bridge and Structures Office may prepare PS&E for such standard type retaining walls if such retaining walls are directly related to other bridge structures being designed by the Bridge and Structures Office. Structural earth wall (SE) systems meeting established WSDOT design and performance criteria have been listed as “preapproved” by the Bridge and Structures Office and the Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Branch. The PS&E for “preapproved” structural earth wall systems shall be coordinated by the Region Design PE Office with the Bridge and Structures Office, and the Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Branch, in accordance with Design Manual M 22-01. The PS&E for minor non-structural retaining walls, such as rock walls, gravity block walls, and gabion walls, are prepared by the Region Design PE Offices in accordance with the Design Manual M 22-01, and any other design input from the Region Materials Office, Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Branch or WSDOT Geotechnical Engineer. Temporary retaining walls are defined as walls that are in service or have a design life of three years or less. Any retaining wall that is expected to be in service for more than three years shall be designed for seismic loading. Temporary retaining walls shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of the current editions of the LRFD-BDS and interims, WSDOT Bridge Design Manual including all design memorandums, and the WSDOT Geotechnical Design Manual Chapter 15. All other retaining walls not covered by the Standard Plans such as reinforced concrete cantilever walls with attached traffic barriers, soil nail walls, soldier pile walls, soldier pile tieback walls and all walls beyond the scope of the designs tabulated in the Standard Plans, are designed by the Bridge and Structures Office according to the design parameters provided by the WSDOT Geotechnical Engineer. The Hydraulics Branch of the Design Office should be consulted for walls that are subject to floodwater or are located in a flood plain. The State Bridge and Structures Architect should review the architectural features and visual impact of the walls during the Preliminary Design stage. The designer is also directed to the retaining walls chapter in the Design Manual M 22-01 and Geotechnical Design Manual Chapter 15, which provide valuable information on the design of retaining walls.

Walls and Buried Structures
Common Types of Retaining Walls The majority of retaining walls used by WSDOT are one of the following five types: 1.
Proprietary Structural Earth (SE) Walls – Standard Specifications Section 6-13.
2.
Geosynthetic Walls (Temporary and Permanent) – Standard Plan D-3 and Standard Specifications Section 6-14.
3.
Standard Reinforced Concrete Cantilever Retaining Walls - Standard Plans D-10.10 through D-10.45 and Standard Specifications Section 6-11.
4.
Soldier Pile Walls and Soldier Pile Tieback Walls – Standard Specifications Sections 6-16 and 6-17.
5.
Soil Nail Walls–Standard Specifications Section 6-15.
Other wall systems, such as secant pile or cylinder pile walls, may be used based on the recommendation of the Geotechnical Engineer. These walls shall be designed in accordance with the current LRFD-BDS. 8.1.2.A
Preapproved Proprietary Walls
A wall specified to be supplied from a single source (patented, trademark, or copyright) is a proprietary wall. Walls are generally preapproved for heights up to 33 feet. The Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Branch will make the determination as to which preapproved proprietary wall system is appropriate on a case-by-case basis. The following is a description of the most common types of proprietary walls: 8.1.2.A.1
Structural Earth Walls (SE)
A structural earth wall is a flexible system consisting of concrete face panels or modular blocks that are held rigidly into place with reinforcing steel strips, steel mesh, welded wire, or geogrid extending into a select backfill mass. These walls will allow for some settlement and are best used for fill sections. The walls have two principle elements:
• Backfill or wall mass: a granular soil with good internal friction (i.e. gravel borrow).
• Facing: precast concrete panels, precast concrete blocks, or welded wire (with or without vegetation). Design heights in excess of 33 feet shall be approved by the Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Division. If approval is granted, the designer shall contact the individual structural earth wall manufacturers for design of these walls before the project is bid so details can be included in the Plans. See Bridge Standard Drawing 8.1-A2 for details that need to be provided in the Plans for manufacturer designed walls. A list of current preapproved proprietary wall systems is provided in the Geotechnical Design Manual Appendix 15-D. For additional information see the retaining walls chapter in the Design Manual M 22-01 and Geotechnical Design Manual Chapter 15. For the SEW shop drawing review procedure see Geotechnical Design Manual Chapter 15. 8.1.2.A.2
Other Proprietary Walls
Other proprietary wall systems such as crib walls, bin walls, or precast cantilever walls, can offer cost reductions, reduce construction time, and provide special aesthetic features under certain project specific conditions. A list of current preapproved proprietary wall systems and their height limitations is provided in the Geotechnical Design Manual Appendix 15-D. The Region shall refer to the Page 8-2

Chapter 8
retaining walls chapter in the Design Manual M 22-01 for guidelines on the selection of wall types. The Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Division and the Bridge and Structures Office Preliminary Plans Unit must approve the concept prior to development of the PS&E. 8.1.2.B
Geosynthetic Wrapped Face Walls
Geosynthetic walls use geosynthetics for the soil reinforcement and part of the wall facing. Use of geosynthetic walls as permanent structures requires the placement of a cast-in-place, precast or shotcrete facing. Details for construction are shown in Standard Plans D-3.09, D-3.10 and D-3.11. 8.1.2.C
Reinforced Concrete Cantilever Walls
Reinforced concrete cantilever walls consist of a base slab footing from which a vertical stem wall extends. These walls are suitable for heights up to 35 feet. Details for construction and the maximum bearing pressure in the soil are given in the Standard Plans D-10.10 to D-10.45. A major disadvantage of these walls is the low tolerance to post-construction settlement, which may require use of deep foundations (shafts or piling) to provide adequate support. 8.1.2.D
Soldier Pile Walls and Soldier Pile Tieback Walls
Soldier Pile Walls utilize wide flange steel members, such as W or HP shapes. The piles are usually spaced 6 to 10 feet apart. The main horizontal members are timber lagging, precast concrete lagging or cast in place concrete fascia panels which are designed to transfer the soil loads to the piles. For additional information see WSDOT Geotechnical Design Manual Chapter 15. See Bridge Standard Drawing 8.1-A3 for typical soldier pile wall details. 8.1.2.E
Soil Nail Walls
The basic concept of soil nailing is to reinforce and strengthen the existing ground by installing steel bars called “nails” into a slope or excavation as construction proceeds from the “top down”. Soil nailing is a technique used to stabilize moving earth, such as a landslide, or as temporary shoring. Soil anchors are used along with the strength of the soil to provide stability. The Geotechnical Engineer designs the soil nail system whereas the Bridge and Structures Office designs the wall fascia. See Bridge Standard Drawing 8.1-A4 for typical soil nail wall details.
8.1.3
General Design Considerations All designs shall follow procedures as outlined in LRFD-BDS Chapter 11, the Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03. See Appendix 8.1-A1 for a summary of design specification requirements for walls. All construction shall follow procedures as outlined in the WSDOT Standard Specifications latest edition. The Geotechnical Engineer will provide the earth pressure diagrams and other geotechnical design requirements for special walls to be designed by the Bridge and Structures Office. Pertinent soil data will also be provided for preapproved proprietary structural earth walls (SEW), non-standard reinforced concrete retaining walls, and geosynthetic walls.

Design of Reinforced Concrete Cantilever Retaining Walls 8.1.4.A
Standard Reinforced Concrete Cantilever Retaining Walls
The Standard Plan reinforced concrete retaining walls have been designed in accordance with the requirements of the LRFD-BDS 4th Edition 2007 and interims through 2008. The Standard Plan reinforced concrete retaining walls have not been designed for hydrostatic pressure due to water accumulating behind the wall. 8.1.4.A.1 1.
The seismic design of Standard Plan D-10.10 and D-10.15 was completed using an effective Peak Ground Acceleration of 0.51g. The seismic design of Standard Plan D-10.20 and D-10.25 was completed using an effective Peak Ground Acceleration of 0.32g. Extreme Event stability of the wall was based on 100 percent of the wall inertia force combined with 50 percent of the seismic earth pressure.
2.
Active Earth pressure distribution was linearly distributed per Section 7.7.4. The corresponding Ka values used for design were 0.24 for wall Types 1 and 2, and 0.36 for Types 3 and 4.
3.
Seismic Earth pressure distribution was uniformly distributed in accordance with Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03, Nov. 2008 Section 15.4.2.9, and was supplemented by LRFD-BDS (Figure 11.10.7.1-1). The corresponding Kae values used for design were 0.43 for Types 1 and 2, and 0.94 for Types 3 and 4.
4.
Passive Earth pressure distribution was linearly distributed. The corresponding Kp value used for design was 1.5 for all walls. For Types 1 and 2, passive earth pressure was taken over the depth of the footing. For Types 3 and 4, passive earth pressure was taken over the depth of the footing and the height of the shear key.
5.
The retained fill was assumed to have an angle of internal friction of 36 degrees and a unit weight of 130 pounds per cubic foot. The friction angle for sliding stability was assumed to be 32 degrees.
6.
Load factors and load combinations used in accordance with LRFD-BDS Sections 3.4.1-1 and 2. Stability analysis performed in accordance with LRFD-BDS Section 11.6.3 and C11.5.5-1& 2.
7.
Wall Types 1 and 2 have not been designed for 42 inch traffic barrier height collision forces. The Standard Plans D-15.10, D-15.20 and D-15.30 are no longer consistent with WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office traffic barrier height policy and shall not be used on any Standard Plan retaining wall.

3.
Seismic Earth pressure distribution was uniformly distributed in accordance with Geotechnical Design Manual Section 15.4.2.9, and was supplemented by LRFD-BDS Figure 11.10.7.1-1. The corresponding Kae values used for design were 0.55 for Types 5 and 6, and 0.30 for Types 7 and 8.
4.
Passive Earth pressure distribution was linearly distributed, and was taken over the depth of the footing and the height of the shear key. The corresponding Kp value used for design was 1.5 for all walls.
5.
The retained fill was assumed to have an angle of internal friction of 36 degrees and a unit weight of 130 pounds per cubic foot. The friction angle for sliding stability was assumed to be 32 degrees.
6.
Load factors and load combinations used in accordance with LRFD-BDS 3.4.1-1 & 2. Stability analysis performed in accordance with LRFD-BDS Section 11.6.3 and C11.5.5-1 & 2.
7.
Wall Types 7 and 8 have not been designed for 42 inch traffic barrier height collision forces. The Standard Plans D-15.10, D-15.20 and D-15.30 are no longer consistent with WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office traffic barrier height policy and shall not be used on any Standard Plan retaining wall.
8.1.4.B
Non-Standard Reinforced Concrete Retaining Walls
8.1.4.B.1
Bearing Resistance, Eccentricity, and Sliding Stability
For sliding, the passive resistance in the front of the footing may be considered if the earth is more than 2 feet deep on the top of the footing and does not slope downward away from the wall. Otherwise, the passive resistance shall be ignored above the bottom of the footing for the Strength Limit States and ignored above the top of the footing for the Extreme Event Limit States The design soil bearing pressure at the toe of the footing shall not exceed the factored soil bearing capacity supplied by the Geotechnical Engineer. 8.1.4.B.2
Application of Lateral Loads
The lateral loads for reinforced concrete retaining walls with a horizontal backfill shall be applied as shown in Figure 8.1.4-1. The lateral loads for reinforced concrete retaining walls with a sloping backfill shall be applied as shown in Figure 8.1.4-2. 1.
The sloped backfill can be a 2H:1V maximum slope with a limited surcharge height (broken back backfill) or a 3H:1V maximum slope with no surcharge height (infinite backfill).
2.
For the broken back backfill condition, the slope angle β* is based on the LRFD-BDS Figure C3.11.5.8.1-1.
3.
The wall backfill interface friction angle is δ = 2/3 φf but not greater than β or β* which is consistent with the Coulomb wedge theory.

Walls and Buried Structures
8.1.4.B.3
Application of Collision Loads
For walls with traffic barriers constructed integral with the wall stem, the vehicular collision load shall be included in the design. To ensure that any failure due to the collision remains in the barrier section, the top of the wall stem shall have sufficient resistance to force the yield line failure pattern to remain within the barrier. The top of the wall stem shall be designed in accordance with the requirement of the LRFD-BDS Article A13.4. As shown in Figures 8.1.4-3 and 8.1.4-4, the collision force (CT, Ft) is assumed to be distributed over the longitudinal length (Lt) at the top of the traffic barrier and is assumed to distribute downward to the top of the footing at a 45 degree angle. See LRFD-BDS Table A13.2-1 for Lt and Ft values. The distribution of the collision force in the footing shall be the distance between expansion joints. For the Extreme Event II Limit State, the load factor, γp, for EH is 1.0 to account for the dynamic nature of the collision load. 8.1.4.B.4
Wall Footing Structural Design
Refer to Section 7.7 for additional footing structural design criteria. The General Footing Criteria provided in Section 7.7.1 shall be applicable to both retaining wall footings and leveling pads. For footings with steps, the bottom of the footing step is to be sloped no steeper than 1H:2V (See Std. Plan D-2.04 for an example). Footings with 90 degree steps at the bottom of the footing shall not be permitted. The minimum reinforcement criteria for bottom reinforcement of #6 bars at 12" centers and top reinforcement of #5 bars at 12" centers required in Section 7.7.4.F is not applicable to retaining wall footings. The structural design of the footing shall assume a triangular or trapezoidal bearing pressure distribution in accordance with the LRFD-BDS Article 10.6.5. When designing the transverse reinforcement located in the bottom of the footing, the contribution of the soil located over the toe of the footing shall be ignored. When designing the transverse reinforcement located in the top of the footing, the contribution of the bearing pressure under the footing shall be ignored. Control of cracking by distribution of reinforcement as specified in LRFD-BDS Article 5.6.7 shall be checked for the top and bottom face of the footing. For retaining walls supported by deep foundations (shafts or piles), refer to Sections 7.7.5, 7.8, 7.9 and 7.10. 8.1.4.B.5
Wall Stem Structural Design
Refer to Sections 7.5.4 and 7.5.10 for additional wall stem structural design criteria. In accordance with Standard Specifications Section 6-11.3(3), the Contract Plans or Special Provisions are to state whether the cast-in-place semi-gravity concrete cantilever wall may be constructed with precast concrete wall stem panels. For cast-in-place semi-gravity concrete cantilever walls with traffic barriers cast integral with the wall stem, the Contract Plans or Special Provisions are to provide explicit direction regarding whether the traffic barrier is permitted to be precast with the precast wall stem or cast-in-place after the precast wall stems are installed. When permitting the traffic barrier to be precast integral with the wall stem, the wall stem design and detailing shall account for the collision load transfer path into the wall stem. Page 8-6

Design of Cantilever Soldier Pile and8.1.4-4 Soldier Pile Tieback Walls Figure 8.1.5.A
Ground Anchors (Tiebacks)
See LRFD-BDS Section 11.9 “Anchored Walls”. The Geotechnical Engineer will determine whether anchors can feasibly be used at a particular site based on the ability to install the anchors and develop anchor capacity. The presence of utilities or other underground facilities, and the ability to attain underground easement rights may also determine whether anchors can be installed. The anchor may consist of bars, wires, or strands. The choice of appropriate type is usually left to the Contractor but may be specified by the designer if special site conditions exist that preclude the use of certain anchor types. In general, strands and wires have advantages with respect to tensile strength, limited work areas, ease of transportation, and storage. However, bars are more easily protected against corrosion, and are easier to develop stress and transfer load. The geotechnical report will provide a reliable estimate of the feasible factored design load of the anchor, recommended anchor installation angles (typically 10 degrees to 45 degrees), no-load zone dimensions, and any other special requirements for wall stability for each project. Both the “tributary area method” and the “hinge method” as outlined in LRFDBDS Section C11.9.5.1 are considered acceptable design procedures to determine the horizontal anchor design force. The capacity of each anchor shall be verified by testing. Testing shall be done during the anchor installation (See Standard Specifications Section 6-17.3(8) and Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03). 1.
Page 8-8
The horizontal anchor spacing typically follows the pile spacing of 6 to 10 feet. The vertical anchor spacing is typically 8 to 12 feet. A minimum spacing of 4 feet in both directions is not recommended because it can cause a loss of effectiveness due to disturbance of the anchors during installation.

Chapter 8
2.
For permanent ground anchors, the anchor design load, T, shall be according to LRFD-BDS. For temporary ground anchors, the anchor design load, T, may ignore extreme event load cases.
3.
The lock-off load is 60 percent of the controlling factored design load for temporary and permanent walls (see Geotechnical Design Manual Chapter 15).
Permanent ground anchors shall have double corrosion protection consisting of an encapsulation-protected tendon bond length as specified in the WSDOT General Special Provisions. Typical permanent ground anchor details are provided in the Appendix 8.1-A1. Temporary ground anchors may have either double corrosion protection consisting of an encapsulation-protected tendon bond length or simple corrosion protection consisting of grout-protected tendon bond length. 8.1.5.B
Design of Soldier Pile (discrete vertical elements)
The soldier piles shall be designed for shear, bending, and axial stresses according to the latest LRFD-BDS and Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03 design criteria. The flexural design shall be based on the elastic section modulus “S” for the entire length of the pile for all Load combinations. The flexural design of soldier piles with tiebacks shall consider the requirements of LRFD-BDS Article 6.10.8.2 and 6.10.3.2. 8.1.5.B.1
Application of Lateral Loads
1.
Lateral loads acting on the back of the wall for the portion of the wall located above the base of excavation, are applied over an effective width equal to the center-tocenter pile spacing. These lateral loads result from horizontal earth pressure, live load surcharge, seismic earth pressure, or any other applicable load.
2.
Lateral loads acting on the back of the pile for the portion of the pile located below the base of excavation, are applied over an effective width equal to the shaft diameter. These lateral loads result from horizontal earth pressure, seismic earth pressure or any other applicable load.
3.
Passive earth pressure is applied over an effective width equal to the smaller of three times the shaft diameter or the center-to-center pile spacing.
8.1.5.B.2
Determining Depth of Pile Embedment
The depth of embedment of soldier piles shall be the maximum embedment as determined from the following; 1.
10 feet
2.
As recommended by the Geotechnical Engineer of Record
3.
As required for skin friction resistance and end bearing resistance.
4.
As required to satisfy factored horizontal force equilibrium and factored moment equilibrium about the bottom of the soldier pile for cantilever soldier piles without permanent ground anchors.
5.
As required to satisfy factored moment equilibrium of factored lateral force about the bottom of the soldier pile for soldier piles with permanent ground anchors.

Soldier Pile Shaft Backfill
Specify controlled density fill (CDF, 145 pcf) or pumpable lean concrete for the full height of the soldier pile shaft when shafts are anticipated to be excavated and concrete placed in the dry. Specify pumpable lean concrete for the full height of the soldier pile shaft when shafts are anticipated to be excavated and concrete placed in the wet. Specify Class 4000P in the embedded portion of the shaft for soldier pile walls that support large vertical loads such as bridge foundations or high permanent ground anchor loads. Class 4000P shall not extend above the bottom of the lagging or permanent fascia. 8.1.5.C
Design of Lagging
Lagging for soldier pile walls, with and without permanent ground anchors, may be comprised of timber, precast concrete, or steel. The expected service life of timber lagging is 20 years which is less than the 75 year service life of structures designed in accordance with LRFD-BDS. The Geotechnical Engineer will specify when lagging shall be designed for an additional 250 psf surcharge due to temporary construction load or traffic surcharge. The lateral pressure transferred from a moment slab shall be considered in the design of soldier pile walls and laggings. All lagging support details shall be shown in the Contract Plans including unique supports details for wall angle points and lagging adjacent to other structures such as culverts, bridge abutments and curtain walls. 8.1.5.C.1
Temporary Timber Lagging
Temporary lagging is based on a maximum 36 month service life before a permanent fascia is applied over the lagging. The wall Design Engineer shall review the Geotechnical Recommendations or consult with the Geotechnical Engineer regarding whether the lagging may be considered as temporary as defined in Standard Specifications Section 6-16.3(6). Temporary timber lagging shall be designed by the contractor in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 6-16.3(6)B. 8.1.5.C.2
Permanent Lagging
Permanent lagging shall be designed for all lateral loads that could occur during the life of the wall in accordance with LRFD-BDS Sections 11.8.5.2 and 11.8.6 for simple spans without soil arching. A reduction factor to account for soil arching effects may be used if permitted by the Geotechnical Engineer. Timber lagging shall be designed in accordance with LRFD-BDS Section 8.6. The size effect factor (CFb) should be considered 1.0, unless a specific size is shown in the wall plans. The wet service factor (CMb) should be considered 0.85 for a saturated condition at some point during the life of the lagging. The load applied to lagging should be applied at the critical depth. The design should include the option for the contractor to step the size of lagging over the height of tall walls, defined as walls over 15 feet in exposed face height.

Chapter 8
Timber lagging designed as a permanent structural element shall consist of treated Douglas Fir-Larch, grade No. 2 or better. Hem-fir wood species, due to the inadequate durability in wet condition, shall not be used for permanent timber lagging. Permanent lagging is intended to last the design life cycle (75 years) of the wall. Timber lagging does not have this life cycle capacity but can be used when both of the following are applicable: 1.
The wall will be replaced within a 20 year period or a permanent fascia will be added to contain the lateral loads within that time period. And,
2. 8.1.5.D
The lagging is visible for inspections during this life cycle. Design of Fascia Panels
Cast-in-place concrete fascia panels shall be designed as a permanent load carrying member in accordance with LRFD-BDS Section 11.8.5.2. Lateral earth pressure loads shall not be reduced for soil arching. For walls without permanent ground anchors the minimum structural thickness of the fascia panels shall be 9 inches. For walls with permanent ground anchors the minimum structural thickness of the fascia panels shall be 14 inches. Architectural treatment of concrete fascia panels shall be indicated in the plans. Concrete strength shall not be less than 4,000 psi at 28 days. The wall fascia shall extend below ground the maximum of the following; 1.
a 2 feet minimum below the finish ground line adjacent to the face of the wall.
2.
3 feet minimum below the lowermost PGA.
3.
2 feet minimum below the scour elevation, unless a greater depth is specified.
When concrete fascia panels are placed on soldier piles, a generalized detail of lagging with strongback (see Bridge Standard Drawing 8.1-A3-5) shall be shown in the plans. This information will assist the contractor in designing formwork that does not overstress the piles while concrete is being placed. Precast concrete fascia panels shall be designed to carry all loads that could occur during the life of the wall. Lateral earth pressure loads shall not be reduced for soil arching. When timber lagging (including pressure treated lumber) is designed to be placed behind a precast element, conventional design practice is to assume that lagging will eventually fail and the load will be transferred to the precast panel. If another type of permanent lagging is used behind the precast fascia panel, then the design of the fascia panel will be controlled by internal and external forces other than lateral pressures from the soil (weight, temperature, Seismic, Wind, etc.). The connections for precast panels to soldier piles shall be designed for all applicable loads and the designer should consider rigidity, longevity (to resist cyclic loading, corrosion, etc.), and load transfer. See Section 5.1.1 for use of shotcrete in lieu of cast-in-place conventional concrete for soldier pile fascia panels. Shotcrete fascia panels may not be suitable in areas where the fascia will be exposed to chlorides. If the fascia may be exposed to chlorides, the reinforcement shall be epoxy coated and the reinforcement clear cover shall be increased.

Preapproved Proprietary Structural Earth Walls
Structural earth (SE) wall systems meeting established WSDOT design and performance criteria have been listed as “pre-approved” by the Bridge and Structures Office and the Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Branch. A list of current pre-approved proprietary wall systems and their limitations is provided in the Geotechnical Design Manual Appendix 15-D. For the SE wall shop drawing review procedure, see the Geotechnical Design Manual Chapter 15. 8.1.6.B
Non-Preapproved Proprietary Structural Earth Walls
Structural earth walls that exceed the limitations as provided in the Geotechnical Design Manual Appendix 15-D are considered to be non-preapproved. Use of non-preapproved structural earth walls shall require the approval of the State Geotechnical Engineer and the State Bridge and Structures Engineer. Use of structural earth walls in marine environments or areas having a soil chemistry or water chemistry that is considered to be aggressive or corrosive shall not be permitted without the approval of the State Geotechnical Engineer and the State Bridge and Structures Engineer. Use of structural earth walls in areas of full or periodic freshwater inundation shall meet the following criteria
8.1.7
1.
Modular block wall facings shall not be used unless the project specific assessment criteria and approval as specified in the Geotechnical Design Manual Section 15-5.3.9 is met.
2.
Welded wire faced structural earth walls shall not be located below the 100 year mean recurrence interval water surface.
3.
The soil and water chemistry shall meet the nonaggressive criteria as described in LRFD-BDS Section 11.10.6.4.2.
4.
Free draining backfill material shall be used below the expected high water elevation.
5.
The number of weep holes shall be increased beyond that required for a standard design.
Design of Standard Plan Geosynthetic Walls Details for construction are given in the Standard Plans Manual Section D. The width “w” of the precast panels as defined in Standard Plan D-3.11 is to be shown on the plan sheets and should be selected considering the architectural requirements for the wall.

Design of the cantilevered portions of the soil nail wall facing which typically occurs at the top, bottom, or ends of the wall shall be in accordance with the requirements of LRFDBDS Section 11.6 for conventional retaining walls.
8.1.9
Design of Shaft Walls Shaft retaining walls are often referred to as cylinder pile walls, secant pile walls, or tangent pile walls. This wall type may be comprised of closely spaced structural concrete shafts or closely spaced structural concrete shafts with interlocking or tangent nonstructural shafts.
8.1.10
Scour of Retaining Walls The foundation for all walls constructed along rivers and streams shall be evaluated during design by the Hydraulics Engineer for total scour in accordance with LRFD-BDS and Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 23 (HEC-23). The bottom of the wall foundation and bottom of wall elements such as, the fascia panel, lagging, leveling pad, footing, pile cap or shaft cap shall be located a minimum of 2 feet below the total scour at the check flood elevation in accordance with the Geotechnical Design Manual Section 15-4.5 unless a greater depth is otherwise specified. In situations where scour (e.g., due to wave or stream erosion) can occur in front of the wall, the bottom of the wall foundation (e.g., structural earth or Geosynthetic wall leveling pad, concrete wall spread footing, the cap for pile or shaft supported walls), and the bottom of fascia panel or lagging, shall meet the minimum embedment requirements relative to the total scour elevation in front of the wall. At any location where a retaining wall or reinforced slope can be in contact with water (such as a culvert outfall, ditch, wetland, lake, river, or floodplain), there is a risk of scour at the toe. The wall designers shall address this risk, based on the Hydraulics Engineer’s assessment of the total scour potential at the wall site. Total Scour includes the amount of streambed vertical elevation drop at a given location due to the removal of streambed material caused by flowing water and the effects of lateral migration. In accordance with LRFD-BDS Section 3.7.5 and Section 2.6.4 consequences of changes in foundation conditions (due to total scour) shall be considered at Extreme Event, Strength, and Service Limit States. Retaining walls or portions of retaining walls that are located within the total scour at scour check flood line of a stream shall be designed to resist scour as shown in Figures 8.1.10-1 and 8.1.10-2. Alternatives for designing retaining walls adjacent to bridge ends for scour and lateral migration could include: 1.
Increasing bridge span lengths or number of spans to move any associated retaining walls beyond the total scour at scour check flood line.
2.
Including revetment or scour countermeasure designs at the bridge ends, and obtaining the permits required for these features. See Figure 8.1.10-3. A. All revetement or scour countermeasures shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the most current version of the HEC-23.

B.
The estimated scour groundline above the scour countermeasure shall extend from the top of the scour countermeasure at an angle equal to the angle of repose. The bottom of wall foundation or element shall be located a minimum of 2 feet below the estimated scour groundline as shown in Figure 8.1.10-3.
Retaining walls associated with Bent-Type Abutments as shown in Figure 7.5.1-4, Isolated Abutments as shown in Figure 7.5.1-5, and Abutments Supported by MSE walls as shown and described in Section 7.5.2, shall be designed for total scour at the design flood. For these situations, the bottom of the retaining wall element or foundation shall be located a minimum of 2 feet below the total scour at scour check flood line as shown in Figures 8.1.10-1 and 8.1.10-2. The permissible modifications to the location of the bottom of wall foundation or element due to the addition of revetments or scour countermeasures does not apply to these design scenarios.

Fall Protection
For retaining walls with exposed wall heights of 4 feet or more, fall protection shall be provided in accordance with WAC 296-880 and as described in the Design Manual Chapter 730. For retaining walls with a fascia, the fall protection shall be located directly on top of the fascia or attached to the back face of the fascia. For retaining walls without a fascia, the fall protection shall be located within 6 inches of the face of the wall. Fall protection shall be required regardless of the location of a traffic barrier placed behind the wall, unless the traffic barrier has a minimum height of 3’-6” and is either a moment slab traffic barrier located on top of the wall or a traffic barrier constructed integral with the top of the wall. The Standard Plan Chain Link Fence Types 3 and 4, and Glare Screen Types 1 and 2 are not considered acceptable fall protection systems. 8.1.11.C
Drainage
Drainage features shall be detailed in the Plans. Permanent drainage systems shall be provided to prevent hydrostatic pressures developing behind the wall. A cut that slopes toward the proposed wall will invariably encounter natural subsurface drainage. Vertical chimney drains or prefabricated drainage mats can be used for normal situations to collect and transport drainage to a weep hole or pipe located at the base of the wall. Installing horizontal drains to intercept the flow at a distance well behind the wall may control concentrated areas of subsurface drainage (see Geotechnical Design Manual Chapter 15).

Chapter 8
Walls and Buried Structures
All reinforced concrete retaining walls shall have 3-inch diameter weepholes located 6 inches above final ground line and spaced about 12 feet apart. In case the vertical distance between the top of the footing and final ground line is greater than 10 feet, additional weepholes shall be provided 6 inches above the top of the footing. No weepholes are necessary in cantilever wingwalls. See Figure 7.5.10-1. Weepholes can get clogged up or freeze up, and the water pressure behind the wall may start to increase. In order to keep the water pressure from building, it is important to have well draining gravel backfill and underdrains. Appropriate details must be shown in the Plans. No underdrain pipe or gravel backfill for drains is necessary behind cantilever wingwalls. A 3 foot minimum vertical layer of gravel backfill shall be placed behind the cantilever wingwalls and shown in the Plans. Backfill for wall, underdrain pipe and gravel backfill for drain are not included in the bridge quantities. The size of the underdrain pipe should not be shown on the bridge plans as this is a Design PE Office item and is subject to change during the design phase. If it is necessary to excavate existing material for the backfill, then this excavation shall be a part of the bridge quantities for “Structure Excavation Class A Incl. Haul”. 8.1.11.D
Expansion, Contraction and Construction Joints
Odd panels for all types of walls shall normally be made up at the ends of the walls. All expansion, contraction and construction joints shall be shown in the plan sheets and are typically shown on the elevation. 8.1.11.D.1
Expansion Joints
For cast-in-place construction, a minimum of ½ inch premolded filler should be specified in the expansion joints. Precast concrete cantilever wall expansion joints shall be in accordance with the Standard Specifications Section 6-11.3(3). For cantilevered and gravity walls, expansion joint spacing in the wall stem shall be a maximum of 60 feet on centers. For cantilevered and gravity walls constructed with a traffic barrier attached to the top, expansion joint spacing in the wall stem shall be consistent with the length determined to be adequate distribution of the traffic collision loading. For counterfort walls, expansion joint spacing in the wall stem shall be a maximum of 32 feet on centers. For soldier pile and soldier pile tieback walls with concrete fascia panels, expansion joint spacing should be 24 to 32 feet on centers. Expansion joints in footings shall align with the expansion joints in the wall stem and shall be spaced at a maximum of 96 feet on centers. The expansion joint in the footing shall have either sleeved dowels across the joint or a shear key as described in Standard Specification Section 6-11.3(3).

Walls and Buried Structures
Chapter 8
Expansion joints in footings shall be provided at the interface between the retaining wall footing and the bridge abutments and where the substructure type changes such as locations where spread footing to pile footing occurs. In these cases, the footing shall be interrupted by a ½ inch premolded expansion joint through both the footing and the wall. Expansion joints at these locations do not require a shear key or sleeved dowels. 8.1.11.D.2
Contraction Joints
Contraction joints shall be spaced at a maximum of 30 feet for wall stems with expansion joints spaced at intervals exceeding 32 feet. 8.1.11.D.3
Construction Joints
Construction joints are only permitted in the footing. The maximum spacing of construction joints in the footing shall be 96 feet. The footing construction joints should have a 6 inch minimum offset from the expansion or contraction joints in the wall stem and footing. 8.1.11.E 1.
Detailing of Standard Reinforced Concrete Retaining Walls In general, the “H” dimension shown in the retaining wall Plans should be in foot increments. Use the actual design “H” reduced to the next lower even foot for dimensions up to 3 inches higher than the even foot. Examples: Actual height = 15′-3″, show “H” = 15′ on design plans
Actual height > 15′-3″, show “H” = 16′ on design plans For walls that are not of a uniform height, “H” should be shown for each segment of the wall between expansion joints or at some other convenient location. On walls with a steep slope or vertical curve, it may be desirable to show 2 or 3 different “H” dimensions within a particular segment. The horizontal distance should be shown between changes in the “H” dimensions. The value for “H” shall be shown in a block in the center of the panel or segment. See Example, Figure 8.1.10-1.

Wall dimensions shall be determined by the designer using the Standard Plans.
5.
Do not show any details given in the Standard Plans.
6.
Specify in the Plans all deviations from the Standard Plans.
7.
Do not detail reinforcing steel, unless it deviates from the Standard Plans.

Noise Barrier Walls
8.2.1
General Design of noise barrier walls shall be based on the requirements and guidance cited herein and in the current LRFD-BDS, LRFD-SGS, WSDOT General & Bridge Special Provisions and the WSDOT Standard Specifications unless otherwise cited herein. Details for construction of the Standard Plan Noise Barrier Walls may be found in Standard Plan D-2.04 through D-2.68 and Standard Specifications Section 6-12. Noise barrier walls are primarily used in urban or residential areas to mitigate noise or to hide views of the roadway. Common types, as shown in the Standard Plans, include castin-place concrete panels (with or without traffic barrier), precast concrete panels (with or without traffic barrier), and masonry blocks. Approval by the State Bridge and Structures Architect is required on all noise barrier wall aesthetics, including finishes, materials, configuration, and top of wall profile.
8.2.2
Loads Noise barrier walls and their components shall be designed for all applicable loads defined in the current LRFD-BDS Chapter 3. Wind loads and on noise barriers shall be as specified in Chapter 3. Seismic load shall be as follows: The effect of earthquake loading on noise barrier walls shall be investigated using the Extreme Event I limit states of LRFD-BDS Table 3.4.1-1 with the load factor γp = 1.0. Seismic loads shall be taken to be horizontal design force effects determined in accordance with the LRFD-BDS provisions of Article 4.7.4.3.3 on the basis of the elastic response coefficient, Csm, specified in Article 3.10.4 and BDM Section 4, and the dead load of sound barrier. The seismic design force effects for connections shall be determined by dividing the force effects resulting from elastic analysis by the response modification factor, R, specified in Table 8.2-1.

Chapter 8
Buried Structures Buried Structure is a generic term for a structure built or assembled inside an excavation employing embankment or trench methods, which works with granular backfill to derive its support from both the structure and the surrounding soil through soil-structure interaction. Buried Structure types considered herein consist of metal structural plate pipes, arches, and boxes, along with composite concrete filled arches, cast-in-place and precast reinforced concrete arches, boxes, split boxes, and three-sided structures.
8.3.1
General Policy Cast-in-place or precast reinforced concrete, composite concrete filled arch, and metal structural plate are authorized materials for Buried Structures. Use of alternate materials, other than reinforced concrete, composite concrete filled arch, and metal structural plate for Buried Structures having a Structural Clear Span of 20.0 feet and greater, requires approval by the WSDOT State Geotechnical Engineer and the WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer. All Buried Structures, regardless of material, shall be designed for a minimum service life of 75 years. Consideration must be given to the degradation of Buried Structure materials resulting from corrosive and abrasive conditions. For hydraulic structures, the invert receives the largest impact due to corrosion and abrasion; however, the surrounding soil properties and groundwater may impact other portions of Buried Structures. The use of different metals, protective linings, increased gauge thickness, or a combination of these methods are common approaches used for metal structures, and additional concrete cover or protective coatings over reinforcing steel are common approaches used for concrete structures to ensure the service life criteria is met. The Structural Clear Span of a Buried Structure shall be used to determine the Buried Structure Class. When supporting a Roadway, the Structural Clear Span shall be defined as the widest horizontal opening from interior face to interior face of the end walls, as measured parallel to Roadway centerline. When not supporting a Roadway, the Structural Clear Span shall be defined as the widest horizontal opening from interior face to interior face of the end walls, as measured perpendicular to the Buried Structure centerline. Structure Class Class 1 Class 2
Structural Clear Span Less than 20.0 feet 20.0 feet and greater
When supporting a Roadway, the Fill Depth shall be defined as the total backfill and surfacing depth above the top of the Buried Structure. When not supporting a Roadway, the Fill Depth shall be defined as the total backfill above the top of the Buried Structure. Buried Structures conveying vehicles, or pedestrians shall consider the applicability of safety systems such as, but not limited to, fire life-safety elements, ventilation, lighting, emergency egress, traffic control, and communications in accordance with Section 8.3.8. Additional provisions other than those cited herein may be specified, on a case-by-case basis, to achieve higher performance criteria for Buried Structures. Where such additional requirements are specified, they shall be site or project specific and shall be tailored to a particular structure type.

For details see Standard Plan C-20.41 and the WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01. The configuration shown in the Standard Plan was crash tested in 2011 by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute (TTI) following the MASH Test 3.11 specifications and reported under the Roadside Safety Research Program Pooled Fund Study No. TPF-5(114), Test Report No. 405160-23-2. 8.3.3.H
Buried Structure Seismic Design
The provisions below are the minimum seismic design requirements for conventional Buried Structures. Additional provisions may be specified, on a case-by-case basis, to achieve higher seismic performance criteria for Buried Structures. Where such additional requirements are specified, they shall be site or project specific and shall be tailored to a particular structure type. Seismic design need not be considered for all Class 1 Buried Structures, and flexible Class 2 Buried Structures comprising metal structural plate pipes, arches, and boxes, except where the structure crosses an active fault. Rigid Class 2 Buried Structures comprising composite concrete filled arch, cast-in-place and precast reinforced concrete arch, box, split box, and three-sided structures shall be designed for seismic effects in accordance with Section 13, Seismic Considerations in the AASHTO Technical Manual for Design and Construction of Road Tunnels – Civil Elements (hereafter referred to as the Technical Manual), with current interims. Seismic design and analysis shall be required for all wingwalls and headwalls. 8.3.3.H.1
Seismic Loading Effects
Buried Structures not excluded from seismic design as denoted above shall be designed in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Road Tunnel Design and Construction Guide Specifications, 1st Edition, 2017, Sections 10.8.3 and 10.8.4 respectively to accommodate the effects resulting from two types of seismic loading:
• Ground Shaking (i.e., transient ground displacement, TGD); and
• Ground Failure (i.e., permanent ground displacement, PGD)
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 8-27
Chapter 8
Walls and Buried Structures
For TGD seismic loads, Buried Structures shall be evaluated using pseudo-static or dynamic soil-structure interaction analysis using a ground displacement approach. The overall effects of seismically induced external earth loading on a Buried Structure causes the structure to deform with the surrounding soil or “rack”. It is, therefore, more reasonable to approach the problem by specifying the loading in terms of deformations. The design goal is to ensure the structure can adequately absorb the imposed racking deformation (i.e., the deformation method), rather than designing to resist a specified dynamic earth pressure (i.e., the force method). For this reasoning, the effects of transient racking or ovaling deformations on Buried Structures in soil or rock, due to the shear distortions of the ground, shall be used to determine the EQ force effects identified in Section 8.3.3.B, in accordance with the Technical Manual, Section 13.5, unless otherwise required in the project-specific criteria. Alternately, a refined analysis utilizing a finite element approach, accounting for free-field displacement and soil-structure interaction may also be used. For PGD seismic loads, the structural designer shall consider the potential for ground failure (e.g., liquefaction, liquefaction induced settlement, downdrag, landslides, and fault displacements) on the function of the Buried Structure. The geotechnical designer shall evaluate the site and soil conditions to provide recommendations based on impacts of seismic geologic hazards including fault rupture, liquefaction, lateral spreading, flow failure, and slope instability, along with estimated loads and deformations acting on the structure, and options to mitigate seismic geological hazards in accordance with the Geotechnical Design Manual. The structural designer shall evaluate, design, and detail all elements for any geological hazards as warranted by the geotechnical engineer. 8.3.3.H.2
Load Combinations for Transient Seismic Motion
The effects of vertically propagating shear waves perpendicular to a Buried Structure’s longitudinal axis produces two independent deformations in the plane of the structure’s cross section that shall be considered: (1) Horizontal racking or ovaling deformations, and (2) inertia forces due to vertical seismic motions. Therefore, these multi-directional effects of the seismic ground motion shall be applied using a percentage combination method. This method accounts for the simultaneous occurrence of earthquake forces in two perpendicular (horizontal and vertical) directions. The percentage combination is accomplished by considering two separate load cases as follows: Load Case 1: EQ = ± EQHoriz. ± γ(EQVert.) Load Case 2: EQ = ± γ(EQHoriz.) ± EQVert. Where, γ is assumed to be 0.30 for rectangular structures, and 0.40 for circular structures. The seismic loads due to racking deformations and vertical seismic motions shall then be combined with non-seismic loads using the load combination and load factors for the Extreme Event I Limit State.

Limit States and Design Methodologies 8.3.5.A
Service Limit State

Total and Differential Settlement
The geotechnical engineer shall perform settlement calculations, evaluating total expected settlement, along with the potential for transverse and longitudinal differential settlement between Buried Structure units, including wingwalls, and provide settlement data and recommendations to the structural designer. The structural engineer shall evaluate, design, and detail all elements for any settlement(s) warranted by the geotechnical engineer. 8.3.5.A.2
Deflection
Concrete structures with less than 2.0 feet of Fill Depth and top slabs that are thinner than specified in LRFD-BDS, Table 2.5.2.6.3-1 may experience excessive differential deflection of adjacent units imposed by vehicular live loads. Excessive differential deflection of the top slab can cause premature deterioration of the wearing surface such as debonding, fracturing or pavement cracking. To mitigate differential deflection between adjacent units the minimum top slab depths stipulated in LRFD-BDS, Table 2.5.2.6.3-1 are required unless computation of deflection indicates that lesser depths may be used without adversely affecting the strength or serviceability of the structure. The vehicular deflection limits for concrete structures in accordance with LRFD-BDS, Section 2.5.2.6.2 may be used to meet these requirements. For concrete structures where the top slab is less than two feet from the Roadway surface, the design shall provide a method of shear transfer between the top slabs of adjacent units to equalize deflections by incorporating at least one of the following:
• Provide a structural connection between adjacent units capable of transferring the imposed shear and equalizing deflections. The structural connection shall include cast-in-place reinforced concrete closures or grouted shear keys.
• Provide a 5.0-inch minimum composite cast-in-place concrete topping, meeting the requirements of a Type 4 Protection System in accordance with Section 5.7.4. Arch-top structures, because of their geometry and interaction with the surrounding soil, do not exhibit significant differential deflections that could cause pavement cracking for structures with less than 2.0 feet of fill. Thus, the requirements for thickness, differential deflection, and shear transfer between adjacent units does not apply.

Extreme Limit State
Extreme Limit State is used to satisfy seismic, check flood, and scour requirements as applicable. 8.3.5.D
Boundary Conditions
Rigid frames are statically indeterminate structures, and as such, require more rigorous analysis than statically determinate structures. This has led to some simplifying assumptions to facilitate rapid computations, which do not capture the inherent advantages of rigid frames, such as continuity, stiffness, and economy, creating inefficiencies in the design. Rigid frame members designed assuming simply supported boundary conditions, produce conservative reinforcement requirements in positive moment regions, and leave negative moment regions with deficiencies in reinforcement requirements. This is not an efficient design approach, because the assumed boundary conditions do not capture the essence of the structure’s behavior. Therefore, to accurately capture a rigid frame’s behavior and eliminate possible reinforcement deficiencies, concrete three-sided structures and box structures shall be analyzed as a rigid frame, applying appropriate boundary conditions. Additionally, the bottom slabs of box structures are entirely supported by the underlying bedding material. Often for ease of computations, the bottom slab of these structures is analyzed as a simply supported beam. Again, this does not capture the structure’s behavior efficiently, and tends to leave reinforcement deficiencies in negative moment regions. Analyzing the slab supported on an elastic foundation is a more appropriate approach. This type of analysis can be achieved using the modulus of subgrade reaction, as determined by the geotechnical engineer, to determine a spring constant, and applying a series of compression springs along the bottom slab of the structure. To effectively capture this soil-structure interaction behavior, the bottom slab of box structures shall be analyzed on an elastic foundation. Alternately, assuming a uniform or trapezoidal support reaction, can sufficiently capture the soil-structure interaction behavior for the design of the bottom slab of box structures.

Structural Modeling
8.3.5.E.1
Three-Sided Structures
Should be modeled as a rigid frame, chorded arch, or arch with pin or fixed support reactions as applicable. 8.3.5.E.2
Split Box Structures
Should be modeled as shown in Figure 8.3.5.E-2. There are two primary boundary condition functions that need to be addressed within the model. The first function should be to maintain global stability, therefore the bottom left node is restrained in the global x direction. The second function should be to provide displacement-dependent resistance to vertical loads by supporting the structure with compression springs. The hinges shown in the model corresponds to the joints between the upper and lower segments. Due to the behavior of a shiplap joint, capable of transferring shear in only one direction but not moment, the shear output from both joints should be added together and applied to a single joint for design. Figure 8.3.5.E-2
Split Box on an Elastic Foundation Model
Nodes should be placed at points of interest such as corners, fillet/uniform cross-section interface locations, and midspan of members. Additional nodes should be placed along the bottom element of the model and restrained using compression springs in the global y direction. The spring constant (stiffness of ground spring) in the beam-spring model is used in the development of the compression springs and shall be computed by multiplying the moduli of subgrade reaction with the tributary area at the corresponding node as follows: K=ksb Where: K = Compression Spring Constant k = Modulus of Subgrade Reaction s = Tributary Length Associated with a Node b = Unit Slab Width

Alternatively, the upper flat slab unit (superstructure) may be analyzed using PGSuper with the bearing reactions applied to the lower unit as an external axial load on a per foot basis. Additionally, in lieu of a racking analysis, earthquake loads, and bearing shear forces could be applied to the lower unit as described in Section 7.5.4.D, and 7.5.4.E respectively.

H1 = Height of Tapered Wall of upper unit, and H2 = Height of Tapered Wall of lower unit, shall be varied in 1’-0” increments from a minimum of 0’-0” to a maximum of 10’-0” (max. includes Fillet Height). If project limitations require a dimension between 1’-0” increments, the designer is encouraged to contact precast manufacturers for available options. TT = Thickness of Top Slab, and TB = Thickness of Bottom Slab, shall be varied in 2.0” increments from a minimum of 10.0” to a maximum of 24.0”. F = Fillet, shall be 17.0” x 17.0”.

The distribution of wheel loads through earth fill shall be in accordance with LRFD-BDS, Section 3.6.1.2.6 as follows; Where the depth of fill is:
• Less than 2.0 feet, live load shall be distributed to the top slab in accordance with LRFD-BDS, Section 4.6.2.10 as axle loads.
• 2.0 feet or greater, live load shall be distributed to the top slab in accordance with LRFD-BDS, Section 3.6.1.2.6 as wheel loads and shall consider interaction effects. 8.3.6.A.3
Joint Design and Details
Joints shall be designed to carry the applied horizontal and vertical forces, and so formed that they can be assembled to transmit those forces and provide joint tightness consistent with tolerances outlined in the Contract Documents.
• Vertical Joints (See Figure 8.3.6.A-1): Joints between adjacent units shall be designed for the applied lateral forces identified in Section 8.3.3.B.
• Horizontal Joints (See Figure 8.3.6.A-1): Transverse joints between the upper units and lower units shall be designed for the applied lateral forces identified in Section 8.3.3.B. Longitudinal joints in the bottom slab shall be designed for the applied vertical forces identified in Section 8.3.3.B, in addition to any differential settlement as warranted by the geotechnical engineer. Longitudinal joints in the top slab shall be designed for the applied vertical forces identified in Section 8.3.3.B, in addition to any differential settlement as warranted by the geotechnical engineer and shall incorporate a method of shear transfer between adjacent units in accordance with Section 8.3.5.A.2 as applicable. All joints shall be detailed employing a bell & spigot (a.k.a. a tongue & groove, or shiplap) connection. See Bridge Standard Drawing 8.3-A2-5 for joint details. Alternate joint types may be proposed addressing applied forces, differential settlement between segments, live load deflection, shear transfer, and prevention of water and soil migration through the joint. If an alternate joint design is accepted, it shall have equal or greater capacity as the joint shown on the Contract Plans. The designer shall provide a note on the Plans stating the capacity of the joint detailed. Example Note: “This joint has been detailed and designed to resist ___ kips of shear per linear foot of joint”. Each joint shall be sealed to prevent exfiltration or infiltration of soil fines or water. Field tests may be required by the Engineer whenever there is a question regarding compliance. See Bridge Standard Drawing 8.3-A2-7 for joint sealing details. As shown in Figure 8.3.6.A-3, joints shall be detailed such that the laying of sections on the prepared bedding material should start at the outlet, and with the bell (or groove) end pointing upstream or ahead on stationing, and the spigot (or tongue) end pointing downstream or back on stationing, with installation proceeding toward the inlet end to facilitate placement during construction and prevent undermining of downstream units at the joints for hydraulic structures in service.

Precast Box Joint Details to Facilitate Installation
The orientation of the bell and spigot should alternate between the bottom units and the top units. This alternating orientation is preferred, as it provides the most flexibility to facilitate staged construction requirements and has an inherent placement advantage during construction. If staging is not necessary, projects may incorporate an optional alternate detail to allow alignment of the vertical bell and spigot joint between the top and bottom units. The installation sequence is this aligned configuration should be such that the bottom segments are installed in the direction of stationing, whereas the top units should be installed in the reverse direction to alleviate constructability issues from trying to slide a bell end under a spigot. 8.3.6.B
Concrete Three-Sided Structures
Three-Sided Structures are rigid frame, chorded arch, and arch structures which may have open inverts, and are supported by concrete foundation units consisting of a footing and possibly a stem wall. Three-Sided Structures shall be designed and constructed in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 6-20. 8.3.6.B.1
Precast Geometric Limitations
Rigid Three-Sided Structures with span lengths ranging from 8.0 feet up to 35.0 feet, contain the same geometric limitations that should be considered when establishing a structure’s geometry as outlined in Section 8.3.6.A-1. Three-Sided Structures with geometries matching WSDOT’s current Buried Structure series FC30 – FC40, and VC45 – VC60 should maintain the geometrics identified on Bridge Standard Drawing 8.3-A1. If project limitations require alternate dimensions, the designer is encouraged to contact precast manufacturers for available options.

Design of Metal Structural Plate Structures
Metal structural plate structures considered herein comprise pipe, arch and box structures defined as:
• Structural Plate Pipe: A steel or aluminum structural plate around the entire circumference of a pipe shape. Structural plate pipes may contain multiple radiuses and plate thicknesses. Structural plate pipe shapes include but are not limited to round, ellipse, underpass, pipe-arch and pear.
• Structural Plate Arch: A steel or aluminum structural plate arch shape placed on reinforced concrete foundations. Structural plate arches may contain multiple radiuses and plate thicknesses.
• Structural Plate Box: A steel or aluminum structural plate box shape that meets the requirements or the LRFD-BDS, Section 12.9 placed on reinforced concrete foundations. Design and construction of metal structural plate structures shall conform to the LRFDBDS, Section 12, and the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Construction Specifications, Section 26. Steel structural plate shall not be used in locations conforming to Marine or Non-Marine: Corrosive environments as defined in Section 6.7.1. Minimum backfill cover over the top of the Buried Structure shall be in accordance with the LRFD-BDS. Where aluminum will contact concrete or grout, two coats of paint shall be applied to the aluminum at the contact surface in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 7-08.3(2)D.
8.3.7
Design of Detention Vaults Detention vaults are used for stormwater storage and are to be watertight. These structures can be open at the top like a swimming pool, or completely enclosed and buried below ground. Detention vaults shall be designed in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications (LRFD-BDS) and the following: Seismic design effects shall satisfy the requirements of ACI 350.3-06 “Seismic Design of Liquid-Containing Concrete Structures”. Requirements for Joints and jointing shall satisfy the requirements of ACI 350-06. Two references for tank design are the PCA publications Rectangular Concrete Tanks, Revised 5th Edition (1998) and Design of Liquid-Containing Structures for Earthquake Forces (2002). The geotechnical field investigations and recommendations shall comply with the requirements given in Section 8.16 of the Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03. In addition to earth pressures, water tables, seismic design, and uplift, special consideration should be given to ensure differential settlement either does not occur or is included in the calculations for forces, crack control and water stops. Buoyant forces from high ground water conditions should be investigated for permanent as well as construction load cases so the vault does not float. Controlling loading conditions may include backfilling an empty vault, filling the vault with stormwater before it is backfilled, or seasonal maintenance that requires draining the vault when there is a high water table. In all Limit States, the buoyancy force (WA) load factor shall be taken as γWA = 1.25 in LRFD-BDS, Table 3.4.1-1. In the Strength Limit State, the load factors that resist buoyancy (γDC, γDW, γES, Etc.) shall be their minimum values, in accordance with LRFD-BDS, Table 3.4.1-2 and the entire vault shall be considered empty.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 8-39
Chapter 8
Walls and Buried Structures
During the vault construction, the water table shall be taken as the seal vent elevation or the top of the vault, if open at the top. In this case the load factors that resist buoyancy shall be their minimum values, except where specified as a construction load, in accordance with LRFD-BDS, Section 3.4.2. In certain situations, tie-downs may be required to resist buoyancy forces. The resisting force (Rn) and resistance factors (ø) for tie-downs shall be provided by the Geotechnical Engineers. The buoyancy check shall be as follows: For Buoyancy without Tie-Downs: (RRES / RUPLIFT) ≥ 1.0 For Buoyancy with Tie-Downs: (RRES / [RUPLIFT + øRn]) ≥ 1.0 Where: RRES = │γDC DC + γDW DW + γES ES + γi Qi│ RUPLIFT = │γWA WA│
ACI 350-06 has stricter criteria for cover and spacing of joints than the LRFD-BDS. Cover is not to be less than 2 inches (ACI 7.7.1), no metal or other material is to be within 1½ inches from the formed surface, and the maximum bar spacing shall not exceed 12 inches (ACI 7.6.5). Crack control criteria is in accordance with LRFD-BDS, Section 5.6.7 with γe = 0.5 (in order to maintain a crack width of 0.0085 inches, in accordance with the commentary of 5.6.7). Joints in the vault’s top slab, bottom slab and walls shall allow dissipation of temperature and shrinkage stresses, thereby reducing cracking. The amount of temperature and shrinkage reinforcement is a function of reinforcing steel grade “and length between joints (ACI Table 7.12.2-1). All joints shall have a shear key and a continuous and integral PVC waterstop with a 4-inch minimum width. The purpose of the waterstop is to prevent water infiltration and exfiltration. Joints having welded shear connectors with grouted keyways shall use details from WSDOT Precast Prestressed Slab Details or approved equivalent, with weld ties spaced at 4′-0″ on center. Modifications to the above joints shall be justified with calculations. Calculations shall be provided for all grouted shear connections. The width of precast panels shall be increased to minimize the number of joints between precast units. For cast-in-place walls in contact with liquid that are over 10′ in height, the minimum wall thickness is 12″. This minimum thickness is generally good practice for all external walls, regardless of height, to allow for 2 inches of cover as well as space for concrete placement and vibration. After the forms are placed, the void left from the form ties shall be coned shaped, at least 1 inch in diameter and 1½ inches deep, to allow proper patching. Detention vaults that need to be located within the prism supporting the Roadway are required to meet the following maintenance criteria. A by-pass piping system is required. Each cell in the vault shall hold no more than 1200 gallons of water to facilitate maintenance and cleanout operations. Baffles shall be watertight. Access hatches shall be spaced no more than 50 feet apart. There shall be an access near both the inlet and Page 8-40

the outfall. These two accesses shall allow for visual inspection of the inlet and outfall elements, in such a manner that a person standing on the ladder, out of any standing water, will be in reach of any grab handles, grates or screens. All other access hatches shall be over sump areas. All access hatches shall be a minimum 36 inch in diameter, have ladders that extend to the vault floor, and shall be designed to resist HL-93 live loads with applicable impact factors as described below. Detention vaults that need to be located in the Roadway shall be oriented so that the access hatches are located outside the traveled lanes. Lane closures are usually required next to each access hatch for maintenance and inspection, even when the hatches are in 12′-0″ wide shoulders. A 16-kip wheel load having the dynamic load allowance for deck joints, in LRFD-BDS, Table 3.6.2.1-1, shall be applied at the top of access hatches and risers. The load path of this impact force shall be shown in the calculations. Minimum vault dimensions shall be 4′-0″ wide and 7′-0″ tall, inside dimensions. Original signed plans of all closed top detention vaults with access shall be forwarded to the Bridge Plans Engineer in the Bridge Projects Unit. This ensures that the Bridge Preservation Office will have the necessary inventory information for inspection requirements. A set of plans must be submitted to both the WSDOT Hydraulics Office and the Regional WSDOT Maintenance Office for plans approval.
8.3.8
Design of Tunnels Tunnels are unique structures in that the surrounding ground material is the structural material that carries most of the ground load. Therefore, geology has even more importance in tunnel construction than with above ground bridge structures. In short, geotechnical site investigation is the most important process in planning, design and construction of a tunnel. These structures are designed in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, AASHTO LRFD Road Tunnel Design and Construction Guide Specifications, 1st Edition, 2017 with current interims and AASHTO Technical Manual for Design and Construction of Roadway Tunnels - Civil Elements. Tunnels are not a conventional structure, and estimation of costs is more variable as size and length increase. Ventilation, safety access, fire suppression facilities, warning signs, lighting, emergency egress, drainage, operation and maintenance are extremely critical issues associated with the design of tunnels and will require the expertise of geologists, tunnel experts and mechanical engineers. For motor vehicle fire protection, a standard has been produced by the National Fire Protection Association. NFPA 502 – Standard for Road Tunnels, Bridges, and Other Limited Access Highways (NFPA 502). This document shall be used for all WSDOT tunnels. NFPA 502, uses tunnel length to dictate minimum fire protection requirements: 300 feet or less: no fire protection requirements 300 to 800 feet: minor fire protection requirements 800 feet or more: major fire protection requirements

Some recent WSDOT tunnel projects are: I-90 Mt. Baker Ridge Tunnel Bore Contract: 3105 Bridge No.: 90/24N This 1,500-foot-long tunnel is part of the major improvement of Interstate 90. Work was started in 1983 and completed in 1988. The net interior diameter of the bored portion, which is sized for vehicular traffic on two levels with a bike/pedestrian corridor on the third level, is 63.5 feet. The project is the world’s largest diameter tunnel in soft ground, which is predominantly stiff clay. Construction by a stackeddrift method resulted in minimal distortion of the liner and insignificant disturbance at the ground surface above. Jct. I-5 SR 526 E-N Tunnel Ramp Contract: 4372 Bridge No.: 526/22E-N This 465-foot-long tunnel, an example of the cut and cover method, was constructed in 1995. The interior dimensions were sized for a 25-foot-wide one lane ramp Roadway with a vertical height of 18 feet. The tunnel was constructed in three stages. 3- and 4-foot diameter shafts for the walls were placed first, a 2-foot-thick cast-in-place top slab was placed second and then the tunnel was excavated, lined and finished. I-5 Sleater-Kinney Bike/Ped. Tunnel Contract: 6031 Bridge No.: 5/335P This 122-foot-long bike and pedestrian tunnel was constructed in 2002 to link an existing path along I-5 under busy Sleater-Kinney Road. The project consisted of precast prestressed slab units and soldier pile walls. Construction was staged to minimize traffic disruptions.

Expansion Joints
9.1.1
General Considerations All bridges must accommodate, in some manner, environmentally and self-imposed phenomena that tend to make structures move in various ways. These movements come from several primary sources: thermal variations, concrete shrinkage, creep effects from prestressing, and elastic post-tensioning shortening. With the exception of elastic post-tensioning shortening, which generally occurs before expansion devices are installed, movements from these primary phenomena are explicitly calculated for expansion joint selection and design. Other movement inducing phenomena include live loading (vertical and horizontal braking), wind, seismic events, and foundation settlement. Movements associated with these phenomena are generally either not calculated or not included in total movement calculations for purposes of determining expansion joint movement capacity. With respect to seismic movements, it is assumed that some expansion joint damage may occur, that this damage is tolerable, and that it will be subsequently repaired. In cases where seismic isolation bearings are used, the expansion joints must accommodate seismic movements in order to allow the isolation bearings to function properly. Expansion joints must accommodate cyclic and long-term structure movements in such a way as to minimize imposition of secondary stresses in the structure. Expansion joint devices must prevent water, salt, and debris infiltration to substructure elements below. Additionally, an expansion joint device must provide a relatively smooth riding surface over a long service life. Expansion joint devices are highly susceptible to vehicular impact that results as a consequence of their inherent discontinuity. Additionally, expansion joints have often been relegated a lower level of importance by both designers and contractors. Many of the maintenance problems associated with in-service bridges relate to expansion joints. One solution to potential maintenance problems associated with expansion joints is to use construction procedures that eliminate the joints from the bridge deck. The two most commonly used methods are called integral and semi-integral construction. These two terms are sometimes collectively referred to as jointless bridge construction. In integral construction, concrete end diaphragms are cast monolithically with both the bridge deck and supporting pile substructure. In order to minimize secondary stresses induced in the superstructure, steel piles are generally used in their weak axis orientation relative to the direction of bridge movement. In semi-integral construction, concrete end diaphragms are cast monolithically with the bridge deck. Supporting girders rest on elastomeric bearings within an L-type abutment. Longer semi-integral bridges generally have reinforced concrete approach slabs at their ends. Approach slab anchors, in conjunction with a compression seal device, connect the monolithic end diaphragm to the approach slab. Longitudinal movements are accommodated by diaphragm movement relative to the approach slab, but at the same time resisted by soil passive pressure against the end diaphragm.

Bearings and Expansion Joints
Obviously, bridges cannot be built incrementally longer without eventually requiring expansion joint devices. The incidence of approach pavement distress problems increases markedly with increased movement that must be accommodated by the end diaphragm pressing against the backfill. Approach pavement distress includes pavement and backfill settlement and broken approach slab anchors. Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has implemented jointless bridge design by using semi-integral construction. Office policy for concrete and steel bridge design is as follows: 9.1.1.A
Concrete Bridges
Semi-integral design is used for prestressed concrete girder bridges under 450 feet long and for post-tensioned spliced concrete girder and cast-in-place post-tensioned concrete box girder bridges under 400 feet long. Use L-type abutments with expansion joints at the bridge ends where bridge length exceeds these values. In situations where bridge skew angles exceed 30 degrees, consult the Bearing and Expansion Joint Specialist and the State Bridge Design Engineer for recommendations and approval. 9.1.1.B
Steel Bridges
Use L-type abutments with expansion joints at the ends for multiple-span bridges. Semiintegral construction may be used in lieu of expansion joints for single span bridges under 300 feet with the approval of the State Bridge Design Engineer. In situations where the bridge skew exceeds 30 degrees, consult the Bearing and Expansion Joint Specialist and the State Bridge Design Engineer for recommendations and approval. In all instances, the use of intermediate expansion joints should be avoided wherever possible. The following table provides guidance regarding maximum bridge superstructure length beyond which the use of either intermediate expansion joints or modular expansion joints at the ends is required. Superstructure Type Prestressed Girder* P.T. Spliced Girder** C.I.P.–P.T. box girder Plate Girder Box girder

This condition is acceptable if the gland is already installed when steel shapes are placed in the blockout. Otherwise (for example, staged construction) the gland would need to be installed at temperature less than 45º F.
Because the movement restriction imposed by a bearing must be compatible with the movements allowed by the adjacent expansion joint, expansion joints and bearings must be designed interdependently and in conjunction with the anticipated behavior of the overall structure.

Chapter 9
A plethora of manufactured devices exists to accommodate a wide range of expansion joint total movements. Expansion joints can be broadly classified into three categories based upon their total movement range as follows: Small Movement JointsTotal Movement Range < 1¾ in. Medium Movement Joints1¾ in. < Total Movement Range < 5 in. Large Movement JointsTotal Movement Range > 5 in.
9.1.2
General Design Criteria Expansion joints must be sized to accommodate the movements of several primary phenomena imposed upon the bridge following installation of its expansion joint devices. Concrete shrinkage, thermal variation, and long-term creep are the three most common primary sources of movement. Calculation of the movements associated with each of these phenomena must include the effects of superstructure type, tributary length, fixity condition between superstructure and substructure, and pier flexibilities. 9.1.2.A
Shrinkage Effects
Accurate calculation of shrinkage as a function of time requires that average ambient humidity, volume-to-surface ratios, and curing methods be taken in consideration as summarized in AASHTO LRFD BDS Article 5.4.2.3.3. Because expansion joint devices are generally installed in their respective blockouts at least 30 to 60 days following concrete deck placement, they must accommodate only the shrinkage that occurs from that time onward. For most situations, that shrinkage strain can be assumed to be 0.0002 for normal weight concrete in an unrestrained condition. This value must be corrected for restraint conditions imposed by various superstructure types. ΔLshrink= β · μ · Ltrib
(9.1.2-1)
Where: Ltrib = Tributary length of the structure subject to shrinkage β = Ultimate shrinkage strain after expansion joint installation; estimated as 0.0002 in lieu of more refined calculations μ = Restraint factor accounting for the restraining effect imposed by superstructure elements installed before the concrete slab is cast = 0.0 for steel girders, 0.5 for precast prestressed concrete girders, 0.8 for concrete box girders and T-beams, 1.0 for concrete flat slabs
9.1.2.B
Thermal Effects
Bridges are subject to all modes of heat transfer: radiation, convection, and conduction. Each mode affects the thermal gradients induced and deflection patterns generated in a bridge superstructure differently. Climatic influences vary geographically resulting in different seasonal and diurnal average temperature variations. Additionally, different types of construction have different thermal “inertia” properties. For example, a massive concrete box girder bridge will be much slower to respond to an imposed thermal stimulus than would a steel plate girder bridge composed of many relatively thin steel elements. Variation in the superstructure average temperature produces uniform elongation or shortening. Uniform thermal movement range is calculated using the maximum and minimum anticipated bridge superstructure average temperatures in accordance with AASHTO LRFD BDS Article 3.12.2.1 Procedure A. For the purpose of establishing the maximum and minimum design temperatures using Procedure A, most of western WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Bearings and Expansion Joints
Washington is classified as a moderate climate. Eastern Washington and higher elevation areas of western Washington having more than 14 days per year with an average temperature below 32˚F are classified as a cold climate. The maximum and minimum design temperatures, TU and TL, respectively, used for uniform thermal movement effects, taken from AASHTO LRFD BDS Table 3.12.2.1-1 are: Moderate Climate: Concrete Bridges: Steel Bridges:
10˚F to 80˚F 0˚F to 120˚F
Cold Climate: Concrete Bridges: Steel Bridges:
0˚F to 80˚F
-30˚F to 120˚F
Total unfactored thermal movement range is then calculated as: ΔLtemp = α · Ltrib · δT
(9.1.2-2)
Where: Ltrib = Tributary length of the structure subject to thermal variation α = Coefficient of thermal expansion; 0.000006 in./in./˚F for concrete and 0.0000065 in./ in./˚F for steel δT = Bridge superstructure average temperature range as a function of bridge type and location
As noted in AASHTO LRFD BDS Article 3.4.1, the larger of the two load factors for uniform temperature, γTU, provided in AASHTO LRFD BDS Table 3.4.1-1 shall be used to calculate factored uniform thermal movements. Design of expansion joints requires calculation of the maximum and minimum temperatures associated with the factored temperature range. Assuming that the unfactored and factored temperature range are centered upon each other, the factored minimum and maximum design temperatures are:
Where Tmin Tmax TL TU ƔTU
Tmin = .5 · (TL + TU) - .5 · ƔTU · (TU - TL) Tmax = .5 · (TL + TU) + .5 · ƔTU · (TU – TL)
= Minimum factored design temperature = Maximum factored design temperature = Minimum (unfactored) design temperature = Maximum (unfactored) design temperature = Load Factor as specified in AASHTO LRFD BDS
In accordance with the Standard Specifications, contract drawings state dimensions at the normal temperature of 64˚F unless specifically noted otherwise. Construction and fabrication activities at average temperatures other than 64˚F require the Contractor or fabricator to adjust lengths of structural elements and concrete forms accordingly. Some expansion joint devices are installed in pre-formed concrete blockouts sometime after the completion of the bridge deck. The expansion joint device must be cast into its respective blockout with a gap setting corresponding to the ambient superstructure average temperature at the time the blockouts are filled with concrete. In order to accomplish this, expansion device gap settings must be specified on the contract drawings as a function of superstructure ambient average temperature. Generally, these settings are specified for temperatures of 40˚F, 64˚F, and 80˚F. Page 9-4

Chapter 9
Small Movement Range Joints Elastomeric compression seals, poured sealants, asphaltic plugs, pre-formed closed cell foam, epoxy-bonded elastomeric glands, steel sliding plates, and bolt-down elastomeric panels have all been used in the past for accommodating small movement ranges. The current policy is to use compression seals and rapid-cure silicone sealants almost exclusively. 9.1.3.A
Compression Seals
Compression seals are continuous manufactured elastomeric elements, typically with extruded internal web systems, installed within an expansion joint gap to effectively seal the joint against water and debris infiltration. Compression seals are held in place by mobilizing friction against adjacent vertical joint faces. Design philosophy requires that they be sized and installed to always be in a state of compression. Compression seals can be installed against smooth vertical concrete faces or against steel armoring. When installed against concrete, special concrete nosing material having enhanced impact resistance may be used, particularly on rehabilitation projects. Polyester concrete and elastomeric concrete have been used successfully. Consult the Bearing and Expansion Joint Specialist for current policy. Each elastomeric compression seal shall be furnished and installed as a single, continuous piece across the full width of the bridge deck. No field splices of the compression seal shall be allowed. For widening projects, a new compression seal shall be furnished and installed as a single, continuous piece across the full width of the original and widened portions of the roadway. Field splicing to the original elastomeric compression seal shall not be allowed. Figure 9.1.3-1
Compression Seal Joint
In design calculations, the minimum and maximum compressed widths of the seal are generally set at 40 percent and 85 percent of the uncompressed width. These measurements are perpendicular to the joint axis. It is generally assumed that the compressed seal width at the normal construction temperature of 64˚F is 60 percent of WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 9-5
Chapter 9
Bearings and Expansion Joints
its uncompressed width. For skewed joints, bridge deck movement must be separated into components perpendicular to and parallel to the joint axis. Shear displacement of the compression seal should be limited to a specified percentage of its uncompressed width, usually set at about 22 percent. Additionally, the expansion gap width should be set so that the compression seal can be replaced over a reasonably wide range of construction temperatures. Manufacturers’ catalogues generally specify the minimum expansion gap widths into which specific size compression seals can be installed. The expansion gap width should be specified on the contract drawings as a function of the superstructure average temperature. Compression seal movement design relationships can be expressed as: ΔLtemp-normal = ΔLtemp · cos θ [thermal movement normal to joint] ΔLtemp-parallel = ΔLtemp · sin θ [thermal movement parallel to joint]
ΔLshrink-normal = ΔLshrink · cos θ [shrinkage movement normal to joint] ΔLshrink-parallel = ΔLshrink · sin θ [shrinkage movement parallel to joint] Wmin
Wmax
= Winstall - [(Tmax - Tinstall)/(Tmax - Tmin)] · ΔLtemp-normal > 0.40 · W
= Winstall + [(Tinstall - Tmin)/(Tmax - Tmin)] · ΔLtemp-normal + ΔLshrink-normal < 0.85 · W
Where: θ = skew angle of the expansion joint, measured with respect to a line perpendicular to the bridge longitudinal axis W = uncompressed width of the compression seal Winstall = expansion gap width at installation Tinstall = superstructure temperature at installation Wmin = minimum expansion gap width Wmax = maximum expansion gap width Tmin = minimum superstructure average temperature Tmax = maximum superstructure average temperature
Algebraic manipulation yields: W > (ΔLtemp-normal + ΔLshrink-normal)/0.45 W > (ΔLtemp-parallel + ΔLshrink-parallel)/0.22 Now, assuming Winstall = 0.6 ⋅ W, Wmax = 0.6 ⋅ W + [(Tinstall - Tmin)/(Tmax - Tmin)] ⋅ ΔLtemp-normal + ΔLshrink-normal < 0.85 ⋅ W Rearranging yields: W > 4 ⋅ [(Tinstall - Tmin)/(Tmax - Tmin) ⋅ ΔLtemp-normal + ΔLshrink-normal] Design Example: Given: A reinforced concrete box girder bridge has a total length of 200 feet. A compression seal expansion joint at each abutment will accommodate half of the total bridge movement. The abutments and expansion joints are skewed 15°. This bridge is located in coastal western Washington, which is classified as a moderate climate in AASHTO LRFD BDS Article 3.12.2.1. Find: Required compression seal size and construction gap widths at 40˚F, 64˚F, and 80˚F.

Solution: Step 1: Calculate factored temperature and shrinkage movement. AASHTO LRFD BDS Table 3.12.2.1-1 identifies the design temperature range for a concrete bridge in a moderate climate as being 10˚F to 80˚F. AASHTO LRFD BDS Table 3.4.1-1 identifies the appropriate load factors as being 1.0 for shrinkage (SH) and 1.20 for uniform thermal (TU) effects. Temperature: ΔLtemp = ½(.000006)(80˚F – 10˚F)(200′)(12″/′)(1.20)= 0.60″ Shrinkage: ΔLshrink = ½(.0002)(0.8)(200′)(12″/′)(1.0)= 0.19″ Total deck movement at the joint:= 0.79″ ΔLtemp-normal + ΔLshrink-normal = (0.79″)(cos 15°) = 0.76″ ΔLtemp-parallel + ΔLshrink-parallel = (0.79″)(sin 15°) = 0.20″ Step 2: Determine compression seal width required. W > 0.76″/0.45 = 1.69″ W > 0.20″/0.22 = 0.91″ Calculate the maximum and minimum temperatures associated with the factored temperature range: Tmin = .5(10˚F + 80˚F) - .5(1.20)(80˚F - 10˚F) = 3˚F Tmax = .5(10˚F + 80˚F) + .5(1.20)(80˚F - 10˚F) = 87˚F W > 4[(64˚F–3˚F)/(87˚F–3˚F) ⋅ (0.60″) + 0.19″] (cos 15˚) = 2.42″ →Use a 3″ compression seal Step 3: Evaluate construction gap widths for various temperatures for a 3 inch compression seal. Construction width at 64˚F = 0.6(3″) = 1.80″ Construction width at 40˚F = 1.80″ + [(64˚F – 40˚F)/(87˚F - 3˚F)] ⋅ (0.60″) ⋅ (cos 15″) = 2.00″ Construction width at 80˚F = 1.80″ - [(80˚F – 64˚F)/(87˚F - 3˚F)] ⋅ (0.60″) ⋅ (cos 15″) = 1.67″ Conclusion: Use a 3-inch compression seal. Construction gap widths for installation at temperatures of 40˚F, 64˚F, and 80˚F are 2 inches, 1-¾ inches, and 1-⅝ inches, respectively. 9.1.3.B
Rapid-Cure Silicone Sealants
Durable low-modulus poured sealants provide watertight expansion joint seals in both new construction and rehabilitation projects. Most silicone sealants possess good elastic performance over a wide range of temperatures while demonstrating high levels of resistance to ultraviolet and ozone degradation. Other desirable properties include selfleveling and self-bonding characteristics. Rapid-cure silicone sealants are particularly good candidates for rehabilitation in situations where significant traffic disruption consequential to extended traffic lane closure is unacceptable. Additionally, unlike compression seals, rapid-cure silicone sealants do not require straight, parallel substrate surfaces in order to create a watertight seal.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 9-7
Chapter 9
Bearings and Expansion Joints
Rapid-cure silicone sealants can be installed against either concrete or steel. It is extremely critical that concrete or steel substrates be thoroughly cleaned before the sealant is installed. Some manufacturers require application of specific primers onto substrate surfaces prior to sealant installation in order to enhance bonding. Consult the Bearing and Expansion Joint Specialist for specifics. Figure 9.1.3-2
Rapid-cure Silicone Sealants Joint
Rapid-cure silicone sealants should be designed based upon the manufacturer’s recommendations. Maximum and minimum working widths of the poured sealant joint are generally recommended as a percentage of the sealant width at installation. Depending upon the manufacturer, these joints can accommodate tensile movements of up to 100 percent and compressive movements of up to 50 percent of the sealant width at installation. A minimum recess is typically required between the top of the roadway surface and the top of the sealant surface. This recess is critical in assuring that tires will not contact the top surface of the sealant and initiate its debonding from substrate material. It is important to recognize that the maximum allowable opening and closing design movements are a function of the joint width at the time the sealant is poured. As such, consideration should be given that the poured sealant can be installed over a reasonably wide range of construction temperatures and still perform, over the full factored uniform temperature range, within the allowable movement limits recommended by the manufacturer. In some instances, it may be necessary to stipulate that the Contractor install the sealant within a more restrictive range of bridge temperatures than the commonly assumed 40˚F to 80˚F.

Design Example: Given: An existing 25-year-old 160 foot long single span prestressed concrete girder bridge is scheduled for a concrete overlay. The existing compression seals at each nonskewed abutment are in poor condition, although the existing concrete edges on each side of each expansion joint are in relatively good condition. The expansion gaps at these abutments are 1 inch wide at a normal temperature of 64˚F. Assume that each expansion joint will accommodate half of the total bridge movement. This bridge is located near a mountain pass in western Washington, where it is reasonable to expect that there are at least 14 days per year with an average temperature below 32˚F. Therefore, it is classified as a cold climate in AASHTO LRFD BDS Article 3.12.2.1. Find: Determine the feasibility of reusing the existing 1 inch expansion gaps for a rapid cure silicone sealant system retrofit. Assume that the sealant will be installed at an average superstructure temperature between 40˚F and 80˚F. Manufacturer’s recommendations state that Sealant A can accommodate 100 percent extension and 50 percent contraction and that Sealant B can accommodate 50 percent extension and 50 percent contraction.

Solution: Step 1: Calculate future factored temperature, shrinkage, and creep movements. AASHTO LRFD BDS Table 3.12.2.1-1 identifies the design temperature range for a concrete bridge in a cold climate as being 0˚F to 80˚F. AASHTO LRFD BDS Table 3.4.1-1 identifies the appropriate load factors as being 1.0 for shrinkage (SH) and creep (CR), and 1.20 for uniform thermal (TU) deformation effects. Temperature: ɣTU · ΔLtemp
= ½ (.000006)(80˚F-0˚F)(160′)(12″/′)(1.20) = 0.55″
Creep: ɣCR · ΔLcreep

Tmin
= .5(0˚F + 80˚F) - .5(1.20)(80˚F - 0˚F) = -8˚F
Shrinkage: ɣSH · ΔLshrink
= 0 (Essentially all shrinkage has already occurred.)
Step 2: Calculate the maximum and minimum temperatures associated with the factored temperature range. = .5(0˚F + 80˚F) + .5(1.20(80˚F - 0˚F) = 88˚F
Tmax
Step 3: Determine existing expansion gap widths at average superstructure temperatures of 40˚F and 80˚F. These are estimated extreme sealant installation temperatures. G40F = 1.00″ + [(64˚F - 40˚F)/(88˚F + 8˚F)] · (.55″) = 1.14″ G80F = 1.00″ - [(80˚F - 64˚F)/(88˚F + 8˚F)] · (.55″) = 0.91″
Step 4: Check sealant capacity if installed at 40˚F. Closing movement
= [(88˚F - 40˚F)/(88˚F + 8˚F)](.55″) = 0.275″ 0.275″/1.14″ = 0.24 < 0.50 Sealants A and B
Opening movement
= [(40˚F + 8˚F)/(88˚F + 8˚F)](.55″) = 0.275″ 0.275″/1.14″ = 0.24 < 1.00 Sealant A< 0.50 Sealant B
Step 5: Check sealant capacity if installed at 80˚F. Closing movement
= [(88˚F - 80˚F)/(88˚F + 8˚F)](.55″) = 0.05″ 0.05″/0.91″ = 0.05 < 0.50 Sealants A and B
Opening movement
= [(80˚F + 8˚F)/(88˚F + 8˚F)](.55″) = 0.50″ 0.50″/0.91″ = 0.55 < 1.00 Sealant A > 0.50 Sealant B
Step 6: Determine the maximum temperature that Sealant B could be installed at and still perform, over the full factored bridge uniform temperature range, within the allowable working range recommended by the manufacturer. Tinstall,max
= [-8 + (0.5)·(64) + (0.5)·(1.00) / (0.000006)·½·160·12)] / (1 + 0.5) = 73.9˚F
Conclusion: Notwithstanding any manufacturer's recommendations regarding sealant workability and cure time as a function of ambient temperature, the existing 1-inch expansion gap at 64˚F is acceptable for installation of Sealant A at bridge uniform temperatures between 40˚F and 80˚F. Sealant B is acceptable for installation at bridge uniform temperatures between 40˚F and 74˚F.

Asphaltic Plug Joints
Asphaltic plug joints consist of a flexible polymer modified asphalt installed in a preformed blockout atop a steel plate and backer rod. In theory, asphaltic plug joints provided a seamless smooth riding surface. However, when subjected to high traffic counts, heavy trucks, or substantial acceleration/deceleration traction, the polymer modified asphalt tends to creep, migrating out of the blockouts. As a consequence, WSDOT no longer specifies the use of asphaltic plug joints. Figure 9.1.3-3

Headers
Expansion joint headers for new construction are generally the same Class 4000D structural concrete as used for the bridge deck and cast integrally with the deck. Expansion joint headers installed as part of a rehabilitative and/or overlay project are constructed differently. Being a flexible material, hot mix asphalt (HMA) cannot provide rigid lateral support to an elastomeric compression seal or a rapid cure silicone sealant bead. Therefore, rigid concrete headers must be constructed on each side of such an expansion joint when an HMA overlay is installed atop an existing concrete deck. These headers provide a rigid lateral support to the expansion joint device and serve as a transition between the HMA overlay material and the expansion joint itself. WSDOT allows either polyester concrete or elastomeric concrete for expansion joint headers. These two materials, which provide enhanced durability to impact in regard to other concrete mixes, shall be specified as alternates in the contract documents. General Special Provisions specify the material and construction requirements for polyester and elastomeric concrete. Modified concrete overlay (MCO) material can provide rigid side support for an elastomeric compression seal or a rapid cure silicone sealant bead without the need for separately constructed elastomeric concrete or polyester concrete headers. This alternative approach requires the approval of the Bearing and Expansion. Joint Specialist. Such modified concrete overlay headers may utilize welded wire fabric as reinforcement. Contract 7108 which includes Bridges No. 90/565N&S and 90/566N&S is an example. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Bridge Paving Joint Seals
Sawcut joints with poured rubber are allowed on the bridge deck provided that the tributary length for calculating movement demand at the joint location does not exceed 50 feet and that the adverse consequence of leakage through the joint is minimal. This is applicable to both concrete bridge decks and to HMA overlays. Sawcut joints with poured rubber are not recommended where leakage through the deck could cause accelerated corrosion to structural steel elements, including steel bearing assemblies.
9.1.4
Medium Movement Range Joints Steel sliding plates, strip seals, and bolt-down panel joints have all been used in the past for accommodating medium movement ranges. The current policy is to use strip seal joints almost exclusively. 9.1.4.A
Steel Sliding Plate Joints
Two overlapping steel plates, one attached to the superstructure on each side of the joint, can be used to provide a smooth riding surface across an expansion joint. Unfortunately, steel sliding plates do not generally provide an effective barrier against intrusion of water and deicing chemicals into the joint and onto substructure elements. Consequently, these joints have been supplanted by newer systems, such as strip seals, with improved resistance to water penetration. Figure 9.1.4-1
Steel Sliding Plate Joint
Before the advent of more modern systems, steel sliding plates were specified extensively. Their limited use today includes the following specific applications: 1.
High pedestrian use sidewalks
2.
Modular expansion joint upturns at traffic barriers
3.
Roadway applications involving unusual movements (translation and large rotations) not readily accommodated by modular expansion joints.
In these applications, the sliding plates are generally galvanized or painted to provide corrosion resistance. Page 9-12

Bearings and Expansion Joints
Chapter 9
Repeated impact and corrosion have deteriorated many existing roadway sliding steel plate systems. In many instances, the anchorages connecting the sliding plate to the concrete deck have broken. When the integrity of the anchorages has been compromised, the steel sliding plates must generally be removed in their entirety and replaced with a new, watertight system. Where the integrity of the anchorages has not been compromised, sliding plates can often be retrofitted with poured sealants or elastomeric strip seals. 9.1.4.B
Strip Seal Joints
An elastomeric strip seal system consists of a preformed elastomeric gland mechanically locked into metallic edge rails generally embedded into the concrete deck on each side of an expansion joint gap. Unfolding of the elastomeric gland accommodates movement. Steel studs are generally welded to the steel extrusions constituting the edge rails to facilitate anchorage to the concrete deck. Damaged or worn glands can be replaced with minimal traffic disruption. The metal edge rails effectively armor the edges of the expansion joint, obviating the need for a special impact resistant concrete, usually required at compression seal and poured sealant joints. The designer must select either the standard or special anchorage. The special anchorage incorporates steel reinforcement bar loops welded to intermittent steel plates, which in turn are welded to the extrusion. The special anchorage is generally used for very high traffic volumes or in applications subject to snowplow hits. In applications subject to snowplow hits and concomitant damage, the intermittent steel plates can be detailed to protrude slightly above the roadway surface in order to launch the snowplow blade and prevent it from catching on the forward extrusion. The special anchorage requires a 9 inches deep blockout, as opposed to 7 inches deep for the standard anchorage. The standard anchorage is acceptable for high traffic volume expansion joint replacement projects where blockout depth limitations exist. Metal edge rails may be field spliced using weld procedures provided by the strip seal expansion joint manufacturer. However, elastomeric strip seal elements shall not be field spliced. Each elastomeric strip seal element shall be furnished and installed as a single, continuous piece across the full width of the bridge deck. Figure 9.1.4-2

Bearings and Expansion Joints
Design Example: Given: A steel plate girder bridge has a total length of 500 feet. It is symmetrical and has a strip seal expansion joint at each end. These expansion joints are skewed 10˚. Interior piers provide negligible restraint against longitudinal translation. This bridge is located in eastern Washington, which is characterized as a cold climate in AASHTO LRFD BDS Article 3.12.1. Assume a normal installation temperature of 64˚F. Find: Required Type A and Type B strip seal sizes and construction gap widths at 40˚F, 64˚F, and 80˚F. Type A strip seals have a ½ inch gap at full closure. Type B strip seals are able to fully close, leaving no gap. Solution: Step 1: Calculate factored temperature and shrinkage movement. AASHTO LRFD BDS Table 3.12.2.1-1 identifies the design temperature range for a steel bridge in a cold climate as being -30˚F to 120˚F. AASHTO LRFD BDS Table 3.4.11 identifies the appropriate load factors as being 1.0 for shrinkage (SH) and 1.20 for uniform thermal (TU) effects. Temperature: γTU · ΔLtemp = ½(.0000065)(120˚F + 30˚F)(500′)(12″/′)(1.20) = 3.51″ Shrinkage: γSH · ΔLshrink = 0.0 (no shrinkage; μ = 0.0 for steel bridge) Total deck movement at each joint: = 3.51″
Calculate the maximum and minimum temperatures associated with the factored temperature range: Tmin = .5(-30˚F + 120˚F) – .5(1.20)(120˚F + 30˚F)= -45˚F Tmax = .5(-30˚F + 120˚F) + .5(1.20)(120˚F + 30˚F)= 135˚F γTU · ΔLtemp-normal-closing = (135˚F - 64˚F)/(135˚F + 45˚F)(3.51″)(cos 10o) = 1.36″
γTU · ΔLtemp-normal-opening = (64˚F + 45˚F)/(135˚F + 45˚F)(3.51″)(cos 10o) = 2.09″
Step 2: Determine strip seal size required. Assume a minimum construction gap width of 1½″ at 64˚F. Type A: Construction gap width of 1½″ at 64˚F will not accommodate 1.36″ closing with a ½″ gap at full closure. Therefore, minimum construction gap width at 64˚F must be 1.36″ + 0.50″ = 1.86″ Size required = 1.86″ + 2.09″ - 0.50" = 3.45″ → Use 4″ strip seal Type B: Construction width of 1½″ at 64˚F is adequate. Size required = 1.50″ + 2.09″ = 3.59″ → Use 4″ strip seal Step 3: Evaluate construction gap widths for various temperatures for a 4″ strip seal. Type A: Required construction gap width at 64˚F = 0.50″ + 1.36″ = 1.86″ Construction gap width at 40˚F = 1.86″ + (64˚F - 40˚F)/(64˚F + 45˚F) ⋅ (2.09″) = 2.32″ Construction gap width at 80˚F = 1.86″ - (80˚F - 64˚F)/(135˚F - 64˚F) ⋅ (1.36″) = 1.55″ Page 9-14
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Bearings and Expansion Joints
Chapter 9
Type B: Construction gap width of 1½″ at 64˚F is adequate. Construction gap width at 40˚F = 1.50″ + (64˚F - 40˚F)/(64˚F + 45˚F) ⋅ (2.09″) = 1.96″ Construction gap width at 80˚F = 1.50″ - (80˚F - 64˚F)/(135˚F - 64˚F) ⋅ (1.36″) = 1.19″ Conclusion: Use a 4-inch strip seal. Construction gap widths for installation at superstructure average temperatures of 40˚F, 64˚F, and 80˚F are 2⅛″, 1⅞″, and 1½″ for Type A and 2″, 1½″, and 1¼″ for Type B. (Note that slightly larger gap settings could be specified for the 4″ Type B strip seal in order to allow the elastomeric glands to be replaced at lower temperatures at the expense of ride smoothness across the joint.) 9.1.4.C
Bolt-down Panel Joints
Bolt-down panel joints, sometimes referred to as expansion dams, are preformed elastomeric panels internally reinforced with steel plates. Bridging across expansion gaps, these panels are bolted into formed blockouts in the concrete deck with either adhesive or expansive anchors. Expansion is accompanied by stress and strain across the width of the bolt-down panel between anchor bolts. Figure 9.1.4-3
Bolt-down Panel Joint
Because of durability concerns, we no longer specify bolt-down panel joints. On bridge overlay and expansion joint rehabilitation projects, bolt-down panels are being replaced with rapid-cure silicone sealant joints or strip seal joints. For rehabilitation of bridges having low speed or low volume traffic, existing bolt-down panel joints may be retained and/or selective damaged panels replaced.
9.1.5
Large Movement Range Joints Steel finger and modular joints have all been used in the past for accommodating large movement ranges. 9.1.5.A
Steel Finger Joints
Finger joints have been successfully used to accommodate medium and large movement ranges. They are generally fabricated from steel plate and are installed in cantilevered configurations. The steel fingers must be designed to support traffic loads with sufficient stiffness to preclude excessive vibration. In addition to longitudinal movement, finger joints must also accommodate any rotations or differential vertical deflection across the joint. Finger joints may be fabricated with a slight downward taper toward the ends of WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 9-15
Chapter 9
Bearings and Expansion Joints
the fingers in order to minimize potential for snowplow blade damage. Unfortunately, finger joints do not provide an effective seal against water infiltration. Elastomeric and metal troughs have been installed beneath steel finger joints to catch and redirect runoff water. However, in the absence of routine maintenance, these troughs clog and become ineffective. Figure 9.1.5-1
9.1.5.B
Steel Finger Joint
Modular Expansion Joints
Modular expansion joints are complex structural assemblies designed to provide watertight wheel load transfer across expansion joint openings. These systems were developed in Europe and introduced into the U.S. in the 1960s. To date, modular expansion joints have been designed and fabricated to accommodate movements of up to 85 inches. In Washington State, the largest modular expansion joints are those on the newest Tacoma Narrows Bridge. These joints accommodate 48 inches of service movement and 60 inches of seismic movement. Modular expansion joints are generally shipped in a completely assembled configuration. Although center beam field splices are not preferable, smaller motion range modular expansion joints longer than 40 feet may be shipped in segments to accommodate construction staging and/or shipping constraints. 9.1.5.B.1
Operational Characteristics
Modular expansion joints comprise a series of steel center beams oriented parallel to the expansion joint axis. Elastomeric strip seals or box-type seals attach to adjacent center beams, preventing infiltration of water and debris. The center beams are supported on support bars, which span in the primary direction of anticipated movement. The support bars are supported on sliding bearings mounted within support boxes. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) – stainless steel interfaces between elastomeric support bearings and support bars facilitate the unimpeded translation of the support bars as the expansion gap opens and closes. The support boxes generally rest on either cast-in-place concrete or grout pads installed into a preformed blockout. Modular expansion joints can be classified as either single support bar or multiple support bar systems. In multiple support bar systems, a separate support bar supports each center beam. In the more complex single support bar system, one support bar supports all center beams at each support location. This design concept requires that each center beam be free to translate along the longitudinal axis of the support bar as the expansion gap varies. This is accomplished by attaching steel yokes to the underside of the center beams. The yoke engages the support bar to facilitate load transfer. Precompressed elastomeric Page 9-16

Bearings and Expansion Joints
Chapter 9
springs and PTFE – stainless steel interfaces between the underside of each center beam and the top of the support bar and between the bottom of the support bar and bottom of the yoke support each center beam and allow it to translate along the longitudinal axis of the support bar. Practical center beam span lengths limit the use of multiple support bar systems for larger movement range modular expansion joints. Multiple support bar systems typically become impractical for more than nine seals, which corresponds to movement ranges exceeding 27″. Hence, the single support bar concept typifies these larger movement range modular expansion joints. Figure 9.1.5-2
Modular Expansion Joint
The highly repetitive nature of axle loads predisposes modular expansion joint components and connections to fatigue susceptibility, particularly at center beam to support bar connections and center beam field splices. Until recently, bolted connections of center beams to support bar have demonstrated poor fatigue endurance. Welded connections have been preferred, but must be carefully designed, fatigue tested, fabricated, and inspected to assure satisfactory fatigue resistance. WSDOT'S current General Special Provisions for modular expansion joints requires stringent fatigue-based design and test criteria for modular expansion joints. This special provision also specifies criteria for manufacturing, shipping, storing, and installing modular expansion joints. Modular expansion joints may need to be shipped and/or installed in two or more pieces and subsequently spliced together in order to accommodate project staging and/ or practical shipping limitations. Splicing generally occurs after concrete is cast into the blockouts. The center beams are the elements that must be connected. These field connections are either welded, bolted, or a hybrid combination of both.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 9-17
Chapter 9
Bearings and Expansion Joints
Center beam field splices have historically been the weak link of modular expansion joints because of their high fatigue susceptibility and their tendency to initiate progressive zipper-type failure. The reduced level of quality control achievable with a field operation in regard to a shop operation contributes to this susceptibility. Specific recommendations regarding center beam field splices will be subsequently discussed as they relate to shop drawing review and construction. 9.1.5.B.2
Movement Design
Calculated total movement range establishes modular expansion joint size. WSDOT policy has been to provide a 15 percent factor of safety on these calculated service movements. Current systems permit approximately 3 inches of service load movement per elastomeric seal element; hence total service load movement rating provided will be a multiple of 3 inches. Modular expansion joints must be fully serviceable and maintainable at their full range of factored design temperatures throughout their operational lifetimes. This includes the time before and after all long-term creep and shrinkage have occurred. To minimize impact and wear on bearing elements, the maximum gap between adjacent center beams under service load conditions should be limited to about 3½ inches. Modular expansion joints are also subject to bridge movements associated with extreme events. Extreme event load combinations include earthquakes and, in the case of floating structures, extreme wind and wave loading. Because the fatigue limit state almost always controls centerbeam and support bar design, a larger movement capacity per cell is acceptable to accommodate extreme event movements provided that 1) support bars and boxes are detailed to accommodate the increased movement, and 2) detachment of elastomeric seals is acceptable. This is discussed further in Section 9.3 Seismic Isolation Bearings. To facilitate the installation of the modular joints at temperatures other than the 64˚F normal temperature, the contract drawings shall specify expansion gap distance faceto-face of edge beams as a function of the superstructure temperature at the time of installation. Modular expansion joint movement design relationships can be expressed as: n
= MR / mr
Gmin = (n - 1) ⋅ w + n ⋅ g Gmax = Gmin + MR
Where MR = total movement range of the modular joint mr
= movement range per elastomeric seal
n
= number of seals
n – 1 = number of center beams w
= width of each center beam
g
= minimum gap per strip seal element at full closure
Gmin = minimum distance face-to-face of edge beams
Gmax = maximum distance face-to-face of edge beams

Design Example: Given: Two cast-in-place post-tensioned concrete box girder bridge frames meet at an intermediate pier where they are free to translate longitudinally. Skew angle is 0°. This bridge is located on the I-5 corridor in western Washington, which is classified as a moderate climate in AASHTO LRFD BDS Article 3.12.2.1. A modular bridge expansion joint will be installed 60 days after post-tensioning operations have been completed. Specified creep is 150 percent of elastic shortening. Assume that 50 percent of total shrinkage has already occurred at installation time. The following factored longitudinal movements were calculated for each of the two frames: Shrinkage Elastic shortening Creep (1.5 × Elastic shortening) Temperature fall (64˚F to 3˚F) Temperature rise (64˚F to 87˚F)
Frame A 1.18″ 1.42″ 2.13″ 4.07″ 1.53″
Frame B 0.59″ 0.79″ 1.18″ 2.03″ 0.77″
Find: Modular expansion joint size required to accommodate the total calculated movements and the installation gaps measured face-to-face of edge beams at superstructure average temperatures of 40˚F, 64˚F, and 80˚F. Solution: Step 1: Determine modular joint size. AASHTO LRFD BDS Table 3.12.2.1-1 identifies the design temperature range for a concrete bridge in a moderate climate as being 10˚F to 80˚F. AASHTO LRFD BDS Table 3.4.1-1 identifies the appropriate load factors as being 1.0 for shrinkage (SH) and creep (CR), and 1.20 for uniform thermal (TU) effects. Note that the temperature fall and rise shown in the table above are associated with the factored temperature range. Total opening movement (Frame A) 				= (0.5) · (1.18″) + 2.13″ + 4.07″ = 6.79″ Total opening movement (Frame B) 		 = (0.5) · (0.59″) + 1.18″ + 2.03″ = 3.51″ Total opening movement (both frames)
= 6.79″ + 3.51″ = 10.30″
Total closing movement (both frames)
= 1.53″ + 0.77″ = 2.30″
Determine size of the modular joint, including a 15 percent allowance: 1.15 · (10.30″ + 2.30″) = 14.49″ · Use a 15-inch movement rating joint

Step 2: Evaluate installation gaps measured face-to-face of edge beams at superstructure average temperatures of 40˚F, 64˚F, and 80˚F. MR

n – 1 = 4 center beams w
= 2.50″ (center beam top flange width)
g
= 0″
Gmin = 4 ⋅ (2.50″) + 4 ⋅ (0″) = 10″ Gmax = 10″ + 15″ = 25″
G64F = Gmin + Total closing movement from temperature rise = 10″ + 1.15 · (2.30″) = 12.65″ →Use 13″
G40F = 13″ + [(64˚F - 40˚F)/(64˚F - 3˚F)] · (4.07″ + 2.03″) = 15.40″
G80F = 13″ – [(80˚F - 64˚F)/(87˚F - 64˚F)] · (1.53″ + 0.77″) = 11.40″
Check spacing between center beams at minimum temperature after all longterm creep and shrinkage shortening has occurred: G0F = 13″ + 10.30″ = 23.30″ Spacing = [23.30″ - 4(2.50″)] / 5 = 2.66″ < 3½″ → OK Check spacing between center beams at 64˚F for seal replacement after all long-term creep and shrinkage shortening has occurred Spacing = [13″ + 1.18" + 0.59" + 2.13" + 1.18" - 4(2.50″)] / 5 = 1.62″ >1.50″ Check spacing between center beams at 64˚F if seal installation occurs early in the life of the bridge, prior to long-term creep and shrinkage having occurred: Spacing = [13" – 4(2.50")] / 5 = 0.60" Therefore, replacement of strip seal elements later in the life of the bridge could be accomplished without the need to mechanically separate centerbeams. However, if the modular expansion joint installation is staged in a manner requiring the seal to be installed after field splicing of the centerbeams, the centerbeams would need to be mechanically separated. Likewise, if the strip seal elements need to be replaced early in the life of the bridge, mechanical separation of the centerbeams may be required. Conclusion: Use a 15 in modular expansion joint. The gaps measured faceto-face of edge beams at installation temperatures of 40˚F, 64˚F, and 80˚F are 15⅜ in, 13 in and 11⅜ in, respectively.

Review of Shop Drawings and Structural Design Calculations
The manufacturer’s engineer generally performs structural design of modular expansion joints. The project special provision requires that the manufacturer submit structural calculations, detailed fabrication drawings, and applicable fatigue tests for approval by the Engineer. All structural elements must be designed and detailed for both strength and fatigue. Additionally, modular expansion joints should be detailed to provide access for inspection and periodic maintenance activities, including replacement of seals, control springs, and bearing components. WSDOT's General Special Provision for modular expansion joints delineates explicit requirements for their design, fabrication, and installation. This comprehensive special provision builds upon WSDOT's past experience specifying modular expansion joints and incorporates the NCHRP Report 402 Fatigue Design of Modular Bridge Expansion Joints. The special provisions include requirements for the shop drawings, calculations, material certifications, general fabrication methods, corrosion protection, shipping and handling, storage, installation, fatigue testing, applicable welding codes and certifications, quality control, and quality assurance. It is strongly advised to carefully review this special provision before reviewing modular expansion joint shop drawings and calculations. Any structural details, including connections, that do not clearly correspond to specific fatigue categories depicted in the LRFD shall be fatigue tested in accordance with the requirements stipulated in the special provision. Documentation of these tests shall accompany the shop drawing submittal. As stated in the special provisions, the Contractor shall submit documentation of a quality assurance program distinctly separate from in-house quality control. Quality assurance shall be performed by an independent agency and shall be provided by the manufacturer. Weld procedures shall be submitted for all shop and field welds. These procedures stipulate welding process employed, end preparation of the component welded, weld metal type, preheat temperature, and welder certifications. It is critical that all welds be made in strict accordance with specifications and under very careful inspection. Field splices of center beams require particularly careful review. WSDOT's special provision recommends several mitigating measures to minimize fatigue susceptibility of center beam field splices. These measures include reducing support box spacing and optimizing fatigue stress range at field splice locations. Keep in mind that the confined nature of the space in which a welder must work can make these welds very difficult to complete. The American Welding Society (AWS) Welding Code prequalifies certain end geometries because experience has shown that high quality welds can be achieved. Non-prequalified center beam end geometries require the Contractor to submit a Procedure Qualification Record documenting that satisfactory weld quality has been achieved using samples before welding of the actual field piece. The Contractor will generally want to avoid the additional expense associated with these tests and will thus specify a prequalified end geometry. WSDOT's special provisions require that adequate concrete consolidation be achieved underneath all support boxes. The reviewer should ascertain that the shop drawings detail a vertical minimum of 2 inches between the bottom of each support box and the top of the concrete blockout. Alternatively, when vertical clearance is minimal, grout pads can be cast underneath support boxes before casting the concrete within the blockout.

9.1.5.B.4
Construction Considerations
Temperature adjustment devices are temporarily welded to the modular expansion joints to permit the Contractor to adjust the modular joint width so that it is consistent with the superstructure temperature at the time concrete is placed in the blockout. The temperature devices effectively immobilize the modular joint. Once the concrete begins to set up, it is critical to remove these devices as soon as possible. If the modular expansion joint is prevented from opening and closing, it will be subject to very large, potentially damaging, forces. Prior to placement of concrete into the blockout, temporary supports generally bridge across the expansion gap, suspending the modular expansion joint from the bridge deck surface. Following concrete placement, the modular joint is supported by bearing of the support boxes on concrete that has consolidated underneath the blockout. The inspector should assure that adequate concrete consolidation is achieved underneath and around the support boxes. Following delivery of the modular expansion joint to the jobsite and prior to its installation, the inspector should ascertain that center beam end geometries at field weld splice locations match those shown on the approved weld procedure.

Bearings
9.2.1
General Considerations
Chapter 9
Bridge bearings facilitate the transfer of vehicular and other environmentally imposed loads from the superstructure down to the substructure, and ultimately, to the ground. In fulfilling this function, bearings must accommodate anticipated movements (thermal expansion/contraction) while also restraining undesired movements (seismic displacements). Because the movements allowed by an adjacent expansion joint must be compatible with the movement restriction imposed by a bearing, bearings and expansion joints must be designed interdependently and in conjunction with the anticipated behavior of the overall structure. Numerous types of bearings are used for bridges. These include steel reinforced elastomeric bearings, fabric pad sliding bearings, steel pin bearings, rocker bearings, roller bearings, pot bearings, spherical bearings, disk bearings, and seismic isolation bearings. Each of these bearings possesses different characteristics in regard to vertical and horizontal load carrying capacity, vertical stiffness, horizontal stiffness, and rotational stiffness. A thorough understanding of these characteristics is essential for economical bearing selection and design. Spherical bearings, disk bearings, and pot bearings are sometimes collectively referred to as high load multi-rotational (HLMR) bearings. Seismic isolation bearings mitigate the potential for seismic damage by utilizing two related phenomena: dynamic isolation and energy dissipation. Dynamic isolation allows a superstructure to essentially float, to some extent, while substructure elements below move with the ground during an earthquake. The ability of some bearing materials and elements to deform in certain predicable ways allows them to dissipate seismic energy that might otherwise damage critical structural elements. Given their unique, in many instances proprietary, nature and the need to holistically incorporate their design with the overall seismic analysis and design of the structure, a separate.
9.2.2
Force Considerations Bridge bearings must be explicitly designed to transfer all anticipated loads from the superstructure to the substructure. These forces may be directed vertically, longitudinally, or transversely with respect to the global orientation of the bridge. In accordance with LRFD provisions, most bearing design calculations are based upon service limit state stresses. Impact need not be applied to live load forces in the design of bearings. Experience has empirically led to the following practical load capacity approximations for various bearing types: Bearing Type Steel reinforced elastomeric (Method B) Fabric pad Steel pin Spherical and disk Seismic isolation

9.2.3
Bearings and Expansion Joints
Movement Considerations Bridge bearings can be detailed to provide translational fixity, to permit free translation in any horizontal direction, or to permit guided translation. The movement restrictions thus imposed by a bearing must be compatible with the movements allowed by an adjacent expansion joint. Additionally, both bearings and expansion joints must be designed consistent with the anticipated load and deformation behavior of the overall structure. Design rotations shall be calculated as follows: 9.2.3.A
Elastomeric and Fabric Pad Bearings
The maximum service limit state rotation for bearings that do not have the potential to achieve hard contact between metal components shall be taken as the sum of unfactored dead and live load rotations plus an allowance for fabrication and construction uncertainties of 0.005 radians. 9.2.3.B
HLMR Bearings
Both service and strength limit state rotations are used in the design of HLMR bearings. These rotations must be shown on the plans to allow the manufacturer to properly design and detail a bearing. The service limit state rotation shown on the plans shall include an allowance for uncertainties of +/-0.005 radians. The strength limit state rotation is used to assure that contact between hard metal or concrete surfaces is prevented under the full range of expected loading. In accordance with the AASHTO LRFD BDS, the strength limit state rotation shown on the plans shall include allowances of:
9.2.4
1.
For disc bearings, +/-0.005 radians for uncertainties
2.
For other HLMR bearings, such as spherical, pot, and steel pin bearings, +/-0.005 radians for fabrication and installation tolerances and an additional +/-0.005 radians for uncertainties
Detailing Considerations HLMR bearings shall be designed, detailed, fabricated, and installed to facilitate inspection, maintenance, and eventual replacement. Jacking points shall be identified in the contract drawings so that bearings can be reset, repaired, or replaced. In some instances, bearings may need to be reset in order to mitigate unintended displacements induced by construction sequences. Prestressed concrete girder bridges having end Type A (semi–integral) need not be detailed to accommodate elastomeric bearing replacement at abutments. Prestressed concrete girder bridges having end Type B (L-type abutments) shall be designed and detailed to accommodate elastomeric bearing replacement at abutments. Specifically, girder stops and end diaphragms shall be detailed to accommodate the placement of hydraulic jacks. The standard end diaphragms for long-span girders may not have sufficient flexural and shear capacity to support jacking induced stresses. The designer shall check these and provide sufficient steel reinforcement to accommodate shear forces and bending moments induced by jacking. (Girder end Types A and B are depicted on Figures 5.6.2-4 and 5.6.2-5.) Incidentally, intermediate piers of prestressed concrete girder bridges having steel reinforced elastomeric bearings shall also be designed and detailed to facilitate bearing replacement.

Elastomeric Bearings
Elastomeric bearings are perhaps the simplest and most economical of all bridge bearings. They are broadly classified into four types: plain elastomeric pads, fiberglass reinforced elastomeric pads, steel reinforced elastomeric pads, and cotton duck reinforced elastomeric pads. Of these four types, the latter two are used extensively for bridge construction. Incidentally, cotton duck reinforced elastomeric pads are generally referred to as fabric pad bearings. This subsection will address steel reinforced elastomeric bearings. A subsequent section will address fabric pad bearings. A steel reinforced elastomeric bearing consists of discrete steel shims vulcanized between adjacent discrete layers of elastomer. The vulcanization process occurs in an autoclave under conditions of high temperature and pressure. The constituent elastomer is either natural rubber or synthetic rubber (neoprene). Steel reinforced elastomeric bearings are commonly used with prestressed concrete girder bridges and may be used with other bridge types. Because of their relative simplicity and fabrication ease, steel reinforced elastomeric bearings offer significant economy relative to HLMR bearings. Steel reinforced elastomeric bearings rely upon the inherent shear flexibility of the elastomer layers to accommodate bridge movements in any horizontal direction. This shear flexibility also enhances their rotational flexibility. The steel shims limit the tendency for the elastomer layers to bulge laterally under compressive load. Steel reinforced elastomeric bearings can be designed by either the Method A or Method B procedure delineated in the LRFD provisions. Current WSDOT policy is to design all elastomeric bearings using the Method B provisions, which provides more relief in meeting rotational demands than Method A. The Method A design procedure is a carryover based upon more conservative interpretation of past theoretical analyses and empirical observations prior to research leading up to the publication of NCHRP Report 596 Rotation Limits for Elastomeric Bearings. Both Method A and Method B design procedures require determination of the optimal geometric parameters to achieve an appropriate balance of compressive, shear, and rotational stiffnesses and capacities. Fatigue susceptibility is controlled by limiting live load compressive stress. Delamination (of steel shim-elastomer interface) susceptibility is controlled by limiting total compressive stress. Assuring adequate shim thickness precludes yield and rupture of the steel shims. Excessive shear deformation is controlled and rotational flexibility is assured by providing adequate total elastomer height. Generally, total elastomer thickness shall be no less than twice the maximum anticipated lateral deformation. Overall bearing stability is controlled by limiting total bearing height relative to its plan dimensions. The most important design parameter for reinforced elastomeric bearings is the shape factor. The shape factor is defined as the plan area of the bearing divided by the area of the perimeter free to bulge (perimeter multiplied by thickness of one layer of elastomer). Axial, rotational, and shear loading generate shear strain in the constituent elastomeric layers of a typical bearing. Computationally, Method B imposes a limit on the sum of these shear strains. It distinguishes between static and cyclic components of shear strain by applying an amplification factor of 1.75 to cyclic components to reflect cumulative degradation caused by repetitive loading.

Bearings and Expansion Joints
In essence, elastomeric bearing design reduces to checking several mathematical equations while varying bearing plan dimensions, number of elastomeric layers and their corresponding thicknesses, and steel shim thicknesses. Because these calculations can become rather tedious, MS Excel spreadsheets have been developed and are available for designs using both Method A and Method B procedures. See the Bearing and Expansion Joint Specialist for these design tools. LRFD design may result in thicker steel reinforced elastomeric bearings than previous designs, particularly for shorter span bridges. This is a consequence of the increased rotational flexibility required to accommodate the 0.005 radian allowance for uncertainties and partially to inherent conservatism built into the rotational capacity equations. Although constituent elastomer has historically been specified by durometer hardness, shear modulus is the most important physical property of the elastomer for purposes of bearing design. Research has concluded that shear modulus may vary significantly among compounds of the same hardness. Accordingly, shear modulus shall be specified on the plans as 165 psi at 73ºF without reference to durometer hardness. Elastomeric bearings shall conform to the requirements of AASHTO Specification M 251 Plain and Laminated Elastomeric Bridge Bearings. Shims shall be fabricated from ASTM A 1011 Grade 36 steel unless noted otherwise on the plans. Bearings shall be laminated in ½ inch thick elastomeric layers with a minimum total thickness of 1 inch. For overall bearing heights less than 5 inches, a minimum of ¼ inch of side clearance shall be provided over the steel shims. For overall heights greater than 5 inches, a minimum of ½ inch of side clearance shall be provided. Live load compressive deflection shall be limited to 1/16 inch. AASHTO Specification M 251 requires elastomeric bearings to be subjected to a series of tests, including a compression test at 150 percent of the total service load. For this reason, compressive dead load and live load shall be specified on the plans. With respect to width, elastomeric bearings shall be designed and detailed as follows: 1.
For prestressed concrete wide flange girders (WF42G, WF50G, WF58G, WF74G, and W95G), the edge of the bearing pad shall be set between 1 inch minimum and 9 inch maximum inside of the edge of the girder bottom flange.
2.
For prestressed concrete I-girders, bulb-tee girders, and deck bulb-tee girders, the edge of the bearing pad shall be set 1 in. in side of the edge of the girder bottom flange.
3.
For all prestressed concrete tub girders, the edge of the bearing shall be set 1in. inside of the edge of the bottom slab. Bearing pads for prestressed concrete tub girders shall be centered close to the centerline of each web.
4.
For all prestressed concrete slabs, one bearing pad and corresponding grout pad is required for each end of the prestressed concrete slab. The centerline of the bearing and grout pad shall coincide with the centerline of the prestressed concrete slab. The need for steel shims shall be assessed during the bearing design.
As mentioned earlier, AASHTO LRFD BDS Article 14.4.2.1 requires that a 0.005 radian allowance for uncertainties be included in the design of steel reinforced elastomeric bearings. This allowance applies to both rotations θx and θy. The AASHTO LRFD BDS Article 14.4.2 Commentary states "An owner may reduce the fabrication and setting tolerance allowances if justified by a suitable quality control plan; therefore, these Page 9-26

Chapter 9
tolerance limits are stated as recommendations rather than absolute limits." Consult with the Bearings and Expansion Joint Specialist in instances in which the 0.005 radian tolerance precludes convergence to a reasonable design solution. In order to facilitate compressive load testing, future bearing replacement, and vertical geometry coordination, the following table shall be included in the Plans: Bearing Design Table Service I Limit State Dead load reaction

In the construction of precast prestressed concrete girder and steel girder bridges, elastomeric bearings are generally not offset to account for temperature during erection of the girders as are most other bearing systems. Girders may be set atop elastomeric bearings at temperatures other than the mean of the temperature range. This is statistically reconciled by assuming a maximum thermal movement in either direction of: Δtemp = 0.75 ∙ α ∙ L ∙ (TMaxDesign - TMinDesign) where TMaxDesign is the maximum anticipated superstructure average temperature and TMinDesign is the minimum anticipated superstructure average temperature during the life of the bridge. For precast prestressed concrete girder bridges, the maximum thermal movement, Δtemp, shall be added to shrinkage and long-term creep movements to determine total bearing height required. The shrinkage movement for this bridge type shall be half that calculated for a cast-in-place concrete bridge, as noted in Section 9.1.2-A. For cast-in-place concrete bridges, it is assumed that the temperature of concrete at placement is equal to the normal temperature, as defined by the Standard Specifications. Total shrinkage movement, calculated as noted in Section 9.1.2-A, is added to the maximum thermal movement, Δtemp, to determine required total height of the elastomeric bearing. 9.2.5.B
Fabric Pad Sliding Bearings
Fabric pad sliding bearings incorporate fabric pads with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)– stainless steel sliding interface to permit large translational movements. Unlike a steel reinforced elastomeric bearing having substantial shear flexibility, the fabric pad alone cannot accommodate translational movements. Fabric pads can accommodate very small amounts of rotational movement; less than can be accommodated by more flexible steel reinforced elastomeric bearings. Practical size considerations limit the use of fabric pad bearings to total service load reactions under about 600 kips. PTFE, also referred to as Teflon, is available in several forms: unfilled sheet, dimpled lubricated, filled, and woven. Filled PTFE contains glass, carbon, or other chemically inert fibers that enhance its resistance to creep (cold flow) and wear. Interweaving high strength fibers through PTFE material creates woven PTFE. Dimpled PTFE contains dimples, which act as reservoirs for silicone grease lubricant.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 9-27
Chapter 9
Bearings and Expansion Joints
Friction coefficients for PTFE – stainless steel surfaces vary significantly as a function of PTFE type, contact pressure, and ambient temperature. The AASHTO LRFD provides friction coefficients as a function of these variables. Dimpled lubricated PTFE at high temperatures and high contact pressures typically yield the lowest friction coefficients. Filled PTFE at low temperatures and low contact pressures yield the highest friction coefficients. In order to minimize frictional resistance, a Number 8 (Mirror) finish should be specified for all flat stainless steel surfaces in contact with PTFE. The low-friction characteristics of a PTFE – stainless steel interface are actually facilitated by fragmentary PTFE sliding against PTFE after the fragmentary PTFE particles are absorbed into the asperities of the stainless steel surface. In fabric pad sliding bearings, the PTFE is generally recessed half its depth into a steel backing plate, which is generally bonded to the top of a fabric pad. The recess provides confinement that minimizes creep (cold flow). The stainless steel sheet is typically seal welded to a steel sole plate attached to the superstructure. Silicone grease is not recommended for non-dimpled PTFE. Any grease will squeeze out under high pressure and attract potentially detrimental dust and other debris. 9.2.5.B.1
Fabric Pad Design
WSDOT's design criteria for fabric pad bearings are based upon manufacturers’ recommendations, supported by years of satisfactory performance. These criteria differ from AASHTO LRFD provisions in that they recognize significantly more rotational flexibility in the fabric pad. Our maximum allowable service load average bearing pressure for fabric pad bearing design is 1,200 psi. WSDOT's maximum allowable service load edge bearing pressure for fabric pad bearing design is 2,000 psi. A 1,200 psi compressive stress corresponds to 10 percent strain in the fabric pad while a 2,000 psi compressive stress corresponds to 14 percent compressive strain. Based upon this information, the following design relationship can be established: θ=
2 × (.14–.10) × T L .08 × T θ= L T = 12.5 × θ × L
Where θ L T
= rotation due to loading plus construction tolerances = pad length (parallel to longitudinal axis of beam) = fabric pad thickness required
Design Example: Given: DL + LL = 240 kips Rotation = 0.015 radians Allowable bearing pad pressure = 1200 psi ƒ′c = 3000 psi Find: fabric pad plan area and thickness required

Conclusion: Pad area required = 240,000/1200 = 200 in2 Try a 20 in wide × 10 in long fabric pad T = 12.5(.015)(10 in) = 1.88 in Solution: Use a 20 in × 10 in × 1⅞ in fabric pad. 9.2.5.B.2
PTFE
Stainless Steel Sliding Surface Design – PTFE having a maximum dimension less than or equal to 24 inches shall be 3/16 inch thick and shall be recessed 3/32 inch into a ½ inch thick steel plate that is bonded to the top of the fabric pad. PTFE having a maximum dimension greater than 24 inches. shall be ¼ inch thick and shall be recessed ⅛ inch into a ½-inch thick steel plate that is bonded to the top of the fabric pad. With the PTFE confined in this recess, the AASHTO LRFD BDS code permits an average contact stress of 4,500 psi for all loads calculated at the service limit state and an average contact stress of 3,000 psi for permanent loads calculated at the service limit state. The AASHTO LRFD BDS code permits slightly higher edge contact stresses. For example, suppose: DL = 150 kips LL = 90 kips APTFE > (150 kips + 90 kips)/4.5 ksi = 53.3 in2 APTFE > 150 kips/3 ksi = 50.0 in2 Selected area of PTFE must exceed 53.3 in2 Stainless steel sheet shall be finished to a No. 8 (Mirror) finish and seal welded to the sole plate. 9.2.5.C
Pin Bearings
Steel pin bearings are generally used to support heavy reactions with moderate to high levels of rotation about a single predetermined axis. This situation generally occurs with long straight steel plate girder superstructures. 9.2.5.D
Rocker and Roller Type Bearings
Steel rocker bearings have been used extensively in the past to allow both rotation and longitudinal movement while supporting large loads. Because of their seismic vulnerability and the more extensive use of steel reinforced elastomeric bearings, rocker bearings are no longer specified for new bridges. Steel roller bearings have also been used extensively in the past. Roller bearings permit both rotation and longitudinal movement. Pintles are generally used to connect the roller bearing to the superstructure above and to the bearing plate below. Nested roller bearings have also been used in the past. Having been supplanted by more economical steel reinforced elastomeric bearings, roller bearings are infrequently used for new bridges today.

9.2.5.E
Spherical Bearings
A spherical bearing relies upon the low-friction characteristics of a curved PTFE–stainless steel interface to provide a high level of rotational flexibility in multiple directions. An additional flat PTFE–stainless steel surface can be incorporated into the bearing to additionally provide either guided or non-guided translational movement capability. Woven PTFE is generally used on the curved surfaces of spherical bearings. Woven PTFE exhibits enhanced creep (cold flow) resistance and durability characteristics relative to unwoven PTFE. When spherical bearings are detailed to accommodate translational movement, woven PTFE is generally specified on the flat sliding surface also. The LRFD code permits an average contact stress of 4,500 psi for all loads calculated at the service limit state and an average contact stress of 3,000 psi for permanent loads calculated at the service limit state. The AASHTO LRFD BDS code permits slightly higher edge contact stresses. Both stainless steel sheet and solid stainless steel have been used for the convex sliding surface of spherical bearings. According to one manufacturer, curved sheet is generally acceptable for contact surface radii greater than 14 in to 18 in For smaller radii, a solid stainless steel convex plate or a stainless steel inlay is used. The inlay is welded to the solid conventional steel. If the total height of the convex plate exceeds about 5 in, a stainless steel inlay will likely be more economical. Most spherical bearings are fabricated with the concave surface oriented downward to minimize dirt infiltration between PTFE and the stainless steel surface. Structural analysis of the overall structure must recognize the center of rotation of the bearing not being coincident with the neutral axis of the girder above. The contract drawings must show the diameter and height of the spherical bearing in addition to all dead, live, and seismic loadings. Total height depends upon the radius of the curved surface, diameter of the bearing, and total rotational capacity required. Consult the Bearing and Expansion Joint Specialist for design calculation examples. Additionally, sole plate connections, base plate, anchor bolts, and any appurtenances for horizontal force transfer must be detailed on the plans. The spherical bearing manufacturer is required to submit shop drawings and detailed structural design calculations of spherical bearing components for review by the Engineer. 9.2.5.F
Disk Bearings
A disk bearing is composed of an annular shaped polyether urethane disk designed to provide moderate levels of rotational flexibility. A steel shear-resisting pin in the center provides resistance against lateral force. A flat PTFE–stainless steel surface can be incorporated into the bearing to also provide translational movement capability, either guided or non-guided.

Miscellaneous Details 9.2.6.A
Temporary Support before Grouting Masonry Plate
The masonry plate of a HLMR bearing is generally supported on a grout pad that is installed after the bearing and superstructure girders above have been erected. This procedure allows the Contractor to level and slightly adjust the horizontal location of the bearing before immobilizing it by placing the grout pad. Several methods have been developed to temporarily support the masonry plate until the grout is placed. The two most commonly used methods will be discussed here. 9.2.6.A.1
Shim Packs
Multiple stacks of steel shim plates can be placed atop the concrete surface to temporarily support the weight of the girders on their bearings before grouting. Engineering judgment must be used in selecting the number and plan size of the shims taking grout flowability and shim height adjustability into consideration. 9.2.6.A.2
Two-step Grouting with Cast Sleeves
A two-step grouting procedure with cast-in-place voided cores can be used for smaller HLMRs not generally subjected to uplift. Steel studs are welded to the underside of the masonry plate to coincide with the voided cores. With temporary shims installed between the top of the concrete surface and the underside of the masonry plate, the voided cores are fully grouted. Once the first stage grout has attained strength, the shims are removed, the masonry plate is dammed, and grout is placed between the top of the concrete surface and the underside of the masonry plate. 9.2.6.B
Anchor Bolts
Anchor bolts shall be designed to resist all horizontal shear forces and direct tension force due to uplift. Anchor bolts shall be ASTM A 449 where strengths equal to ASTM A 325 are required and ASTM A 354, Grade BD, where strengths equal to ASTM A 490 are required. ASTM F 1554 bolts with supplemental Charpy test requirements shall be specified in applications in which the bolts are subject to seismic loading.
9.2.7
Contract Drawing Representation High load multi-rotational bearings are generally depicted schematically in the contract drawings. Each bearing manufacturer has unique fabricating methods and procedures that allow it to fabricate a bearing most economically. Depicting the bearings schematically with loads and geometric requirements provides each manufacturer the flexibility to innovatively achieve optimal economy.
9.2.8
Shop Drawing Review The manufacturer designs and develops shop drawings for high load multi-rotational bearings. The Engineer is responsible for checking and approving the calculations and shop drawings. The calculations shall verify the structural adequacy of all components of the bearing. Each bearing shall be detailed to permit the inspection and replacement of components.

Bearings and Expansion Joints
Bearing Replacement Considerations In some situations, existing bearings, or elements thereof, must be replaced consequent to excessive wear or seismic rehabilitation. Bearing replacement operations generally require lifting of superstructure elements using hydraulic jacks. The designer is responsible for calculating anticipated lifting loads and stipulating these loads on the contract drawings. Limitations on lift height shall also be specified. Consideration shall be given to lift height as it relates to adjacent expansion joints elements and adjoining sections of railing. Stresses induced as a consequence of differential lift height between multiple hydraulic jacks are generally addressed by stipulating restrictions in the plans or special provisions. Past experience shows that actual lifting loads nearly always exceed calculated lifting loads. Many factors may contribute to this phenomenon, including friction in the hydraulic jack system and underestimation of superstructure dead loads. Unless the Bearing and Expansion Joint Specialist or the State Bridge Design Engineer approves a variance, contract documents shall require that all hydraulic jacks be sized for 200 percent of the calculated lifting load. In all cases, the designer shall verify from manufacturer’s literature that appropriate hydraulic jacks are available to operate within the space limitations imposed by a particular design situation.

Seismic Isolation Bearings
9.3.1
General Considerations
Chapter 9
Numerous seismic isolation bearings exist, each relying upon varying combinations of dynamic isolation and energy dissipation. These devices include lead core elastomeric bearings, high damping rubber, friction pendulum, hydraulic dampers, and various hybrid variations. Effective seismic isolation bearing design requires a thorough understanding of the dynamic characteristics of the overall structure as well as the candidate isolation devices. Isolation devices are differentiated by maximum compressive load capacity, lateral stiffness, lateral displacement range, maximum lateral load capacity, energy dissipation per cycle, functionality in extreme environments, resistance to aging, fatigue and wear properties, and effects of size. The Highway Innovative Technology Evaluation Center (HITEC) has developed guidelines for testing seismic isolation and energy dissipating devices. With the goal of disseminating objective information to design professionals, HITEC has tested and published technical reports on numerous proprietary devices. These tests include performance benchmarks, compressive load dependent characterization, frequency dependent characterization, fatigue and wear, environmental aging, dynamic performance at extreme temperatures, durability, and ultimate performance.
9.3.2
Suitability and Selection Considerations The decision to use seismic isolation bearings should be made during the early stages of project development based upon complexity of the geotechnical issues and bridge structural design. A cost-benefit analysis comparing Type 1 (ductile substructure) design vs. Type 3 (seismic isolation) design shall be performed and submitted for approval to the Bridge Design Engineer. The designer shall perform two separate designs, one with and one without seismic isolation bearings. The cost-benefit analysis shall, as minimum, address the following:
• Longer initial design time and increased analysis complexity
• Impact of preliminary and final design time on the project delivery schedule
• Time required for feasibility assessment of seismic isolation and consultation with prospective isolation bearing suppliers
• Life cycle cost associated with additional specialized bearing inspections
• Life cycle cost associated with potential bearing and expansion joint replacements
• Long-term performance and maintenance issues
• Necessity for larger movement range expansion joints to accommodate isolation effects Seismic isolation bearings shall not be used between top of column and bottom of crossbeam in either single or multiple column bents. Following approval, by the State Bridge Design Engineer, to use seismic isolation bearings, the designer shall send a set of preliminary plans and mitigation requirements to at least three seismic isolation bearing suppliers for evaluation to determine if they can meet the design and specification requirements. Inspection and maintenance requirements shall be solicited from the suppliers to ascertain that their bearings will function satisfactorily throughout the design life of the bridge, including after any seismic events. Comments
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 9-33
Chapter 9
Bearings and Expansion Joints
from suppliers shall be considered and appropriately assimilated before commencing final structural design. Sole source procurement may be considered and pursued upon approval by the State Bridge Design Office and the Project Engineer. Seismic isolation bearings may not provide significant benefit for concrete bridges under 700 foot length, steel bridges under 800 foot length, bridges having skew in excess of 30 degrees, or bridges with geometrical complexities, variable superstructure width, or dropin spans. As such, seismic isolation bearings are not recommended for bridges having these characteristics. The suitability of seismic isolation bearings for a specific project should be carefully evaluated prior to approval. Seismic isolation bearings may not be an effective solution for some combinations of bridge types and site conditions. For example, increasing the fundamental period of a structure founded on soft soils may not reduce the force demand. Design shall include near fault effects and soil-structure interaction associated with soft soil sites. Expansion joints must accommodate seismic movements in order for seismic isolation bearings to function properly. The effect of this increased movement upon expansion joint demands shall be carefully considered. Modular expansion joints are generally designed to accommodate longitudinal service movement only. Design of modular expansion joints to accommodate longitudinal service movement is generally based upon limiting the movement capacity per elastomeric seal to 3 inches maximum in order to limit the fraction of wheel load imposed upon any one centerbeam and to assure that elastomeric seals will not detach under service load conditions. Because the fatigue limit state almost always controls centerbeam and support bar design, a larger movement capacity per cell is acceptable to accommodate seismic movement provided that 1) support bars and boxes are detailed to accommodate the increased movement and 2) elastomeric seal detachment is acceptable. Standard modular expansion joints are not designed to accommodate transverse bridge movements. Seismic modular expansion joints must be used if transverse movement must also be accommodated.
9.3.3
General Design Criteria Seismic isolation bearings shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of the AASHTO Guide Specifications for Seismic Isolation Design. The response modification factors (R-factors) contained in Article 6 shall not be used if the provisions of the LRFD SEISMIC are being followed for the design of the bridge.
9.3.4
Seismic Isolation Bearing Submittal Requirements The selected manufacturer shall develop and submit seismic isolation bearing design calculations and shop drawings to WSDOT for review and approval. Design calculations and shop drawings shall be based upon the loads, movement demands, schematic details, and engineering requirements contained in the contract drawings and Special Provisions. All suppliers are required to provide calculations and shop drawings regardless of the contracting method or whether sole source procurement has been approved. The use of seismic isolation bearings for WSDOT projects shall fully comply with the requirements herein.

Overhead Cantilever and Bridge Sign and signal structures, high-mast lighting towers (HMLT), poles, and bridge mounted sign brackets shall conform to the following fatigue categories. Fatigue Category I: Overhead cantilever sign structures (maximum span of 35 feet and no VMS installation), overhead sign bridge structures, high-mast lighting towers 55 feet or taller in height, bridge-mounted sign brackets, and all signal bridges. Gantry or pole structures used to support sensitive electronic equipment (tolling, weighin-motion, transmitter/receiver antennas, transponders, etc.) shall be designed for Fatigue Category I, and shall also meet any deflection limitations imposed by the electronic equipment manufacturers. Fatigue Category II: For structures not explicitly falling into Category I or III. Fatigue Category III: Lighting poles less than 55 feet in height with rectangular or square cross sections, or non-tapered round cross sections, and overhead cantilever traffic signals (maximum cantilever length 65 feet). Sign bridges, cantilever sign structures, signal bridges, and overhead cantilever traffic signals mounted on bridges shall be either attached to substructure elements (e.g., crossbeam extensions) or to the bridge superstructure at pier locations. Mounting these features to bridges as described above will help to avoid resonance concerns between the bridge structure and the signing or signal structure. CCTV camera pole shall meet deflection criteria specified on Standard Plan J-29-15 for fixed base. The “XYZ” limitation shown in Table 10.1.4-2 shall be met for Monotube Cantilevers. The “XYZ” limitation consists of the product of the sign area (XY) and the arm from the centerline of the posts to the centerline of the sign (Z). See Appendix 10.1-A2-1 for details. 10.1.1.F
Ice and Snow Loads
A 3 psf ice load may be applied around all the surfaces of structural supports, horizontal members, and luminaires, but applied to only one face of sign panels (Section 3.7, AASHTO 2015). Walk-through VMS shall not be installed in areas where appreciable snow loads may accumulate on top of the sign, unless positive steps are taken to prevent snow build-up. 10.1.1.G
Group Load Combinations
Sign, luminaire, and signal support structures are designed using the load factors from Table 3.4-1, AASHTO 2015 (including latest interims).

Impact Loads
Vehicle impact loads shall be applied to sign, luminaire and traffic signal foundations that are integrated into roadside traffic barriers. The vehicle impact loads shall be applied at the height specified for intended test levels in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Section 13 Table A13.2-1 “Design Forces For Traffic Railing (32-inch for TL-4 and 42-inch for TL-5).” Structural supports for signs, luminaires and traffic signals are normally not designed for the application of vehicle impact loads (with the exception of pole or post-type supports on break-away bases).

Bridge Mounted Signs 10.1.2.A
Vertical Clearance
All new signs mounted on bridge structures shall be positioned such that the bottom of the sign or lighting bracket does not extend below the bottom of the bridge as shown in Figure 10.1.2-1. The position of the sign does not need to allow for the future placement of lights below the sign. If lights are to be added in the future they will be mounted above the sign. To ensure that the bottom of the sign or lighting bracket is above the bottom of the bridge, the designer shall maintain at least a nominal 2 inch dimension between the bottom of the sign or lighting and the bottom of the bridge to account for construction tolerances and bracket arm sag. Bridge mounted sign brackets shall be designed to account for the weight of added lights, and for the wind effects on the lights to ensure bracket adequacy if lighting is attached in the future.

Design Loads
Design loads for the supports of the Sign Bridges shall be calculated based on assuming a 12‑foot‑deep sign over the entire roadway width, under the sign bridge, regardless of the sign area initially placed on the sign bridge. For Cantilever design loads, guidelines specified in Section 10.1.1 shall be followed. The design loads shall follow the same criteria as described in Section 10.1.1. Loads from the sign bridge shall be included in the design of the supporting bridge. In cases where a sign structure is mounted on a bridge, the sign structure, from the anchor bolt group and above, shall be designed to AASHTO LRFD Standard Specifications for Structural Supports for Highway Signs, Luminaires, and Traffic Signals First Edition, dated 2015 including interims. The concrete, the anchor bolt group, and the connecting elements to the bridge structure shall be designed to the specifications in this manual and AASHTO LRFD. The loads calculated from the AASHTO LRFD Specifications for Structural Supports for Signs, Luminaires and Traffic Signals (AASHTO SLTS) shall be considered as Service Loads (LF =1.0). These Service Loads shall be factored as required for the Strength and Extreme Limit States described in AASHTO LRFD Table 3.4.1-1, and used for design of sign structure foundation elements incorporated into new structures. For sign structure foundation elements attached to older structures originally designed using Allowable Stress Design, the loads calculated using AASHTO SLTS may be considered as Service Loads. 10.1.3.B
Vertical Clearance
Vertical clearance for Monotube Sign Structures shall be 20′-0″ minimum from the bottom of the lowest sign to the highest point in the traveled lanes. See Appendix 10.1A1-1, 10.1-A2-1, and 10.1-A3-1 for sample locations of Minimum Vertical Clearances. 10.1.3.C
Geometrics
Sign structures shall be placed at approximate right angles to approaching motorists. Dimensions and details of sign structures are shown in Appendix 10.1-A1-1, 10.1-A1-2, and 10.1-A1-3 and 10.1-A2-1, 10.1-A2-2, and 10.1-A2-3.

Foundations 10.1.5.A
Monotube Sign Structure Foundation Types
The foundation type to be used shall be based on the geotechnical investigation performed and geotechnical report completed by the geotechnical engineer of record. Monotube sign structure foundations are Bridge Design Office conventional designs and shall be as described in the following paragraphs: 1.
Foundation Type 1, is the preferred foundation type. A foundation Type 1 consists of a drilled shaft with its shaft cap. The design of the shaft depths shown in the Bridge Standard Drawings are based on an allowable lateral bearing pressure of 2,500 psf. The designer shall check these shaft depths using AASHTO LRFD methodology. For Type 1 foundation details and shaft depths see Bridge Standard Drawings 10.1-A4-1
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 10-11
Chapter 10
Signs, Barriers, Approach Slabs, and Utilities
and 10.1-A4-2. The Geotechnical Report for Foundation Type 1 should include the soil friction angle, soil unit weight, allowable lateral bearing pressure and temporary casing if required. Temporary casing shall be properly detailed in all Foundation Type 1 sheets if the Geotechnical Engineer requires them. 2.
Foundation Type 2 is an alternate to Type 1 when drilled shafts are not suitable to the site. Foundation Type 2 is designed for an allowable lateral bearing pressure of 2,500 psf. See Bridge Standard Drawing 10.1‑A4‑3 for Foundation Type 2 Bridge Design Office conventional design information. The designer shall check these shaft depths using LRFD methodology.
3.
Foundation Type 3 replaces the foundation Type 2 for poor soil conditions where the allowable lateral bearing pressure is between 2,500 psf and 1,500 psf. See Bridge Standard Drawing 10.1-A4-3 for Type 3 Foundation Bridge Design Office conventional design information. The designer shall check these shaft depths using LRFD methodology.
4.
Barrier Shape Foundations are foundations that include a barrier shape cap on the top portion of Foundation Types 1, 2, and 3. Foundation details shall be modified to include Barrier Shape Cap details. Appendix 10.1-A5-1 details a single slope barrier.
10.1.5.B
Luminaire, Signal Standard, and Camera Pole Foundation Types
Luminaire foundation options are shown on Standard Plan J-28.30. Signal Standard and Camera Pole foundation options are provided on Standard Plans J-26.10 and J-29.10 respectively. 10.1.5.C
Foundation Design
Shaft type foundations constructed in soil for sign bridges, cantilever sign structures, luminaires, signal standards and strain poles shall be designed in accordance with the current edition of the AASHTO LRFD Standard Specifications for Highway Signs, Luminaires, and Traffic Signals; Section 13.6 Drilled Shafts. For stratified soil conditions, a weighted average approach should be used to calculate a uniform set of soil properties (soil friction angle, soil unit weight, allowable lateral bearing pressure) for foundation design. No provisions for foundation torsional capacity are provided in Section 13.6 of the AASHTO LRFD Standard Specifications for Highway Signs, Luminaires, and Traffic Signals. The following approach can be used to calculate torsional capacity of sign structure, luminaire, and signal standard foundations: Torsional Capacity, φTn, Tn = F*tanφD/2 10.1.5(1) Where: F = Total force normal to shaft surface (kip) D = Diameter of shaft (feet) φ = Soil to foundation contact friction angle (degree), use smallest for variable soils

Chapter 10
Monotube Sign Structures Foundation Type 1 Design
The standard embedment depth “Z”, shown in the table on Monotube Sign Structure Standard Drawing 10.1-A4-1, shall be used as a minimum embedment depth and shall be increased if the shaft is placed on a sloped surface. The standard depth assumed that the top 4 feet of the C.I.P. cap is not included in the lateral resistance (i.e., shaft depth “D” in the code mentioned above), but is included in the overturning length of the sign structure. The sign structure shaft foundation GSPs under Section 8-21 in the RFP Appendix shall be included with all Foundation Type 1 shafts. 10.1.5.C.2
Monotube Sign Structures Foundation Type 2 and 3
These foundation designs are Bridge Design Office convention and shall not be adjusted or redesigned. They are used in conditions where a Foundation Type 1 (shaft) would be impractical due to difficult drilling or construction and when the State Geotechnical Engineer specifies their use. The concept is that the foundation excavation would maintain a vertical face in the shape of the Foundation Type 2 or 3. Contractors often request to over-excavate and backfill the hole, after formwork has been used to construct this foundation type. This is only allowed with the State Geotechnical Engineer's approval, if the forming material is completely removed, and if the backfill material is either CDF or concrete class 3000 or better. 10.1.5.C.3
Monotube Sign Structures Non-Conventional Design Foundations
The Geotechnical Engineer of record shall identify conditions where the foundation types (1, 2, or 3) will not work. In this case, the design forces are calculated, using the AASHTO LRFD Standard Specifications for Structural Supports for Highway Signs, Luminaires, and Traffic Signals, and applied at the bottom of the structure base plate. These forces are then considered service loads and the non-conventional design foundation is designed with the appropriate Service, Strength, and Extreme Load Combination Limit States and current design practices of the AASHTO LRFD and this manual. Some examples of these foundations are spread footings, columns and shafts that extend above ground adjacent to retaining walls, or connections to traffic barriers on bridges. The anchor rod array shall be used from Tables 10.1.4-1 and 10.1.4-2 and shall be long enough to develop the rods into the confined concrete core of the foundation. The rod length and the reinforcement for concrete confinement, shown in the top four feet of the Foundation Type 1, shall be used as a minimum. 10.1.5.C.4
Signal Foundation Design
The traffic signal standard GSPs under Section 8-20 shall apply for foundations in substandard soils.

10.2.1
General Guidelines
Chapter 10
The design criteria for traffic barriers on structures shall be in accordance with Section 13 of the AASHTO LRFD. The following guidelines supplement the requirements in AASHTO LRFD. The WSDOT Bridge and Structures standard for traffic barriers on new bridges, bridge approach slabs, retaining walls, Structural Earth Wall traffic barriers, and Geosynthetic wall traffic barrier and differential grade median traffic barriers shall be a 42 inch Single Slope concrete barrier for all Interstate, United States Numbered Highway System, and State highway routes unless special conditions apply. The 42 inch requirement is in accordance with the “Fall Protection” requirements of the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries, (WAC 296-155-24609 and WAC 296-155-24615 2a), and the  AASHTO resolution for Fall Protection. The WSDOT Bridge and Structures standard for existing bridges, bridge rehabilitation projects, and median barrier shall be a 34 inch or 42 inch Single Slope traffic barrier. Use of a 32 inch or 42 inch F Shape concrete barrier shall be limited to locations where there is F Shape concrete barrier on the approach grade to a bridge or for continuity within a corridor. Use of a 32 inch Pedestrian concrete barrier shall be limited to locations with sidewalk. Use of a 42 inch or 54 inch combination barrier (32 inch or 34 inch concrete barrier increased by metal railing) are less economical, require more maintenance, and shall be limited for purposes such as scenic roads. For additional requirements for pedestrian and bicycle/pedestrian railings, see Section 10.5.1. It shall be the Bridge and Structures Office policy to design traffic barriers for new structures using a minimum Test Level 4 (TL-4) design criteria regardless of the height of the barrier safety shape. The Test Level shall be indicated in the Bridge General Notes or General Notes. A Test Level 5 (TL-5) traffic barrier shall be used on new structures under the following conditions:
• “T” intersections on a structure.
• Barriers on structures with a radius of curvature less than 500 ft, TL-4 is adequate for the barrier on the inside of the curve.
• Greater than 10 percent Average Daily Truck Traffic (ADTT) where approach speeds are 50 mph or greater (e.g., freeway off-ramps).
• Accident history suggests a need.
• Protection of schools, business, or other important facilities below the bridge. See AASHTO LRFD Section 13 for additional Test Level selection criteria.
10.2.2
Bridge Railing Test Levels It must be recognized that bridge traffic barrier performance needs differ greatly from site to site. Barrier designs and costs should match facility needs. This concept is embodied in the AASHTO LRFD. Six different bridge railing test levels, TL-1 thru TL-6, and associated crash test/performance requirements are given in AASHTO LRFD Section 13 along with guidance for determining the appropriate test level for a given bridge.

Available WSDOT Designs 10.2.3.A
Service Level 1 (SL-1) Weak Post Guardrail (TL-2)
This bridge traffic barrier is a crash tested weak post rail system. It was developed by Southwest Research Institute and reported in NCHRP Report 239 for low-volume rural roadways with little accident history. This design has been utilized on a number of short concrete spans and timber bridges. A failure mechanism is built into this rail system such that upon a 10 kip applied impact load, the post will break away from the mounting bracket. The thrie beam guardrail will contain the vehicle by virtue of its ribbon strength. This system was designed for a Working Stress design force of 10 kip applied at 22 inches above the deck surface. To ensure minimal or no damage to the bridge deck and stringers, the breakaway connection may be modified for a lower impact load (2 kip minimum) with approval of the State Bridge Design Engineer. The 2 kip minimum equivalent impact load is based on evaluation of the wood rail post strength tested in NCHRP Report 239. The appropriate guardrail approach transition shall be a Case 14 placement as shown on WSDOT Standard Plan C-2h. For complete details see Appendix 10.4-A1-4. 10.2.3.B
Texas T-411 Aesthetic Concrete Baluster (TL-2)
Texas developed this standard for a section of highway that was considered to be a historic landmark. The existing deficient concrete baluster rail was replaced with a much stronger concrete baluster that satisfactorily passed the crash test performance criteria set forth by the NCHRP Report 230. For details, visit TXDOT’s Bridge and Structures website at www.txdot.gov/inside-txdot/division/bridge.html.

Traffic Barrier – 32″ F-Shape (TL-3)
This configuration was crash tested in the late 1960s, along with the New Jersey Shape, under NCHRP 230 and again at this test level under NCHRP 350. The steeper vertical shape tested better than the New Jersey face and had less of an inclination to roll vehicles over upon impact. For future deck overlays, an encroachment of 2.0 in., leaving a 1.0 in. lip has been satisfactorily tested for safety shapes, see AASHTO Article C13.7.3.2. This barrier height will require the use of a Bridge Railing Type Pedestrian railing to meet fall protection requirements. For complete details see Bridge Standard Drawings 10.2-A1 and 10.2-A2. 10.2.3.D
Traffic Barrier – 34″ Single Slope (TL-3)
This concrete traffic barrier system was designed by the state of California in the 1990s to speed up construction by using the “slip forming” method of construction. It was tested under NCHRP 350. WSDOT has increased the height from 32″ to 34″ to match the approach traffic barrier height and to allow the placement of one HMA overlay. Due to inherent problems with the “slip forming” method of traffic barrier construction WSDOT has increased the concrete cover on the traffic side from 1½″ to 2½″. This barrier height will require the use of a Bridge Railing Type Pedestrian railing to meet fall protection requirements. For complete details, see Bridge Standard Drawing 10.2-A3.

10.2.3.E
Pedestrian Barrier (TL-3)
This crash tested rail system offers a simple to build concrete alternative to the New Jersey and F-Shape configurations. This system was crash tested under both NCHRP 230 and 350. Since the traffic face geometry is better for pedestrians and bicyclists, WSDOT uses this system primarily in conjunction with a sidewalk. This barrier height will require the use of a Bridge Railing Type Pedestrian railing to meet fall protection requirements. For complete details, see Bridge Standard Drawing 10.2-A4. The Pedestrian Barrier has been reduced from a TL-4 barrier to a TL-3 barrier due to its height of 34” being less than adequate to contain the design vehicle when compared to MASH criteria. The intent is to design this barrier as a TL-4 barrier, even though its classification does not meet TL-4 due to the height. On projects which have a minimum of 5’ of raised sidewalk from the barrier face to traffic or a TL-4 barrier protecting the Pedestrian Barrier from traffic, it is permissible to use this barrier for new construction as a TL-3. For instances absent a TL-4 barrier or sidewalk as described, a unique barrier design with an overall height of 36” is required to meet the TL-4 criteria. 10.2.3.F
Oregon 3-Tube Curb Mounted Traffic Barrier (TL-4)
This is another crash tested traffic barrier that offers a lightweight, see-through option. This system was crash tested under both NCHRP 230 and 350. A rigid thrie beam guardrail transition is required at the bridge ends. For details, see the Oregon Bridge and Structure website at www.oregon.gov/ODOT/HWY/ENGSERVICES/Pages/bridge_ drawings.aspx.

Design Criteria 10.2.4.A
Design Values
AASHTO LRFD Appendix A13 shall be used to design bridge traffic barriers and their supporting elements (i.e. the deck). Concrete traffic barriers shall be designed using yield line analysis as described in AASHTO LRFD A13.3.1. The impact loads on traffic barriers shall be applied at the height specified for intended Test Levels in accordance to the AASHTO LRFD Table A13.2-1 “Design Forces for Traffic Railing”. WSDOT Standard F Shape, Single Slope, and Pedestrian barriers meet these requirements. Deck overhangs supporting traffic barriers shall be designed in accordance with AASHTO LRFD A13.4. For concrete traffic barriers in Design Case 1, AASHTO requires MS, the deck overhang flexural resistance, to be greater than Mc of the concrete traffic barrier base. This requirement is consistent with yield line analysis (see AASHTO LRFD CA13.3.1), but results in over conservative deck overhang designs.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 10-19
Chapter 10
Signs, Barriers, Approach Slabs, and Utilities
In order to prevent this unnecessary overdesign of the deck overhang, the nominal traffic barrier resistance to transverse load RW (AASHTO LRFD A13.3.1) transferred from the traffic barrier to deck overhang shall not exceed 120 percent of the design force Ft (AASHTO LFRD Table A13.2-1) required for a traffic barrier. The deck overhang shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of AASHTO LRFD A13.4.2 to provide a flexural resistance Ms, acting coincident with the tensile force T. At the inside face of the barrier Ms may be taken as: for an interior barrier segment–Ms =
Rw · He LC + 2 · H
and for an end barrier segment–Ms =
R w · He LC + H
However, Ms need not be taken greater than Mc at the base. T shall be taken as: for an interior barrier segment–T =
Rw LC + 2 · H
and for an end barrier segment–T =
Rw LC + H
The end segment requirement may be waived if continuity between adjacent barriers is provided. When an HMA overlay is required for initial construction, increase the weight for Shape F traffic barrier. See Section 10.2.4.C for details. 10.2.4.B
Geometry
The traffic face geometry is part of the crash test and shall not be modified. Contact the WSDOT Bridge and Structure Office Bridge Rail Specialist for further guidance. Thickening of the traffic barrier is permissible for architectural reasons. Concrete clear cover must meet minimum concrete cover requirements but can be increased to accommodate rustication grooves or patterns. 10.2.4.C
Standard Detail Sheet Modifications
When designing and detailing a bridge traffic barrier on a superelevated bridge deck the following guidelines shall be used:
• For bridge decks with a superelevation of 8 percent or less, the traffic barriers (and the median barrier, if any) shall be oriented perpendicular to the bridge deck.
• For bridge decks with a superelevation of more than 8 percent, the traffic barrier on the low side of the bridge (and median barrier, if any) shall be oriented perpendicular to an 8 percent superelevated bridge deck. For this situation, the traffic barrier on the high side of the bridge shall be oriented perpendicular to the bridge deck. The standard detail sheets are generic and may need to be modified for each project. The permissible modifications are:
• Removal of the electrical conduit, junction box, and deflection fitting details.
• Removal of design notes.
• If the traffic barrier does not continue on to a wall, remove W1 and W2 rebar references.
• Removal of the non-applicable guardrail end connection details and verbiage.

Chapter 10
• If guardrail is attached to the traffic barrier, use either the thrie beam end section “Design F” detail or the w-beam end section “Design F” detail. If the traffic barrier continues off the bridge, approach slab, or wall, remove the following:
• Guardrail details from all sheets.
• Conduit end flare detail.
• Modified end section detail and R1A or R2A rebar details from all sheets.
• End section bevel.
• Increase the 3″ toe dimension of the Shape F traffic barriers up to 6″ to accommodate HMA overlays. 10.2.4.D
Miscellaneous Design Information
• Show the back of pavement seat in the “Plan – Traffic Barrier” detail.
• At roadway expansion joints, show traffic barrier joints normal to centerline except as shown on sheets Appendix 9.1-A1-1 and 9.1-A2-1.
• When an overlay is required, the 2′-8″ minimum dimension shown in the “Typical Section – Traffic Barrier” shall be referenced to the top of the overlay.
• When bridge lighting is part of the contract, include the lighting bracket anchorage detail sheet.
• Approximate quantities for the traffic barrier sheets are: Barrier Type 32″ F-shape (3″ toe) 32″ F-shape (6″ toe) 34″ Single Slope 42″ F-shape (3″ toe) 42″ F-shape (6″ toe) 42″ Single Slope

At Grade Concrete Barriers
10.3.1
Differential Grade Concrete Barriers
Chapter 10
The top of the differential grade concrete barrier shall have a minimum width of 6″. If a luminaire or sign is to be mounted on top of the differential grade concrete barrier, then the width shall be increased to accommodate the mounting plate and 6″ of clear distance on each side of the luminaire or sign pole. The transition flare rate shall follow the Design Manual M 22-01. 10.3.1.A
Differential Grade Concrete Barriers
Concrete barriers at grade are sometimes required in median areas with different roadway elevations on each side. The standard Single Slope barrier can be used for a grade difference up to 10″ for a 2′-10″ safety shape and up to 6″ for a 3′-6″ safety shape. See Standard Plans C-70.10 and C-80.10 for details. If the difference in grade elevations is 4′-0″ or less, then the concrete barrier shall be designed as a rigid system in accordance with AASHTO LRFD with the following requirements: 1.
All applicable loads shall be applied in accordance to AASHTO LRFD Section 3. The structural capacity of the differential grade concrete barrier and supporting elements shall be designed for the required Test Level (TL) vehicle impact design forces in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Sections 5 and 13. Any section along the differential grade barrier and supporting elements shall not fail in shear, bending, or torsion when the barrier is subjected to the TL impact forces.
2.
For soil loads without vehicle impact loads, the concrete barrier shall be designed as a retaining wall (barrier weight resists overturning and sliding). Passive soil resistance may be considered with concurrence by the geotechnical engineer.
3.
Vehicle impact loads shall be applied on the side of the concrete barrier retaining soil if there is traffic on both sides. The vehicle impact loads shall be applied at the height specified for intended Test Levels in accordance to the AASHTO LRFD Section 13, Table A13.2-1 “Design Forces for Traffic Railing (32-inch for TL-4, and 42-inch for TL-5)”.
4.
For soil loads with vehicle impact loads, the AASHTO LRFD Extreme Event loading for vehicular collision shall also be analyzed. Equivalent Static Load (ESL) per NCHRP Report 663 may be applied as the transverse vehicle impact load for evaluating sliding, bearing, and overturning only. For TL-4 barrier systems, the ESL shall be 10 kips and for TL-5, the ESL shall be 23 kips. The point of rotation for overturning shall be taken at the toe of barrier. Sliding resistance factor shall be 0.8 and overturning resistance factor shall be 0.5 (supersedes AASHTO 10.5.5.3.3).
5.
The effective length of the concrete barrier required for stability shall be no more than 10 times the overall height, but not to exceed the length between barrier expansion joints (or one precast section). The barrier shall act as a rigid body behavior and shall be continuous throughout this length of barrier. Any coupling between adjacent barrier sections or friction that may exist between free edges of barrier and the surrounding soil shall be neglected.

Signs, Barriers, Approach Slabs, and Utilities
6.
A special impact analysis shall be performed at the barrier ends if the barrier terminates without being connected to a rigid object or dowelled to another barrier. Differential barrier deflection from barrier impact may cause a vehicle to “snag” on the undeflected barrier. The barrier depth may need to be increased at the end to prevent this deflection.
7.
The differential grade traffic barrier shall have dummy joints at 8 to 12 foot centers based on project requirements.
8.
Full depth expansion joints with shear dowels at the top will be required at intervals based on analysis but not to exceed a 120′-0″ maximum spacing.
9.
Barrier bottom shall be embedded a minimum 6″ below roadway. Roadway subgrade and ballast shall be extended below whole width of differential grade barrier.
Median traffic barriers with a grade difference greater than 4′-0″ shall be designed as standard plan retaining walls with a traffic barrier at the top and a barrier shape at the cut face.

General
The guidelines provided herein are based on NCHRP Report 663 with the exception that a resistance factor of 0.5 shall be used to determine rotational resistance.

Guidelines for Moment Slab Design
10.3.2.B.1
Structural Capacity
The structural capacity of the barrier and concrete moment slab shall be designed using impulse loads at appropriate Test Level (TL-4 and TL-5) applied to the top of the barrier in accordance with Sections 5 and 13 of AASHTO LRFD. Any section along the moment slab shall not fail in shear, bending, or torsion when the barrier is subjected to the design impact loads. The torsion capacity of the moment slab must be equal to or greater than the traffic barrier moment generated by the specified TL static equivalent of the vehicle impulse load. Page 10-24
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Signs, Barriers, Approach Slabs, and Utilities
Chapter 10
The moment slab shall be designed as a deck supporting barrier in accordance to AASHTO LRFD A13.4.2 as modified by BDM Section 10.2.4.A. The moment slab reinforcement shall be designed to resist combined forces from the moment MS (kip-ft/ ft) and the tensile force T (kip/ft). MS and T are determined from the lesser of the ultimate transverse resistance of barrier RW (kip) and 120 percent of transverse vehicle impact force FT (kip). MS is not to be exceeded by the ultimate strength of barrier at its base MC (kip-ft/ft). 10.3.2.B.2
Global Stability
Bearing stress, sliding, and overturning stability of the moment slab shall be based on an Equivalent Static Load (ESL) applied at the height specified for intended Test Levels in accordance to the AASHTO LRFD Section 13, Table A13.2-1 “Design Forces for Traffic Railing”. For TL-4 barrier systems, the ESL shall be 10 kips. For TL-5 barrier systems, the ESL shall be 23 kips. The Equivalent Static Load (ESL) is assumed to distribute over the length of continuous moment slab through rigid body behavior. Barrier shall also be continuous or have shear connections between barrier sections if precast throughout this length of moment slab. Any coupling between adjacent moment slabs or friction that may exist between free edges of the moment slab and the surrounding soil should be neglected. 10.3.2.B.3
Minimum and Maximum Dimensions
The minimum height of the traffic barrier portion of the moment slab shall be 42 inches above the finished roadway surface. Moment slabs shall have a minimum width of 4.0 feet measured from the point of rotation to the heel of the slab and a minimum average depth of 0.83 feet. Moment slabs meeting these minimum requirements are assumed to provide rigid body behavior up to a length of 60 feet limited to the length between moment slab joints. Rigid body behavior may be increased from 60 feet to a maximum of 120 feet if the torsional rigidity constant of the moment slab is proportionately increased and the reinforcing steel is designed to resist combined shear, moment, and torsion from TL static equivalent of the vehicle impulse loads. For example: Rigid Body Length = (J’/J60)x(60 ft.) < 120 feet The torsional rigidity constant for moment slabs shall be based on a solid rectangle using the following formula:
Where: 2a = total width of moment slab 2b = average depth of moment slab For example: Minimum Moment Slab Width = 48 inches: a = 24 inches Minimum Moment Slab Average Depth = 10 inches: b = 5 inches J = J60 = 13,900 in4

Sliding of the Barrier
The factored static resistance to sliding (φP) of the barrier-moment slab system along its base shall satisfy the following condition: φP ≥ γLs (1) Where: Ls = Equivalent Static Load (10 kips for TL-3 or TL-4, 23 kips for TL-5) φ = resistance factor (0.8) Supersedes AASHTO 10.5.5.3.3—Other Extreme Limit States γ = load factor (1.0) for TL-3 and TL-4 [crash tested extreme event] load factor (1.2) for TL-5 [untested extreme event] P = static resistance (kips) P shall be calculated as:
(2)
P = W tan φr Where: W = weight of the monolithic section of barrier and moment slab between joints or assumed length of rigid body behavior whichever is less, plus any material laying on top of the moment slab φr = friction angle of the soil on the moment slab interface (°)
If the soil-moment slab interface is rough (e.g., cast in place), φr is equal to the friction angle of the soil φs. If the soil-moment slab interface is smooth (e.g., precast), tan φr shall be reduced accordingly (0.8 tan φs). 10.3.2.B.5
Overturning of the Barrier
The factored static moment resistance (φM) of the barrier-moment slab system to overturning shall satisfy the following condition: φM ≥ γLs ha (3) Where: A = point of rotation, where the toe of the moment slab makes contact with compacted backfill adjacent to the fascia wall Lw = width of moment slab Ls = Equivalent Static Load (10 kips for TL-3 and TL-4) (23 kips for TL-5) φ = resistance factor (0.5) Supersedes AASHTO 10.5.5.3.3—Other Extreme Limit States and NCHRP Report 663 γ = load factor (1.0) for TL-3 and TL-4 [crash tested extreme event] load factor (1.2) for TL-5 [untested extreme event] ha = moment arm taken as the vertical distance from the point of impact due to the dynamic force (top of the barrier) to the point of rotation A M = static moment resistance (kips-ft) M shall be calculated as: M = W (La) (4) W = weight of the monolithic section of barrier and moment slab between joints or assumed length of rigid body behavior whichever is less, plus any material laying on top of the moment slab La = horizontal distance from the center of gravity of the weight W to point of rotation A
The moment contribution due to any coupling between adjacent moment slabs, shear strength of the overburden soil, or friction which may exist between the backside of the moment slab and the surrounding soil shall be neglected. Page 10-26

Precast Concrete Barrier 10.3.3.A
Concrete Barrier Type 2
“Concrete Barrier Type 2” (see Standard Plan C-8) may be used on bridges for median applications or for temporary traffic control based on the following guidelines: 1.
For temporary applications, no anchorage is required if there is 2 feet or greater slide distance between the back of the traffic barrier and an object and 3 feet or greater to the edge of the bridge deck or a severe drop off (see Design Manual M 22-01).
2.
For permanent applications in the median, no anchorage will be required if there is a 3 foot or greater slide distance between the traffic barrier and the traffic lane.
3.
For temporary applications, the traffic barrier shall not be placed closer than 9 inches to the edge of a bridge deck or substantial drop-off and shall be anchored (see Standard Plans K-80.35 and K-80.37).
4.
The traffic barrier shall not be used to retain soil that is sloped or greater than the barrier height or soil that supports a traffic surcharge.
10.3.3.B
Concrete Barrier Type 4 and Alternative Temporary Concrete Barrier
“Concrete Barrier Type 4 (see the Standard Plan C-8a), is not a free standing traffic barrier. This barrier shall be placed against a rigid vertical surface that is at least as tall as the traffic barrier. In addition, Alternative Temporary Concrete Barrier Type 4 – Narrow Base (Standard Plan K-80.30) shall be anchored to the bridge deck as shown in Standard Plan K-80.37. The “Concrete Barrier Type 4 and Alternative Temporary Concrete Barrier” are not designed for soil retention.

Bridge Traffic Barrier Rehabilitation
10.4.1
Policy The bridge traffic barrier retrofit policy is: “to systematically improve or replace existing deficient rails within the limits of roadway resurfacing projects.” This is accomplished by:
• Utilizing an approved crash tested rail system that is appropriate for the site or
• Designing a traffic barrier system to the strength requirements set forth by Section 2 of AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges, 17th edition.
10.4.2
Guidelines A strength and geometric review is required for all bridge rail rehabilitation projects. If the strength of the existing bridge rail is unable to resist a 10 kip barrier impact design load or has not been crash tested, then modifications or replacement will be required to improve its redirectional characteristics and strength. Bridges that have deficient bridge traffic barriers were designed to older codes. The AASHTO LFD load of 10 kips shall be used in the retrofit of existing bridge traffic barrier systems constructed prior to the year 2000. The use of the AASHTO LRFD criteria to design bridge traffic barrier rehabs will result in a bridge deck that has insufficient reinforcement to resist moment from a traffic barrier impact load and will increase the retrofit cost due to expensive deck modifications. If the design of the bridge rehabilitation includes other bridge components that will be designed using AASHTO LRFD then the following minimum equivalent Extreme Event (CT) traffic barrier loading can be used: Flexure = (1.3)*(1.67)*(10 kip) / (0.9) = 24.10 kip Shear = (1.3)*(1.67)*(10 kip) / (0.85) = 25.54 kip
10.4.3
Design Criteria Standard thrie beam guardrail post spacing is 6′-3″ except for the SL-1 Weak Post, which is at 8′-4″. Post spacing can be increased up to 10′-0″ if the thrie beam guardrail is nested (doubled up). Gaps in the guardrail are not allowed because they produce snagging hazards. The exceptions to this are:
• Movable bridges at the expansion joints of the movable sections.
• At traffic gates and drop down net barriers.
• At stairways. Design F guardrail end sections will be used at the approach and trailing end of these gaps. For Bridge Traffic Barrier Rehabilitation the following information will be needed from the Region Design office:
• Bridge Site Data Rehabilitation Sheet – DOT Form 235-002A.
• Photos, preferably digital JPEG format.
• Layout with existing dimensions.

Chapter 10
• Standard Plan thrie beam guardrail transitions (selected by Region Design office) to be used at each corner of the bridge (contact bridges and structures office for thrie beam height).
• Location of any existing utilities.
• Measurements of existing ACP to top of curb at the four corners, midpoints and the locations of minimum and maximum difference (five locations each side as a minimum).
• Diagram of the location of Type 3 anchors, if present, including a plan view with vertical and horizontal dimensions of the location of the Type 3 anchor connection relative to the intersecting point of the back of pavement seat with the curb line.
• The proposed overlay type, quantities of removal and placement.
• For timber bridges, the field measurement of the distance from the edge of bridge deck to the first and second stringer is required for mounting plate design. Placement of the retrofit system will be determined from the Design Manual M 22-01. Exceptions to this are bridges with sidewalk strength problems, pedestrian access issues, or vehicle snagging problems.
10.4.4
WSDOT Bridge Inventory of Bridge Rails Concrete balusters are deficient for current lateral load capacity requirements. They have approximately 3 kips of capacity whereas 10 kips is required. The curb and rail base system/Type 7 bridge rail shall maintain a minimum 6 inch curb height. If this requirement is not met then the existing HMA will need to be removed to re-establish the 6 inch minimum curb height during the next paving cycle. Figure 10.4.4-1
The combination high-base concrete parapet and metal rail may or may not be considered adequate depending upon the rail type. The metal rail Type R, S, and SB attached to the top of the high-base parapet are considered capable of resisting the required 5 kips of lateral load. Types 3, 1B, and 3A are considered inadequate. See the Design Manual M 22-01 for replacement criteria.

Washington Thrie Beam Retrofit of Concrete Balusters
This system consists of thrie beam guardrail stiffening of existing concrete baluster rails with timber blockouts. The Southwest Research Institute conducted full-scale crash tests of this retrofit in 1987. Results of the tests were satisfactory and complied with criteria for a Test Level 2 (TL-2) category in the Guide Specifications. For complete details see Bridge Standard Drawing 10.4-A1-1. 10.4.5.B
Delaware Thrie Beam Guardrail
This crash tested rail system can be utilized at the top of a raised concrete sidewalk to separate pedestrian traffic from the vehicular traffic or can be mounted directly to the top of the concrete deck. For complete details see Thrie Beam Retrofit Concrete Curb in Appendix 10.4-A1-3. 10.4.5.C
Concrete Parapet Retrofit
This is similar to the Delaware system. For complete details see Appendix 10.4-A1-2. 10.4.5.D
SL-1 Weak Post
This bridge traffic barrier is a crash tested weak post rail system. It was developed by Southwest Research Institute and reported in NCHRP Report 239 for low-volume rural roadways with little accident history. This design has been utilized on a number of short concrete spans and timber bridges. A failure mechanism is built into this rail system such that upon a 10 kip applied impact load, the post will break away from the mounting bracket. The thrie beam guardrail will contain the vehicle by virtue of its ribbon strength. This system was designed for a Working Stress design force of 10 kip applied at 22 inches above the deck surface. To ensure minimal or no damage to the bridge deck and stringers, the breakaway connection may be modified for a lower impact load (2 kip minimum) with approval of the WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer. The 2 kip minimum equivalent impact load is based on evaluation of the wood rail post strength tested in NCHRP Report 239. The appropriate guardrail approach transition shall be a Case 14 placement as shown on WSDOT Standard Plan C-2h. For complete details see Appendix 10.4-A1-4.

Chapter 10
Bridge Approach Slabs Bridge approaches typically experience two types of settlement, global and local. Global settlement is consolidation of the deeper natural foundation soils. Local settlement is mainly compression of fill materials directly beneath the approach pavement due to construction. The combination of global and local settlements adjacent to the bridge end piers form the characteristic “bump” in the pavement at the bridge. The approach slab significantly reduces local settlement and will provide a transition to the long term roadway differential settlements. Generally, abutments with a deep foundation will have greater differential roadway settlements than spread footing foundations. When Are Bridge Approach Slabs Required Bridge approach slabs are required for the following structures:
• New bridges
• Widened bridges (full roadway width)
• Class 1 and Class 2 Buried Structures without a full depth roadway section (including HMA and CSBC) within 25 feet of each end of the buried structure Bridge approach slabs may be omitted for Buried Structures with structural spans up to 30 ft when concurrence is reached between the Geotechnical Office, the Region Design Project Engineer Office, and the Bridge and Structures Office. Allowances for deleting bridge approach slabs are described in GDM Section 8.6.5.3. Bridge approach slab lengths may be reduced for Buried Structures with structural spans up to 25 ft with approval from the State Geotechnical Engineer. The reduced bridge approach slab length shall not be less than the greater of the structural span length of the Buried Structure and 10 ft. Precast bridge approach slabs shall be considered when accelerated construction is required. Modifications may be required to the basecourse to provide a smooth surface for the precast unit(s). Standard Plan A-40.50 – The Standard Plan A-40.50 is available for the Local Agencies (or others) to use or reference in a contract. Bridge and Structures Office designs will provide detailed information in a customized approach slab Plan View and show the approach slab length on the Bridge Layout Sheet. Bridge Runoff – Bridge runoff at the abutments shall be carried off and collected at least 10 feet beyond the bridge approach slab. Drainage structures such as grate inlets and catch basins shall be located in accordance with Standard Plan B-95.40 and the recommendations of the Hydraulics Branch. Approach Pay Item –All costs in connection with constructing bridge approach slabs are included in the unit contract price per square yard for “Bridge Approach Slab.” The pay item includes steel reinforcing bars, approach slab anchors, concrete, and compression seals.

Depending on the type and number of other roadway features present at the bridge site (such as approach curbs and barriers, drainage structures, sidewalks, utilities and conduit pipes) or special construction requirements such as staged construction, other questions in the Notes to Region pertaining to the bridge approach slabs may be appropriate. Special staging conditions exist when the abutment skew is greater than 30° and for wide roadway widths. This includes bridge widenings with (or without) existing bridge approach slabs. The preliminary plan should include details showing how these conditions are being addressed for the bridge approach slabs, and the designer shall include appropriate questions in the Notes to Region asking for concurrence with the proposed design.
10.6.2
Bridge Approach Slab Design Criteria The standard bridge approach slab design is based on the following criteria:
10.6.3
1.
The bridge approach slab is designed as a slab in accordance with AASHTO LRFD. (Strength Limit State, IM = 1.33, no skew).
2.
The support at the roadway end is assumed to be a uniform soil reaction with a bearing length that is approximately ⅓ the length of the approach slab, or 25′/3 = 8′.
3.
The Effective Span Length (Seff), regardless of approach length, is assumed to be: 25′ approach – 8′ = 17′
4.
Longitudinal reinforcing bars do not require modification for skewed approaches up to 30 degrees or for slab lengths greater than 25′.
5.
The approach slab is designed with a 2″ concrete cover to the bottom reinforcing.
Bridge Approach Slab Detailing The bridge approach slab and length along center line of project shall be shown in the Plan View of the Bridge Layout sheet. The Bridge Plans will also include approach slab information as shown in Bridge Standard Drawings 10.6-A1-1, 10.6-A1-2, and 10.6-A1-3. A minimum pavement seat width of 10 inches is required to support the bridge end of the bridge approach slab. The Approach Slab Plan sheets should be modified as appropriate to match the bridge site conditions. Approach slab Plan Views shall be customized for the specific project and all irrelevant details shall be removed.

Chapter 10
Plan View dimensions shall define the plan area of the approach slab. The minimum dimension from the bridge is 25′. If there are skewed ends, then dimensions shall be provided for each side of the slab, or a skew angle and one side, in addition to the width. For slabs on a curve, the length along the project line and the width shall be shown. Similar to Bridge Traffic Barrier detailing, approach slab steel detailing shall show size, spacing, and edge clearance. The number and total spaces can be determined by the contractor. If applicable, the traffic barrier AS1 and AS2 along with the extra top transverse bar in the slab shall be shown in the Plan View. AS1 bars shall be epoxy coated. Also, remember that the spacing of the AS1 bars decreases near joints. When the skew is greater than 20 degrees, then AP8 bars shall be rotated at the acute corners of the bridge approach slab. Bending diagrams shall be shown for all custom reinforcement. All Bridge Approach Slab sheets will have the AP2 and AP7 bars. If there is a traffic barrier, then AP8, AS1, and AS2 bars shall be shown. Longitudinal contraction joints are required on bridge approach slabs wider than 40 ft. or where steps are used on skewed alignments. Joints shall be located at lane lines or median barrier and in accordance with Bridge Standard Drawing 10.6-A1-2. If joints are to be sawcut, cutting shall occur as soon as possible after finishing the concrete, but after the concrete has set enough not to be torn or damaged by the blade. Additionally, cutting shall occur before shrinkage cracks start to appear, but no later than 48 hours after concrete placement. Early-entry sawing equipment is typically used within 4 hours after finishing the slab, and conventional sawing equipment is typically used between 4 and 12 hours, but may vary depending on the concrete mix design and environmental conditions. Additional layout and details may be required to address special roadway features and construction requirements such as: roadway curbs and barriers, sidewalks, utilities and conduits and staging. This means, if sidewalks and interior barriers (such as trafficpedestrian barriers) are present, special details will be required in the Bridge Plans to show how the sidewalks and interior barriers are connected to and constructed upon the bridge approach slab. If the bridge construction is staged, then the approach slabs will also require staged construction.
10.6.4
Skewed Bridge Approach Slabs For all skewed abutments, the roadway end of the bridge approach slab shall be normal to the roadway centerline. The WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer shall be consulted when approach slab skew is greater than 30 degrees. Skews greater than 20 degrees require analysis to verify the bottom mat reinforcement, and may require expansion joint modifications. The roadway end of the approach may be stepped to reduce the size or to accommodate staging construction widths. A general rule of thumb is that if the approach slab area can be reduced by 50 SY or more, then the slab shall be stepped. At no point shall the roadway end of the approach slab be closer than 25′ to the bridge. These criteria apply to both new and existing bridge approach slabs. If stepped, the design shall provide the absolute minimum number of steps and the longitudinal construction joint shall be located on a lane line. See Figure 10.6.4-1 for clarification.

Approach Anchors and Expansion Joints For semi-integral abutments or stub abutments, the joint design shall be checked to ensure the available movement of the standard joint is not exceeded. In general, the approach slab is assumed to be stationary and the joint gap is designed to vary with the bridge movement. Approach Slab Sheets 10-A1-3 and Standard Plan A-40.50 detail a typical 2½″ compression seal. For approach slabs with barrier, the compression seal shall extend into the barrier. Approach slab anchors installed at bridge abutments shall be as shown in the Bridge Plans. For bridges with semi-integral type abutments, this can be accomplished by showing the approach slab anchors in the End Diaphragm or Pavement Seat details. 
L Type Abutments – L type abutments do not require expansion joints or approach anchors because the abutment and bridge approach slab are both considered stationary. A pinned connection is preferred. The L type abutment anchor detail, as shown sign in Figure 10.6.5-1, shall be added to the abutment plan sheets. The pinned anchor for bridges with L type abutments shall be a #5 bar at one foot spacing, bent as shown, with 1′-0″ embedment into both the pier and the bridge approach slab. This bar shall be included in the bar list for the bridge substructure.

Bridge Approach Slab Addition or Retrofit to Existing Bridges When bridge approach slabs are to be added or replaced on existing bridges, modification may be required to the pavement seats. Either the new bridge approach slab will be pinned to the existing pavement seat, or attached with approach anchors with a widened pavement seat. Pinning is a beneficial option when applicable as it reduces the construction cost and time. The pinning option is only allowed on semi-integral abutments as a bridge approach slab addition or retrofit to an existing bridge. Figure 10.6.6-1 shows the pinning detail. As this detail eliminates the expansion joint between the bridge approach slab and the bridge, the maximum bridge superstructure length is limited to 150′. The WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer may modify this requirement on a case by case basis. Additionally, if the roadway end of the bridge approach slab is adjacent to PCCP roadway, then the detail shown in Figure 10.6.6-2 applies. PCCP does not allow for as much movement as HMA and a joint is required to reduce the possibility of buckling.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 10-37
Chapter 10
Signs, Barriers, Approach Slabs, and Utilities
When pinning is not applicable, then the bridge approach slab shall be attached to the bridge with approach anchors. If the existing pavement seat is less than 10 inches, the seat shall be modified to provide at least 10 inches of seat width. The WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer may modify this requirement on a site-specific basis. Generic pavement seat repair details are shown in Appendix 10.6-A2-1 for a concrete repair and Appendix 10.6-A2-2 for a steel T-section repair. These sheets can be customized for the project and added to the Bridge Plans. When a bridge approach slab is added to an existing bridge, the final grade of the bridge approach slab concrete shall match the existing grade of the concrete bridge deck, including bridges with asphalt pavement. The existing depth of asphalt on the bridge shall be shown in the Plans and an equal depth of asphalt placed on a new bridge approach slab. If the existing depth of asphalt is increased or decreased, the final grade shall also be shown on the Plans. Figure 10.6.6-1

Bridge Approach Slab Staging Staging plans will most likely be required when adding or retrofitting approach slabs on existing bridges. The staging plans shall be a part of the bridge plans and shall be on their own sheet. Coordination with the Region is required to ensure agreement between the bridge staging sheet and the Region traffic control sheet. The longitudinal construction joints required for staging shall be located on lane lines. As there may not be enough room to allow for a lap splice in the bottom transverse bars, a mechanical splice option shall be added. If a lap splice is not feasible, then only the mechanical splice option shall be given. See Figure 10.6.6-3. Figure 10.6.6-3 Alternate Longitudinal Joint Detail   

Traffic Barrier on Bridge Approach Slabs Placing the traffic barrier on the bridge approach slab is beneficial for the following reasons.
• The bridge approach slab resists traffic impact loads and may reduce wing wall thickness
• Simplified construction and conduit placement
• Bridge runoff is diverted away from the abutment Most bridges will have some long-term differential settlement between the approach roadway and the abutment. Therefore, a gap between the bridge approach slab and wing (or wall) shall be shown in the details. The minimum gap is twice the long-term settlement, or 2 inches as shown in Figure 10.7-1. A 3 inch gap is also acceptable. When the traffic barrier is placed on the bridge approach slab, the following barrier guidelines apply.
• Barrier shall extend to the end of the bridge approach slab
• Conduit deflection or expansion fittings shall be called out at the joints
• Junction box locations shall start and end in the approach
• The top transverse reinforcing in the slab shall be sufficient to resist a traffic barrier impact load. A 6′-0″ (hooked) #6 epoxy coated bar shall be added to the approach slab as shown in Figure 10.7-1. Figure 10.7-1 

Bridge Approach Slab over SE Walls The tops of structure earth (SE) walls are uneven and shall be covered with a fascia to provide a smooth soffit line. Usually SE walls extend well beyond the end of the approach slab and require a moment slab. Since SEW barrier is typically 5′-0″ deep from the top of the barrier, the soffit of the SEW barrier and bridge barrier do not match. The transition point for the soffit line shall be at the bridge expansion joint as shown in Figure 10.7.2-2. This requires an extended back side of the barrier at the approach slab to cover the uneven top of the SE wall. Battered wall systems, such as block walls, use a thickened section of the curtain wall to hide some of the batter. The State Bridge and Structures Architect will provide dimensions for this transition when required. Figure 10.7.2-1

Utilities Installation on New and Existing Structures
10.8.1
General Concepts
Chapter 10
The utilities included under this section are those described in Standard Specifications Section 6-01.10. The Bridge designer shall determine if the utility may be attached to the structure and the location. Bridge plans shall include all hardware specifications and details for the utility attachment as provided in any written correspondence with the utility and the utility agreement coordinated by the WSDOT Region Utility Engineer with the associated utility. 10.8.1.A
Responsibilities of the Utility Company
The Region or utility company will initiate utility installations and provide design information. The utility company shall be responsible for calculating design stresses in the utility and design of the support system. Utility support design calculations with a State of Washington Professional Engineer stamp, signed and dated, shall be submitted to the Bridge and Structures Office for review. The following information shall be provided by the utility company and shown in the final Bridge Plans.
• Location of the utility outside the limits of the bridge structure
• Number of utilities, type, size, and weight (or Class) of utility lines
• Utility minimum bending radius for the conduit or pipeline specified Utility General Notes and Design Criteria are stated in Form 224-047. See Figure 10.8.1-1. This form outlines most of the general information required by the utility company to design their attachments. The Bridge Office will generally provide the design for lightweight hanger systems, such as electrical conduits, attached to new structures. 10.8.1.B
Confined Spaces
A confined space is any place having a limited means of exit that is subject to the accumulation of toxic or flammable contaminants or an oxygen deficient environment. Confined spaces include but are not limited to pontoons, box girder bridges, storage tanks, ventilation or exhaust ducts, utility vaults, tunnels, pipelines, and open-topped spaces more than 4 feet in depth such as pits, tubes, vaults, and vessels. 10.8.1.C
Coating and Corrosion Protection
When the bridge is to receive pigmented sealer, consideration shall be given to painting any exposed utility lines and hangers to match the bridge. When a pigmented sealer is not required, steel utility conduits and hangers shall be painted or galvanized for corrosion protection. The special provisions shall specify cleaning and painting procedures.

General Notes
General Notes and Design Criteria for Utility Installations to Existing Bridges
All materials and workmanship shall be in accordance with the requirements of the state of Washington, Department of Transportation, Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction, current edition. The utility conduits shall be labeled in accordance with Section 6-01.10. All steel in utility supports, including fastenings and anchorages, shall be galvanized in accordance with AASHTO M-111 or M-232 (ASTM A-123 or A-153 respectively). All utilities and utility support surfaces, including any galvanized utilities, shall be painted in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 6-07. The final coat shall match the bridge color. Galvanized metal or aluminum utilities completely hidden from public view may be exempted from the above painting requirements. Any painted surfaces damaged during construction shall be cleaned and painted as noted above. Any paint splatters shall be removed from the bridge. Appearance of the utility installation shall be given serious consideration in all cases. Where possible, the utility installation shall be hidden from public view. The notes and criteria explained here are presented as a guide only. Each proposed utility installation shall be submitted to the Department of Transportation for approval on an individual basis. Compliance with these criteria does not assure approval, nor does variance from these criteria, for reasonable cause, necessarily exclude approval.
Design Criteria 1.
Pipelines carrying volatile fluids through a bridge superstructure shall be designed by the utility company in accordance with WAC 480-93, Gas Companies - Safety, and Minimum Federal Safety Standard, Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section part 192. WAC 468-34-210, Pipelines - Encasement, describes when casing is required for carrying volatile fluids across structures. Generally, casing is not required for pipelines conveying natural gas per the requirements of WAC 468-34-210. If casing is required, then WAC 468-34-210 and WAC 480-93-115 shall be followed.
2.
Utilities shall not be attached above the bridge deck nor attached to railing or rail posts.
3.
Utilities shall not extend below bottom of superstructure.
4.
The utilities shall be provided with suitable expansion devices near bridge expansion joints and/or other locations as required to prevent temperature and other longitudinal forces from being transferred to bridge members.
5.
Rigid conduit shall extend 10 feet (3 meters) minimum, beyond the end of the bridge abutment.
6.
Utility supports shall be designed such that neither the conduit, the supports, nor the bridge members are overstressed by any loads imposed by the utility installation.
7.
Utility locations and supports shall be designed so that a failure (rupture, etc.) will not result in damage to the bridge, the surrounding area, or be a hazard to traffic.
8.
Conduit shall be rigid. (Items 1 through 8 may be cross-referenced with Bridge Design Manual, Utilities Section.)
9.
Lag screws may be used for attaching brackets to wooden structures. All bolt holes shall meet the requirements of Sections 6-04.3(4) and 6-04.3(5) of the Washington State Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction, current edition.

Signs, Barriers, Approach Slabs, and Utilities
Utility Design Criteria All utilities shall be designed to resist Strength and Extreme Event Limits States. This includes and is not limited to dead load, expansion, surge, and earthquake forces. Designers shall review WSDOT Form 224-047 “General Notes and Design Criteria for Utility Installations to Existing Bridges” and the items in this section when designing a utility system or providing a review for an existing bridge attachment. See Figure 10.8.1-1 and Section 10.9 Utility Review Procedure for Installation on Existing Bridges. The Bridge Engineer shall review the utility design to ensure the utility support system will carry all transverse and vertical loading. Loading will include (and is not limited to): dead load, temperature expansion, dynamic action (water hammer), and seismic inertial load. Positive resistance to loads shall be provided in all directions perpendicular to and along the length of the utility as required by the utility engineer. Where possible, dynamic fluid action loads shall be resisted off the bridge. If these loads must be resisted on the bridge, the utility engineer shall be involved in the design of these supports. The utility engineer shall determine these design forces being applied to the bridge. Realize these forces can be generated in any pipe supporting moving fluids, which may include, but are not limited to: water, sewer, storm water, and fire suppression systems. Where utilities are insulated, the insulation system shall be designed to allow the intended motion range of the hardware supporting the utility. This will prevent unanticipated stresses from being added to the hanger in the event the insulation binds up the hardware. 10.8.2.A
Utility Location
Utilities shall be located, such that a support failure will not result in damage to the bridge, the surrounding area, or be a hazard to traffic. In most cases, the utility shall be installed between girders. Utilities and supports shall not extend below the bottom of the superstructure. Utilities shall be installed no lower than 1 foot 0 inches above the bottom of the girders. In some cases when appurtenances are required (such as air release valves), care shall be taken to provide adequate space. The utility installation shall be located so as to minimize the effect on the appearance of the structure. Utilities shall not be attached above the bridge deck nor attached to the railings or posts. 10.8.2.B
Termination at the Bridge Ends
Utility conduit and encasements shall extend 10 feet minimum beyond the ends of the structure in order to reduce effects of embankment settlement on the utility and provide protection in case of future work involving excavation near the structure. This requirement shall be shown on the plans. Utilities off the bridge must be installed prior to paving of approaches. This should be stated in the Special Provisions.

Chapter 10
Utility Expansion
The utilities shall be designed with a suitable expansion system as required to prevent longitudinal forces from being transferred to bridge members. Water mains generally remain a constant temperature and are anchored in the ground at the abutments. However, the bridge will move with temperature changes and seismic forces. Pipe support systems shall be designed to allow for the bridge movements. For short bridges, this generally means the bridge will move and the utility will not since it is anchored at the abutments. For long bridges that require pipe expansion joints, design shall carefully locate pipe expansion joints and the corresponding longitudinal loadcarrying support. Electrical conduits that use PVC shall have an expansion device for every 100 foot of pipe due to the higher coefficient of expansion. If more than two joints are specified, a cable or expansion limiting device is required to keep the ends from separating. 10.8.2.D
Utility Blockouts
Blockouts shall be provided in all structural members that prohibit the passage of utilities, such as girder end diaphragms, pier crossbeams, and intermediate diaphragms. These blockouts shall be large enough to fit deflection fittings, and shall be parallel to the utility. For multiple utilities, a note shall be added to the plans that the deflection fittings shall be staggered such that no fitting is located adjacent to another, or the blockouts shall be designed to fit both fittings. Expansion fittings shall be staggered. 10.8.2.E
Gas Lines or Volatile Fluids
Pipelines carrying volatile fluids through a bridge superstructure shall be designed by the utility company in accordance with WAC 480-93, Gas Companies—Safety, and Minimum Federal Safety Standard, Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section part 192. WAC 468-34-210, Pipelines—Encasement, describes when casing is required for carrying volatile fluids across structures. Generally, casing is not required for pipelines conveying natural gas per the requirements of WAC 468-34-210. If casing is required, then WAC 468-34-210 and WAC 480-93-115 shall be followed. 10.8.2.F
Water Lines
Transverse support or bracing shall be provided for all water lines to carry Strength and Extreme Event Lateral Loading. Fire control piping is a special case where unusual care must be taken to handle the inertial loads and associated deflections. The Utility Engineer shall be involved in the design of supports resisting dynamic action loads and deflections. In box girders (closed cell), a rupture of a water line will generally flood a cell before emergency response can shut down the water main. This shall be designed for as an Extreme Event II load case, where the weight of water is a dead load (DC). Additional weep holes or open grating shall be considered to offset this Extreme Event (see Figure 10.8.3-1). Full length casing extending 10-feet beyond the end of the bridge approach slab shall be considered as an alternate to additional weep holes or open grating.

Sewer Lines
Sewer lines shall meet the same design criteria as waterlines. Encasement pipe is required for sewer lines on bridges that cross over water or roads. See the utility agreement or the Hydraulic Section for types of sewer pipe material typically used. 10.8.2.H
Electrical (Power and Communications)
Telephone, television cable, and power conduit shall be galvanized Rigid Metal Conduit (RGS) or Rigid Polyvinyl Chloride Conduit (PVC). Where such conduit is buried in concrete curbs or barriers or has continuous support, such support is considered to be adequate. Where hangers or brackets support conduit at intervals, the maximum distance between supports shall be 5 feet.
10.8.3
Box/Tub Girder Bridges Utilities shall not be placed inside reinforced concrete box girders with less than 4 feet inside clear height and all precast prestressed concrete tub girders because reasonable access cannot be provided. Utilities shall be located between girders or under bridge deck soffit in these cases. Inspection lighting, access and ventilation shall always be provided in girder cells containing utilities. Refer to the concrete and steel chapters for additional details. Special utilities (such as water or gas mains) in box girder bridges shall use concrete pedestals. This allows the utility to be placed, inspected, and tested before the deck is cast. See Figure 10.8.3-1. Concrete pedestals consist of concrete supports formed at suitable intervals and provided with some type of clamping device. Continuous supports shall be avoided due to the very high cost and additional dead load to the structure.

Traffic Barrier Conduit All new bridge construction shall install two 2-inch galvanized Rigid Metal Conduit (RGS) or Rigid Polyvinyl Chloride Conduit (PVC) in the traffic barriers. These conduits generally carry wiring for Traffic Signals (TS) and Lighting (LT). Other wiring may be installed or the conduit may be used for future applications. PVC conduit may be used only in stationaryform barriers, and will connect to RGS using a PVC adaptor when exiting the barrier. RGS conduit may be used in stationary-form barriers, but it shall be used in slipform barriers. Each conduit shall be stubbed-out into its own concrete junction box at each corner of the bridge. The Bridge Plans must show the placement of the conduits to clear the structure or any foreseeable obstructions. The galvanized steel conduit shall be wrapped with corrosion resistant tape at least one foot inside and outside of the concrete structure, and this requirement shall be so stated on the plans. The corrosion resistant tape shall be 3M Scotch 50, Bishop 5, Nashua AVI 10, or approved equal. The usual location of the conduit throughout the remainder of the bridge should be in the traffic barrier. Pull boxes shall be provided within the barrier for each conduit at each end of the bridge and at a maximum spacing of 180 feet. For fiber optics only, spacing shall not exceed 360 feet. The pull box size shall conform to the specifications of the National Electric Code or be a minimum of 8 inches by 8 inches by 18 inches to facilitate pulling of wires. Galvanized steel pull boxes (or junctions boxes) shall meet the specifications of the “NEMA Type 4X” standard for stationary-form barrier, shall meet the specifications of the “NEMA 3R” and be adjustable in depth for slip form barrier, and the NEMA junction box type shall be stated on the plans. Stainless steel pull boxes may be used as an option to the galvanized steel. In the case of existing bridges, an area 2 feet in width shall be reserved for conduit beginning at a point either 4 feet or 6 feet outside the face of usable shoulder. The fastening for and location of attaching the conduit to the existing bridge shall be worked out on a job-by-job basis.
10.8.5
Conduit Types All electrical conduits shall be galvanized Rigid Metal Conduit (RGS) or Rigid Polyvinyl Chloride Conduit (PVC). Steel Pipe – All pipe and fittings shall be galvanized except for special uses. PVC Pipe – PVC pipe may be used with suitable considerations for deflection, placement of expansion fittings, and of freezing water within the conduits. PVC pipe shall not be placed in concrete traffic barriers when the slip form method is used due to damage and pipe separation that often occurs during concrete placement.
10.8.6
Utility Supports The following types of supports are generally used for various utilities. Selection of a particular support type shall be based on the needs of the installation and the best economy. All utility installations shall address temperature expansion in the design of the system or expansion devices. Designs shall provide longitudinal and transverse support for loads from gravity, earthquakes, temperature, inertia, etc. It is especially important to provide transverse and longitudinal support for inserts that cannot resist moment.

Chapter 10
Signs, Barriers, Approach Slabs, and Utilities
Vertical supports shall be spaced at 5 foot maximum intervals for telephone and power conduits, and at a spacing to resist design loads for all other utilities. For Schedule 40 steel conduit, 4” or greater, support spacing may be increased to 8 feet maximum if the design loads permit. Drilling into prestressed concrete members for utility attachment shall not be allowed. 10.8.6.A
Concrete Embedment
This is the best structural support condition and offers maximum protection to the utility. Its cost may be high for larger conduit and the conduit cannot be replaced. 10.8.6.B
Pipe Hangers
Utility lines shall be suspended by means of cast-in-place inserts, whenever possible. This is the most common type of support for utilities to be supported under the bridge deck. This allows the use of standard cast-in-place inserts and is very flexible in terms of expansion requirements. For heavy pipes over traffic (10″ water main or larger), a Safety Factor of 1.5 should be used to resist vertical loads for Strength Design. This is to avoid complete failure of the utility hanger system by failure of one hanger. Vertical inserts will not provide resistance to longitudinal forces. Longitudinal and transverse supports shall be provided for ITS conduits. When ¾″ or ⅞″ diameter hanger rods are suspended from cast-in-place inserts, at least three of the following inserts shall be identified: Cooper B-Line B22-I Series, Unistrut 3200 Series, Powerstrut 349 Series, Halfen HT5506 or similar. The specific cast-in-place insert within each series shall be identified based on the required length of insert. The cast-in-place insert shall be at least 6″ long and hot dipped galvanized in accordance with AASHTO M 111 or ASTM F2329. The insert shall not interfere with reinforcement in the bridge deck. The inserts shall be installed level longitudinally and transversely. When the superelevation of the roadway is not significant, a single, long insert may be used to support multiple hanger rods. When the superelevation becomes significant, a single insert may be used for each hanger. Occasionally large diameter utilities require pipe rolls that only fit on 1″ diameter hanger rods. When 1″ diameter hanger rods are required, the Anvil Fig. 286 and Unistrut P3246 insert shall be used. The designer shall only specify this insert when absolutely necessary. The Bridge Engineer shall verify that the cast-in-place insert has sufficient capacity to support the loads from the hanger rod. Transverse supports may be provided by a second hanger extending from a girder or by a brace against the girder. Bridge Standard Drawings 10.8-A1-1 and 10.8-A1-2 depict typical utility support installations and placement at abutments and diaphragms. Transverse supports shall, at a minimum, be located at every other vertical support. 10.8.6.C
Surface Mounting
Utilities to be installed on existing structures that cannot be located between girders may be mounted under the deck soffit. Utilities shall not be attached above the bridge deck nor attached to the railings or posts. Adhesive anchor shall be used and design in accordance with Section 10.10. Bridge Standard Drawing 10.8-A1-3 shows typical mounting locations for concrete beam of box girder bridges. Anchors shall be located 3” minimum from the edge of deck or other concrete surfaces.

Review Procedure for Utility Installations on Existing Structures Utility companies typically submit proposed attachments to WSDOT’s structures to the Region’s Utility offices, which in turn forward to the Bridge Preservation Office (BPO) for review. BPO is responsible for reviewing only those details pertaining to the bridge crossing such as attachment details or trenching details adjacent to bridge piers or abutments. The Bridge Preservation Office reviews proposed utility attachments and either approves the attachment or returns for correction (RFC). A current file for most utility attachments is maintained in the Bridge Preservation Office. The turnaround time for reviewing the proposals should not exceed four weeks. Utility attachments, which exert moments or large forces at the supports, shall be accompanied by at least one set of calculations from the utility company. Bridge attachments designed to resist surge forces shall always be accompanied by calculations. The connection details shall be designed to successfully transfer all forces to the bridge without causing overstress in the connections or to the bridge members to which they are attached. For large utilities, the bridge itself shall have adequate capacity to carry the utility without affecting the live load capacity. The engineer may request calculations from the utility company for any attachment detail that may be questionable. All plans, details, and calculations shall be stamped, signed, and dated by a Professional Engineer licensed in the State of Washington. Additionally, for heavier utilities, such as waterlines or sewer lines, the engineer may request a load rating of the structure, which shall be stamped, signed, and dated by a licensed professional engineer in the state of Washington to follow the guidelines of Chapter 13. The ratings shall be based solely on the engineer of record calculations. Guidelines for Utility Companies Detailing guidelines for utility companies to follow when designing utility attachments are listed in WSDOT Form 224-047, “General Notes and Design Criteria for Utility Installations to Existing Bridges.” See Figure 10.8.1-1. See Section 10.8 for other requirements, which include, but are not limited to: design of utility, material used, and spacing of supports. Water lines and sewer lines installed within box girders shall have full length casing extending 10-feet beyond the end of the bridge approach slab. The casing shall be sufficient to prevent the flooding of a cell upon a utility line rupture. Guidelines for Column Attachments The following guidelines shall be followed for installing attachments to columns.
• Attachments on round columns may be either drilled and bolted or banded.
• Attachments on non-circular column shapes shall be drilled and bolted.
• Only percussion drilling methods shall be allowed on bridge columns, and only for small diameter resin bonded anchor installation (0.50″ diameter max.). Drilling will normally result in blind holes, and these holes shall be patched with material conforming to Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(20).
• Drilling into prestressed or post-tensioned concrete elements is not permitted. Some WSDOT bridges utilize prestressed columns.

Anchors for Permanent Attachments Cast-in-place concrete anchors are the preferred option for new construction in bridge applications. The design procedure for cast-in-place and post-installed anchors shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD 5.13. Adhesive and undercut anchors shall meet the assessment criteria in accordance with ACI 355.4 and ACI 355.2, respectively. WSDOT allows conventional adhesive anchors systems (resin bonded anchors) and post installed undercut anchors for permanent attachments in many aspects of bridge design, including the permanent cyclical or sustained tension applications listed below.
• Bridge mounted sign brackets with a maximum cantilever length or total span of 10 feet.
• Light standards with a maximum cantilever length of 16 feet.
• Sign structures with a supporting, round or rectangular, post or beam with a maximum dimension of 8 inches.
• Retrofitted corbels for bridge approach slabs.
• Supporting utilities under bridges, including water pipes, electrical conduit and other utility piping systems. Adhesive anchors shall not be used in monotube sign structure, sign structure truss, and mast arm type signal standard applications. Fast set resin bonding materials shall not be used for adhesive anchors. For carbon steel undercut anchors, hot-dip galvanized components are preferred, but not currently available from suppliers. Undercut anchors with electroplated zinc coatings are not considered equivalent or better and shall not be used. Therefore, stainless steel undercut anchors are the preferred option. Expansion anchors and mechanical anchors are not allowed for any permanent applications, except for specific connection details previously approved by the Bridge and Structures Office for precast concrete panel faced structural earth walls as low risk applications.

Drainage Design Even though it is rare that poor drainage is directly responsible for a structural failure, it still must be a primary consideration in the design. Poor drainage can cause problems such as ponding on the roadway, erosion of abutments, and deterioration of structural members. Collecting the runoff and transporting it away from the bridge can prevent most of the problems. Proper geometrics during the preliminary stage is essential in order to accomplish this. The Hydraulics Branch recommends placing the bridge deck drainage off of the structure. Therefore, the Bridge Design Section has adopted the policy that all expansion joints shall be watertight.
10.11.1
Geometrics Bridges shall have sufficient transverse and longitudinal slopes to allow the water to run quickly to the drains. A transverse slope of .02′/ft and longitudinal slope of 0.5 percent for minimum valves are required. Avoid placing sag vertical curves and superelevation crossovers on the structure that could result in hydroplaning conditions or, in cold climates, sheets of ice from melting snow. The use of unsymmetrical vertical curves may assist the designer in shifting the low point off the structure.
10.11.2
Hydrology Hydrological calculations are made using the rational equation. A 10-year storm event with a 5-minute duration is the intensity used for all inlets except for sag vertical curves where a 50-year storm intensity is required.
10.11.3
On Bridge Systems Drains shall only be placed on bridge structures when required. If required, the first preference is to place 5-inch diameter pipe drains that have no bars and drop straight to the ground. At other times, such as for steel structures, the straight drop drain is unacceptable and a piping system with bridge drains is required. The minimum pipe diameter shall be 6 inches with no sharp bends within the system. The Hydraulics Branch shall be contacted to determine the type of drain required (preferably Neenah).
10.11.4
Construction Bridge decks have a striated finish in accordance with the Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(10)D5, however, the gutters have an untextured finish (steel trowel) for a distance of 2 feet from the curb. This untextured area provides for smooth gutter flow and a Manning n value of .015 in the design.

Bridge Security
10.12.1
General
Chapter 10
Security based bridge design and its direct correlation to modern social issues is addressed in this section. Criminal activity, illegal encampments, graffiti, hindrance to economic development and public eyesore create unwanted expensive. They also pose public health concerns and safety hazards for State Maintenance and Operations practices. The issue exists in urban areas as well as rural and recreational locales. Bridges are dominant structures in landscapes. They are held to a higher standard of design due to their influence on communities, where economic and social settings are affected by their quality. Initial project cost savings may quickly be overshadowed by increased externalized costs. These externalized costs are born by local municipalities and businesses as well as other departments within WSDOT. WSDOT bridge inspectors are required to inspect all bridges at least once every 24 months. The presence of the illegal encampments, as well as garbage, hypodermic needles, and feces often makes it impossible to do a close, hands-on inspection of the abutments and bearings of bridges. The Bridge Preservation Office has requested that maintenance clean up transient camps when it becomes difficult or impossible to do an adequate inspection of the bridges. Campfires set by the homeless have also caused damage to bridges. Bridge Maintenance Crews also face the same difficulty when they need to do repair work on bridges in the urban area. Clean up requires (per law) posting the bridge seventy-two hours prior to any work. Material picked up is tagged, bagged, and stored for retrieval. Often the offenders are back the next day.
10.12.2
Design Design is determined on a case by case basis using two strategies. These strategies are universally accepted best practices. The first, Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED), is a multi-disciplinary approach to deterring criminal behavior. The second, Context Sensitive Design (CSS), is also multi-disciplinary and focuses on project development methods. Multi-disciplinary teams consist of engineers and architects but may include law enforcement, local businesses, social service providers, and psychologists. 1.
CPTED principals are based upon the theory that the proper design and effective use of the built environment can reduce crime, reduce the fear of crime, and improve the quality of life. Built environment implementations of CPTED seek to dissuade offenders from committing crimes by manipulating the built environment in which those crimes proceed from or occur. The six main concepts are territoriality, surveillance, access control, image/maintenance, activity support and target hardening. Applying all of these strategies is key when preventing crime in any neighborhood or right-of-way. Natural surveillance and access control strategies limit the opportunity for crime. Territorial reinforcement promotes social control through a variety of measures. These may include enhanced aesthetics or public art. Image/maintenance and activity support provide the community with reassurance and the ability to stop crime by themselves. Target hardening strategies may involve fencing or concrete enclosures

or they may include all techniques to resolve crime or chronic trespass into one final step. 2.
10.12.3
WSDOT implements FHWA’s CSS design development principles through Executive Order E 1028. The CSS methods require designers to consider the physical, economic, and social setting of a project. Stakeholder’s interests are to be accounted for; including area residents and business owners.
Design Criteria New bridges need to address design for the environment by basic criteria:
• Slopes under bridges need to be steep; around a 1:1 slope, and hardened with something like solid concrete so that flat areas cannot be carved into the hillside. Flat areas under bridge superstructures attract inappropriate uses and should be omitted.
• Illegal urban campers have been known to build shelters between the concrete girders. Abutment walls need to be high enough that they deny access to the superstructure elements. When it is not feasible to design for deterrence the sites need to be hardened with fencing buried several feet into the soil or with solid concrete walls. See Figures 14.2.3a and 14.2.3b for high security fence and concrete wall examples.
• Regular chain link is easy cut, therefore stouter material needs to be specified.
• Landscape design should coordinate with region or headquarters landscape architects. Areas need to be visible to law enforcement. ‘High security’ proprietary fence designs may be employed, or unique case-by-case custom designs may be required. Where required, coordinate with the State Bridge and Structures Architect.

General
Chapter 10
Temporary bridges are defined as bridges that are in service for 5 years or less. Any bridge that is expected to be in service for more than five years shall be designed using the requirements for permanent structures. These requirements apply to all temporary bridges regardless of the delivery contracting methods. The approaches to the temporary bridge, including but not limited to, slopes, reinforced slopes, and retaining walls, shall be designed in accordance with the WSDOT Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03.

10.13.2.A One To Two Construction Season Temporary Bridges Temporary bridges that will be used for one to two construction seasons shall be designed in accordance with the GSP in the Contract special provisions and shall be designed by the Contractor. Bridges of this type shall be shown on the Bridge Preliminary Plan and shall include the minimum required length and minimum roadway width including shoulders. Temporary bridges on 30,000 or greater ADT routes may be required to be designed as a long term, three to five season temporary bridge, as stated below. 10.13.2.B Three To Five Construction Season Temporary Bridges Temporary bridges of this category shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of the current editions of: AASHTO LRFD and interims AASHTO SEISMIC WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50, including all design memorandums WSDOT Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03 10.13.2.B.1 Design Requirements The design of the temporary bridge shall not include an additional future overlay of 25 pound per square foot. Except for project specific conditions for lack of a practical freight route detour, the live loading of the temporary bridge may be reduced to 75-percent of the HL-93 loading, consistent with the Temporary Bridge General Special Provision. If it is determined during design that there is no practical detour route available for freight traffic impacted by this 75-percent HL-93 live load restriction, then the temporary bridge live load shall be specified as 100-percent of the HL-93 loading, and this project specific live load shall be specified in the General Notes in the Plans. Determination of practical detour routes shall be coordinated with the Region Project Engineer.

10.13.2.B.2 Seismic Design Requirements The seismic design of temporary bridges shall be in accordance with the requirements of the current edition of AASHTO SEISMIC, except the design response spectra shall be reduced by a factor not greater than 2.5. The minimum support length provisions shall apply to all temporary bridges. The Seismic Design Category (SDC) of the temporary bridge shall be obtained on the basis of the reduced/modified response spectrum except that a temporary bridge classified in SDC B, C, or D based on the unreduced spectrum cannot be reclassified to SDC A based on the reduced/modified spectrum. 10.13.2.B.3 Deck Design Requirements Traffic barriers for temporary bridges shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of the current edition of AASHTO LRFD, but not less than TL-3 collision load requirements. The TL demand may be adjusted on a case-by-case basis for vehicle size and speed per AASHTO LRFD Tables 13.7.2-1 and 2. The fall restraint specifications of WAC 296-155-24615 Section 2a requiring minimum vertical height of thirty-nine inches for traffic barriers shall be considered for temporary bridges. Concrete bridge deck thickness may be reduced to 7 inches for concrete superstructure, and to 7½ inches for steel superstructures. Epoxy coating requirement for bridge deck reinforcement may be waived for temporary bridges with 2 inch min cover for the top mat of reinforcement. The driving surface of the temporary bridge shall be durable, skid resistant deck, with an initial skid number of at least 35 and maintaining a skid number of 26 minimum, in accordance with AASHTO T 242. The Contractor shall maintain the temporary bridge, including the driving surface, for the life of the temporary bridge in the project. 10.13.2.B.4 Superstructure Design Requirements A 3 inch minimum HMA overlay could be used for temporary bridges made of adjacent precast concrete members. Steel temporary bridges need not be painted. Fatigue need not be checked for temporary bridges with steel superstructure. All welding, repair welding, and welding inspection, of steel components of the temporary bridge shall conform to the Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(25) and 6-03.3(25)A requirements specified for steel bridges. Allowable tensile stress for precast-prestressed concrete girders under service limit state load combinations per AASHTO LRFD Article 5.9.4.2.2 may be used in lieu of those specified in Section 5.2.1C. 10.13.2.B.5 Foundation Design Requirements Pile types such as precast, prestressed concrete piles, steel H piles, timber piles, micropiles and steel pipe piles may be used for temporary bridges. Soldier pile wall with treated timber lagging may be used for temporary bridges.

Chapter 10
NBI Requirements Temporary or re-commissioned bridges used as a detour and in-service longer the 90 days shall receive full National Bridge Inspection Standards (all SI&A data; ex., NBIS inspection, load ratings and scour evaluation). All SI&A data shall be submitted to the Washington State NBI data base within 90 days of opening to vehicle traffic. An “open” bridge is defined as a bridge that is near substantial completion with general highway traffic accessing/operating on the bridge in a configuration that is the final planned configuration. Phased construction stages, if carrying traffic for 90 days or longer shall fall into these criteria. Bridges open less than 90 days will need regular “safety” type inspections to ensure the safe operation of traffic on the bridge. Contracts are to clearly identify the owner and who is responsible for all of this NBIS criteria. Load ratings for legal trucks and special hauling vehicles are required for temporary and bridges constructed in phased stages. The minimum rating factor shall not be less than 1.0.
10.13.4
Submittal Requirements The Contractor shall submit drawings and copies of supporting design calculations of the temporary bridge to the Engineer for approval in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 6-01.9. The submittal shall include an erection plan and procedure in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(7)A. Submittals for temporary bridges with total length of more than 200 ft shall be stamped and signed by a Washington State registered Structural Engineer (SE) in accordance with the requirements of WAC 196-23. The Contractor shall construct the temporary bridge in accordance with the working drawings and erection plan as approved by the Engineer, environmental permit conditions specified in Section 1-07.5 as supplemented in the Special Provisions and as shown in the Plans, and in accordance with the details shown in the Plans.

Detailing Practice
Detailing Practice The following is to provide basic information on drafting and the fundamentals of the Bridge and Structures Office drafting practices.
11.1
Standard Office Practices
11.1.1 11.1.1.A
Purpose
• The purpose of these standards is to enable the Bridge and Structures Office to produce consistent and effective plan sheets that will have uniform appearance and information.
• Designers and detailers are responsible for ensuring that these criteria are implemented.
• Limited deviations from the standards listed in this chapter, unless otherwise noted, may be approved by the WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer as a specific situation requires, so long as all possible attempts to maintain the standards are made prior to authorizing a deviation. All deviations must be approved by the WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer.
• Definitions used in this chapter: ҽ Should: Denotes when best practice dictates a standard is to be followed, but may be deviated from or omitted if necessary, as approved by the design engineer. ҽ Shall: Denotes when a standard must be followed with no deviations or omissions allowed. 11.1.1.B
Planning
• The designer and the structural detailer together coordinate the scope of the detailing work involved in each project. Time should be allotted for checking plans for accuracy and consistency with office practices.
• Similar bridge plans and details should be reviewed and kept as examples for maintaining consistent detailing practices. These examples should not be older than three years. 11.1.1.C
Drawing Orientation and Layout Control
• Standard format for a bridge plan sheet is 34 inches × 22 inches with the bottom 2 inches used for title block and related information. The use of a sheet format that is 17 inches x 11 inches with the bottom 1 inch used for title block and related information is permitted so long as the final printed product maintains the same graphical standards as a 34 inch x 22 inch format plotted at half size. For the purposes of this manual, all sizes and dimensions referenced herein are in relation to the 34 inch x 22 inch format.
• Contract plans are printed, sealed, signed and submitted on 11″ × 17″ paper. This is accomplished by either plotting a 34 inch x 22 inch format at half size, or a 17 inch by 11 inch format at full size, depending on the sheet format that is used.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 11-1
Chapter 11
Detailing Practice
• Drawings shall be carefully organized so the intent of the drawing is easily understood. ҽ North arrow shall be placed on layouts and footing/foundation layouts. The North arrow should be placed in the upper right corner of the sheet whenever possible. ҽ Related details shall be grouped together in an orderly arrangement: lined up horizontally and vertically and drawn to the same scale. ҽ Do not detail a bridge element in more than one location. If the element is changed there is a danger that only one of the details is updated. ҽ Do not crowd the drawing with details. ҽ The Plan view layout of structures and retaining walls should be oriented from left to right in the direction of increasing state route mileposts. For layouts of existing bridges undergoing widening, expansion joint or thrie beam retrofit, or other structural modification, this orientation requirement may result in the bridge layout being opposite from what is shown in the original plans. In such cases, the designer and detailer shall review the Bridge Preservation Office inspection records for the bridge, and the bridge layout orientation and pier identification should be laid out to be consistent with the Bridge Preservation Office inspection records. 11.1.1.D
General
11.1.1.D.1
Text and Labeling
• Lettering shall be upper case only, slanted at approximately 68 degrees. General text is to be approximately ⅛″ high.
• Text shall be oriented so as to be read from the bottom or right edge of the sheet.
• A primary Legend shall be placed on the first sheet of the plan set. At a minimum this will include a Section Callout reference, followed by a Detail Callout reference, and finally a Key Note reference. Anything else that is to be added to the legend shall be placed after these 3 items. See Figure 11.1.1-D1. Figure 11.1.1-D1

• Detail titles shall be a similar font as general text, about twice as high and of a heavier weight. Underline all titles with a single line having the same weight as the lettering. Additional detail information or description shall be the standard text style and placed directly under the title. See Figure 11.1.1-D2. Figure 11.1.1-D2
Detail Titles
DETAIL TITLE DETAIL INFORMATION
• Primary Line Labels for alignments, highway or bridge centerline (in plan view), creeks/rivers, and under-crossings shall be aligned with the associated line work and placed above the line. Any Secondary Labels such as survey bearing shall be placed below the line, and should be centered on the primary label. See Figure 11.1.1-D3. Figure 11.1.1-D3
Primary and Secondary Line Labels PRIMARY LABEL TEXT: BR50 ABOVE LINE

Dimensioning
• A dimension shall be shown once on a drawing. Duplication and unnecessary dimensions should be avoided.
• All dimension figures shall be placed above the dimension line, so that they may be read from the bottom or the right edge of the sheet, as shown in Figure 11.1.1-D5. Inclined Dimensions

Chapter 11
Detailing Practice
• When details or structural elements are complex, utilize two drawings, one for dimensions and the other for reinforcing bar details.
• Dimensions 12 inches or more shall be given in feet and inches unless the item dimensioned is conventionally designated in inches (for example, 16″ pipe).
• Dimensions that are less than one inch over an even foot, the fraction shall be preceded by a zero (for example, 3′-0¾″).
• Place dimensions outside the view, preferably to the right or below. However, in the interest of clarity and simplicity it may be necessary to place them otherwise. Examples of dimensioning placement are shown on Appendix 11.1-A1. 11.1.1.D.3
Callouts (See Figure 11.1.1-D6 below)
• Callouts should be specific, brief, and limited to not more than one sentence. The intent is to make the purpose clear, while reducing superfluous information that could both cloud the meaning of the content and clutter the drawing sheet.
• All callout text shall be left justified regardless of the position of the leader.
• When creating a callout, the detailer and the design engineer should attempt to limit the callout to not more than 3 lines of text and ensure the text is formatted in a way that each line is a similar length and forms a rectangular appearance. Additionally, a callout should be limited to not more than about 3 ½” to 4” in width.
• Leaders shall be attached to either the beginning or end of the sentence. This means the top line of text for leaders coming off the left of the callout or the bottom line of text for leaders pointing right. Figure 11.1.1-D6
Callouts
A standard callout shall be le used and should contain no more than 3 lines of text. t should also be relavely rectangular in format with the boom line of text typically being not less than 2/3 the length of the line above. STANDARD CALLOUTS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO NO MORE THAN THREE (3) LINES OF TEXT.

11.1.1.D.4
Key Notes (See Figure 11.1.1-D7 below)
• Key notes are defined as specific notes pertaining to information or conditions within the plan sheet on which they reside. They are not to be confused with general notes, which are non-specific, or general in nature, and typically can be applied globally to the sheet or the whole plan set. Key notes should not be used to cover non-specific, or general information that would be typically specified in a general note.
• Key notes should be used in situations where a callout may become too large (more than 3 lines or more than 1-2 sentences), a callout would clutter the sheet or detail, or in situations where that same callout would need to be shown in multiple locations (3 or more) on the same view or detail.
• Key notes may be used to reference a standard plan, a note on another sheet, or even another sheet within the contract plan set that is separate from the bridge plans (i.e. roadway or illumination plans).
• The same key note may be referenced in multiple views or details so long as they are on the same plan sheet.
• Key notes will be referenced on the sheet as “KEY NOTES": and should be placed on the lower right side of the sheet whenever possible. Key notes should be placed below any general notes on the sheet (if applicable). They should be placed numerically and shall have a flag placed around the number.
• Key note flags shall be used to reference key notes within the drawing area. Each note flag will use the same symbol and corresponding number as found in the key notes.
• Note flags may be used with or without a leader as the situation dictates.
• Note flags shall be an elongated hexagon that is ¼” in height and ½” in length with each corner chamfered at 45° tapering to a single point at each end. The number shall be centered horizontally and vertically within.
• A note flag legend symbol shall be placed as part of the primary legend found typically on the first sheet of a plan set as this is a continuous standard found throughout the set in the same way a section or detail callout is. (see Figure 11.1.1-D1)

Line Work
• All line work must be of sufficient size, weight, and clarity so that it can be easily read from a print that has been reduced to 11″ × 17″ or one-half the size of the original drawing.
• The line style used for a particular structural outline, centerline, etc., shall be kept consistent wherever that line is shown within a set of bridge plans.
• Line work shall have appropriate gradations of width to give line contrast as shown below. Care shall be taken that the thin lines are dense enough to show clearly when reproduced. Figure 11.1.1-E1

• When drawing structural sections showing reinforcing steel, the outline of the sections shall be a heavier line weight than the rebar.
• The order of line precedence (which of a pair of crossing lines is broken) is as follows: A. Dimension lines are never broken. B.

11.1.1.F
Scale
• Scales are not to be shown in the plans.
• When selecting a scale, it should be kept in mind that the drawing will be reduced. Generally, the minimum scale for a section detail with rebar is ⅜″ = 1′. The minimum scale to be used on steel details will be ¾″ = 1′.
• The contract plan sheets are not to be used to take measurements in the field. They will, however, be drawn using scales that can be found on any standard architectural or engineering scale.
• Care should be taken that all structural elements are accurately drawn to scale.
• Sections and views may be enlarged to show more detail, but the number of different scales used should be kept to a minimum.

Graphic Symbols

Graphic symbols shall be in accordance with the following: A. Structural steel shapes: See also AISC Manual of Steel Construction.
11.1.1.H
B.
Welding symbols: See Lincoln Welding Chart.
C.
Symbols for hatching different materials are shown on Appendix 11.2-A2.
Structural Sections, Views and Details
• A section cuts through the structure, a view is from outside the structure, a detail shows a structural element in more detail – usually a larger scale.
• Whenever possible Sections and views should be taken looking to the right, ahead on stationing, or down.
• Care shall be taken to ensure that the orientation of a detail drawing is identical to that of the plan, elevation, etc., from which it is taken. Where there is a skew in the bridge any sections should be taken from plan views.
• The default is to be looking ahead on stationing. The only mention of view orientation is if the view is looking back on stationing.
• Wall elevations are to show the exposed face regardless of direction of stationing. The Layout sheet stationing will read increasing left to right. The elevation sheets will represent the view in the field as the wall is being built. See Figure 11.1.1-H1 below.
• On plan and elevation drawings where there is insufficient space to show cut sections and details, the section and detail drawing should be on the plan sheet immediately following the plan and elevation drawing unless there are a series of related plans. If it is impractical to show details on a section drawing, a detail sheet should immediately follow the section drawing. In other words, the order of plan sheets should be from general plan to more minute detail.
• A circle divided into upper and lower halves shall identify structural sections, views, and details. Examples are shown in Appendix 11.1-A3.
• Breaks in lines are allowable provided that their intent is clear. Figure 11.1.1-H1

Revisions
• All addendums and change orders will be noted in the revision block at the bottom of the sheet using font Sheet12. For the purpose of this section, change orders and addendums will be referred to collectively as revisions unless otherwise necessary.
• Addendums are made after general distribution and project ad but before the contract is awarded. Changes made to the plan sheets during this time shall be shaded or clouded in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual Appendix 5 (note that all table entry revisions shall be shaded). Subsequent addendums are shaded and the shading from previous addendums is removed. Additionally addenda shall be noted in the revision block as “AD#” followed by a dash and the addendum description. For example “AD1 – CHANGE TB F-SHAPE TO SINGLE SLOPE 42 TB” denotes addendum number 1 and describes the main purpose of the revision on the particular sheet. Addenda will be numbered according to the assigned addendum number from the region office and may skip numbers on the bridge plans, as certain addenda may only pertain to other contract documents, such as roadway plans or special provisions. For example, it would not be uncommon to see addenda listed in the revision block numbered in a fashion such as “AD1, AD3, AD7, etc.” See Figure 11.1.1-I Below.
• Change orders are made after the contract has been awarded. Changes will be marked with a revision number inside a circle within a triangle, commonly referred to as a revision triangle. Revision triangles shall appear in a standard numerical sequence (1, 2, 3 etc.) within the revision block. Immediately following the revision triangle should be the official change order number provided by the regional PEO in accordance with the WSDOT Construction Manual Section SS 1-04.4. Directly after the change order number will be a dash separating the number and the description, followed by the revision RFI number and/or the revision description. For example: “ CO9 – AA123 WIDEN BRIDGE FOR NEW LANE”. Note that the plan revision triangle number and the change order won’t always match, as shown in the above example. For additional examples, see Figure 11.1.1-I below.
• The date block of the revision table should contain the date of the revision request, but if not provided by the regional office, may be substituted by the date the revision design work was completed.
• The last two fields in the revision block are the “BY” and “APP’D” (approved by) blocks. The “BY” field should contain the designer's initials whereas the “APP’D” field should contain the approving authority’s initials, which in most cases will be the design team supervisor.
• In the event there are multiple revisions on a given sheet, the previous revision information shall remain in the revision block. Revisions shall appear chronologically in the order received, starting with the oldest revision at the bottom. The revision shall be placed on the next available line above the revisions, however, only the current iteration should be shaded, clouded, or referenced in the drawing area. See Figure 11.1.1-I below.
• Best practice dictates that any time a revision occurs, a new sheet should be generated by copying the desired sheet to be modified and making the revisions on the copied sheet. This ensures the original sheet and associated data exists in an unmodified state that can be referred back to at a later time as necessary.

REVISIONS START AT THE BOTTOM OF THE REVISION BLOCK
11.1.1.J
Title Block
• The project title is displayed in the contract plan sheet title block. The title consists of PLAN REVISIONS Line 1 specifying the highway route number(s), Line 2 and possibly Line 3 specifying the title verbiage. Bridge structures use a fourth line, in a smaller font, to specify the bridge name and number in accordance with the Bridge List M 23-09 and BDM Sections 2.3.1.A and 2.3.2.A.
• The exact wording of Lines 1, 2, and 3 of the project title, including line arrangement, abbreviations, and punctuation, is controlled by the project definition as specified by legislative title and the Capital Program Management System (CPMS) database.
• The highway route number(s) in Line 1 shall be consistent with WSDOT naming practice. Interstate routes (5, 82, 90, 182, 205, 405, and 705) shall be specified as I-(number). US routes (2, 12, 97, 97A, 101, 195, 197, 395, and 730) shall be specified as US (number). All other routes shall be specified as SR (number). Projects including two highway routes shall include both route numbers in Line 1, as in “US 2 And I-5”. Projects including three or more highway routes shall be specified with the lowest numbered route, followed by “Et Al”, as in “SR 14 Et Al”.
• The job number block just to the left of the middle of the title block shall display the PS&E Job Number assigned to the project by the Region Plans Office. The PS&E Job Number consists of six characters. The first two characters correspond to the last two digits of the calendar year. The third character corresponds to the letter designation assigned to the specific Region (NWR - A, NCR - B, OR - C, WSF and selected UCO projects - W, SWR - X, SCR - Y, and ER - Z). The final three characters correspond to the three digit number assigned to the specific project by the Region Plans Office.

11.1.1.K
Reinforcement Detailing
• This section is intended to define how reinforcement is to be detailed and called out on plan sheets. Reinforcement design and specification is to be conducted in accordance with this Section 5.1.2 by the design engineer. Graphical representation and notation shall be done in accordance with this Section 11.1.1-K.
• Contract documents shall convey all necessary information for fabrication of reinforcing steel. In accordance with Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(24), reinforcing steel details shown in the bar list shall be verifiable in the plans and other contract documents.
• Typical reinforcement type and grade is specified in Standard Specifications Section 9-07.2 and need not be provided elsewhere in the contract documents unless it differs. Typical reinforcement is defined as the predominant type and grade of reinforcement used throughout the contract plan set.
• Any reinforcement that differs from the typical reinforcement shall include the type and grade as part of the callout within the contract plan set.
• Size, spacing, orientation and location of reinforcement shall be shown on the plan sheets.
• Reinforcement shall be identified by mark numbers inside a rectangle. Reinforcing bar marks shall be called out at least twice. The reinforcement including the spacing is called out in one view (such as a plan or elevation). The reinforcement without the spacing is called out again in at least one other view taken from a different angle (such as a section). See Appendix 11.1-A4 for reinforcement callout examples.
• Coating or treatment for reinforcement shall be shown in the plans by noting the letter designator inside of an inverted triangle. The coating designator shall be placed within a callout or dimension directly after the mark number. See Figure 11.1.1-K1 below.
• Material for reinforcement, when required, shall be shown using the corresponding two (2) letter designator inside of an ellipse measuring ½” wide by ¼” in height. The material designator shall be placed within a callout or dimension directly preceding the bar size. See Figure 11.1.1-K1 below.
• Bar size is to be shown on all reinforcement callouts and shall be shown using a pound (#) preceding the numeric size designator (i.e. #4). Bar size shall be placed within a callout or dimension after any coating and material designator, but prior to grade designator.
• Grade for reinforcement, when required, shall be shown using “GR.” And the numeric grade designator (i.e. GR. 80). The grade designator shall be placed within a callout or dimension directly after the bar size designator. See Figure 11.1.1-K1 below.
• Reinforcement component type (stirrup, tie, etc.) shall be placed within a callout or dimension at the end of the callout after all other reinforcement designators. Component type is NOT required on reinforcement bars that are considered primary bars, regardless of hook or straight ends. Primary reinforcement bars are those whose purpose is to provide the main shape and reinforcement for the associated structure and are typically straight bars but may also have a hook at one or both ends. These are typically laid out in either the longitudinal or transverse orientation relating to the structure and aren’t intended to connect additional reinforcement together such as a stirrup or a tie.

• The spacing for reinforcement shall be on a dimension line with extension lines. Do not point to a single bar and call out the spacing. Reinforcement spacing callouts shall include a distance. If the distance is an unusual number, give a maximum spacing. Do not use “equal spaces” as in, “23 equal spaces = 18′-9″ ” (the steel workers should not have to calculate the spacing). Also, never use the word “about” as in, “23 spaces @ about 10″ = 18′-9″ ”(this is open to too much interpretation). Instead these should read, “23 spaces @ 10″ max. = 18′-9″.”
• Reinforcement geometry shall be clear in plan details. Congested areas, oddly bent bars, etc. can be clarified with additional views/details/sections or adjacent bending diagrams. In bending diagrams, reinforcement dimensions are given out-to-out. It may be necessary to show edges of reinforcement with two parallel edge lines to clearly show working points and dimensions.
• Reinforcement lengths, angles, etc. need not be called out when they can be determined from structural member sizes, cover requirements, etc. Anchorage, embedment and extension lengths of reinforcement shall be dimensioned in the plans.
• Standard hooks per AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.2.1 need not be dimensioned or called out, but shall be drawn with the proper angle (90º, 135º or 180º). Seismic hooks per AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.2.2 (used for transverse reinforcement in regions of expected plastic hinges) shall be called out on the plans whenever they are used.
• Splices in reinforcement are required when reinforcement lengths exceed the fabrication lengths in Section 5.1.2.F. They may also be necessary in other locations such as construction joints, etc. The location, length and stagger of lap splices shall be shown on the plan sheets. Tables of applicable lap splice lengths are acceptable with associated stagger requirements. Type, location and stagger of mechanical and welded splices of reinforcement shall be shown.
• Where concrete cover requirements differ from those given in the standard notes or Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(24)C, they shall be shown in the plans. It shall be clear whether the cover requirement refers to ties and stirrups or the main longitudinal bars.

Detailing Practice
• Bar list sheets shall be prepared for plan sets including bridges. They shall be included at the end of each bridge plan set. They are not stamped. They are provided in the plans as a convenience for the Contractor and are to be used at their own risk. Despite this warning, Contractors sometimes use the bar list directly to fabricate reinforcement without confirming details from the plans. Designers should therefore strive for accuracy in the bar list. An accurate bar list also serves as a checking mechanism and a way to calculate reinforcement quantities.
• The reinforcing for some structural members such as approach slabs, shafts, piles, barrier, retaining walls, bridge grate inlets, sign structure foundations, precast SIP deck panels and precast girders are not shown in the bar list at the end of the bridge plan set but may include their own bar list on their plan sheets. These components typically have shop plans, include steel reinforcement within their unit costs and/or are constructed by separate sub-contractors.
• Other reinforcement detailing references include ACI 315-99 “Details and Detailing of Concrete Reinforcement”, ACI 318-08 “Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete”, and CRSI “Manual of Standard Practice”.

Bridge Office Standard Drawings and Office Examples 11.1.2.A
General
• The Bridge and Structures Office provides standard drawings and example sheets of various common bridge elements. 11.1.2.B
Use of Standards
• The Standard Drawings are to be considered as nothing more than examples of items like girders or traffic barriers which are often used and are very similar from job to job.
• They are to be copied to a structure project and modified to fit the particular aspects of the structure. They are not intended to be included in a contract plan set without close scrutiny for applicability to the job. 11.1.2.C
Maintenance of Standard Drawings
Ownership and maintenance of Bridge Standard Drawings is the responsibility of the drawing owner. Drawings are owned by the engineer responsible for the corresponding BDM chapter or section within the chapter in which they appear. The CAD Applications Engineer role is to ensure CAD standards are followed in accordance with this chapter as well as the WSDOT Electronic Engineering Data Standards (EEDS) Division 3-S5 PS&E Standards for any standard symbology not defined in a Bridge and Structures Office Standard library or the Bridge Design Manual. The CAD Applications Engineer will also ensure the folders containing the Standard Drawings are properly updated and that the Standard Drawings are published to the WSDOT Website. The procedure for updating existing Bridge Standard Drawings or developing new Standards is:

3.
Modifications shall be made to a copy of the Standard Drawing. The current standard shall not be altered.
4.
The completed Standard Drawing will be reviewed by the drawing owner to ensure changes have been made correctly and CAD Applications Engineer for conformance with the CAD Standards.
5.
The drawing owner will send the updated Standard Drawing to the Bridge Design Engineer in accordance with Section 11.1.2C.
6.
Once the completed drawing is approved for use, the CAD Applications Engineer will update the standard drawing library, publish the drawing to the Bridge Office website, and notify the Bridge Design Office of the updates.
11.1.3
Typical Plan Set and Sheets 11.1.3.A
Plan Sheet Organization
• Plan sheets should be assembled in the order of construction and be clear and logical when moving from one sheet to the next.
• Bridge and other structural plans can be broken into Plan Groups. A Plan Group is a grouping of all the corresponding plan sheets for one particular bridge or structure within a project, to include all primary and auxiliary structures and structural components.
• Sheet numbering shall start with the letter designator for the discipline followed by the letter designator for the plan group location within the project (i.e. A is the first structure, or plan group, in the project, B is the second structure, and so on). Plan group designators follow alphabetical order and are to be assigned to each bridge as it appears in the project along stationing. See Table 11.1.3-A1 below ҽ An example would look like “BA1”. “B” represents the Bridge discipline, “A” denotes this is the first bridge in the project and “1” denotes the plan group sheet number, in this case, the first sheet in the plan group. ҽ As a general rule, plan group designators shall avoid using the letters “I” and “O” as they may become confused with a one “1” or zero “0” ҽ If there is only one bridge or structure plan group in the project plan set, the plan group letter designator shall be “A” (i.e. “BA”) Table 11.1.3-A1 Designator B S W
Structural Plan Discipline Designators Definition Bridge Sign Structures Wall
• If one of the listed disciplines in Table 11.1.3-A1 are part of a bridge plan group (i.e. a sign structure attached to a bridge in conjunction with other rehab or retrofit plans occurring on that bridge, or wingwalls on a bridge abutment) their associated sheets would fall under the Bridge discipline and would not fall under their stand-alone discipline such as “S” or “W”

Sheet Contents
• Layout ҽ The Layout sheet shall contain, but is not limited to: ◦ Plan View with ascending stations from left to right ◦ Elevation View shown as an outside view of the bridge and shall be visually aligned with the plan view. ҽ The original preliminary plan will be copied to create the final layout. Views, data, and notes may be repositioned to improve the final product. ҽ Items on the preliminary plan, which should not appear on the final layout are as follows: ◦ Typical roadway sections. ◦ Vertical curve, Superelevation and curve data for other than the main line. ◦ Other information that was preliminary or that will be found elsewhere in the plans. ҽ Items not normally found on the preliminary plan, which should be added: ◦ Test hole locations (designated by 3/16 inch circles, quartered) to plan view. ◦ Elevation view of footings, seals, piles, etc. Show elevation at Bottom of footing and, if applicable, the type and size of piling. ◦ General notes above legend on right hand side, usually in place of the typical section. ◦ Title “LAYOUT” in the title block and sheet number in the space provided. ◦ Other features, such as lighting, conduit, signs, excavation, riprap, etc. as determined by the designer. ҽ The preliminary plan checklist in Appendix A, Chapter 2 can be used for reference.
• General Notes/Construction Sequence ҽ The General notes shall contain the following information: ◦ Reference to the current edition of the WSDOT Standard Specifications ◦ Reference to the current edition of the AASHTO LRFD Design Specifications ◦ Reference to the current AASHTO Seismic Design Specifications and seismic design category information ◦ The types of concrete allowed on the project ◦ Abutment backfill requirements ◦ Concrete cover requirements ◦ Concrete foundation seal information ◦ Pile or shaft information ◦ Material requirements ҽ Additionally, if possible, the construction sequence should be placed on this sheet. If there is not room on the General Notes sheet, the construction sequence shall be its own sheet immediately following the General Notes sheet.

Detailing Practice
• Footing/Foundation Layout ҽ An abutment with a spread footing has a Footing Layout. An abutment with piles and pile cap has a Foundation Layout. ҽ The Footing Layout is a plan of the bridge whose details are limited to those needed to locate the footings. The intent of the Footing Layout is to minimize the possibility of error at this initial stage of construction. ҽ The Foundation Layout is a plan of the bridge whose details are limited to those needed to locate the shafts or piles. The intent of the Foundation Layout is to minimize the possibility of error at this initial stage of construction. ҽ Other related information and/or details such as pedestal sizes, and column sizes are considered part of the pier drawing and should not be included in the Footing Layout. ҽ The Footing Layout should be shown on the layout sheet if space allows. It need not be in the same scale. When the general notes and footing layout cannot be included on the first (layout) sheet, the Footing Layout should be included on the second sheet. ҽ Longitudinally, footings should be located using the survey line to reference such items as the footing, centerline pier, centerline column, or centerline bearing, etc. ҽ When seals are required, their locations and sizes should be clearly indicated on the Footing Layout. Seal depth and elevations should be shown on abutment and pier sheets as required. The Footing Layout should have references to the pertinent information on those sheets as necessary. ҽ The Wall Foundation Plan for retaining walls is similar to the Footing Plan for bridges except that it also shows dimensions to the front face of wall.
• Piles/Shafts ҽ Pile and shaft details will be associated with a Foundation Layout or a Footing Layout (if the footing is to have piles below, acting as a pile cap more so than a spread footing). ҽ These detail sheets will come immediately after the Foundation Layout or Footing Layout if they are to be used to support an Abutment or directly after the abutment sheets if used to support Intermediate Piers. ҽ Best practice is to have a set of shaft or pile details for each pier, however, the design engineer may choose to use one set of details for the whole bridge plan set, as long as all variables and conditions are addressed and would be clear to the contractor reading the plans. ҽ Typically, when showing items below ground, they would be detailed using a hidden line style. However, because the shaft “elevation” is detailed more like a section, it is not necessary, and in fact, discouraged to show the below ground portions as hidden. ҽ Bridge elements that have not yet been built should not be shown, unless it is to add clarification to the condition being detailed. For example, a shaft cap may be shown to highlight the penetration depth of the shaft into the cap. Any future element (those that have not been built yet) shall be shown using a DDASH line style in accordance with Figure 11.1.1-E1.

Detailing Practice
Chapter 11
• Abutment ҽ Abutment piers shall be detailed separately due to the elevation views being opposite directions in relation to stationing. This will mitigate any chance for confusion in the field due to asymmetrical profiles or grades, and any differences in skew. ҽ Bridge elements that have not yet been built will not be shown. For example, the superstructure is not to be shown, dashed or not, on any substructure details. ҽ Elevation information for seals and piles or shafts may be shown on the abutment or pier sheets. Seal depth and elevations may be shown on abutment or pier elevation views and may also be shown on section views only if required for additional clarification. ҽ Seals should be shown on Abutment or Pier sheets as necessary but should not include dimensions already specified on the Footing Layout ҽ Views are to be oriented so that they represent what the contractor or inspector would most likely see on the ground. Pier 1 elevation is often shown looking back on stationing. A note should be added under the Elevation Pier 1 title saying “Shown looking back on stationing”.
• Wingwall Details ҽ Wingwall detail sheets shall be placed directly after each set of Abutment detail sheets. ҽ These sheets are permitted to show superstructure components, even though they would not be built at the time the wingwalls are being built. This is to show relational data, such as open joint dimensions and top slope of wall in relation to deck haunch. The future substructure components shown shall be detailed in a DDASH line style in accordance with Figure 11.1.1-E1 to represent a future component to be built. ҽ Each abutment should have its own set of wingwall detail sheets, however, each wingwall for that particular abutment pier may be represented concurrently by a single set of details using elevation tables and other multi-data representations to differentiate between each wall. Additionally, the design engineer may permit the use of a single set of wingwall sheets for all wingwalls within the project so long as all the information requirements are met and would be clear to the contractor.
• Intermediate Piers/Bents ҽ Each pier should be detailed separately as a general rule or best practice. ҽ If the intermediate piers are identical except for height, then they may be shown together at the discretion of the design engineer, so long as the design intent and the information pertaining to each pier is clear and easily understood.
• Bearing Details ҽ Typically shown after all substructure details directly before the girder framing plan. ҽ Only one bearing detail sheet is needed in the plan set. If multiple are required, they should be directly placed after all detail sheets for each abutment pier and their attached structures (i.e. wingwall sheets)

Detailing Practice
• Framing Plan ҽ Girder Lines must be identified in the plan view (Gir. A, Gir. B, etc.). ҽ For adjacent deck girder bridges, such as slab girders and wide flange thin deck girders, the framing plan shall be based on the girder centerline or centerline work point rather than the gap width between adjacent girders.
• Typical Section ҽ Girder spacing, which is tied to the bridge construction baseline ҽ Roadway slab thickness, as well as web and bottom slab thicknesses for box girders ҽ “A” dimension ҽ Limits of pigmented sealer ҽ Profile grade and pivot point and cross slopes ҽ Utility locations ҽ Curb to curb roadway width ҽ Soffit and drip groove geometry
• Girders ҽ Prestressed girder sheets can be copied from the Bridge Office library but they must be modified to match the project requirements.
• End Diaphragm ҽ End diaphragm sheets can be copied from the Bridge Office library but they must be modified to match the project requirements ҽ Only one set of End Diaphragm details is required, however, specific conditions may warrant a separate set of details for each End Diaphragm. This will be at the discretion of the Design Engineer.
• Intermediate Diaphragm ҽ Intermediate diaphragm sheets can be copied from the Bridge Office library but they must be modified to match the project requirements ҽ Only one set of Intermediate Diaphragm details is required if there are multiple diaphragms, however, specific conditions may warrant a separate set of details for each Intermediate Diaphragm. This will be at the discretion of the Design Engineer.
• Bridge Deck Reinforcement ҽ Plan and transverse section views ҽ Traffic barrier reinforcing bars shall be called out on the Bridge Deck Reinforcement Plan sheet by using an overall dimension as shown in Figure 11.1.3-C1. The S1 and S2 bars are to be detailed, dimensioned, and their spacing shall be shown only on the Traffic Barrier Details 1 sheet. Figure 11.1.3-C1
