Tribal Signing
A.
Reservation Boundary Signing – ENTERING/LEAVING and (NAME OF) RESERVATION signs may be installed at reservation boundaries where the state highway passes through a tribal reservation. The boundary limits indicated are to be the original treaty boundary limits. If the reservation has a “patch work” boundary layout, place the boundary signs to encompass the entire patch work layout rather than installing individual sets of signs for each boundary crossing location. Signs shall be white letters on a green background.
B.

Directional/Distance Signing – As sovereign nations, a tribal reservation may be considered as a primary or supplemental destination along with other local jurisdictions (a city or town). Tribal logos may be incorporated on directional signs. Any wording that refers to or implies a commercial enterprise is not allowed. Directional and distance signs shall be white letters on a green background.
Signing may be from one state highway to another if sign space is available. Ramp follow-through signing should show the mileage if the reservation is more than 1 mile away. Additional signing for the Tribal Center or Community Center may be considered at the nearest and most direct interchange or intersection, if it meets heritage, cultural, historic, or museum criteria.
Examples: (NAME OF) RESERVATION
NEXT RIGHT or “X” Miles (NAME OF) TRIBAL CENTER
NEXT RIGHT or “X” Miles
Tribal logo may be incorporated into the guide sign. The maximum logo size is 30″ x 30″. The logo shall show the shape and color both day and night.
If there is insufficient space to display a tribal logo on an existing sign face, the logo will be installed directly above the upper left-hand corner of the guide sign. If the Tribe wants the logo incorporated onto the face of the guide sign, they have the option of paying for a complete new guide sign to include the logo.
When the guide sign is due for replacement, it may be enlarged to incorporate the tribe logo onto the sign face at no cost to the Tribe.
C.
Tribal Language Signs – Tribal Governments have requested certain traffic signs display both English and their tribal language on roads and highways that traverse tribal lands. WSDOT worked with the Washington Indian Transportation Policy Advisory
Committee (WITPAC) to develop this signing program.
Information about the meanings of the words on the signs will be publicly available on the WSDOT Tribal Liaison webpage www.wsdot.wa.gov/tribal after the signs are installed.
Tribal Governments may request dual language signing on jurisdictional boundary and geographic features signs on or adjacent to tribal lands roadways under WSDOT jurisdiction. The following is the WSDOT’s guidance on the display of both the English and tribal language on traffic signs.

WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10
Page 2-59 Chapter 2
Signs
The display of both the English and tribal languages on a single sign or sign assembly may be approved by WSDOT, based on the following guidelines:
Page 2-60 1.
Requests may include any jurisdictional boundary (WA MUTCD Section 2H.04
County/City Name Marker Signs) or geographic features (WA MUTCD Section 2H.04 Lake and Stream) signs include the following signs: Reservation Boundary signs, City entrance signs, County line boundaries and bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, streams, or creeks when that body of water is crossed by the state highway by the use of a bridge or the body of water is visible to the motorist.
A letter of concurrence from the City or County is required for city entrance signs or county boundary signs. The letter of concurrence needs to specify that they are in agreement that both languages be displayed and identify the placement, above or below, of each language. 2.
Such signs shall be limited to locations on or adjacent to tribal lands.

3.
The sign message shall be tribal language as specified by the requesting Tribal
Government. 4.
Tribal languages shall not be displayed on any other sign including, but not limited to, Regulatory, Warning (including School Zone), and all other Guide (including
Destination, Mileage, Street Name, General or Specific Service (Logo Signs),
Tourist-Oriented Directional (Specific Service Signs), Scenic Byway Routes, and
Acknowledgment) signs. 5.
Tribal language signs may be installed on conventional highways, but not on freeway or expressway type highways. Freeways are high speed highways that have entrance and exit ramps. Examples include I-5, I-90, I-405, I-705, I-205, I-82,
I-182, SR 520, SR 16, SR 167, SR 512 and others. Expressways are generally high speed 4-lane divided highways like SR 8 between Olympia and Aberdeen, parts of US 101, US 97 and US 12. Three sections of Expressways that are on or next to Tribal lands: US 97 from Union Gap to Toppenish, SR 20 from Anacortes to I-5 and US 101 near Kamilche. 6.
Such signs shall be post mounted on WSDOT approved crashworthy roadside sign structures and not be overhead installations.

7.
Installation of the signs shall not interfere with the placement of any other necessary signing and shall not compromise the safety or efficiency of traffic flow. The signing shall be limited to one sign at an appropriate location in each route direction. 8.
All letters and numerals displayed on the sign for the main characters of the tribal language shall be as provided in the Standard Highway Signs and Markings reference publication. Unique characters that are necessary for the proper translation, but not provided in the FHWA Standard Alphabets, may be used.
These unique characters are to be kept to a minimum and shall be based on the characteristics of the letter forms of the Standard Alphabets, such as stroke width and arc, to the extent practicable.

Process Overview 1.
The Tribal Government will request signs through the WSDOT HQ Traffic
Operations Office.

2.
The Tribe will include the following items with the request: 3. a.
Submittal Letter b.
Documentation that illustrates action of approval by the Tribal Government to request signs. For example, letter from Tribal Chair or Tribal Council Resolution. c.
Letter of concurrence from the City or County is required for any requested city entrance signs or county boundary signs. The letter or concurrence needs to specify that they are in agreement that both languages be displayed and identify the placement, above or below, of each language. d.
List of requested signs as entered into the spreadsheet: Tribal Language Signs. xlsx. Because of the length of some tribal words, some signs could be very large unless the word or phrase is separated onto two lines. Where possible, recommend where the word or phrase can be separated onto two lines without changing the meaning. e.
If possible, submit electronically the spreadsheet referenced above to the
WSDOT Traffic Office so information can be added to the spreadsheet as described below.
The WSDOT Regional Traffic Office will provide the following information back to the Tribe: a.
Sign Panel designs (PDF)

b.
Completed spreadsheet: Tribal Language Signs.xlsx c.
Cost estimate for each sign fabrication and installation according to WSDOT
Traffic Operations Office. d.
J-agreement for cost reimbursement, sign design, location, sign maintenance and replacement. 4.
The Tribe will review the sign panel designs for accuracy. If there are errors in the sign design, the Tribe should contact the Regional Traffic Office with revisions. Once the tribal sign design is approved, the Tribe will send the WSDOT Traffic Office a completed agreement and payment. 5.
When the completed agreement and payment are received, signs will be ordered for fabrication and installation. 6.
If the sign needs to be replaced because it is damaged, the replacement cost will be the responsibility of the Tribe. 7.
The WSDOT Regional Traffic Office will send the completed spreadsheet to the
WSDOT Tribal Liaison who will make the English words, the tribal language words, and the English translation of the tribal words, and a phonetic representation of the words available on the WSDOT Tribal Liaison website.

Sign Panel Design 1.
The tribal language may be placed above the English language on a case by case basis.
Both language are upper lower case lettering. 2.
Due to the length of some tribal words and phrases it is recommended to use the highway font Series D instead of E Mod. Series D is a similar font to E Mod but has less breadth to the letters by approximately 35 percent. By using the Series D font and one inch less than the standard font height, the overall width of the signs when placing the tribal language on two lines should in most cases fit on U channel post sign structures.
If the word or phrase cannot be displayed on two lines the overall size of the sign may require a larger sign structure. This will increase the cost of the sign. 3.
The I3-101 (Body of water) and I2-501 (County boundary) sign will include the tribal language in Series D, 6-inch font and the English language in E Mod, 6-inch font.

4.
The I2-301 (City Entrance Signs) will include the tribal language in Series D, 8-inch font and the City Name with the English language in E Mod, 8-inch font.

United States Forest Service (USFS) Facilities
Supplemental guide signing to a USFS facility (campground, Visitor’s Center, or a
Headquarters building) may be considered if distance criteria are met and sign space in accordance with the MUTCD is available.
The facility must be located within 1 mile of an interchange or intersection in a major metropolitan or urban area, and within 10 miles in a rural area. These signs are white letters on a brown background per agreement with the USFS (MOU NFS 00-MU- 11060000-040).

Follow-Through Signing
Follow-through signing provides motorists (after being directed off the state highway) with confirmation to destinations. Signs are installed and maintained by the agency responsible for the local roadway and must be in place before any directional signs are installed on the state highway.
When considering a destination for a supplemental guide sign, determine whether the local agency will install follow-through signing on the local roadway and coordinate the signing plan with them. Provide MUTCD guidelines for follow- through sign sizing to local agencies.
Use 6-inch D series letters in high traffic volume or high speed areas. Use 5-inch C series letters, as a minimum, on lower volume or slower speed roadways. Include directional information or arrows as part of the legend.
Install follow-through signing in advance of decision points where route changes are required. Additional trailblazer signs may be placed at mandatory stop locations, but do not install these signs in combination with regulatory or warning signs. 2-17
General Service Signs 2-17.1
General
The MUTCD directs States to establish signing guidelines for several types of general services. Install GENERAL SERVICE signs where the services are not readily apparent to travelers and where they meet the criteria noted below.
Do not combine GENERAL SERVICE signing and MOTORIST INFORMATION (MIS LOGO) signs on the same back panel. If a specific MIS back panel is in place do not also install
GENERAL SERVICE signs for that service. (e.g., if a FOOD back panel exists then a general
MSS food sign will not be installed). A specific business can join the MIS program instead.
Periodic reviews by region personnel confirm that signing is displayed only for services and facilities that meet eligibility criteria and that signs are removed or covered when the service or facility is closed for the season or no longer in operation.

The NEXT SERVICES MILES (D9-1601) sign may be placed below the MOTORIST SERVICE sign if the next services are more than 20 miles away.
A separate word message VISITOR INFORMATION sign may be installed under the
GENERAL SERVICE sign.
When services are not readily visible from an interchange, install follow-through signs at ramp terminals, using the same legends or symbols as on the mainline signs. If the services are located more than 1 mile from the interchange or intersection, display the distance to the services on the ramp terminal or direction sign respectively.
Signs have white symbols or letters on a blue background.
GENERAL SERVICE plaques may be installed in conjunction with other guide signs: • On ground mounted signs, install the plaque on either post below the sign. • If more than two GENERAL SERVICE plaques are required, place them on a bracket below the guide sign, in a manner that does not interfere with the breakaway safety features of the sign structure. • On overhead signs, a GENERAL SERVICE plaque is installed above the guide sign.
The department uses the following criteria to determine if a general service sign is warranted. The State Traffic Engineer can approve minor deviations on a case-by-case basis.

Other Essential Guide Signs 2-18.1
Street Name and Advance Street Name Signs
STREET NAME (D3 Series) signs are useful navigational tools for the roadway user and are installed at roadway intersections. Street name signs are white letters on a green background. Upper and lower case letters are used.
Signs showing the historical street name may be used in conjunction with a current street name sign. All costs associated with the historic street name shall be the responsibility of the local agency making the request.
Page 2-70
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Signs
Chapter 2
In urban areas, STREET NAME signs are installed at the intersection. For significant cross streets, channelized intersections, and at signalized intersections, ADVANCE STREET NAME signs should also be installed. Place them 200 feet or more in advance of intersections to alert motorists to the upcoming roadway and the possibility of turns or lane changes, etc.
A directional chevron may be used on the street name sign indicating the direction of the side street.
In rural areas, where a county road intersects the state highway, a STREET NAME sign identifying the state route is installed above the state installed STOP sign. The county is responsible for the original installation, and the department maintains these signs.
Where ADVANCE INTERSECTION WARNING signs are used, (primarily in rural or suburban areas) it is WSDOT policy to install the black on yellow ROAD NAME (D3-201) sign above or below the INTERSECTION WARNING sign.
On city streets that are part of state highways, the local agency shall install and maintain street signs within the corporate limits (RCW 47.24.020). Use this table to determine appropriate letter size for street name signs:

Border Crossing – Canadian Customs
Several Canadian Customs border crossing stations have limited hours of operation and are closed to motorists outside these hours. For these crossing stations, install signing to inform motorists of the hours of operation and locate the signs to provide them an opportunity to find an alternate route or to delay their crossing. Place the sign in advance of the closest exit before the border where overnight accommodations are available.
Canadian Customs at 24-hour border crossings do not need advance signing showing hours of operation.

Unincorporated Community
COMMUNITY ENTRANCE signs (I2-301) may be installed on each non-limited access state highway approach to an unincorporated community that includes: • A United States Postal Service office. • At least two motorist services, which may be any combination of gas, food, or lodging.
Supplemental destination guide signing to the community may be considered if it is within
10 miles from a rural state highway interchange or intersection.
Do not install destination signing to unincorporated communities from an urban area interchange. 2-18.5
City Center
Historically, the department has provided CITY CENTER signs at the request of local governments, to direct motorists to local government buildings (i.e., city hall, courthouse).
Currently, requests for CITY CENTER signs often come from local business communities to direct motorists to business areas within a city.
CITY CENTER signing requests should include the following information: • Description and location of all city center exits within the corporate limits. • The interchange or intersection name of the proposed sign location. • Verification of local agency agreement on the location of the city center.
When reviewing CITY CENTER signing requests, conduct a field review to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of sign locations and confirm other details of the request letter.
Include the local government, business community, and other interested groups to assure agreement on the location of the city center.
All costs for sign fabrication and installation are the responsibility of the city making the signing request.

D10-102, and D10-103) on the right side of the roadway, in the direction of increasing milepost. • On multilane highways, install the single faced MILEPOST MARKER (D10-1, D10-2, and D10-3) for each roadway direction, on the right side of the roadway. • MILEPOST MARKERS on spur routes display the letter “S” below the mileage figure. • MILEPOST MARKERS must be installed within 50 feet of their designated location.
If that is not physically possible, do not install that MILEPOST MARKER.
When a milepost marker is relocated it must be documented in the Traffic Sign Maintenance
System (TSMS). Headquarters Traffic supplies this information to the Roadway Data Office annually so the milepost marker can be accurately relocated in the State Highway Log.
See Standard Plan G-10.10-00 and G20.10-00 for installation details.

2-18.7
Highway and Freeway Entrance
Install the HIGHWAY ENTRANCE sign (E12-101) on two-lane two-way undivided highways where interchanges are provided at intersecting crossroads. Install signs on both sides of the on-ramp, facing approaching traffic, to clearly identify the entrance to the on-ramp.
Install the FREEWAY ENTRANCE sign (E12-201) on both sides of each freeway or expressway on-ramp, facing approaching traffic, to identify the ramp entrance. 2-18.8
Other Agencies
Consider installation of supplemental guide signs to facilities of other federal, state and local agencies when space is available per the MUTCD. Sign colors are determined by the type of sign destination (recreation, emergency, or direction). • Department of Natural Resources Campgrounds – White letters on brown background. • State Patrol – White letters on blue background. • State Public Fishing Areas – White letters on brown background. • Government Fish Hatcheries Open to the Public – White letters on green background. • Department of Corrections Facilities – White letters on green background.

Miscellaneous Signing 2-19.1
Adopt-a-Highway or Adopt-a-Trail
ADOPT-A-HIGHWAY/TRAIL (AAH/AAT) signs are installed to recognize both volunteer groups and businesses that sponsor litter pick up, or other roadside, or trail enhancement activities as part of the AAH program. The program is administered through the
Headquarters Maintenance Office, with regional coordinators assigning locations to groups.
Adopted roadside sections can include one or both sides of the roadway.
AAH signs are placed at or near the beginning of an adopted section. Lateral placement of the AAH signs may be up to 50 feet from the edge of the travel lane, if right of way is available and the signs are still visible from the traveled lanes. All AAH signs mounted on the same post must be the same width.
The name displayed on the AAH recognition sign shall be the official name of the organization, individuals, or business sponsoring the section and must be pre-approved by the department.
Volunteer adoption sections are signed as follows: • Sections adopted by volunteer groups are signed using I6-901, I6-901A, I6-902,
I6-902A, I6-904, and I6-905A signs. • If the section includes both directions of travel, install signs for each. • On divided highways, AAH signs are installed on the right shoulder only.
Sponsored adoption sections are signed as follows: • Sections adopted by businesses are signed using an I6-906 sign. • On divided highways, AAH signs may be installed on either the median or the right shoulder. • The sponsor’s logo/name plaque is provided to the region for WSDOT installation on the AAH sign. The plaque will be a 0.050 inch aluminum overlay. • Size requirements are a maximum of three lines, with 20 spaces per line. • If a sponsor’s name will not fit within the sign width, the letter height will be reduced until it can.
AAH recognition signs may also be installed for special enhancement projects such as landscaping at interchanges, or other areas. In these cases, the smaller sign shall be used and the region traffic engineer shall determine sign placement on a case-by-case basis.
Spacing between AAH signs and other traffic control signs shall conform to MUTCD Section 2H.08. AAH signs are shown in Appendices 2-26 and 2-27.

Roadside Memorial Sign Program
The Headquarters Traffic Office administers the DUI Victim Memorial signing program and approves all locations for signing. Refer citizen requests for Victim Memorial signs to the
Headquarters Traffic Office.
Install one of the following signs: PLEASE DON’T DRINK AND DRIVE (I20-201), PLEASE
DON’T DRUG AND DRIVE (I20-201A), PLEASE DON’T SPEED (I20-201B), PLEASE DON’T

BICYCLISTS (I20-201G), or SEAT BELT SAVE LIVES (I20-201H) with the IN MEMORY OF (I20-203) or SPONSORED BY (I20-204) plaque at approved locations.
Specific sign locations are determined on an individual basis during the review of the sign request. In general, along non-interstate highways, one sign is installed for each direction of travel. Install the sign near the physical crash location, while considering sign spacing, sight distance, and other factors that may preclude using the exact crash site.
For the Interstate system, one sign is installed along the on-ramp nearest to the collision scene, in the direction of travel that the collision occurred.
Information on the Roadside Memorial Sign Program is available at: www.wsdot.wa.gov/operations/traffic/signs/duisign.htm.

2-19.3
City/Community Entrance Markers
WSDOT may allow cities or communities, either by permit or agreement, to construct and maintain city/community entrance beautification areas on state highway right of way. The agreement may include a CITY or COMMUNITY ENTRANCE MARKER.
On a state highway, one ENTRANCE MARKER may be installed for each direction of travel near where it enters a city or community. Any landscaping associated with the marker shall be in compliance with the WSDOT Roadside Policy Manual M 3100, and approved by the region Landscape Architect.
An ENTRANCE MARKER for a neighborhood community that lies within the corporate limits of a city or town may be allowed if the city or town approves the neighborhood’s marker.
This marker will count as one of the two allowed per city or town.
An ENTRANCE MARKER visible to any state highway is required to meet these guidelines: • Be simple, dignified, and devoid of advertising. space for those who walk and bike, reduce accessibility for person with disabilities, or reduce sight distance below minimum design criteria. • Shall not interfere with, nor distract from any existing or future traffic control or safety device. • Any lighting associated with the marker shall comply with RCW 47.36.180. • Be sponsored by the city or a community group in which it is located.

Chapter 2
Signs
The city or community group is responsible for maintaining the marker and any associated landscaping. Inadequate maintenance of either, as determined by the department, may result in marker removal.
If a highway project (such as roadway widening) will displace an ENTRANCE MARKER, the city or community group is responsible for relocating and/or removing it. Markers not relocated shall be removed by WSDOT, with removal and disposal costs billed to the city or community group.
A.
Entrance Markers on Limited Access Highways – The total marker area shall not exceed 100 square feet, and the message area shall not exceed approximately 60 square feet. At highway interchanges, the marker must be oriented so it can be read by the motorist leaving the ramp and not by the motorist on the highway mainline.
Non-Profit Service Club Plaques (i.e., Kiwanis, Lions, Rotary) may not be installed on
ENTRANCE MARKERS within limited access highways. These signs are considered to be Type (1)(c) signs and are regulated under the Scenic Vistas Act (RCW 47.42 and
WAC 468-66).
B.

1.
Interstate – ENTRANCE MARKERS installed on Interstate right of way require
FHWA approval. The State Traffic Engineer reviews the design and placement of city ENTRANCE MARKER requests on interstate roadways before recommending approval to the FHWA. If approved, the marker is placed between the interchange ramp and the right of way line, in the area of the ramp terminal with the connecting city street, and not visible to mainline traffic. 2.
Non-Interstate – The region traffic engineer approves the design and placement of the marker on non-interstate routes. If there are any deviations from the guidelines above, the design must be submitted to the State Traffic Engineer for approval. For undivided highways, the marker is placed just inside corporate limits, or at the far side of an intersection located inside corporate limits.
Entrance Markers on Non-Limited Access Highways – The total marker size shall not exceed 150 square feet, including the border and trim, and service club plaques. The service club plaque area of the sign shall not be disproportional to the marker message.
The maximum size for each service club plaque is 24″ × 24″.
Non-Profit Service Club Plaques (i.e., Kiwanis, Lions, Rotary) may be installed on a city
ENTRANCE MARKER along a state highway if the marker is located within corporate limits and is not within a limited access area. These signs are considered to be Type (1) (b) signs and are regulated by the Scenic Vistas Act (RCW 47.42 and WAC 468-66).
The region traffic engineer shall approve the design and placement of the marker.
If there are any deviations from the guidelines, the design and placement shall be submitted to the State Traffic Engineer for approval.
Install the city ENTRANCE MARKER inside the city limits, beyond the curb line or outside edge of the roadway. ENTRANCE MARKERS for unincorporated communities may be considered for placement on state highway right of way. The marker must be located beyond the clear zone if it does not meet break- away standards.

Transit logos may be included in the sign design in accordance with MUTCD Section 2D-48. These signs are considered incidental and can be removed if sign space is needed for a higher priority sign.
The requesting agency is responsible for sign fabrication and initial installation costs.
WSDOT is responsible for the sign maintenance. Sign spacing: • Use a 300-foot spacing between signs on conventional two-lane, high-speed roadways. • Use 150-foot spacing for freeway on-ramps, and for both multilane and two-lane, lowspeed roadways in incorporated areas. 2-19.5
Commercial Dump Prohibition
Some rest areas along state highways provide Recreation Vehicle dump stations for use by noncommercial vehicles. Install the COMMERCIAL VEHICLE USE PROHIBITED (I8-704) sign in the rest area at these RV dump sites. This is the only valid application for this sign on state highways.

2-19.6
Fire District Boundary
The ENTERING FIRE DISTRICT and LEAVING FIRE DISTRICT signs (I8-804) may be installed at Fire District boundaries along state highways using these guidelines: • Upon region approval, signs shall be installed and maintained by the jurisdiction requesting the sign(s). A General Permit issued by the area maintenance office is required. • Signs should be installed at the district boundary, if possible, or no further than 1,000 feet from the boundary. • Signs may be placed away from the roadway near the edge of the right of way.
They shall not obstruct a driver’s view or constitute a hazard by their location. • Mounting posts shall be of wood, no larger than 4 inches × 4 inches, or they may be perforated square steel.

The sign shall be placed parallel to, and facing the roadway. The sign shall be visible from the shoulder, mounted either on the right of way fence or on a post, and shall display the distance from the edge of traveled way to the fire hydrant. If requested by the fire department, a 24-inch plaque may be added below the sign to indicate the nearest street or intersection.
The region traffic engineer shall contact local fire departments to determine signing needs for fire hydrants located near limited access highways.
The department is responsible for installing and maintaining these signs. 2-19.9
Apple Maggot
Many people carry homegrown fruit and municipal waste throughout the state without realizing that they may also be transporting harmful pests, such as the apple maggot, thereby increasing the insects’ range. Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) established specific geographical boundaries where the transport of homegrown fruit is prohibited. At their request, signs were installed at several locations throughout the state in an effort to stop the transport of homegrown fruit. Sign fabrication, installation, and maintenance costs are paid for by WSDA through an Interagency Agreement. Contact
Headquarters Traffic before replacing any apple maggot signs. Signs locations and messages are:

Salmon and Other Fish
WSDOT receives requests from fish related user groups to sign a stream or body of water with a specific fish related message. Signs related to preserving the fish habitat may be installed along a state highway; however, only one type of fish related sign will be allowed for a location. Where several user groups (i.e., salmon, steelhead, or trout) request signing in a location, suggest that they work together to develop a single fish related sign message and to seek support from the local jurisdiction. An overall signing plan with support documentation should be submitted to the region Traffic Office, preferably by the local jurisdiction or by an official organization or agency. • The stream crossing or body of water is required to be year round. • Multiple signs, supported, endorsed, or maintained by different user groups (i.e., salmon, steelhead, and trout) will not be allowed. • The requesting user group is responsible for the sign fabrication, installation costs, and all maintenance and replacement costs. A J account can be set up to administer the funds. Sign installation and removal will be by WSDOT personnel. • Sign size will be 18″ × 24″, 24″ × 24″, or 24″ × 36″, dependent on the fish logo and line message approved by WSDOT. • Sign colors are white letters on a blue background.

Variable Message Signs
Variable Message Signs (VMS) are traffic control devices designed to display diverse messages to alert roadway users about specific conditions or situations. VMS are part of
WSDOT’s Traffic Management System and are operated by each region Traffic Management
Center (TMC).
VMS are located on many highways throughout the state. Some are used exclusively to provide information about variable speed limits, lane use restrictions, active traffic management, or traction requirements. Others may provide information about: • Traffic incident information. • Traffic restrictions or emergency conditions. • Special event related traffic impact information. • Upcoming road closures or other impacts.
Operation of the Variable Message Signs is coordinated by the region’s TMC and is governed by the Variable Message Sign Policies, Guidance, Operations at: http://sharedot/ops/traffic/

Highway Advisory Radio (HAR) and Traveler Information Station (TIS)
Signing
HAR and TIS systems are low power AM radio stations installed to provide the traveling public with traffic alerts or traveler information. They are sometimes used in conjunction with a Variable Message Sign (VMS). Both HAR and TIS installations must comply with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requirements and must be approved by and coordinated through the WSDOT ITS and Communications office. HAR and
TIS system messages are governed by the HAR/TIS procedures which can be found at http://sharedot/ops/traffic/TO%20Policies%20and%20Plans/Highway%20Advisory%20
Radio/HARPolicy.pdf.
HAR and TIS signs are secondary to official traffic control signs (i.e., regulatory and warning signs, guide signs) and are installed only when MUTCD and WSDOT sign spacing requirements can be met.

Delineation and Markings
General
Delineation is the pavement markings, guideposts, and raised pavement markers used on and adjacent to the roadway to define vehicular travel paths. The MUTCD, Design Manual, and Standard Plans provide delineation placement guidelines.
The Roadway Delineation Practices Handbook, published by FHWA, discusses specialized materials and delineation treatments for unique applications and situations. This handbook does not establish policies or standards but is only a reference document. 3-2
Pavement Markings
Pavement markings are classified as either longitudinal or transverse. Materials typically used for each are paint for longitudinal markings and durables for transverse markings.
Durable markings include thermoplastics, Meythl Methacrylate, tape, etc. Durable markings are generally used in locations with higher ADT, high truck traffic and/or areas with increased turning radius. Approved sources for durable materials are listed in the General
Special Provisions. A purchase contract is available for the purchase of paint. New durable materials are continually being evaluated.
A.

Intersection Channelization – The MUTCD has a provision that allows pavement markings to be extended through an intersection where design or visibility conditions make it desirable to provide control through the intersection. These markings are only installed as the result of a traffic engineering analysis that considers horizontal curvature and other visibility conditions. For statewide uniformity, the dotted line used for this extension is applied as a 2-foot stripe with a 4-foot gap between stripes.
Multilane approaches may provide exclusive or shared lanes for turning and through vehicles. At most intersections through traffic must share a lane with one direction of turning traffic. To minimize delay, through traffic should normally be combined with right-turning traffic unless opposite approach geometrics are unfavorable. An offset centerline and minor widening may help accomplish the proper lane assignments.
Stop lines can be included at signalized intersections with crosswalks but are to be included at signalized intersections without crosswalks. At nonsignalized intersections, stop lines are necessary on the stop sign control approaches when crosswalks are not included. Including the stop line at stop sign control locations having marked crosswalks is optional.

Delineation and Markings
B.
Interchange Off Ramps – At either a parallel or a tapered deceleration lane, the
MUTCD allows the application of an optional dotted extension of the main line right edge line through the ramp opening. The dotted line is a 2-foot stripe with a 4-foot gap.
For statewide uniformity, these optional dotted extensions should only be installed where the exit ramp is located on a horizontal curve, except for locations with continuous illumination, and at locations with prevalent foggy periods. They are generally not needed at ramps exiting from tangent sections. These markings are only to be installed as a result of a traffic engineering analysis.

C.
Uncontrolled Pedestrian Crossing/Supplemental Treatments for Marked Pedestrian
Crossings.
Refer to the Traffic Manual chapter.
No Passing Zone Marking – No passing zones are to be established and marked on horizontal and vertical curves in accordance with the MUTCD.
State law, in the Rules of the Road RCW 46.61.100 – RCW 46.61.165, identifies several situations with a statutory no passing zone distance such as “. . . when approaching within 100 feet of or traversing any intersection or railroad crossing . . .”or“. . . the view is obstructed upon approaching within 100 feet of any bridge, viaduct, or tunnel” However, state law does not imply a need to mark no passing zones for such situations. 3-3
Guideposts
Guideposts, discussed in the MUTCD as delineators, are light retroreflecting devices mounted at the side of the roadway to indicate roadway alignment. They are effective aids for night, wet, or other reduced visibility driving conditions and are intended to guide rather than warn motorists.
Guidepost installation and spacing requirements are included in the Standard Plans and the Design Manual. The field spacing for guideposts shall be determined from Exhibit 3-1.
Approved sources for guideposts as well as reflective materials are listed in the General
Special Provisions.

3-4
Barrier Delineation
Barrier delineation is the extension of guideposts through an area of guardrail or concrete barrier. Spacing is the same as for guideposts.
Guardrail is delineated by mounting guideposts on guardrail posts as shown in the
Standard Plans.
Concrete barrier is delineated by placing reflective devices on the face of the barrier about
6 inches down from the top. When concrete barrier is placed immediately adjacent to the traveled lane, such as in construction zones, delineator spacing should be a maximum of
40 feet on tangents and 20 feet through curves.

Raised Pavement Markers
Chapter 3
As described in the Design Manual, raised pavement markers are extensively used in western
Washington to simulate lane lines and to supplement painted pavement markings.
Maintenance of raised pavement markers is discussed in the Maintenance Manual.
A.
Right Edge Lines – The general use of raised reflective pavement markers to supplement, or in lieu of, right edge lines is strongly discouraged. At night, such markers can be easily mistaken for lane lines.
The State Traffic Engineer has approved the use of reflective markers to supplement right edge lines in these locations: • On the taper in lane reduction sections, such as from four lane to two lane. • Through sections with reduced lane width, such as narrow structures. • At the gore of exit ramps.

B.
Recessed Markers – Recessed reflective markers and recessed lane lines appear to be an effective way to supplement centerline and lane line delineation in areas requiring regular snow plowing.
The details for installation of the recessed marker are contained in the Standard Plans.
Not generally allowed, recessed markers and lines may be installed on bridges with
Bridge Preservation approval. Currently, several alternative methods are being considered for this application to minimize the impact on bridge decks.

Multimodal Planning, Design, and Operational Considerations
Introduction
Washington’s Transportation Plan envisions an integrated
WSDOT Vision system safely connecting people and communities –
Washington travelers have fostering commerce and economic opportunity for all, a safe, sustainable, and operating seamlessly across boundaries, and providing integrated multimodal transportation system travel options to achieve an environmentally and financially sustainable system. Achieving a complete transportation system requires us to provide a variety of transportation options to all users. Not only will such a system serve everyone, it will function more efficiently. The benefits are significant and wide- ranging such as a cleaner environment, a stronger economy and a more mobile and healthy population.
Transportation system integration requires all partners
Multimodal to pull from a larger, multimodal toolbox to consider
Transportation Systems solutions that can best serve the interests of communities
A transportation network that and the traveling public. Highways and streets are a accommodates multiple modes of travel for the movement of community asset where access to transit facilities and people and goods including, services are found; bicycle and pedestrian connections are but not limited to, walking, complete; and access to major employment, education, rolling, bicycling, using public social service and residential destinations are a priority. transit, and driving.
The roadway system needs to feel safe for all users and it should both benefit and respond to the needs of people and communities around it.
Chapter 4 of the Traffic Manual is intended to expand the toolbox of strategies and complement the Design Manual, AASHTO, NACTO, FHWA polices and guides.

Multimodal Planning, Design, and Operational Considerations
Background
Washington State’s population is projected to grow more than 20 percent during the next
20 years. In Spokane and Clark counties, the population is expected to grow to more than 500,000 people and Central Puget Sound is expected to add another million people in the coming decades.1 This population growth will likely be accompanied by a number of challenges including: • Addressing a greater backlog of public infrastructure maintenance needs • Serving a larger number of people who are over 65 years old • Serving an increasing percentage of the population with disabilities • Helping a growing number of people facing health and economic inequality • Responding to the needs of a more urbanized population and the transportation issues associated with suburbanized poverty • Putting greater effort into the need to address climate change as well as the challenges providing a transportation system that provides for needs of road users in an equitable manner. All of these trends challenge us find the best use of the broad array of transportation services and systems, both public and private that are available to the public. 4-3
Policy 4-3.1
United States Department of Transportation
23 CFR § 652.5 states, “the safe accommodation of pedestrians and bicyclists should be given full consideration during the development of Federal-aid highway projects, and during the construction of such projects. The special needs for the elderly and the handicapped shall be considered in all Federal-aid projects that include pedestrian facilities. Where current or anticipated pedestrian and/or bicycle traffic presents a potential conflict with motor vehicle traffic, every effort shall be made to minimize the detrimental effects on all highway users who share the facility. On highways without full control of access where a bridge deck is being replaced or rehabilitated, and where bicycles are permitted to operate at each end, the bridge shall be reconstructed so that bicycles can be safely accommodated when it can be done at a reasonable cost. Consultation with local groups of organized bicyclists is to be encouraged in the development of bicycle projects.”
It is the policy of the United States, as described in 49 U.S.C. §70101 to maintain and improve the condition and performance of the National Multimodal Freight Network to ensure that the network provides a foundation for the United States to compete in the global economy.
Chapter 53 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code establishes the authority for FTA. It incorporates the Urban Mass Transportation Act originally enacted in 1964 and states that “it is in the interest of the United States, including its economic interest, to foster the development and revitalization of public transportation systems that (1) maximize the safe, secure, and efficient mobility of individuals; (2) minimize environmental impacts; and (3) minimize transportation-related fuel consumption and reliance on foreign oil.”

WSDOT Safety Goal is Zero Fatalities and
Serious Injuries by 2030
WSDOT is committed to multimodal safety as identified in Washington State’s Strategic
Highway Safety Plan.
The Washington Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and Washington Traffic Safety
Commission (WTSC), along with dozens of partners, collaborated to create the
Target Zero Strategic Highway
Safety Plan (SHSP). Target Zero is a statewide, data-driven effort to reduce fatalities and serious injuries to zero by the year 2030. We will do this by developing strong leadership in organizations that directly affect highway safety, and using partnerships to develop and implement innovative, data-based solutions based on a safe systems approach. Our goal is zero deaths and serious injuries, because every life counts. For more information about the Washington
Strategic Highway Safety Plan visit the Target Zero website :

Equity and Transportation
Transportation is essential for healthy, thriving communities. Safe, reliable, affordable transportation opens doors to economic and social opportunities for many people.
However, not all people have the same access. Equity refers to the distribution of benefits and costs or burdens across race, economic status, disability status and other characteristics and whether that distribution is fair in the context of past and current disparities. Transportation equity focuses on transportation system effects in an effort to understand where costs and burdens are unfairly distributed.
It reflects the input of an inclusive process involving the people who will be affected. This is the starting point for transportation decisions and investments that create a more just system that works for all.
WSDOT has a number of tools to support analysis of existing data to use when considering equity on transportation projects. Some programs and projects will require collection of additional data. Existing data sources include:
WSDOT Application for Local Planning and Community
Accessibility (ALPACA) provides demographic mapping tools for race/ethnicity, age, disability, and limited
English proficiency.

Screening and Mapping Tool. EJSCREEN is an environmental justice mapping and screening tool that provides EPA with a nationally consistent dataset and approach for combining environmental and demographic indicators.

Did you know?
Communities with poverty rates higher than the state average also have the highest numbers of households that lack access to a personal vehicle and are therefore more likely to rely on walking, bicycling, and transit for their transportation needs.
However, studies show a long pattern of investment inequity in lower-income neighborhoods. “Children who grow up in walkable communities fare better economically, controlling for a wide range of economic factors as well as the related characteristics of those neighborhoods.” – Kids Raised in Walkable Cities Earn More
Money As Adults, CityLab.

Multimodal Planning
Transportation facilities should provide for reasonable safe movement of people, goods, and services by multiple transportation modes, including motorized vehicles, bicycling, walking, transit, and others. WSDOT is moving towards the Safe Systems approach to roadway safety. This is a paradigm shift, a change in the way we understand transportation for all road users and identify solutions.
When evaluating the transportation system performance, the old paradigm considered motor vehicles as the main and dominant transportation mode, giving little consideration to other modes and the effects on those movements. The new paradigm is multimodal and comprehensive. Current WSDOT policies recognizes non-auto travel demands, and a wide range of economic, social and environmental effects, including vehicle ownership costs, parking costs, health effects, and the benefits of providing independent mobility for everyone regardless of mode. Speed management is a tool for the goal of reducing the incidence and severity of crashes for people using all modes.
When planning for motor vehicle and transit modes we generally think about complete systems. We want to provide travel that does not have a high probability of a crash. Such concepts apply equally well to all modes including freight, transit, and active transportation planning, though in practice we often pay more attention to isolated elements of a network like specific intersections.
In evaluating movements for all modes consider the larger areas people are likely to use.
Look at where schools, grocery stores, and other services are located relative to where people live. Also consider active transportation access to intermodal connections. It is useful to take the perspective of travelers who don’t own motor vehicles and can’t always make use of transit, walking, or biking. The Active Transportation Plan provides methodologies for understanding network quality and connectivity and associated performance measures.
Ideally, network improvements would be considered that help increase the active transportation and/or transit mode share. Where improvements are specific to a given facility, however, it is still necessary to understand how that facility interacts with the broader network. When changes to a facility reduce utility of the broader active transportation network, consider on and off-system investments that restore network connectivity and functionality. Changes that increase roadway width, posted or operating speed, and/or motor vehicle volume increase the potential for crashes that can be serious or fatal for people using active transportation. At the planning stage, potential changes to crash exposure and mobility because of new design and future operations need to be considered.
Planning actions that help remove or mitigate barriers to active transportation should be identified. Increasing mode share for active transportation and transit is considered a form a transportation demand management and can be considered to supplement or replace congestion mitigation. Mode share increases for active transportation modes occurs when road users feel reasonably safe and secure on the transportation systems.

Multimodal Planning, Design, and Operational Considerations
There is not one single approach to optimizing to meet the needs of all road users on the highway system. Keys to multimodal planning include: • Put safety first to support elimination of fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads and to reduce the severity of the crashes that may occur (e.g., everyone should to get home safely). • Learn and understand existing and future contexts. • Being mindful of project context beyond the immediate footprint. • Collaborate with colleagues, subject matter experts, and stakeholders. • Engage communities. For example: listen to priorities, discuss constraints, educate, find forums to engage, and review the Regional Transportation Plans and other relevant plans. • Look for opportunities on all projects to improve mobility and accessibility for all modes.
For example, roadway lanes can be re-purposed to add pedestrian and bicycle facilities.
Safety does not need to be at the expense of increased mobility when all road users are factored in. • Considering performance measures beyond vehicle peak hour analysis. Designing for the peak vehicle hour can lead to overbuilding facilities. Consequences of overbuilding highways can include reduced safety performance, higher maintenance costs, and increased stormwater runoff, as well as the creation of barriers to greater active transportation use that otherwise could reduce the peak load. The Exhibit 4-1 provides examples of common metrics used versus ones that are often not used.

Multimodal Transportation Analysis Tools
Balancing the demands on the transportation system within a multimodal framework requires effort to identify affordable and effective solutions. WSDOT has various tools available to assist with this effort, which include but are not limited to:
Design Manual Chapter 320 - Traffic Analysis. Traffic Analysis is either “operational” or “planning” in nature. Traffic Analysis are generally examines areas such as corridors or larger geographic areas. Outcomes of Traffic Analysis include identification of multimodal needs in a corridor and effects of land use changes. These studies typically do not reach the level of providing intersection control and geometric design recommendations.
Intersections are defined by Intersection Control Evaluations. (ICE). ICE is a data-driven, performance-based framework used to objectively screen alternatives and identify an optimal geometric and control solution for an intersection.
ICE studies can include more than one intersection or be applied on an entire corridor as needed. ICE policy is intended to be flexible, adaptable, and provide a transparent multimodal decision making process. achieving the WSDOT mission. This is how we plan, design, build, operate and maintain the state’s transportation system. Our goal is to identify and solve problems as quickly and inexpensively as possible. This approach uses performance-based and data-driven decision making with early community involvement to guide the development and delivery of transportation investments. Practical Solutions strategies include: • Lowest lifecycle cost to preserve the system in a state of good repair • Target Zero strategies for safety • Transportation System Management and Operations (TSMO) • Mobility management;2 and • Capital project investment

Mobility management includes Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies such as programs and services that help encourage transportation alternatives, reduce reliance on the private automobile for travel, and reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and greenhouse gas emissions. A good example of mobility management strategies can be found in the San Diego’s
Mobility Management Guidebook. WSDOT Transportation Demand Management website is another resource

If highway or intersection capacity is measured only for automobiles, then mitigation required to address “deficiencies” will only add automobile capacity in the form of vehicle travel or turn lanes, which may compromise the viability and safety of pedestrian, bicycle, and transit modes.
Widening a street may not be feasible from a physical or economic standpoint, and it might not be desirable from a practical design or land use standpoint, either. Chapter 12 provides guidance to measure transportation effects across the modes.
Safety Analysis Guide - The purpose of this guide is to provide guidance to WSDOT staff regarding expectations for safety analysis. This guide defines the focus, scale, and scope of safety analyses across the different WSDOT program areas as well as safety analysis outside the typical program areas.

Multimodal Transportation Documentation
Every project has a unique land use and transportation context. Understanding and documenting the project’s context is critical to successful application of state and WSDOT goals and defining multimodal transportation needs. Context should be viewed as both a constraint and an opportunity. WSDOT Design land use and transportation context and documentation requirements for the Basis of Design. The WSDOT
Context and Modal Accommodation Report (CMAR) is available for determining the existing and future multimodal context.
Sources of information to assist with documentation include resources listed in Section 4-3.3 and those listed below:
Definition of Context “Context refers to the environmental, economic, and social features that influence livability and travel characteristics. Context characteristics provide insight into the activities, functions, and performance that can be influenced by the roadway design. Context also informs roadway design, including the selection of design controls, such as target speed and modal priority, and other design decisions.” WSDOT • Stakeholder and/or community engagement • Local and regional plans and/or studies • Local land use plans • Local design standards • Local transit routes, plans, and/or studies • WSDOT Design Manual • WSDOT Corridor Sketches • WSDOT planning studies • Truck Freight Economic Corridor Maps • Freight and Goods Transportation Map (FGTS) • Freight Systems Plan • Functional Classification Maps • National Highway System Map • WSDOT GeoPortal Map

Active Transportation
Effective active transportation networks lead to more people walking and bicycling by creating routes that are safe, efficient, seamless, and easy to use. Years of research confirm the public health benefits of active travel modes like walking and biking. Organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National
Institutes of Health, among others, have long advocated for
Americans to increase physical activity to reduce avoidable chronic conditions associated with inactivity. Providing well-designed and managed facilities for people walking and rolling also provides important information for drivers to understand the mix of uses present in a corridor. 4-6.1
Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian travel is a vital transportation mode. It is used by everyone at some point in each trip and is a critical outlines WSDOT polices regarding pedestrian facilities.

Pedestrian & Bicyclist Safety all traffic fatalities in our state, and 20 percent of all traffic serious injuries, were people walking or biking. These figures continued to climb in 2018. At 109 fatalities, pedestrian deaths reached their highest number in more than 30 years. Compared to 2012–2014, the 2015–2017 figures show a 41 percent increase in fatalities for people who walk and bike, and an 11 percent increase in serious injuries.

Highway Safety Plan
When evaluating pedestrian facilities in urban core, urban, suburban, and rural town/ community population centers contexts consider the following: • Local agency road standards, criteria, and guidelines • Motor vehicle traffic volume, traffic speeds, number of travel lanes; the Level of Traffic
Stress index developed for the Active Transportation Plan incorporates these elements • Safety considerations: observed crashes, near miss data, pedestrian and bicycle volumes, safety analysis, opportunity for speed management, injury minimization policy • Land use consideration: Presence of current or future planned destinations, context, opportunity to support latent pedestrian demand, demographics indicating higher number of disabled people and/or people reliant on active transportation/transit • Multimodal connectivity: Transit usage, presence of transit stops, other modal connections, modal mix, roadway design, active transportation facilities connected to the particular segment in question • Consider demographics of the population within the walk shed of the location. Give special consideration to equity, age, disabilities, car ownership, and income. These area characteristics can affect reliance on active transportation facilities and public transportation services. • Stakeholder and community input • Other considerations: Maintenance, other factors

Sidewalk Width
Sidewalk width should be sufficient to facilitate easy movement by pedestrians and may vary depending on the character of an area. At a minimum, sidewalk widths must meet the contextual needs of the pedestrian access route. Where the sidewalk is not buffered from motor vehicle traffic, the preferred total width for a curb-attached sidewalk is at least
6 feet in residential areas and at least 8 feet in commercial areas. Additional width should be provided as needed in commercial areas for frontage zones and in locations where large volumes of pedestrian traffic can be expected based on context. In locations where sidewalks are constructed so that they are immediately adjacent to roadways and building faces, the walkway should include at least 2 feet of width for shy distance from walls, railings and fixed objects while also providing the necessary width for easy travel by the expected pedestrian, including those who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices.
Curb-attached sidewalks and buffer areas should be considered on all new and reconstructed state facilities and incorporated whenever possible in population centers.
B.
Sidewalk Buffer
In general, separation between pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic is desirable. The optimal width of a buffer zone varies depending on the character of an area and the traffic conditions on the adjacent roadway. Increased buffer width can reduce traffic stress for pedestrian’s providing a sense of safety and comfort and reducing crash exposure.
Greater separation from traffic is desirable where there are higher vehicle volumes and/or higher speeds.
Where curb-attached sidewalk is provided, at least a 3 foot buffer is required. Where an at grade pedestrian facility is separated from motor vehicle traffic by a swale or ditch a buffer zone of at least 4 feet or wider is recommended. Buffers should be maximized on higher speed, higher volume roadways. A buffer zone 7 feet wide will allow for installation of curb ramps, street lights, and signs outside the pedestrian access route. The buffer should be widened to accommodate the space occupied by any objects placed there, and still provide
2 feet clear to both the roadway and the sidewalk.
On roadways without curbs, buffer widths equal to or greater than the clear zone appropriate for the roadway are desirable.
Wider buffers also provide space to manage driveway slopes, making it easier to comply with cross slope limits that facilitate the preservation of the pedestrian access route at driveway crossings and prevent the need to drop sidewalks to grade at every driveway crossing. Buffer areas are frequently used for storage of snow removed from adjacent roadways in climates where snow accumulation is common. If the buffer area is used for snow storage, the buffer width should be scaled accordingly, bearing in mind that people who rely on pedestrian access continue to do so during the winter.

Pedestrian Crossings at Uncontrolled Locations
Uncontrolled pedestrian locations occur where a sidewalk or pedestrian path intersects a roadway where no traffic control exists such as a stop sign or traffic signal. This locations can be at intersections or midblock locations.
The focus of this section is crossings without intersection control such as a traffic signals or stop signs. Many of the design considerations for uncontrolled crossings can be incorporated into locations with controls as well; controls may need to be increased based on traffic volumes and speed. injuries occurred while the person was crossing the roadway. By focusing on pedestrian crossing needs and understanding crossing patterns agencies can take advantage of a significant statewide safety need and improve quality of life and transportation access for pedestrians of all ages and abilities. Bicyclists in crosswalks are defined in state law as pedestrians; their transportation needs are also addressed through crossing improvements.

A.
Federal Law
The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, or MUTCD defines the standards used by road managers nationwide to install and maintain traffic control devices on all public streets, highways, bikeways, and private roads open to public travel.
The MUTCD is published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) under 23 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 655, Subpart F.

B.
State Law
Legal crosswalks exist at all intersections, whether marked or not, per RCW 46.04.160.
Marked crossings at other locations are called mid-block crossings and can occur at schools, commercial areas, parks, transit stops, or other areas where pedestrians need to cross unmarked crossings.
C.
Agency Application
Designated crosswalks provide guidance for pedestrians and in conjunction with other measures help alert road users to a pedestrian crossing across a roadway. There are many factors to consider when deciding whether a marked pedestrian crossing is recommended at a specific location and what type of treatment is appropriate. Because every situation is unique, it is impossible to prescribe a “one size fits all” evaluation process that would work in every situation. The study process and criteria here are presented as guidance.
Consult the WSDOT Action Plan for Implementing Pedestrian Crossings Countermeasures at Uncontrolled Locations for additional discussion. The final decision to install pedestrian crossing infrastructure is subject to review and approval of the Region Traffic Engineer.
D.
Studies
WSDOT requires an engineering study to determine whether a crosswalk should be provided and the treatment needed. Implementation of a marked crosswalk at an uncontrolled location shall require approval from the Region Traffic Engineer or designee in
WSDOT uses engineering studies to determine where Pedestrian Signals or Pedestrian
Hybrid Beacons may be used on State Highways.
Engineering studies are recommended for updating existing marked uncontrolled crossings.
An engineering study by WSDOT is not required for systems installed by local jurisdictions.
Local agencies will need to comply with all applicable DOT permit approval processes.

Establish crossing need
After data collection is complete the next step is assessing the pedestrian/bicyclist need at the location, as well as the suitability of the location based on roadway, traffic, and adjacent land use characteristics. Pedestrian crossing needs may exists if any of the following are indicated: • Pedestrian/bicyclist crash and near miss history • Crash types and contributing factors • Known pedestrian/bicyclist crossing activity especially in dark or night time conditions • Proximity to adjacent enhanced crossings • Proximity to transit stops, trails/shared-use paths, or other pedestrian/bicyclist generators (employment centers, schools, parks, restaurants, bars, businesses, health services, etc.) • Land use context and future land use changes, growth, or development patterns • Demographics of the population within the walk shed of the location. Give special consideration in communities where there are higher numbers of people over 65, people with disabilities, and areas of lower income. • Pedestrian/bicyclist delay or suitability of gaps • Walking desire lines or biking patterns • Consistency with state or local agency plans that include the location as a part of their pedestrian/bicycle network
H.
Safety Data Discussion
Pedestrian crash data are the most commonly used statistic for evaluating safety. However, the frequency and accuracy of pedestrian and bicyclist crash data are generally low and research has found that crashes are underreported. Therefore using crash data as the sole method by which crossings are evaluated is not usually practical. Surrogates for crash data include roadway speeds, number of lanes, vehicle volumes, population density, and population demographics such as age and ethnicity. The Level of Traffic Stress developed for the Active Transportation Plan can serve as a proxy in the absence of crash data.3 FHWA guidance on determination and use of pedestrian risk factors can be found in the following

Determine pedestrian crossing needs or countermeasures
This step of the engineering study is to evaluate the crossing based on the roadway and traffic characteristics. These characteristics relate to the FHWA guidance found in Exhibit 4-2 and 4-3. Characteristics to consider include: Traffic volumes, posted speed, number of lanes (total and number that would need to be crossed consecutively without an intermediate pedestrian refuge), presence of median, motorist and pedestrian sight distance, proximity to nearby enhanced crossings, ADA compliance of existing features, illumination, and presence of on-street parking.
K.
Identify Countermeasures Options - FHWA Pedestrian Crossing
Treatment Guide4
Once the need for a pedestrian crossing is established and the location is identified, the next step is to select the crossing treatment. This section presents countermeasures FHWA suggests to consider for various roadway conditions. Exhibit 4-2 is a baseline guide for evaluating countermeasure options for roadway conditions such as vehicle volumes, speeds, and roadway configuration. Each matrix cell indicates possibilities that may be appropriate for designated pedestrian crossings. In all cases, the countermeasures, when implemented, should follow MUTCD and other relevant AASHTO, FHWA and state policies. Follow department policy and guidance if conflicts arise with use of this table. See Section 4-6.3 for supplemental RRFB guidance.
Changes made for speed management to minimize serious-injury and fatal collisions by reducing posted and operation speeds will change crossing conditions and control measures. 4

Safety at Uncontrolled Locations, 2017 and WSDOT’s Action Plan for Implementing
Pedestrian Crossings Countermeasures at Uncontrolled Locations.

M. Using Multiple Countermeasures
Exhibit 4-2 provides baseline countermeasure considerations for various roadway conditions. Not all of the countermeasures listed in the matrix cell should necessarily be installed at a crossing. WSDOT staff should also review crossing characteristics discussed in Exhibit 4-3, the surrounding land development context, pedestrian travel patterns, and countermeasure effectiveness when considering what countermeasure(s) are best suited for the crossing. Apply practical solutions approach to determining appropriate treatments within the context of the project or program.

Multi-lane and high volume roads
At multi-lane roadway crossings where vehicle daily traffic volumes are in excess of 10,000 vehicles, a marked crosswalk alone is typically not sufficient.5 Under such conditions, more crossing improvements are also needed to reduce pedestrian crash potential. Examples of more substantial treatments include a refuge islands, a pedestrian signal, and RRFB (rectangular rapid flashing beacon). Refer to the symbols used in Exhibit 4-1 for when a marked crosswalk should be paired with one or more of the other countermeasures described. Advance stop lines and “Stop Here for Pedestrian” signs shall be used in advance of all crosswalks with more than two or more through lanes in one direction. See MUTCD 3B.16 for guidance and IS-23 for additional Pedestrian Crossing Details.

Existing Crossings
Improving existing crossings that are not part of a new construction and alternations can be challenging for many reasons such as the natural or built environment, funding, and resource availability. The goal is to reduce the potential for, and the severity of crashes while also using the Department’s limited resources strategically. For example, Exhibit 4-2 does not suggest considering Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFB) for three lane (1 lane in each direction with a two-way left-turn lane) roadways without medians, traffic volumes over 15,000 ADT, and speeds in excess of 35 mph. If the crosswalk will remain in place a
RRFB does improve conspicuity so it still may be a practical solution until such time the roadway is reconstructed or additional funding is secured.
Q.
Increasing conspicuity of crossing
To further increase visibility of pedestrian crossings, consider integrating multiple countermeasures or enhancing existing ones. Examples include: • Doubling up signs (left and right) or adding retro-reflective strips to sign posts can enhance existing measures. • RRFB are often installed in conjunction with advance stop markings and signs. • Road diets or pavement reallocation present opportunities for adding pedestrian refuge islands and curb extensions at key crossing locations. Consider roadway geometry and the MUTCD when integrating multiple countermeasures. 5

Pedestrian and Bicycle Beacons on State Highways
Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacons
At some uncontrolled crossings, particularly those with four or more lanes, and posted speeds above 25 mph it can be difficult to achieve compliance with laws that require drivers to yield to pedestrians. One type of device proven to be successful in improving driver yielding compliance at crossings is the rectangular rapid flash beacon (RRFB). RRFBs are a pedestrian crossing sign combined with an intense and rapid flashing beacon that is only activated when a pedestrian is starts it. Unlike pedestrian signals or hybrid beacons, these devices provide immediate service to pedestrians meaning there is little or no wait times.
Studies indicate that pedestrians can become impatient when experiencing delays.6
RRFBs are considerably less expensive to install than mast-arm mounted pedestrian signals and are considered a practical crosswalk improvement solution. They can also be installed with solar-power panels to eliminate the need for a power source. RRFBs should be consistent with the WSDOT standard plan sheet library for Rectangular Rapid Flashing
Beacon (RRFB) Details & Pedestrian Crossing Details (IS-22 & IS-23). They are usually implemented at high-volume pedestrian crossings, but may also be considered for school crossings, priority bicycle route crossings or locations where bike facilities/trails cross roads at mid-block locations. RRFBs must be in accordance with FHWA’s Interim Approval (IA-21), issued on March 20, 2018. WSDOT has already resubmitted, and received approval from
FHWA, to use the RRFB.
Exhibit 4-4 below describes the conditions under which RRFBs, alternate beacons, and advance beacons should be used. Installation on roadways with a posted speed greater than
40 mph requires a crossing study with approval from the Region Traffic Engineer. At any location type marked as “Optional” or “Not required”, RRFB’s or other pedestrian beacons may be installed by the local jurisdiction, but the local jurisdiction is responsible for all costs and materials for installation, maintenance, and repairs. A crossing study by WSDOT is not required for systems installed by the local jurisdiction.

Pedestrian & Bicycle Beacon Placement
The locations of the primary and advance beacons varies with the configuration of the roadway. Beacons shall be placed as shown in the IS-23 details (available on the IS-22 web page at www.wsdot.wa.gov/Design/Standards/PlanSheet/IS-22.htm.
Where Advance Circular Beacons are installed due to crosswalk sight distance, they shall operate continuously. All other advance beacons shall be pedestrian activated with the beacons at the crossing.
If advance circular beacons are used, then use a minimum 8-inch displays for roadways with a posted speed limit of 35 MPH or less and 12-inch displays for roadways with a posted speed limit of 40 MPH or higher. Exhibit 4-5 provides guidance on where to place beacons based upon roadway lane configuration.

Roadway Bicycle Facilities
WSDOT is the steward of a multimodal transportation system and this system includes facilities for bicyclists and users of mobility assistive devices and encourages bicycle use on and interconnecting with its facilities. Bicycle facilities or improvements for bicycle transportation are included in WSDOT’s project development and highway programming processes.7 When choosing the bicycle facility keep in mind that lower stress facilities attract more users, in particular the “interested but concerned” potential users because bicycle facilities decrease exposure to moving motor vehicle traffic.
Designing for current, confident riders does less to support mode shift than designing for people of all ages and abilities. 7

Urban Context
Generally, the higher the speed and volume of a road, the more protected or separated the recommended bikeway will be. Shared lanes or bicycle boulevards are recommended for the lowest speeds and volumes; bike lanes for low speeds and low to moderate volumes; and separated bike lanes or shared use paths for moderate to high speeds and high volumes.8
