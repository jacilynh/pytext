eport of BST Operations (DOT Form 422-644) shall be completed by the Project Inspector at the end of each day’s work, showing type of work, areas treated, quantities used, etc. This report shall be submitted in duplicate for the Project Engineer and Region. Records of quantities of emulsified asphalt and aggregate used shall be kept in the Inspector’s Daily Report, and shall be checked daily against quantities shown on tickets issued to the Contractor. Accurate, neat records are invaluable to the Project Engineer in preparing estimates and final records. See Section 10-2 for instructions concerning quality control procedures. The Project Inspector shall include all pertinent information concerning each day’s Work in the Inspector’s Daily Report.

Inspection of Contractor’s Equipment – Prior to construction of the bituminous surface, inspect the Contractor’s equipment. Check to see that all required equipment is available, in good condition, and is properly adjusted. Carefully check the asphalt distributor to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Specifications. Verify the capacity of the distributor, and ensure that the volume gauge is calibrated to correctly indicate quantities in the tank. Special attention should be given to the condition and adjustments of the asphalt pump, spray bar and spray nozzles. The nozzles should be set uniformly at the proper angle from the axis of the spray bar, normally 15 to 30 degrees, to eliminate interference of the sprayed material from one nozzle with that from an adjoining nozzle. Each nozzle should be set at the same angle. The height of the spray bar must be checked to see that the correct overlap of the spray from each nozzle is obtained. This can be accomplished by plugging alternate nozzles and adjusting the height of the spray bar until the edges of the spray fans from the unplugged nozzles just meet at the roadway surface. When all nozzles are spraying, an exact coverage of emulsified asphalt will be obtained, resulting in an application of emulsified asphalt free from longitudinal streaking. The asphalt pump must be checked to ensure that the manufacturer’s required pressure can be maintained uniformly. The Project Inspector must check the motor patrol graders, rollers, spreader boxes, etc., to ensure that they are in good operating condition, and that the motor patrols are equipped with the required moldboard brooms. Determine the capacity of hauling trucks and water tanks from measurements obtained on the job, and record the results for future reference. SS 5-02.3(2) Preparation Of Roadway Surface SS 5-02.3(2)A New Construction The roadway surface shall be shaped and compacted to a smooth, uniform grade and cross-section before application of the emulsified asphalt. If possible when setting grade, do not place stakes, hubs, etc. in the roadway, as this may cause faults in the finished surface. If stakes or hubs must be placed in the roadway in order to set the grade, these stakes or hubs must be removed and the void filled and compacted prior to placement of the surface treatment. No traffic will be allowed on the prepared surface until the first application of asphalt emulsion and aggregate is applied. It is essential that the grading of the surfacing material be uniform over the area to be treated to allow uniform penetration of the emulsified asphalt. This is different work than that associated with shaping and compacting of crushed surfacing as required in Standard Specifications Section 4-04.3(5). The quality and smoothness of the finished roadway depends to a great extent on the quality of the work done in preparing the roadway. Careful inspection during this operation will lay the groundwork for a smooth riding and uniform appearing finished project. In many instances, the surfacing course upon which the bituminous surface treatment is to be placed will be segregated, rutted and pot-holed by traffic using the roadway prior to oiling. Such a surface must be completely processed to the depth of the ruts or potholes, and re-laid. Do not allow the Contractor to merely lightly blade the surfacing course, filling the holes with loose, segregated material. Such procedures are sure to result in a rough uneven pavement, due to differential compaction and penetration. Page 5-8

Chapter 5
Do not allow the Contractor to merely lightly blade the surfacing course, filling the holes with loose, segregated material. Such procedures are sure to result in a rough and uneven pavement, due to differential compaction and penetration. The surfacing must be damp, bladed, and thoroughly rolled to obtain a dense, unyielding base for the bituminous surface treatment. If additional water is required, it shall be applied in the amount and at the locations designated by the Project Inspector. The final coverage must be with a steel-wheeled roller to produce a smooth surface upon which to apply the first application of emulsified asphalt. The blading and rolling of the surfacing shall be coordinated so the emulsified asphalt will be applied while the surfacing material is still damp. If the surfacing material compacts to a very tight surface, the emulsified asphalt will not penetrate as much as if the material is more open. If this is the case, the Project Inspector should ensure that the top coat of emulsified asphalt is not applied too heavy. SS 5-02.3(2)B
Seal Coats
• New Construction – The surfacing needs to be dampened, trimmed, and rolled to provide a uniform grade and cross section according to the plans. Surface soft spots need to be excavated and repaired with the same type of surfacing material. The amount of water applied needs to be the optimum amount necessary to tighten the surfacing enough to minimize its porosity and absorption of the first application of emulsified asphalt. Traffic should not be allowed on the prepared finished surfacing.
• Existing Roadway – Prior to the first application of emulsified asphalt, the Project Inspector shall ensure that the existing surface is broomed clean and that holes and breaks are patched as required. Inspect the existing surface carefully over the length of the job, noting the surface characteristics of the roadway, so that the rate of application of emulsified asphalt best suited to the conditions can be determined. Document varying conditions and plan to vary the application of emulsified asphalt accordingly. Areas of the roadway showing failure caused by soft Subgrade or poor drainage must be removed to correct the cause of the failure. Open or porous paved surfaces, particularly on recently constructed bituminous pavements found in the area to be treated, the Project Inspector shall require the application of a fog seal to be applied before construction of the seal coat. If fog seal is not shown on the Plans, inform the Project Engineer so that a supplemental agreement may be reached with the Contractor. The Project Inspector is responsible to see that a newly constructed bituminous surface be allowed the required time for curing before allowing construction of the seal coat over the affected area. SS 5-02.3(3) Application of Emulsified Asphalt and Aggregate The Project Inspector shall require that the Contractor provide a minimum 1,000-foot test strip to verify that the Contractor’s equipment is functioning according to specification. Building paper shall be placed at the joint, each time the distributor starts, in a manner that assures a uniform asphalt emulsion spread across the area of the joint.

Page 5-9
Chapter 5
Surface Treatments and Pavements
During the application of the emulsified asphalt, maintain a close inspection of the roadway to see that the emulsified asphalt is applied in a uniform manner. Longitudinal joints will be allowed only at the centerline of the roadway, the center of the driving lanes, or the edge of the driving lanes. If evidence of improper application is apparent, the operation must be stopped to make required corrections. Check to see that the asphalt pump pressure and the speed of the distributor are maintained at uniform rates to ensure even application of the emulsified asphalt. A record shall be made of each distributor load applied, showing area treated, gallons spread, temperature of emulsified asphalt, etc. The Project Inspector should compute the yield of each spread in gallons per square yard depending on diluted or undiluted emulsified asphalt. Part of the first application of emulsified asphalt applied to the surfacing penetrates the material and the rest remains on the surface and surrounds the aggregate. Constant checking is necessary to ensure that enough emulsified asphalt is applied to fill the voids and adhere to the aggregate. Conditions may change during the day due to weather or the preparation crew’s efforts to stay ahead of the oiling crew. Some bleed can be tolerated on the first application as it can be corrected on the second application if uniform in nature. The final mat will be thicker and better if the optimum amount of emulsified asphalt is used, without excessive bleed, on the first application. Stockpiled aggregate shall be inspected to ensure that the grading of the material meets specification, and to verify that it is damp at the time of loading onto trucks for hauling to the roadway. If dry or dusty, the material in the stockpile must be watered to produce a damp surface condition. The emulsified asphalt does not readily coat a dry dusty surface. During warm weather, the moisture on the surface of the aggregate will quickly evaporate after the aggregate is spread and the emulsified asphalt is applied to the roadway. The Project Inspector must frequently check the truckloads of aggregate at the point of delivery, to verify that the trucks are completely loaded and that the material is damp. Tickets shall be issued for each load of material received or a receiving report record made as the loads of material are received. A record shall be made of the quantities of material used on each section. Following the application of emulsified asphalt, the Project Inspector is responsible for ensuring that the aggregate is applied in accordance with the specifications. The aggregate needs to be applied at the correct rate within the allotted time limit. The roadway shall be inspected for signs of skips or omissions in the application of the aggregate. Any omissions shall be immediately covered by re-spreading with the chip spreader or by hand-spotting methods. Do not allow excessive amounts of aggregate to be applied, as this will result in waste of the material and require harmful excessive brooming. Careful inspection and control of the rolling operation must be made to ensure that the requirements of the specifications are met. It is important that rolling be conducted as soon as possible following application of the aggregate in order to properly imbed the aggregate in the asphalt. Adequate rollers must be present to provide complete coverage without excessive speeding and abrupt starting/stopping motions. Chips are broomed once the emulsified asphalt cures enough to adhere the chips to the roadway. Brooming is necessary to prevent wheel tracking promoted by loose Page 5-10
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

Chapter 5
aggregate on the roadway. Areas of severe bleeding will need to be blotted with ¼-inch material during the cure period. Emulsified asphalts do not really cure except for water evaporation when they break. The constructed area will be tender, although probably ready for the next construction step. When the asphalt has set, adhesion has developed and the chances of bleeding are remote. The excess aggregate on the edge of the roadway shall be broomed off as it is a hazard to traffic and reduces the usable width of the roadway. SS 5-02.3(5) Application of Aggregates Construction of Seal Coat When constructing a seal coat, the emulsified asphalt thickness is critical to ensure the layer of aggregate placed on the emulsified asphalt is covered appropriately. Constant checking is required to ensure that embedment of the major stone in the asphalt is 50 to 70 percent. When ½-inch to No. 4 chips are used on routes with moderate traffic volumes, choke stone may be used either ahead of or immediately behind the main rollers. Some bleed is inevitable at intersections, on steep hills, and at severe horizontal or vertical curves. This is preferable to losing rock on long sections in between, due to insufficient emulsified asphalt being placed. Continuously inspect the aggregate application on the freshly spread emulsified asphalt, to ensure that the material is placed within the time allotted, to ensure the spread of emulsified asphalt is not extended beyond the area which the Contractor can cover. Omissions or skips in the spreading of aggregates must be immediately covered by re‑spreading with the chip spreader or by the hand spotting crew. The best seal coats are obtained on those jobs where the time elapsed between spreading of asphalt and application of aggregates is held to the time allotted. The Project Inspector must ensure that the rolling operation is not allowed to lag far behind the spreading of aggregates. It is important that the aggregate be rolled into the asphalt film as soon as possible following application. Spreading Choke Stone – When constructing Bituminous Surface Treatment Seal Coats, the specifications may require application of choke stone following the spreading and rolling of the coarse aggregates. The Project Inspector must exercise judgment in determining the time for applying the choke stone. When using emulsified asphalt, the choke stone should be applied immediately, sometimes even before initial rolling. Choke stone, applied at the proper time, will key the gaps between the particles of coarse aggregate and provide a smoother riding surface, as well as absorb any free asphalt which might bleed to the surface of the coarse particles. By observing conditions and results carefully, the experienced inspector will determine the procedure which produces the best results under any particular condition.

Surface Treatments and Pavements
If the sealed roadway is rained on before the asphalt has cured and the asphalt starts to emulsify under the traffic, the roadway can usually be saved from damage by applying choke stone on the roadway to prevent the traffic from picking up the asphalt. Refer to the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC plan) for guidance on using Best Management Practices (BMPs) to protect the environment. SS 5-02.3(9) Protection of Structures When spreading emulsified asphalt or aggregate near curbs, bridge rails, drainage inlets, monument covers or other structures, adequate protection must be provided to prevent damage to the structures. The Project Inspector shall see that any emulsified asphalt sprayed, or aggregate spread, on or in a structure is satisfactorily removed by the Contractor.

Crack and Joint Sealing
GEN 5-03.1
General Instructions Crack sealing is one of the most cost-effective methods of pavement preservation. Joint sealing is required anywhere there is a joint including between different surface types, at bridge ends, and between PCCP panels. Joint sealing helps restrict the infiltration of water into the Subgrade and prevents incompressible material from entering the joint causing spalling when the joint closes up during warmer conditions. The Project Inspector should ensure the proper material has been selected for the application. For bituminous pavements the material msut follow the selection table in SS 5-03.3(2)A. Material selection depends on whether the sealant is used in a crack or a joint. Furthermore, if sealing cracks, there are different materials depending on the size of the crack and if there will be any additional surfacing materials placed over the crack after sealing. Placing Hot Mix Asphalt over the top of a crack sealed with Hot Poured Sealant can cause bumps. Different types of crack and joint sealant material are required for use with Cement Concrete Pavements; see SS 9-04.2. A properly constructed crack or joint seal will adhere to the sides of the crack or joint and flex with the thermal expansion and contraction of the pavement. To ensure proper adhesion the crack or joint will be properly prepared in accordance with SS 5-03.3(1)B and the Work should be done under the proper weather conditions, see SS 5-03.3(1)A. Review the Standard Specifications and manufacturer’s installation instructions to identify any additional weather or preparation requirements specific to the material being used and the type of pavement being sealed, and the handling, heating, and storage requirements. When filling cracks or joints the Project Inspector should be aware that in some situations the sealant may settle requiring the Contractor to return to top off the sealant material. The sealant material should also be confined to the crack or joint minimizing any sealant on the pavement surface. Hot Applied Joint Sealants often remain tacky after placement. When the cool tires roll over the hot HMA mix, the mix tends to stick to the tires, and is “picked” up from the mat on to the tires. Project Inspectors should watch for picking when the pavement is opened to traffic.

Hot Mix Asphalt
GEN 5-04.1
General Instructions The technology of asphalt materials and mixes is continuously changing, and this in turn drives changes to the Contract Specifications. It is imperative to study Contract documents and Specifications prior to the start of any paving Contract. There also are many excellent handbooks that can be obtained to assist paving Inspectors and testers. It is recommended that the Project Engineer obtain copies of these handbooks as a resource for their office. Recommended books include “Hot Mix Asphalt Materials, Mixture Design and Construction” by the National Center for Asphalt Technology and “Construction of Hot Mix Asphalt Pavements (MS-22)” by the Asphalt Institute. Good work and a successfully completed job depend on good equipment, skillful operation of the equipment, competent, knowledgeable supervision and inspection, and open lines of communications. Maintaining open lines of communication through informal daily meetings between the Inspector and Contractor can greatly improve the success of any job. Hot mix asphalt (HMA) projects are not always built as originally scheduled. Changes may occur because of problems with material supply, equipment breakdown, Contractor and Subcontractor schedules, and weather conditions. Informal meetings on a regular basis provide a forum for the exchange of information and discussion of problems. To begin the communication process a prepaving meeting is recommended. The Project Engineer, paving Inspectors and testers together with the paving superintendents and paving foremen should be present to go over all activities and plan the entire operation. It is also advisable to include the Traffic Control Supervisor (TCS). The following checklist may be used as an outline for the prepaving meeting:
Prepaving Checklist 1. Review the HMA Contract requirements with the Contractor to include: a. HMA class b. Grade of asphalt binder c. Evaluation and acceptance procedures d. Mix design being approved on the QPL e. Mix design submittal for approval to use on the Contract f.
Mixture test section (HMA mixture if required or requested)
If an HMA additive that reduces the optimum mixing temperature or serves as a compaction aid for producing HMA is proposed the Contractor is required to submit the request on Form 350-076 (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.2(2)B) 2. Review procedures in Standard Specifications Section 5-04.2(2)A for modifying the job mix formula (JMF) 3. Discuss construction of HMA mixture test section (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(9)A)

Surface Treatments and Pavements
4. Discuss the communication procedure to be used for weather shut downs and other potential construction problems 5. Review what type of material transfer equipment (vehicle or device) the Contractor plans on using 6. Discuss testing for low cyclic density (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(10)B) and what to do if segregation of the mix is occurring 7. Discuss the preparation of the existing paved surfaces (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(4)) including cleaning the pavement, application of tack, pickup problems, weather limitations (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(1), crack sealing (Standard Specifications Section 5-03), and pavement repair (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(4)C) 8. Discuss aggregate sampling and testing requirements (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(8) and 3-04 9. Mixture sampling and testing: a. Who and how (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(9)), b. When (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(9)B1) c. Notification of mixture acceptance test results (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(9)E) d. Mixture acceptance pay factors (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(9)B4) e. Mixture acceptance Composite Pay Factors (CPF) (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(9)B5) f.
Mixture acceptance price adjustments (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(9)B6)
g. Contractor requests for mixture sublots to be retested (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(9)B7) 10. Review the requirements for the Contractor to maintain a CPF greater than 1.00 for aggregates in 3-04.3(7)D3, and for mixture and compaction in 5-04.3(11)F. The intent of these particular Specifications is to maximize the likelihood that WSDOT will receive all materials and all compaction at CPF’s and pay factors of 1.00 or greater. This requires the Paving Inspector and Contractor to evaluate the updated CPF and pay factors every time a test on aggregate, mixture, or compaction is completed. When the CPF and pay factors fall below threshold values of 1.00, 0.95, or 0.75, the Contractor must immediately take the actions described in the Specification. The need for the Contractor and Paving Inspector to be made immediately aware of the changing CPF and pay factors after each test reinforces the need for the test results to be processed into the Materials Testing System (MATS) and the Statistical Analysis of Materials program (SAM) within 24 hours. 11. Review sampling of the asphalt binder, the maximum recommended temperature for heating the asphalt binder and the maximum allowable temperature for discharge of the HMA (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(3)A item 3 and 5-04.3(6) respectively) for the type(s) of asphalt binder being used on the Contract. The Contractor will supply the information from the manufacturer of the asphalt binder. Page 5-14

12. Review the procedure and timing in obtaining density gauge correlation factors 13. Review Contract requirements for asphalt densities: a. When (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(10)C1) b. Who and how (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(10)C2 c. Notification of compaction test results (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(1)F) d. Contractor requests for cores and utilization of core results (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(10)C4) 14. Review construction of transverse joints (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(12)A), and longitudinal joints including the notched wedge joint and when/where it will be required (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(12)B) 15. Traffic control procedures and lines of communication including allowable times for lane closures 16. Other factors specific to Contract or of concern by those attending In the construction of HMA, it is extremely important that the material meets all requirements of the Specifications. It should be remembered that Specifications are not arbitrarily arrived at, but have evolved through the years as a result of experience and research. Experience has shown that pavements that do not meet all Specifications will not perform satisfactorily, resulting in high maintenance costs and reduced service life. The responsibility for obtaining a mixture in close conformance with the Contract mix design and meeting the Specification requirements rests with the Contractor. The importance of this cannot be overemphasized, since the best possible construction at the lowest cost to WSDOT cannot be obtained unless the mixture produced at the plant is uniform and of good quality. One of the key words used to describe quality production of HMA is UNIFORMITY.
• The aggregate in the stockpile must be of UNIFORM quality and gradation.
• Aggregate must be fed into the plant in a UNIFORM, controlled manner.
• The heating and drying of the aggregate must be UNIFORM.
• The separation of the aggregate in the bins must be UNIFORMLY controlled.
• The aggregates and asphalt must be combined and mixed in a UNIFORM, consistent manner. In order to achieve this uniformity, it is necessary that the entire operation be conducted so that each phase of the production operation is in balance with all other phases. To accomplish this most Contractors have a Quality Control (QC) program. With the advent of Quality Assurance (QA) Specifications and statistical evaluation of HMA, the role of inspection has evolved from one that was highly involved in the operation of the asphalt plant to one that is involved in verification that the material the Contractor produces is in conformance with the JMF and in accordance with the Specifications.

Chapter 5
Surface Treatments and Pavements
An Inspector’s Daily Report must be kept, showing all instructions received from the Project Engineer and instructions issued to the Contractor. Careful review of Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(1) concerning weather limitations and calendar cutoff dates should be made in advance of any HMA paving so the Work can be planned and completed prior to any unfavorable weather. Pavement performance is highly dependent on the weather conditions in the first weeks and months following paving. Invariably, when these Specifications are not closely adhered to, early pavement performance problems occur. Therefore, beginning October 1 of any year through March 31 of the following year, no wearing course is to be placed without written authorization of the Project Engineer. The Project Engineer will review this decision with the Region Construction Office prior to allowing any paving outside these dates. In addition, use of a pneumatic tired roller is required from October 1 through March 31 (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(10)A). It has been shown that during warmer weather, traffic will knead the HMA providing a more durable pavement. To duplicate this benefit for late season paving, use of pneumatic tired rollers is part of the Specifications. Placement of HMA less than 0.10 feet or less is not recommended for surface temperatures less than 55˚F for wearing course and 45˚F for other courses (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(1)). Heat loss in thin lifts is very quick and in most cases inadequate time is available for placement or to achieve needed compaction. A word about the writing style used in Section 5-04: For those parts of Standard Specifications 5-04 which tell the Contractor what to do, the writing style, beginning with the  Amendments, is different from the rest of the Standard Specifications. Referred to as “active voice, imperative mood”, this style is more “directive” in its tone, and has been adopted as the writing style of preference for all Contract Specifications by AASHTO and FHWA. It is used in Section 5-04 on a trial basis to see how well it is received and understood by users, including industry and Inspectors. If well enough received, it may be adopted as WSDOT’s standard style for writing Contracts.
SS 5-04.2
Materials Mix design approval involves two steps - (1) approval on the QPL, and (2) approval for use on a particular Contract.
SS 5-04.2(1) How to Get an HMA Mix Design on the QPL The process for getting a mix design approved for listing on the QPL does not involve the Project Engineer’s office. This is because the process occurs outside of any construction Contract. The HMA producer works directly with the State Materials Laboratory in all aspects of this process. Refer to SS 5-04.2(2). If the HMA producer’s proposed mix design is approved for listing on the QPL, the State Materials Laboratory will assign a mix ID number (a unique identification number) that has “MD” as its prefix. The “MD” prefix indicates the associated mix design is the original mix design approved by the State Materials Laboratory, and therefore does not include any changes to the JMF which are allowed under SS 5-04.2(2)A.
Page 5-16
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Surface Treatments and Pavements
Chapter 5
SS 5-04.2(2) Mix Design - Obtaining Project Approval The Contractor is required to use a QPL approved mix design for the HMA that meets the requirements of the Contract. After identifying the mix design it intends to use from the QPL, the Contractor submits WSDOT Form 350-041 to the Project Office. The Project Office then requests approval for using the proposed mix design on its Contract by completing an HMA mix design submittal using the MATS program. Note: It is extremely helpful to the State Materials Laboratory, when evaluating the mix design approval request, for the Project Office to make sure to convey the correct Specification year of the HMA required by the Contract. This is when the acceptance settings are first established in SAM for both mixture and compaction for that mix design on your Contract. If the Contract requires something other than an exact match of a Specification year for any of the items in the table in Construction Manual Section GEN 5-04.3(9)B3, contact the Assistant State Construction Engineer (ASCE) or the State Materials Laboratory, Bituminous Testing Engineer, at the same time the mix design approval request is submitted. The State Materials Laboratory will evaluate the mix design approval request and respond to the Project Office. If approved, the mix design prefix will change from MD to RD, indicating “reference design”. Each approved HMA mix design will be listed on the QPL for 24 consecutive months. The Contractor may propose a mix design that does not meet the Contract requirements, which would require an approved Change Order. (See the table below for information regarding HMA mix design Change Orders) Change Order Approval Process for HMA Mix Design Substitutions 1. Purpose: Consistent approvals throughout the state (HQ, Region and PEO), 2. Use correct materials to ensure performance, 3. Consistent with the cost associated with change orders, 4. Avoid unintentional precedents and potential unfair bidding advantage, 5. Involve the right people in the approval process.

HMA Mix Design Change Order Approval Process Change orders allow substitution, but do not guaranty HMA mix design approval. Questions that need to be answered before processing a change order: 1. Does the plan HMA tonnage exceed 1,000 tons? If yes, stop and do not proceed with HMA mix design substitution. 2. What Class, ESAL level (gyration) and grade of binder does the Contract require? 3. What Class, ESAL level (gyration) and grade of binder is being proposed? 4. Are there any Special Provisions that need to be considered? 5. Where is the HMA to be placed? Is it structure, leveling, repair, etc.? 6. What is the risk of using a mix design that does not meet the Contract requirements? (Pavements & Materials) 7. How much time has the Contractor had between Award and Proposal of Change Order? 8. What is the anticipated date of paving? Unacceptable Change Order Criteria: 1. A Contract that specifies a 100 gyration (> 3 mil. ESAL) asphalt mix design and a proposed change to use of a 75 gyration (< 3 mil. ESAL) mix design. 2. A Contract that specifies a PG “V” grade binder and a proposed change to use of a PG “H” grade asphalt binder. 3. Modifications to an approved QPL mix design such as increase or decrease to the binder content, require a test section, etc. 4. HMA Contract plan quantities exceed 1,000 tons. Potentially Acceptable Change Order Criteria: 1. A Contract that specifies a 75 gyration (< 3 mil. ESAL) asphalt mix design and a proposed change to use of a 100 gyration (> 3 mil. ESAL) mix design. 2. A Contract that specifies a PG “H” grade binder and a proposed change to use of a PG “V” grade asphalt binder. 3. HMA Contract plan quantity of 1,000 tons or less. Who to contact in determining if a Change Order is acceptable? 1. Project Engineer, Region Materials Engineer and HQ Construction Office; need to discuss what the Contract requires and the proposed change to the Contract? 2. Consult Pavement Design for pavement structure assessment to determine if proposed mix design is acceptable? 3. Consult Construction Materials for mixture specific details on proposed HMA mix design questions and to assist with determining if the proposed material change will meet performance and service life criteria. 4. If the answers to any questions 1 – 3 are No, or concerns are identified: The Contractor needs to use an approved mix design that meets the original Contract requirements. 5. If the answer to all the three questions above are yes: Then a Change Order could be processed to allow the alternative mix design from the QPL.

SS 5-04.2(2)A Mix Design - Making Adjustments to the JMF During HMA production it may be necessary to make adjustments to the JMF to improve workability, compactibility, and volumetric properties (Va and VMA). Standard Specifications Section 9-03.8(7) Sub-Section 2, defines the maximum adjustment allowed for aggregate and the asphalt binder content that can be approved by the Project Engineer. These adjustments can be made at the request of the Contractor and approved by the Project Engineer, provided the change will produce material of equal or better quality. The Project Engineer should consult the State Materials Laboratory or ASCE to confirm that the Contractor’s proposed JMF change will indeed provide equal or better quality, before approving the proposed change. Adjustments to aggregate gradation and asphalt binder content beyond the limits defined in Standard Specifications Section 9-03.8(7) may be allowed only with approval by the State Materials Engineer. During construction, guidance for adjustments is provided through the use and interpretation of the compaction control and mixture test results. The Contractor’s plant operator must be advised of all results of sampling and testing performed.
GEN 5-04.2
Inspector Roles and Responsibilities Testing Equipment – Before the production of HMA commences, the Inspector needs to ensure that all of the equipment needed to accomplish all of the test procedures has been obtained. In addition, qualified testers using calibrated or verified equipment are required. The Inspector needs to make sure that this equipment is in good working order and has a current calibrated or verified sticker on it, and that all tester qualifications are current. The Inspector is charged with responsibility for care and safekeeping of all testing equipment that is issued. The equipment must be maintained in a clean and proper operating condition to ensure accuracy of test results. Special care must be exercised in the use and maintenance of sieves to see that they do not become clogged or damaged. Thermometers must be handled carefully to avoid breakage. Electronic scales are expensive and delicate equipment. Particular care should be taken to protect them from theft or voltage spikes. The ignition furnace is a high temperature oven, so care must be exercised in its operation and testers must be qualified in its use. Given reasonable care, HMA testing equipment will give long and satisfactory service. Required Tests – The Inspector is responsible to the Project Engineer for the required field tests as well as for submission of required samples to the State Materials Laboratory for testing. Testers must be qualified in the “Asphalt Module” or for the particular method of sampling and testing they will be performing. The QA Specifications intend for the Contractor to be totally responsible for the maintenance and operation of equipment and the production of the HMA. It is the Inspector’s role to direct the Contractor when to take samples and observe the Contractor taking the samples while the Inspector performs the tests. However, it is not possible or desirable for the Inspector to take a “hands off” approach to the production of HMA. If the Inspector notices anything at all that affects

the quality of the HMA, this information should be brought to the Contractor’s attention in a cooperative manner so the situation can be corrected. Notifying the Contractor of Test Results - Sections 5-04.3(9)E and 4-04.3(10)F of the Standard Specifications address how and when we are expected to provide the Contractor with official acceptance test results for mixture and compaction. We must do our best to get the results into SAM within 24 hours of receiving the sample from the Contractor, then the SAM program will email the test result to the Contractor if the Contractor has requested the email service. The intent of these Specifications is to be both correct and timely. The State Construction Office has no objection to providing unofficial test results to the paving Contractor as soon as the field test is complete, when so requested. When providing preliminary test results to the Contractor before they have gone through the checks and approvals of MATS and SAM, remind the paving Contractor that the results are preliminary and therefore unofficial and, when appropriate, acceptance is by statistical evaluation. The email to the Contractor mentioned above requires the Contractor to send a written request to the Project Engineer identifying the name of its designee and email address. Then, the Project Engineer’s staff input the email address of the Contractor’s designee into SAM. For questions on how to make this happen in SAM contact the IT Help Desk at the State Materials Laboratory. Furthermore, because the information input into SAM is the official basis of notification and acceptance, it is critical that the data be input correctly, checked and done in a timely manner.

Street Inspection General – In the construction of HMA pavements, it is the responsibility of the Street Inspector to see that construction methods and equipment used, as well as the finished pavement, meet the requirements of the Specifications. In order for the Street Inspector to properly discharge this responsibility, it is necessary that the Street Inspector thoroughly understand the Standard Specifications, the Special Provisions of the Contract, and the instructions set forth herein. The Street Inspector must also have a good working knowledge of methods and equipment involved in the construction of HMA pavements. A means of communication between the Street Inspector and the Plant Inspector must be established, and the Street Inspector must keep the Plant Inspector informed of any difficulties encountered in the placement or compaction of the mixture or of any faulty mixture received at the paving site. Street Inspector’s Checklist – Some of the most important details of inspection on HMA paving are listed below: 1. Check condition and adjustment of paving machines and rollers before and during operation to verify no tearing or pickup of the mat. 2. Has width of spread in successive layers been determined to ensure joints are covered? 3. See that traffic control is organized and functioning properly; make sure required signs are in place and document it.

4. Check application of tack coat and do not allow tacking of more base than will be paved each day. Be sure the pavement is swept and clean ahead of the tack application (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(5)A). The tack coat should be broken and cured prior to allowing construction traffic on it, and must be broken and cured before HMA is placed on it. Remember that proper application of tack coat is essential to long life for the pavement. 5. Examine the pavement base, and verify that all required patching and/or pre-leveling is completed. Verify the planned surfacing depths before paving begins. 6. If the paving Contractor elects to use control wires for grade control, verify they are to the correct grade and are adhered to during the paving operation (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(3)C). 7. Check transverse joints for smoothness and appearance (a straightedge should be used). 8. Watch trucks dumping into paver hopper or transfer device for adverse effect on paver operation. Ensure a material transfer vehicle (MTV) or material transfer device (MTD) is being used if required. Pay particular attention to constant uniform paver speed and minimum operation of the hopper wings. If a transfer vehicle is not used or the hopper wings are being folded, the Street Inspector should check for significant temperature differences on the paved mat prior to compaction. These temperature differences can lead to non-uniform compaction. 9. Check temperature of HMA occasionally and watch for evidence of incomplete mixing. 10. Maintain constant inspection of the mat behind the paver for signs of roughness or non‑uniformity of mixture. 11. Ensure the longitudinal joints are raked and compacted properly. The Contractor should be doing minimal handwork with a rake and should only “bump” the material at the joint and stay away from “raking” the material. 12. Make frequent checks of yield and depth. 13. Watch the rolling operation and verify that the rollers are operated in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(4)). See that nuclear density readings are maintained. Check the internal temperature of mix to verify that static rolling is used when the mat temperature is below 175°F. 14. Keep a record of truckloads used each day. 15. Make sure the job is in good shape and safe for traffic before you leave at the end of the day, that the transverse night joint is properly constructed (Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(12)A1), and that any excess paper is trimmed from the transverse night joint.

Surface Treatments and Pavements
Duties Before Paving Begins The Street Inspector is a key participant in the prepaving meeting and typically oversees all aspects of the operation at the jobsite. The Street Inspector should be knowledgeable as to the project limits, hours of operations, the direction in which paving is to proceed, methods of performing any unusual features of work peculiar to the project, proposed traffic control methods, etc. The plan of operation agreed upon at the prepaving meeting should be followed faithfully whenever possible. Traffic Control – The Contractor shall conform to the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 1-10. The Project Engineer and the responsible Inspector must work closely with the Regional Traffic Engineer and the Contractor to ensure that the proper signs are placed in the best possible manner. All applicable signs shall be installed on the job before paving begins. Inspection Tools – Before paving work begins, the Street Inspector must verify that all tools and equipment necessary for the inspection work are available. These would include such things as surface and probe thermometers, tape measure, depth gauge, 10-foot straightedge, notebooks, Inspector’s Daily Report, report forms, etc. Inspection of Paving Equipment – It is the duty of the Street Inspector to inspect the Contractor’s paving equipment to verify the equipment meets the Contract Specifications. For the best possible surface finish, it is essential that all machines are in good condition and all parts are in proper adjustment. All equipment, including trucks, should be observed for hydraulic and fuel leaks when systems are under pressure. If leaks are detected, notify the Contractor immediately to clean up the leaks and repair or remove the equipment creating the leaks. Listed below are some of the most important details the Street Inspector should check during the inspection of paving equipment: (a) Paving Machines – Several types and makes of paving machines are in use in this State, all of which are capable of producing satisfactory surface finishes. The differences between types of paving machines are primarily in the methods used in striking off, compacting, and smoothing the mixture. The Street Inspector should be familiar with the mechanical features of the type of paver to be used on each job. Handbooks of operating instructions are available from each manufacturer, in which the various adjustments and operating details are shown. The Street Inspector can obtain copies of these instructions from the Contractor or the manufacturer if needed. The requirements for paving machines are in Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(3). Ask the Contractor to explain the operation of the attachment intended to construct the notched wedge joint. The Street Inspector must be familiar with these Specifications. Extensions may be added to the paving machine to allow the Contractor to pave a wider section. When the extensions are used in the traveled way they are required to have augers and screeds that vibrate and are heated. Most paving machines will be equipped with automatic screed extensions. On all track paving machines, correct adjustment of the track linkage is essential for smooth operation. A poorly adjusted track, or a badly worn one, can produce an uneven, lurching movement in the travel of the machine which will be reflected in Page 5-22
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Surface Treatments and Pavements
Chapter 5
an uneven, “choppy” pavement surface. Observation of the machine in motion will usually show up any defects in the track or drive mechanisms. Some pavers are suspended on rubber-tired wheels. For proper operation of this type of paving machines all tires must be inflated to the correct pressure and the drive system must not have any slack. The paving machine is required to be equipped with the most current equipment available for the prevention of segregation and the Contractor is required to provide a certification, upon the Street Inspector’s request, that it is properly equipped. (b) Rollers – The proper operation of the roller is a key factor in quality pavement. When done properly the HMA will be compacted to a dense uniform mat free of defects. Improper operation produces a poor quality mat that may include tears, roughness and low or uneven compaction. All of these will result in a reduced life of the HMA and increased long term cost to WSDOT. The Street Inspector should be especially watchful for flat spots on the drums of steel rollers. The steering and driving mechanisms must be free of excessive play or backlash. Observation of the roller in motion and reversing direction will disclose any deficiencies in the drive and clutch mechanisms. The manufacturer of the roller provides the maximum rate of travel. Pneumatic-tired rollers, to function properly, must have tires of equal size and in good condition. All tires must be equally inflated, so that all exert equal unit pressure on the pavement. Tire pressures may be varied to suit conditions on the job, but, in general, should be such that ground contact pressures range between 40 and 80 psi. The Street Inspector should observe the roller in motion to see that all wheels are rolling true, without wobble or creep. Pneumatic tired rollers should have full skirts as the tires must be warm to prevent “picking.” (When the cool tires roll over the hot HMA mix, the mix tends to stick to the tires, and is “picked” up from the mat onto the tires.) Current vibratory rollers are capable of operating in three modes: static, vibratory, and oscillating. In static mode, the only movement of the drum is rolling on the pavement. In vibratory mode, eccentric cams inside the drums add rapid movement of the drum that is primarily up and down. In oscillatory mode, eccentric cams inside the drums add rapid movement of the drums that is primarily forward and back. An individual drum can operate in only one mode at a time but it is possible for a roller to operate the front drum in a different mode from the back. Compaction on a bridge deck is allowed with drums in either static mode or oscillatory mode – vibratory is not allowed. The Street Inspector cannot see the difference between vibratory and oscillatory by looking at the drum because the movement is too rapid. The only way to tell whether a drum is vibrating or oscillating is to learn how to read the control panel by discussing it with the roller operator. Each roller manufacturer has a different control panel. A pre-pave meeting is the ideal time for the Street Inspector to view the controls and discuss how to best ensure oscillation or static mode on bridge decks. (c) Other Items – The Street Inspector should be satisfied that the Contractor is properly equipped with portable barricades, cones, or other means of protecting the freshly laid pavement from damage by traffic.

Chapter 5
Surface Treatments and Pavements
Upon completion of the check of the paving equipment, the Street Inspector should call any deficiencies of equipment to the attention of the Contractor, so that correction can be made. Preleveling – The Project Engineer must give careful consideration to the use of a preleveling course over areas of unusual roughness, wheel ruts, or sags in the profile of the pavement base. The Contractor should be given as much advance notice as is possible of the intent to place a preleveling course. The areas that need prelevel should be marked out and reviewed with the Contractor prior to the pre-pave meeting. The extent of prelevel and the methods to be used should be discussed at the pre-pave meeting. There are several methods the Contractor is allowed to use for preleveling. One method is the use of a motor grader. A paving machine may be used if better results can be obtained by this method and particularly where long undulations occur. When conditions warrant, a reference line may be erected for preleveling and an electronic paving machine reference should be used for placement of subsequent pavement courses. Ruts can be economically preleveled by dragging a paver screed if the Contractor elects to use this method. In order to outline areas and amount of preleveling, the Contractor may elect to erect a single reference line along the crown point for the first pass. The practice of directly marking depths and limits of preleveling required on the pavement surface is considered beneficial. When the area is small or irregular the Contractor may choose to use hand methods to prelevel. The nominal compacted depth of any layer of any course, including preleveling lifts, shall not exceed the depths outlined in the Standard Specifications for the class of mix being used. The purpose of this requirement is to reduce the differential compaction that takes place and to ensure adequate compaction of thick lifts between two humps. Compaction of pre-level should be accomplished with a pneumatic roller. When preleveling wheel ruts, a pneumatic tire roller is required. To produce a satisfactory riding surface, preleveling, in theory, should continue regardless of plan quantities until a uniform lift of HMA can be placed by paving machines with the electronic reference. If it appears that the plan quantity of prelevel must be exceeded due to the condition of the existing pavement, the situation should be immediately brought to the attention of the Project Engineer and the Region Construction staff. The Project Engineer must take care to clearly distinguish between preleveling operations and paving operations, especially for lifts under wearing courses. Duties During Paving Operations Prior to beginning of paving work each day the Street Inspector must verify that grade control lines, if used, are set for the day’s work, that the base is properly prepared, and that tack coat has been adequately and uniformly applied through the area (including vertical edges) to be paved during the day. It is not a good practice to apply tack coat over more area than can be paved in a day or an hour or two if the weather appears to be questionable. Traffic conditions may also dictate how far the tack coat should be placed ahead of the paving operation.

Chapter 5
Miscellaneous Duties of the Street Inspector Prior to placing HMA against gutters, curbs, cold pavement joints, manhole castings, etc., the Street Inspector must verify that all contact surfaces are painted with an accepted tack coat. A detailed Inspector’s Daily Report (DOT Form 422-004, 422-004A, and 422-004B) will be kept by the Street Inspector, noting all unusual occurrences, orders received from the Project Engineer, orders issued to the Contractor, and other pertinent information. The Hot Mix Asphalt Compaction Report (DOT Form 350-092) must be prepared by the Density Inspector. Multiple Asphalt Plants When two or more asphalt plants are used on one project, the mix from each plant must be placed with separate paving machines and compaction equipment. This is necessary because of the required adjustments on each paving operation to accommodate the different mixes and the various rolling patterns that may be necessary.
GEN 5-04.4
How to ... Compute Yield – During the paving operation, a careful record shall be kept, showing truckloads, the weight of each truckload and other pertinent data. Periodically, the Street Inspector is required to compute the quantity of mix placed per square yard, and must compare the yield against the proposed quantities. Overruns or underruns in quantities may be avoided by making a constant check of quantities placed. HMA pavements are designed on a weight/volume relationship of 137 pounds for one square yard of pavement at a compacted depth of 0.10 feet. It is the intention in the construction of the pavement to spread the mixture according to an average yield in pounds per square yard. Remember that the minimum compacted depth of pavement must also be met. If the aggregates are heavier than anticipated when the quantities were computed, or if the surface that the pavement is being constructed on is not true, the average yield can be attained without meeting the minimum thickness requirement. Weigh tickets must be collected and a daily total weight of mixture received will be obtained and entered on the daily report for submission to the Project Engineer. To eliminate possible errors, totals as recorded by the Plant Inspector shall be compared against the total obtained by the Street Inspector. Careful attention given to those details may save argument with the Contractor concerning pay quantities. Determining Minimum Lift Thickness – On occasion, the thickness of an individual lift of HMA is not specifically indicated on the roadway sections, or a Contractor requests permission to place the HMA in more than one lift. Although maximum lift thickness is specified in the Standard Specifications, there is no guidance as to the minimum. Lift thickness is governed by aggregate size. Adequate lift thickness ensures proper aggregate alignment during compaction, so that density and an impermeable mat can be achieved. Lifts placed too thin can lead to aggregate segregation, tearing, and more rapid cooling of the mat. It is generally more difficult to achieve proper density and pavement

SS 5-04.3(3)A Mixing Plant Plant Inspector’s Checklist – Some of the most important details of inspection on asphalt plants are listed below: 1. Verify that testing tools, equipment, and samples are on hand at the plant site and in good condition. Make sure you understand all of the required tests. 2. Inspect all components of the asphalt plant listed in the Standard Specifications, and make sure all deficiencies are corrected before production has begun. 3. Verify that the truck scales are currently certified in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-09. 4. Post mix designs, including all revisions to the JMF. When a reference mix design is accepted the Inspector should verify if any changes to the mix design were accepted on another Contract. 7. Watch for evidence (dark smoke from plant exhaust and oily coating of aggregate) of incomplete combustion of burner fuel. 8. Check frequently the temperature of the asphalt. 9. Observe plant operation occasionally to verify that correct weights and proportions are obtained, including asphalt content and recycled asphalt pavement (RAP). 10. Make frequent visual inspections of mix leaving the plant for evidence of nonuniformity or incomplete mixing. 11. Check temperature of mix frequently. The mix design has the temperature requirements. An infrared heat gun may be used. 12. Inspect truck beds before loading and verify that the bed is free of congealed chunks of mix and excess release agent. 13. Observe the Contractor taking samples of aggregate before mixing with asphalt, and HMA mixture, for acceptance testing and submission to the laboratory. 14. Make accurate, complete record of all test results, asphalt used, and other pertinent data. 15. Have copies of all test reports available for review.

16. Fill out the required daily reports. 17. Keep in constant communication with the plant foreman and the Street Inspector and give immediate notification regarding any problems. Acceptance Testing – On all projects involving HMA, job site samples shall be obtained, tested, and recorded in accordance with the Standard Specifications, the Contract Special Provisions, and Chapter 9 of this manual. A split of the field sample will be retained by the field tester for further testing if necessary. This sample may be used when the Contractor requests a sublot be retested in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(9) B7. Asphalt content of the mix shall be determined by use of the Ignition Furnace in accordance with WAQTC FOP for AASHTO T 308, gradation determined in accordance with WAQTC FOP for AASHTO T 30, and voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) and air voids (Va) in accordance with WSDOT SOP 731. Samples Required by Materials Laboratory – Mix design “conformation samples” are not used for acceptance so they impose no liability risk to the Contractor. Conformation samples are samples that shall be submitted to the State Materials Laboratory Bituminous Materials Section. For all projects, beginning with the first acceptance sample, submit one sample (two representative quarters) every 10,000 mix tons (one conformation sample for every ten acceptance samples). The conformation samples should be taken in conjunction with and be representative quarters of the acceptance samples taken for the project as described in WSDOT Test Method 712. When taking a sample for mix design conformation testing, a sufficient quantity of the mix should be obtained so that two representative quarters of the same sample are submitted to the State Materials Laboratory. Samples shall be taken as provided in Chapter 9. Sampling Methods – Samples of the complete asphalt mixture should be taken by the Contractor, at the request of and in the presence of the Plant Inspector, in accordance with WAQTC FOP for AASHTO R 97. Acceptable locations are either by mechanical sampler between the discharge of the silo and the haul truck if approved by the Regional Materials Engineer, or from the truck without entering the truck. The Plant Inspector should then reduce the sample to size for testing in accordance with WAQTC FOP for AASHTO R 47. Remember that the value of material quality testing is dependent on exact parallel tests of identical splits from representative samples. Verification of the Ignition Furnace Calibration Factor – The State Materials Laboratory prepares 12 ignition furnace calibration samples for every HMA mix design. Four samples are shipped to each Region along with the reference HMA mix design so they can calibrate their ignition furnace. The “Ignition Furnace Calibration Factor” shall be determined in accordance with WSDOT SOP 728 and should be done prior to beginning the production of any paving mixture using initial mix design. The verification shall be done using the furnace that will be used for acceptance testing. In some circumstances it may be necessary to use production data to verify acceptance results but should be only utilized when all verification procedures have been used and validated.

Surface Treatments and Pavements
Inspection of Mixing Plant Plant Inspectors should familiarize themselves with plant operations prior to beginning of paving. A visit to the plant will do this and additionally provide an opportunity to inspect the plant for conformance to Standard Specifications. Specification violations should be brought to the attention of Contractor so they may be corrected prior to beginning paving. When doing plant inspection, particular attention should be given to examination of gates, feeders, drier and dust collector, screens and bins, pugmill, and all thermometers, pyrometers, and weighing scales. To assist in this inspection, one of the previously recommended hot mix asphalt paving handbooks will provide excellent guidance. With the increased emphasis on aggregate structure, voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) and air void content (Va), it may be necessary for the Contractor to use multiple stockpiles. Allowable methods of heating the asphalt are stated very clearly in the Specifications, and the limits of the range of application temperatures are also specified. An asphalt thermometer is required to be installed in the asphalt line. This thermometer should be checked for accuracy before work starts. Close control of variations in temperature of the asphalt binder is very important, as overheating of asphalt oils will cause hardening and may cause substantial decrease in pavement life. The Project Engineer may allow increasing the mixing temperature, in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation, as allowed in the Standard Specifications. Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(3)A Item 1 requires that a valve be placed in either the asphalt supply line to the mixer or the storage tank for sampling the asphalt binder. This valve should provide a safe method of obtaining samples of the asphalt binder that are representative of the material being incorporated in the mixture. All samples must be taken by the Contractor in the Plant Inspector’s presence. If for any reason the asphalt binder is suspected to have become mixed or contaminated in the storage tank, additional samples from the asphalt supply line should be taken and noted on sample submittals. Inspection During Mixing Operations After the mixing begins and throughout the day, the Plant Inspector, who is a qualified tester, shall perform the required tests of the HMA mixture. It is very important, however, that the testers spend some of the time observing the operation of the plant and the condition of the mixture being produced. Changes in the mixture can quickly be detected by observing changes in appearance or color of the mixture. Periodic checks of the temperature of the liquid asphalt, as well as the mixture produced must be made to ensure that maximum allowable temperatures are not exceeded and uniform material is being produced. The Contractor will choose the desired temperature of the mixture within Specification limits, depending on weather conditions, length of haul, and other factors. Plant Inspectors should watch for excessive variation in temperatures, and notify the Contractor of any variation that occurs. Variable temperatures of the mix may cause compaction and segregation problems; therefore close monitoring of temperatures is an essential part of HMA paving.

Chapter 5
When stockpiled, aggregates may contain a high percentage of moisture. With excess moisture in the aggregate difficulty may be encountered in heating the material to the proper temperature. In some cases, the Contractor may try to correct this condition by increasing the amount of fuel oil fed to the burner. This can be done satisfactorily until incomplete combustion of the fuel oil occurs. Black smoke coming from the exhaust stack is an indication that incomplete combustion is occurring. Black smoke is also a sure sign that air quality standards are being violated. The Plant Inspector should watch for this condition, as the unburned fuel can deposit a sooty, oily film on the aggregate particles that is detrimental to proper coating of the material with the asphalt film. A reduction in the rate of aggregate fed to the drier will usually correct the situation and allow proper heating and drying of the material. Frequent inspections of the condition of the mixture leaving the plant should be made, noting the consistency of the mix, the distribution of asphalt and aggregate throughout the mixture, and the temperature of the mixture. Trucks should be loaded by multiple dumps of three or more as recommended by the National Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA). If the quality of the mixture varies from truck to truck, an immediate check should be made to locate the source of trouble. Uniform distribution of asphalt binder throughout the mix is extremely important. If portions of each truckload vary from rich to lean, the Plant Inspector must advise the Contractor to correct the problem. It may be necessary to increase the mixing time to correct this situation. By examining the mixture in bright light, the experienced Plant Inspector can quickly detect non-uniformity in the mixture. Miscellaneous Duties of the Plant Inspector One of the duties of the Plant Inspector may be to oversee the work of the scale person on truck weighing scales at the plant, and verify that the required tests of the scales are performed. The Plant Inspector must verify that tickets are properly made out and issued for each truckload of mixture delivered, and must also verify that daily totals are promptly obtained and entered on the daily report. When HMA is produced using a warm mix asphalt (WMA) process the tickets are required to identify the mixture as WMA. Before trucks are allowed to be loaded at the plant, a check shall be made to verify that the truck beds are properly lubricated as required in the Specifications. No pools of bed release agent shall be allowed to remain in the truck bed following this operation. The truck bed should be raised to allow any excess material to be drained off. When the Contractor is using a site furnished by WSDOT, the Plant Inspector should ensure that the Contractor shapes up any remaining aggregate into neat stockpiles, and removes all debris from the plant site when the project is complete. SS 5-04.3(3)D
Material Transfer Device or Material Transfer Vehicle
Material Transfer Devices (MTD) and Material Transfer Vehicles (MTV) are machines used between the delivery trucks and paver. An MTD is attached to the paver while an MTV is self-propelled and not attached to the paver. These devices/vehicles provide for remixing of the HMA prior to placement which brings the HMA mixture to a more consistent temperature. This will greatly reduce or eliminate “cold spots” in the mat when the HMA is placed. In addition, the use of these machines will allow for a more constant operation, minimizing stops and starts. This will provide a smoother mat. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 5-29
Chapter 5
Surface Treatments and Pavements
At the Contractor’s request the Project Engineer may approve paving without a Material Transfer Device or Materials Transfer Vehicle (MTD/V). It is intended that these request be approved for work at intersections, etc. These requests will not be approved if they reflect work on mainline paving. The Project Engineer should evaluate these requests for equitable adjustments in monies or time. SS 5-04.3(4) Preparation of Existing Paved Surfaces Proper application of tack is one of the most important construction processes for ensuring the full service life of the pavement. Too much tack, too little tack, streaks, or failure to allow time for the tack to break before being covered with hot mix can reduce the pavement life by half or more. The Specifications require an application of tack coat that is uniform and free of streaks and bare spots. The application rate will depend on several factors and include the condition of the existing pavement, the Contractor’s equipment, the type of asphalt used, if it has been diluted with water and the application temperature. Tack coat is always applied to all paved surfaces prior to the placement of HMA including projects that have multiple lifts of HMA. Tack coat is not required when HMA is placed directly on crushed surfacing. For many pavements an application rate of approximately 0.05 gallons per square yard of residual asphalt is adequate. When paving a second lift of HMA a lower application rate is typically applied. Thin lifts of pavement require heavier applications of tack coat to prevent raveling, spalling, and delamination. As a guide, existing surfaces that are coarse, dry or milled require a higher application rate of tack coat than surfaces that appear rich or bleeding. SS 5-04.3(4)B
Soil Residual Herbicide
Weeds cause considerable damage to thin asphalt pavements such as sidewalks, shoulder overlays, and asphalt lined ditches. It is typically recommended that chemical weed control be used under all asphalt pavements less than 0.35 feet in depth unless a full depth base preparation was included in the construction. Check the Contract requirements to see if soil residual herbicide is required. SS 5-04.3(7) Spreading and Finishing In the construction of HMA pavements, it is extremely important for the paving machine to be in good adjustment and the machine and screed operators be experienced and capable. The Street Inspector should be quick to note operational practices that have an adverse effect on the work, and request the Contractor to make immediate corrections. Compaction procedures will be as specified in Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(10). During the paving operation, constant inspection must be maintained to see that the machine is producing a smooth pavement having the required characteristics of texture and uniformity. The Street Inspector must require immediate action be taken by the Contractor to correct any trouble that may develop. Listed below are some common difficulties encountered on HMA paving work, together with the most common causes of the difficulty:
Page 5-30
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Surface Treatments and Pavements
Chapter 5
• Wavy Surface (short, choppy waves) – Worn or poorly adjusted tracks or drive train; truck driver setting brakes too tightly; excessive paving machine speed; vibratory roller operating too fast.
• Wavy Surface (long waves) – Excessive variation in amount of mix carried in auger box ahead of screed; over-controlling screed; milling machine operated too fast.
• Excessively Open Surface Texture – Improper adjustment of strike off; screed plate surface is rough or galled; excessive paving machine speed.
• Varying Surface Texture – Insufficient mixing; trucks being loaded improperly at the plant; segregation of mix in trucks; poor gradation control at mixer; screed not uniform across paving machine.
• Streaked Surface Texture – Insufficient mixing; segregation of mix in trucks; worn or damaged screed plate.
• Bleeding Patches on Surface – HMA not uniformly mixed; excessive moisture in mix, or high binder content in the mix.
• Irregular Rough Spots on Pavement – Roller standing on fresh surface; abrupt reversing of roller; trucks backing into paver; poor workmanship at transverse joints.
• Cyclic Open Texture or Mat Temperatures that Vary More Than 25° (that usually matches up with the distance that each truck load of material covers) – This may be caused by a couple of problems. One is the result of thermal segregation. In this case, the differential temperatures in the HMA result in inconsistent compaction and a cyclic open texture. The use of an MTV/D will reduce or eliminate thermal segregation. Secondly, the machine operator may be allowing the head of material to fall below the top of the augers or by dumping the wings of the paver when the hopper is low on material. Hopper wings should be operated only occasionally and then with some load in the hopper.
• Crooked or Irregular Longitudinal Joint Lines – Careless machine operation or no guide string placed for the machine operator to follow. Some paving machine operators have a tendency to operate the paver at speeds in excess of that required to handle the quantity being produced at the plant, resulting in a jerky, stop and go operation. This must not be allowed. Generally, when the paver is operated consistent with plant production and roller capacity, the finished surface will be smoother. The ideal speed of the paver will be that which will result in a smooth, nearly continuous process with a minimum of stops required in waiting for trucks and/or the compaction equipment. If the production rate of the mixing plant is very high, requiring excessive speed of the paver, the Contractor will be required to correct the situation by slowing the production or using additional paving machines and generally, additional compaction equipment. Delivery must be adjusted to match production and uniform lay down. The Street Inspector should periodically check for difficulties while truckloads of mixture are dumped into the hopper of the paving machine. Trucks must not be allowed to back into the paver in such a manner that they bump the paver, nor shall trucks that bear against any part of the machine other than the pushing rollers be permitted to dump into the paver. Any mix spilled onto the pavement in front of the paving machine must be shoveled into the hopper of the machine or back into the truck before paving is resumed. The Street Inspector should be especially watchful to see that mix spilled in the paths of the tracks or wheels of the machine is removed.

Checks should be made of the crown adjustment of the screed, to ensure that the finished surface will conform to the required section. Particular attention must be given to the construction of the longitudinal joint when paving adjacent to a previously laid lane. The Street Inspector must insist that hand raking be held to a minimum, by adjusting the screed so that the freshly laid pavement is of the proper depth, allowing for compaction, to meet the grade of the previously laid lane. The uncompacted mixture immediately adjacent to the joint should be left slightly high so that the roller can compact the mixture thoroughly at this point. The rakers must not be permitted to cast excess mixture over the uncompacted, freshly spread lane. The Street Inspector must insist that segregated coarse particles of mix remaining after making the joint be removed and wasted, to avoid construction of a coarse, porous joint. GEN 5-04.3(9)B3
Mixture Statistical Evaluation – Acceptance Testing
Beginning with the 2018 paving season, several changes to Specification requirements for HMA compaction and mixture are being phased in incrementally over four years. The goal of these changes is to increase the service life of our HMA by at least one year. We are implementing these changes incrementally over four years to provide time needed by Industry to adjust means and methods to successfully meet the new requirements. Changing Specifications so frequently creates a challenge for staff responsible for entering and evaluating HMA test results, making sure that HMA data is being evaluated in accordance with each Contract, and ensuring that incentive/disincentive payments are being made per Contract. Offices administering multi-season HMA projects could be dealing with as many as three different Specifications in one paving season, until 2023. The key to ensuring that you are following the correct Specification when performing statistical evaluation and making the incentive/disincentive payments is to make sure the settings in SAM are correctly set to match the requirements of the Contract. It is easy to see what the SAM setting for HMA evaluation is for a particular Contract by looking at what is indicated in the drop-down list for “Material”. For example, if the material dropdown list shows “Class 3/8 inch, 9-03.8(7) – 2018”, SAM is using what is referred to as the 2018 settings. A drop-down indicating “Class 3/8 inch, 9-03.8(7) – 2019” indicates the 2019 settings are being used, and so on. The difficulty arises in determining which “year” in the “Material” setting is required by your Contract. It is not the Specification book year, because these changes have been made by Amendments and in some cases by Special Provision. The only way to correctly determine if SAM is correctly performing the statistical evaluation on your HMA is as follows: 1. Find the values in your Contract for each of the Specifications listed in the table below. Be sure to look in the Amendments to the Standard Specifications and in the Special Provisions to see if any changes have been made to the Standard Specifications. 2. Compare the values in your Contract to those in the table below. Find the column in the table below that exactly matches all the values in your Contract. Find the Specification year at the top of that column. If your Contract does not exactly match all of the values in one of the columns, contact your ASCE in the State Construction Office.

3. Look at the “Material” drop-down list in SAM. The Specification year indicated by SAM must be the same as the one you determined from your Contract and the table below. If they do not match, change the SAM pic-list item so it matches the Specification year determined from the Table. Field Acceptance – HMA Spec Changes: Mixture and Compaction 2021 & 2022

HMA Compaction Acceptance
SS 5-04.3(10)A HMA Compaction - General Compaction Requirements Compaction of the HMA is very important in the construction of a durable pavement. When good compaction is coupled with the proper mix design, extended service life of the pavement can reasonably be expected. The importance of thorough compaction of HMA cannot be over stressed. Two major factors are working simultaneously in a well-designed mixture to resist good compaction: (A) the stability of the mix in place increases with each pass of the roller, and (B) the viscosity of the asphalt increases as the temperature drops. A temperature-viscosity curve for the type of asphalt used in the mix is a useful tool in determining the ideal compaction temperature of the mix. Although densities for some HMA may be increased at temperatures below 175°F, vibratory rollers may damage the mat internally in ways that cannot be seen at the time of compaction. To prevent this damage, compaction with static rollers is required when the internal temperature of the mix is below the minimum Specification of 175°F. When paving in air temperatures over 90°F, some or all of the compactive effort may have to be delayed, but in no case should it be delayed below 175°F mat temperature. Vibratory rolling is prohibited on bridge decks and within 5 feet back of the pavement seat, however, rollers may be operated in oscillatory mode unless otherwise noted on the plans.

Chapter 5
Surface Treatments and Pavements
The desirable end product of a properly compacted HMA is a dense and nearly impermeable mat. Acceptable densities can be obtained if the mix proportions are proper. If not, no reasonable amount of compaction can produce acceptable density. Without proper density, the HMA will be subject to early distress and failure. Some mixes may be difficult to compact because they will move under the roller instead of compact. This is referred to as a tender mix and may result from several causes including gradation, fracture and asphalt binder properties. The asphalt binder content in a mix is based on several factors including traffic levels, aggregate structure and asphalt binder properties. The Contractor develops the mix design to meet specific volumetric properties. Field changes in the mix design asphalt content should only be allowed after careful consideration of all of the impacts. The maximum adjustment the Project Engineer may allow may not exceed 0.3 percent from the accepted mix design (Standard Specifications Section 9-03.8(7)). The Region Materials Laboratory is a good resource when considering changes in the asphalt binder content. Increasing the asphalt binder content on high traffic volume routes carries more long term performance risk than on low volume roads. The use of thicker lifts of pavement permits more time for compacting and will increase the effectiveness of the equipment. With careful organization and planning, the production of over 400 tons per hour may be compacted by as few as three rollers on deeper lifts. It is also apparent that high production rates with thin lifts might require twice as many rollers or more. It is the Contractor’s responsibility to determine how many rollers are needed to match the asphalt plants production rate. Usually the Contractor has a companion group of rollers, pavers, and production equipment for use together on paving projects that have been proven to be compatible. Before production begins, the Region Materials Engineer should be notified to arrange for the coring of the pavement to correlate nuclear densities to core densities for calculation of a nuclear gauge correlation factor, and to core bridge decks for compaction if the Contract assigns these cores to WSDOT. In general, compacting should begin on the outer edge of the course and progress toward the center of the pavement except on superelevated sections where the initial effort shall be on the lower side with the progressive compaction toward the higher side. The type of rollers and their relative position in the compaction sequence shall generally be at the Contractor’s option provided Specification densities are attained and it is not specified otherwise in the Contract Provisions. Exceptions are (1) a pneumatic tired roller is required for compaction of the wearing course from October 1 through March 31, and (2) a pneumatic tire roller is required to compact preleveling in areas that are severely wheel rutted. Coverage with a vibratory or steel roller may precede pneumatic tired rolling. The maximum speed of rollers shall not exceed the recommendations of the manufacturer of the roller for the compaction of HMA. When requested by the Project Engineer, the Contractor is required to provide a copy of the manufacturer’s recommendations. When the roller reverses direction the vibrators must be turned off momentarily.

Chapter 5
The steel drum vibratory roller is generally used for the primary compaction on HMA mixes and sometimes for finish rolling in a static mode. Two terms frequently used with vibratory rollers are frequency and amplitude. Frequency is how often the impacts are applied and is normally stated in cycles per second. Amplitude is the greatest vertical movement, up or down, of the drum during a cycle. Vibratory rollers achieve their compaction effect from the kinetic energy produced by the vibrating components of the roller. Vibratory rollers usually work best when operated with high frequency and low amplitude on dense graded leveling and wearing courses. On hills, it usually works best to operate the vibrators only while traveling uphill. Over vibrating can cause a decrease in compaction. Operated in the static mode, despite their apparent bulk, they are less effective than even intermediate size conventional steel drum rollers due to their lower mass. Vibratory rollers may not be practical in areas where there are mortar joint concrete or certain other vintage pipe used for utilities or irrigation. In locations with this type of pipe the Special Provisions will restrict the compaction to static rolling. With pneumatic roller breakdown it will be necessary to hold in about 6 inches from unsupported edges to avoid lateral displacement of the HMA. A narrow overlap of successive trips is desirable and the roller should be kept in constant motion. During initial compaction, the rollers orientation should be such that the powered axle passes over the uncompacted mix first. Breakdown tiller wheels should be turned the least possible amount in the uncompacted area to avoid pushing and shoving the hot mat near the wheels. The steel drum roller should follow closely behind the pneumatic roller to compact the centerline joint and the edge of the pavement as well as iron out the pneumatic tire marks. The steel drum roller will exert extra pressure on the uncompacted edge and should have no difficulty in properly compacting this edge if the roller is close behind the pneumatic rollers. Cold rubber tires usually “pick” the mat. Every effort should be made to warm the tires before compacting the mat. Sending the rollers for a drive before the work is fully organized prior to paving will help with the tires. The axles of the roller are weighted by the use of iron pigs, chain, rivets or other concentrated loading in addition to the usual water and aggregate tank loading to control the total roller weight. Ground contact pressure is determined by the tire inflation pressure, a ground contact pressure of 70 psi is a reasonable pressure to start with. Variation in the mixture and tire pressures will soon determine the most desirable combination of mixture, temperature, contact pressures and number of applications. Steel drum rolling is generally used for finish rolling; however, it is sometimes used for breakdown and primary compaction. It is important that vibratory roller operation on pavement with temperatures below 175°F not be permitted. Over-rolling by the steel drum roller may damage the pavement more than under-rolling. Preferably, rolling equipment should be wide enough so that a uniform application of compactive effort can be distributed over the entire course without creating hard streaks or leaving narrow porous strips. Breakdown and intermediate rolling should be completed while the mixture is above 185°F with the finish rolling completed above 150°F. With lower temperature mixes and thin lift applications it becomes obvious that the rollers must be kept up close to the paver.

SS 5-04.3(10)B HMA Compaction – Cyclic Density Temperature variations in the newly placed HMA mat have the tendency to cause variations in density. These variations are more common when the HMA is dumped directly into the paver hopper, where there is limited re-mixing of the HMA to provide a consistent temperature. The requirement to use an MTV/D allows for re-mixing of the HMA, providing a more constant temperature as the HMA is being placed, reducing or eliminating the temperature variations in the mat behind the paver screed. The Street Inspector should review the surface condition of the mat after rolling to determine if there are any areas which appear coarse in comparison to the rest of the mat. These suspect areas should be noted and marked for testing with the nuclear gauge to verify the compaction requirements have been met. Another effective method of identifying suspect areas is to use an infrared surface heat thermometer or thermal imaging camera. The thermometer or camera scans must be performed behind the paver screed prior to compaction of the mat. Any areas that are excessively cooler than the rest of the mat (25° or greater) need to be noted and marked for testing with the nuclear gauge. Areas marked as suspect for low densities are to be independent from the required random density acceptance testing. Readings taken for cyclic density are to be reported separately from acceptance testing on WSDOT Form 350-170. Each 500 foot section of the mat will be evaluated. If there are two or more areas with a density of less than 90 percent of reference maximum density within the section, a $500.00 price adjustment will need to be assessed. SS 5-04.3(10)C
HMA Compaction Acceptance - Statistical Evaluation
Refer to Table 14 in Standard Specifications 5-04 to determine which pavements are statistically evaluated for acceptance of HMA compaction. Note also that 5-04.3(10)C1 requires all HMA compaction on a bridge deck to be evaluated statistically, regardless of whether the HMA is in a lane, shoulder, gore, et cetera. Refer to Table 16 in Standard Specification 5-04 to determine whether pavement density is measured by testing with the nuclear density gauge or cores. If density is measured on cores, Table 16 also shows what role, if any, the Contractor will play in taking the cores. Determine the percent compaction for each density test by dividing the density into the maximum density (Rice Density) as determined by WSDOT SOP 729 when using the nuclear density gauge and WSDOT SOP 736 when using cores. Enter the data into the MATS program. Be sure that MATS and SAM are using the correct Lower Specification Limit (LSL) for compaction required by your Contract. See the table above, under GEN 5-04.3(9)B3. The compaction results are then evaluated statistically for acceptance by the SAM program. SAM calculates a CPF. If the CPF is greater than 1.00, the Contractor will receive an incentive payment for exceeding the minimum statistical requirements. If the CPF is less than 1.00, the Contractor will provide WSDOT a credit (a “disincentive”) for failing to meet minimum statistical requirements. If the CPF is equal to 1.00, the Contractor will receive neither incentive payment nor disincentive credit, because 1.00 represents “meeting” the statistical requirements. Page 5-36

Compaction lots not meeting the prescribed minimum CPF of 0.75 will need to be evaluated for removal and replacement with satisfactory material. GEN 5-04.3(10)C1
HMA Compaction Acceptance – Statistical Evaluation
HMA density on bridge decks will always be determined using cores, and acceptance of HMA compaction on bridge decks will always be by statistical evaluation. When taking a core on a bridge deck, care must be taken to avoid damaging the concrete deck or waterproofing membrane. To mitigate any possible damage to the membrane or concrete deck, the bottom of the core hole must be swabbed with PG grade asphalt binder before backfilling the core hole with HMA. WAQTC FOP for AASHTO T 355, regarding using the nuclear density gauge, requires all HMA density testing to be done with a thin lift gauge, or if one is not available, by using the backscatter mode. SS 5-04.3(10)D HMA Compaction - Visual Evaluation Visual evaluation is the basis for acceptance of compaction for preleveling and pavement repair. Refer to Table 14 in Standard Specification 5-04. For preleveling mix, the compaction control shall be to the satisfaction of the Project Engineer. A pneumatic tired roller is required for compacting HMA that is used for preleveling wheel rutting. SS 5-04.3(10)E HMA Compaction - Test Point Evaluation For any condition that does not require either statistical evaluation for compaction or visual evaluation for compaction, the Contractor shall construct a test point in accordance with instructions from the Project Engineer. The number and timing of passes with an accepted compaction train, that will yield maximum density with the nuclear gauge readings at the test point, shall be used on all succeeding paving. The Street Inspector should make sure the Contractor is making the required number of passes and reconstruct a new test point if conditions change. When this evaluation is used to determine density, WSDOT Form 350-073 is to be completed for project records. In order for HMA to be accepted by a test point evaluation the Project Engineer shall, at the beginning of paving, select a section approximately 200 feet long upon which to conduct the evaluation. Select a spot within the section near the center of the pavement area for density testing with a nuclear density gauge. After each roller pass, a density reading is taken with the nuclear gauge at this test spot. Gauge readings are taken in the backscatter or thin layer mode; marking the footprint of the gauge with crayon or paint stick as there will be multiple tests required at the same location. Record the information required on DOT Form 350-073. Continue this process until the density readings level off or start to drop. This indicates the relative density has reached its maximum with the compaction equipment being used. After the relative density has reached the maximum, the Street Inspector may request the breakdown roller to make an additional pass or two to see if the density reading increases or stays the same. The test section should be repeated when there is a change to the work. Examples of a qualifying change would be a different pavement section (depth of pavement/surfacing and not a different roadway section with the same structure), compaction equipment, mix design or JMF (JMF changes to the percent of asphalt binder or gradation).

When a Contractor is paving HMA which will be accepted by both statistical evaluation and test point evaluation in a single operation (e.g., lane and shoulder) the test point evaluation may be omitted if the Contractor uses the same rolling pattern on the area accepted by test point evaluation as that used for the statistical evaluation. SS 5-04.3(12)
Joints
SS 5-04.3(12)A1
Transverse Joints
The Standard Specifications provide that transverse joints, also called butt joints, be constructed. The use of heavy paper is recommended to form the butt joint at the end of the day’s work, with a temporary ramp laid on the paper beyond the joint to assist traffic over the change in elevation. Paper protruding above the pavement shall be carefully trimmed flush with the pavement so that there will not be an illusion of a hazard at night. When the ramp and paper are removed prior to beginning the succeeding day’s paving, a well‑constructed joint will require a minimum of cutting back to form the required butt joint. When hand raking is performed on a joint, all segregated coarse aggregate shall be removed, to avoid a coarse, porous surface at the joint. If the roadway is open to traffic, the transverse joint must be feathered to provide a smooth transition for the traveling public and joints between successive lifts in each lane should not be less than 100 feet apart. The higher the speed on the roadway, the longer the taper on the joint must be to provide an acceptable transition. The required slope ratio is 1 vertical to 50 horizontal or flatter. This slope will usually require use of more than one width of paper. Sufficient material must be temporarily placed in front of the paver to prevent a deformation from occurring in the permanent HM the joint. Care should be taken to construct a straight line taper without humping. At the beginning of the day’s work, special care must be exercised in the construction of the transverse joint joining the freshly laid mixture with the previous day’s work. The paver should be allowed to proceed at a low rate of speed (creep) ahead of the joint, until hand finishing of the joint is completed. The paver should not come to a full stop or the screed may settle and cause a dip at that point. The Street Inspector should check this work closely, using the 10 foot straightedge to see that the requirement for surface smoothness is met. SS 5-04.3(12)A2
Longitudinal Joints
The long term performance of longitudinal joints is highly dependent on the quality of construction. Improperly and poorly constructed joints can fail prematurely; raveling and cracking are common problems with these joints. Proper joint construction includes the following:
• The joint is constructed at the lane line or an edge line of the Travelled Way;
• When multiple lifts of asphalt are placed a joint is offset from the joint below from 2 to 6 inches;
• Tack coat is applied to the joint, including the vertical face of the joint, to bind and seal the joint;
Page 5-38
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Surface Treatments and Pavements
Chapter 5
• Industry standards for compaction of the joint are followed to achieve density; and
• For a wearing course where new pavement abuts new pavement a notched wedge joint is required (unless otherwise approved by the Project Engineer). A notched wedge joint has benefits by the shape of the joint in that there is a better bond, with tack, between the pavements and the density may be improved. This method of joint construction should be used in all locations in the wearing course; not using a notched wedge joint should be an exception and only allowed where the specific project conditions do not allow for this method of joint construction. A notched wedge is not required when new HMA is placed against existing HMA such as at the edge line of a grind and inlay project. The intent of the notched wedge joint is to partially confine the edge for paving while still leaving a “notch” to match to. The wedge needs to be adequately compacted and the notch needs to be there (i.e., not flattened or rounded by traffic or equipment driving across it) when the adjacent lane is paved. When a roller is compacting HMA adjacent to a longitudinal joint the goal is to confine and densify the material at the joint. The sequence that is recommended by research on longitudinal joint construction is for the first pass of the roller that is adjacent to the joint to be approximately 6 inches from the joint on the “hot” side. This roller pass compacts and provides confinement for the HMA at the joint. This is followed with a roller pass that overlaps to the “cold” side of the pavement and the 6 inch strip of HMA is densified in the joint area. Other methods of joint compaction have been demonstrated to push the HMA away from the joint resulting in lower density and poorer joint performance. When HMA is placed adjacent to cement concrete pavement the joint is required to be sawed and filled with a joint sealant to prevent the intrusion of water. SS 5-04.3(13)
Surface Smoothness
When a course is being constructed below the wearing course, an attempt must be made to remove all depressions and sags in the grade line by adjusting the depth of the course. The Street Inspector should work closely with the screed operator to accomplish this result by pointing out irregularities in the base far enough ahead of the machine to allow proper adjustment of the screed to eliminate the irregularity. The objective to be attained during construction of each course is the complete elimination of all irregularities, so placement of the wearing course can be accomplished with a minimum of screed adjustments. If the base is excessively rough, pre-leveling should be completed prior to construction of the first course. Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(3)C requires the use of automatic screed controls on the paver. It must be remembered that as the equipment becomes more sophisticated, it also becomes more necessary that it be properly adjusted and operated or satisfactory results will not be achieved. With proper operation, this equipment will give excellent performance. When reference lines are required, or the Contractor elects to use reference lines, particular attention must be given to verify the line is properly set and tensioned. If the line is offset too far from the paving machine, vibrations of the machine may affect operation of the automatic controls, which in turn affect the smoothness of the pavement. The reference line for asphalt paving machines normally will not be used when the roadway is under traffic. The Specifications provide that if the course the pavement WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 5-39
Chapter 5
Surface Treatments and Pavements
is to be placed on is superior to established smoothness requirements, the paver may operate from a mat referencing device such as electronic sensors instead of the wire. The Street Inspector must ascertain that smoothness of the pavement continues to be superior to the requirements of the Specifications. Normally, when the surface for paving is properly constructed using a reference line or the first course of pavement is constructed using a reference line, subsequent courses of pavement may be constructed using a mat referencing device with continued improvement in the surface smoothness. Manual operation of the screed controls will be permitted in the construction of irregular shaped and minor areas, such as gore areas, road approaches, left turn channelization lanes, and tapers. Surface smoothness and good ride qualities of a pavement are secured only by hard work and strict attention to small details. The Street Inspector should continually study the conditions peculiar to the job, and strive to obtain the smoothest surface possible. A smooth riding pavement costs no more than an unsightly, poor surface, but it does require constant, careful inspection of all details of construction to obtain the desired results. Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(13) outlines the smoothness requirements using a 10 foot straight edge oriented in both the longitudinal and transverse directions. Smoothness checks should be made at the starting point of paving, at transverse “night joints,” whenever the paver is stopped for any length of time, or wherever the Street Inspector suspects a smoothness problem. Some projects may include the “Smoothness Compliance Adjustment” pay item. The State Materials Laboratory Pavement Office will provide the beginning IRI results from the inventory lane of the previous year for informational purposes. The inventory data will not include data from all lanes. This data will be placed into the Contract for informational purposes. After the paving is completed on the project, a specially equipped van will travel each lane to determine the final IRI. Payment for the “Smoothness Compliance Adjustment Factor” is determined from the pay schedule based on the type of roadway and associated opportunities to obtain smoothness. See the General Special Provisions for more information. Ensure the proper usage of the Special Provisions and pay close attention to the intent of using the Smoothness Compliance Adjustment. It is not intended for short sections of paving, ramps or sections that have a speed limit less than 35 MPH. It is intended for mainline paving sections greater than 1 mile in length. In order to measure the final IRI, the Project Office must inform the Pavement Office (MLPavementProfileTest@wsdot.wa.gov) and provide the form that can be found at http:// sharedot/eng/cn/sml/pave/SitePages/Home.aspx) After the paving is complete and the roadway is returned to final lane configuration, a request to the Pavement Office is required so the final IRI smoothness can be determined. Final measurements require that traffic control or any detours be completely removed from the roadway and all paving is complete.

Cement Concrete Pavement
GEN 5-05.1
General Instructions Concrete paving is a highly complex, mechanized operation and proper organization and planning of the work is essential on the part of both Contractors and WSDOT. Cement concrete pavement has a relatively high initial cost and WSDOT expects many years of satisfactory service from this type of pavement. It is imperative that the Project Engineer and Inspectors are thoroughly familiar with the specifications and techniques applying to the work, if this objective is to be attained. Before construction begins, the Project Engineer should review all phases of the work, and see that all members of the crew are familiar with the duties to which they are to be assigned. Advance planning and organization of the engineering and inspection teams will do much to eliminate the confusion and improper construction sometimes found during the first day’s work. All inspection equipment and testing tools should be on hand, and properly calibrated or certified, in advance of beginning of paving, and WSDOT materials testers properly qualified to perform the necessary concrete testing. The Project Engineer should make certain that all Inspectors are instructed in the proper methods of keeping notes, records and diaries. Accurate records of construction progress and test results are absolutely essential in evaluating pavement performance through the years. The Contract may contain the GSP, Just in Time Training. The purpose of this training is to bring all the parties to the table, and to raise understanding about the means and methods the contractor is proposing in order to comply with the Contract.

Checklists For the convenience of the Inspector, some of the most important inspection duties on concrete paving work are listed below:
GEN 5-05.3(1) Concrete Mix Design Approval The Contractor’s mix design should be reviewed by the Project Office to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Contract. The following items should be reviewed:
• Cementitious materials (Portland Cement, Low Alkali Cement, Blended Hydraulic Cement, Fly Ash, Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag, Microsilica Fume, and Metakaolin) – Verify products are listed on the QPL or have been approved through the RAM process. – Check that mill certification demonstrates specification compliance. – Verify the proposed quantities within specification limits for the concrete class.

See that all testing tools and equipment are on hand and in good condition. Working with the Contractor, determine location(s) for the Contractor provided curing box(es) used for initially curing concrete test cylinders (Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(4)A). 3. Check preparation of Subgrade; watch for soft spots. Check Subgrade elevations to ensure there are no high or low spots (Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(6)). If HMA pavement placed on Subgrade prior to PCCP, refer to Standard Specifications Section 5-04 for HMA requirements. 4. Check that forms are in good condition and are set securely, true to line and grade (Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(7)B). If a slip form paver is used, check position of wire, string line across the wire and check the depth to Subgrade or HMA pavement in at least three locations across the proposed paving area at each pin location. 5.

Check tie bars and dowel bars for rust and defects, that they are installed properly, secured to the grade, and located mid-depth of the slab if placed in baskets. Ensure that dowel bars receive a bond breaker if they are not precoated (Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(10)). Be alert to anything in the paving operation that results in movement of the bars. 9. Watch for excessive movement of forms under weight of concrete paving equipment. 10. Check frequently to see that vibrators are operating properly (Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(7)). If a dowel bar inserter is used, check spacing and alignment of dowel bars. Ensure that PCCP is consolidated after the bar is inserted and that slurry does not fill the insertion point. 11. Watch finishing operations to make sure excessive amount of water is not added to surface; allow fine spray only to be used (Section 5-5.3B). 12. Check the surface texturing operation to see that proper, uniformly textured surface is obtained (Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(11)). 13. See that curing compound is placed uniformly, at the required rate, and at the proper time. The curing compound needs to completely coat the surface of the concrete (Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(13)A). Note other curing methods are allowed in Standard Specifications. 14.

Construction Requirements
SS 5-05.3(1) Concrete Mix Design for Paving The Contractor shall provide a concrete mix design for each design of concrete specified in the Contract. The proportions shall be determined in accordance with ACI 211.1. The same concrete Mix Design No. may be used in several of a concrete suppliers Plants. Note that a unique identification for the mix design is comprised of the combination of the Mix Design Number and the Plant Number. SS 5-05.3(3) Equipment A very important factor in obtaining a superior product with slip form paving is uniformity of operation. The Engineer should ensure that the plant, mixing facilities and hauling units are in quality and quantity balance to supply the paver with an adequate quantity of concrete for continuous operation at the recommended speed, without sacrificing uniform slump. Considerable pavement roughness can be attributed to spasmodic operation, and this should be held to a minimum. SS 5-05.3(3)B
Mixing Equipment
Nonagitating trucks are permitted to haul plant mixed concrete provided the concrete is delivered and discharged within 45 minutes after the introduction of mixing water to cement and aggregates, and the concrete is in a workable condition when placed Paver. SS 5-05.3(3)C
Finishing Equipment
The slip form paving equipment must be self-propelled and capable of placing, spreading, consolidating, screeding, and finishing the freshly placed concrete to the proper pavement elevation and cross-section within the specified tolerances. Sliding forms on the paver must be rigid to prevent spreading of the forms. The paving equipment must finish the surface in a manner which will minimize hand finishing. Slip form pavers contain various combinations of all or some of the following components: auger spreader, spud vibrators, oscillating screeds, tamping bars, and pan floats. The equipment should be checked for calibration and satisfactory operation in accordance with the manufacturer’s manual before paving is allowed to proceed. If it is necessary to stop the forward movement of the paver, the vibratory and tamping elements should also be immediately stopped. No tractive force should be applied to the machine except that which is controlled from the machine.

Chapter 5
Surface Treatments and Pavements
SS 5-05.3(5) Mixing Concrete It is very important that uniform consistency of the concrete be maintained with the water/cementitious ratio not exceeding 0.44 and the edge slump not exceeding ¼-inch. The Standard Specifications requirements for the water/cementitious ration is in Section 5-05.3(2) and the edge slump requirement is in Section 5-05.3(11). The current requirements for water/cementitious ratio and edge slump are intended to control consistency. SS 5-05.3(6) Surface Preparation Ahead of the paving operation, the Subgrade must be properly prepared with some type of “fixed” control template to accommodate the width of the paver. The Subgrade must be properly dampened so as to have no water demand from the mix, but, also, the concrete must not be placed on Subgrade on which pools of water have formed. If concrete is delivered by trucks on the grade, Subgrade disturbance should be kept at a minimum. The Subgrade should be shaped and thoroughly compacted. Special attention should be directed to see that all parts of the Subgrade are firm and unyielding. Soft spots should be removed and backfilled with suitable material. Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(6) requires that the Subgrade be prepared and compacted a minimum of 3 feet beyond each edge of the area to receive the concrete pavement in order to accommodate the width of the slip form paving equipment. The 3 foot extensions on each side of the Subgrade are tracklines that the slip form paving machines tracks will follow, and the smoothness of the tracklines directly affects the smoothness of the concrete pavement. The Subgrade must be trimmed to the proper Subgrade elevation and shape. After trimming, the Subgrade shall be thoroughly wetted and compacted to achieve a dense unyielding surface. The Subgrade must be kept in this condition until the concrete is placed. The elevation of the Subgrade should be checked either by stretching a stringline between the control wires and measuring down to the surface or by another method that provides for a satisfactory check. Extra checks should be made through crown and super transitions to be sure proper adjustments were made in the machine through this area and that no high spots exist. Controls If control stakes have not been set for previous operations, they need to be installed at this time. If the control stakes have previously been set, the installation of the wire shall be checked to verify that it is set to the proper line and grade. This is especially important if the wire is offset from its original position. SS 5-05.3(7) Placing, Spreading, and Compacting Concrete As paving progresses, the Inspector should be alert to the wire position just ahead of the machine, since the most precisely set control can be disturbed by workers or equipment hitting it. If you notice anyone or anything bumping, touching, leaning on or otherwise in contact with the control wire, notify the Contractor immediately. It is much easier to correct a misaligned control wire than repair the pavement after it has been placed.

Surface Treatments and Pavements
Chapter 5
The unconsolidated concrete in front of the paver should be kept well distributed by spreading or by dumping. As the truck or mixer discharges the mix onto the grade in front of the paver, the forces delivered to the machine should be held to a minimum, with all systems functioning as designed. If the paver is not moving, the vibration should be off. When vibration is in progress, it is important that the concrete becomes uniformly plastic for the full slab width as it passes through the vibration area. A lack of consolidation at one position on the machine could cause a potential fracture line parallel to the direction of movement and also a rough and uneven finished surface. The head of material in front of the paving machine should always be in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendation. It is possible that experimentation may be necessary at the beginning of paving. To start, no trailing forms should be used on the machine and all finishing equipment should be engaged. This could then be modified if problems occur. One of the prime contributors to edge slump is high slump concrete. This should not be tolerated. Another is tie bar insertion for abutting lanes, which should be installed ahead of the final finishing. Edge slump of the unsupported sides behind the paver is one of the major problems to be combated on slip form paving. The surface should be immediately straight edged by the Contractor and methods corrected to deliver a consistently true edge. Trailing forms can be used to give support beyond the length of the paver, but this may not be the answer. It is possible that more damage than good is done by trailing forms in some cases, by drag resistance pulling down the edge, or by mechanical vibration transmitted through the paver linkage to the form. This comment is also applicable to a trailing finisher. Remember that the concrete is between the moving forms only a few minutes and does not take its initial set until long after the forms leave it. If water is added to the surface from a spray bar at the rear of the machine it should be in the form of a fine fog spray to avoid washing of the surface and extreme care must be exercised to see that the amount of water added is held to a bare minimum. Addition of excessive amounts of water during finishing will weaken the surface of the concrete and may result in hair checking or scaling of the pavement surface at an early date. If a considerable amount of water is continually required to finish the concrete, it may be better to add more water to the concrete mix to reduce the need for spraying water on the surface. Rain on a green unformed slab can cause disastrous edge slump and erosion. The Contractor should be encouraged to halt operations previous to this circumstance, and should be prepared to protect the pavement at all times. Soon after the paving starts, and periodically thereafter, the slab template should be checked to insure that the “dry” template has not changed. This is done by stretching a line over the transverse wires and measuring down. This check should also be made through curves and transitions to ensure that the proper section adjustments are being made. The slip form paver behaves similarly to an asphalt paver with the front probe approximately 3/16 inch higher than the rear. This will probably vary with the machine, due to mass distribution, etc.

Slope of less than this produces an unstable characteristic and an undulating profile, slopes in excess of the correct one cause the machine to repeatedly build up and then slump down. If the symptoms occur, this is one place to check. The machine also has about ¾ inch convergence in the sides, to encourage stability. Hand finishing, water adding, and other surface manipulation should be kept at a minimum. SS 5-05.3(7)B
Stationary Side Form Construction
Metal side forms or other forms accepted by the Project Engineer, conforming to the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(7)B, shall be used for the construction of cement concrete pavement when a slipform paving machine is not used unless the Contractor requests to use an accepted slip form machine. It is essential that the base of the forms used have full, equal bearing upon the Subgrade throughout their length and width. The forms should be set true to alignment and grade and firmly staked with steel pins to avoid movement. The forms must never be set on blocks or pedestals. After the forms are firmly staked in place, a final inspection of line and grade should be made by sighting along the tops of the forms. Minor adjustments in grade can be accomplished by tamping additional Subgrade material under the form base by an accepted mechanical form tamper or by inserting small leveling wedges under the forms. It is important that the leveling wedges do not protrude into the cement concrete pavement so as to prevent uncontrolled cracking in the concrete pavement at the locations of the wedges. A small amount of concrete may seep under the forms and this concrete needs to be removed flush with the vertical face of the existing concrete pavement prior to placing new cement concrete pavement next to existing concrete pavement. If major changes in alignment or grade are required, the forms should be removed and the Subgrade reshaped to the proper elevation and recompacted before resetting the forms. SS 5-05.3(8) Joints Isolation Joints – Drainage features and manholes placed within the concrete pavement are likely to cause a crack to develop in the concrete and need to be isolated from the rest of the concrete pavement by some type of premolded joint filler. Consult the contract plans and or Standard Plans for details. If no details are found contact the State Construction Office for guidance. SS 5-05.3(8)A Contraction Joints Longitudinal and transverse contraction joints shall be provided by saw cutting the surface in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(8) to the depth specified in Standard Plan A-40.10. The joints shall match transverse joints on adjacent concrete pavement and be at 15 foot intervals transversely on other areas. As concrete cures and hardens, a change in volume occurs due to loss of moisture and cooling. This shrinkage results in tensile stresses being set up in the pavement, causing cracks to develop. History has shown that transverse cracks will develop at about 15 foot intervals along the length of a slab, and that a slab wider than 15 feet may crack longitudinally. The spacing for transverse contraction joints is a maximum of 15 feet; see Standard Plans A-40.10-00 for more information on spacing of transverse joints.

Chapter 5
The purpose of contraction joints is to control the cracking of the concrete, thereby preventing ragged random cracks that spall and require expensive maintenance. Good construction of these joints is of the utmost importance, and inspection of this work is one of the most important phases of the Engineer’s duties. Contraction joints are weakened planes that collect the cracking into a controlled joint. These joints are made by sawing and pouring a hot or cold filler into the joint. The purpose is to create a maintainable joint in the slab and cause the crack to form along the plane of the joint. This type of joint is constructed by sawing a groove in the hardened concrete to create a plane of weakness along which the crack will form. The saw cuts are made with the circular saw blades edged with diamonds. On full width construction, a gang sawing machine using several blades simultaneously is generally used to saw the transverse joints. When the gang sawing machine is used, the Inspector must see that the individual blades are properly aligned and set to cut the required depth. It is necessary to control the time of sawing transverse joints very carefully, so that sawing may be done when concrete has hardened as much as possible without delaying so long as to allow development of random cracks. It is impossible to state a sawing schedule that will be ideal for every job, since curing conditions vary a great deal from job to job. Some generalizations can be made concerning sawing, but the Contractor on each job must determine from experience the most suitable schedule for that job. It is desirable to delay sawing as long as possible to allow the concrete to gain enough strength to resist raveling adjacent to the saw cut. Sawing green concrete produces excessive wear on the saw blades, and causes washing, raveling, and other structural damages to the concrete near the joint. However, it may be necessary to make some early cuts to control cracking. In general, a program of sawing control joints should be followed, sawing every fifth joint, not to exceed 64 feet, as soon as the concrete hardens sufficiently to resist excessive raveling. The beginning of sawing may vary depending on the type of base, concrete mix characteristics and weather. Sawing of the intermediate joints should follow the sawing of the control joints. It will usually be found possible to delay sawing the rest of the joints until the day following placement of the concrete (see Standard Plan A-40.10-00 for more information). By observing the frequency of cracking and opening of joints the next day, it will be possible to lay out a sawing schedule that will give best results. If only the control joints are cracked, the sawing of the intermediate joints can be delayed further, given fairly constant weather conditions. The Contractor should mark off the locations of the transverse joints and the inspector should check the spacing and frequently check to see that the specified depth of cut is sawed. The locations of the dowel bar baskets need to be marked on the grade prior to the dowel bar baskets being covered by the concrete pavement in order to correctly locate the transverse joint saw cut in the middle of the dowel bars. Since much of the sawing will be done at night, the Inspector should be equipped with a good flashlight to properly examine the condition of saw cuts and to watch for random cracks.

Surface Treatments and Pavements
When paving a lane adjacent to a previously paved slab, an early morning examination of joints in the existing lane will show the joints that are open and working. These locations should be marked for sawing control joints in the second lane. Friction at the construction joint and the tie bars will transmit stresses to the new slab and may cause random cracking to occur. For the same reason, uncontrolled cracks in the first lane should be matched with a control joint in the second. In addition, when cement concrete pavement is placed adjacent to existing cement concrete pavement, the vertical face of all existing working joints shall be covered with a bond breaker, such as polyethylene film, roofing paper or other material as accepted by the Engineer to prevent uncontrolled migration of the crack into the adjacent slab (Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(8)A). If the Contractor proposes to use material other than polyethylene film or roofing paper as a bond breaker, the Project Engineer shall consult with the State Construction Office on the suitability of the proposed bond breaking material. SS 5-05.3(8)B
Sealing Sawed Contraction Joints
Prior to opening of the pavement to traffic, sawed joints must be sealed with an accepted type of filler material. Before application of the filler material, the joints must be thoroughly clean and dry. The sawed joints shall be free of dirt and dust. It is important that the saw cut be completely filled to within ¼ inch to ⅝ inch below the top of the concrete surface with the joint filler material. The Inspector can check this by probing the joint after sealing with a stiff wire and watching for sagging of the filler below the top of the joint. SS 5-05.3(8)C
Construction Joints
A construction joint shall be made at the end of each day’s paving by placing a header board transversely across the pavement. Uncapped dowel bars should be installed in the joint, seeing that the dowels are parallel with the centerline and profile of the pavement. The ends of the dowels projecting from the header should be protected so that they will not be disturbed or moved from their correct positions. Prior to beginning paving the following day, any broken curing seal on the end of the previous day’s work must be re-sprayed with curing compound, and exposed dowel bars shall be coated with a parting compound, such as curing compound or grease to allow for future slab movement. SS 5-05.3(9) Joint Matching Pre-Existing Pavement Joints Prior to paving new PCCP in a driving lane, diamond grind a minimum of 3 feet of any preexisting pavement, that is scheduled to remain at the completion of the project, and is logitudinally adjacent to the new PCCP. This will produce a smooth surface to tie the new PCCP in to. The preexisting pavement shall be ground regardless if it is PCCP or bituminous. SS 5-05.3(10)
Tie Bars and Dowel Bars
Tie/dowel bars must be installed where specified in the Standard Plans M 21-01 (see Standard Plan Series A-40 and A-60). Tie bars must be placed so that equal lengths of the bars project into the two lanes of adjoining pavement. When paving two or more lanes at a time, the tie bars are placed at the juncture of the lanes by mechanical means. The Page 5-50
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Surface Treatments and Pavements
Chapter 5
Inspector must be alert to see that the bars are set at the proper spacing and depth and are properly centered between the two lanes. When placing tie/dowel bars in the edge of a slab, the ends of the bars projecting from the forms should be protected against disturbance that might destroy the bond between the concrete and steel. The bars already in place shall be bent to lie close to the slab to permit preparation of the Subgrade of the adjoining lane, and carefully straightened to their proper position before placement of concrete. SS 5-05.3(11) Finishing After the concrete has been given the preliminary finish by the paving machine, minimal hand finishing may be required before the Contractor checks the surface with a straightedge device not less than 10 feet in length. High and low areas indicated by the straightedge shall be corrected. The requirements of checking the surface with the straightedge may be waived if it is demonstrated that other means will consistently produce a surface that meets the requirements for surface smoothness. The final pavement texturing shall be either a tined finish or a finish produced by cement concrete pavement grinding. For a tined finish, the pavement shall be given a final finish by texturing with a wire comb parallel to the center line of the pavement. The tining on small or irregular areas may be either parallel or perpendicular to centerline. It is important that the comb be used when the concrete is at the proper consistency. If the concrete is too soft, it will not retain the proper texture obtained by the comb, and if the concrete is too hard, the proper texture will not be achieved. The comb should be set up and ready to use well in advance of the time it will be required. For a ground surface the pavement surface shall be ground to produce a uniform corduroy like texture in compliance with SS 5-01.3(9)A. SS 5-05.3(12)
Surface Smoothness
Smoothness is one of the most important pavement characteristics to road users. A smooth pavement provides a comfortable ride and reduces road noise. In addition to comfort, longer pavement life, reduced fuel consumption and less vehicle wear and tear are all attributes associated with smoother pavements. It is one of the factors that the public associates with the quality construction which reflects on the agency constructing it. WSDOT uses the International Roughness Index (IRI) to evaluate pavement smoothness. IRI is a measure of smoothness in one wheel path only. Since both wheel paths affect pavement smoothness WSDOT averages the IRI in each wheel path to produce the Mean Roughness Index (MRI). When the term IRI is used within WSDOT, what is most often meant is MRI. Driver comfort depends on how much of the pavement roughness is transmitted through a vehicle’s suspension to the driver and occupants. MRI predicts driver comfort by using an algorithm to simulate the suspension movement felt by the driver of a virtual car. The higher the MRI the more the driver feels roughness in the pavement. When evaluating the MRI of a pavement it should be remembered that the goal of MRI testing is to improve driver comfort. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 5-51
Chapter 5
Surface Treatments and Pavements
The Contractor is responsible for providing the inertial profiler and operator used for smoothness testing. To ensure the profiler is accurate and the measured profile is repeatable, the inertial profiler must have been certified within the last 12 months and the operator must have been certified within the last three years. Inertial profilers will either be certified by a certification facility or by another state. Profilers certified by a certification facility are required to display a decal or other approved marking as evidence of certification and the certification expiration date. If the inertial profiler is certified by another state, the Contractor is required to submit documentation verifying the profiler certification. Contact the State Pavement Office to verify that the certification meets the requirements of AASHTO R 56. The specifications require MRI testing on all lanes of cement concrete pavement 0.25 miles in length or longer. Ramps, tapers and shoulders are exempt from IRI testing. All cement concrete pavement must meet 10-foot straightedge requirements regardless of whether it is subject to MRI testing of not. The Contractor is responsible for collecting and analyzing the MRI data. The Contractor evaluates the profiles and submits the results to the Project Engineer for verification. Verification of the profile should include the following: 1. The filter setting used at the time of certification were used for the testing 2. The location of start, stop and excluded areas are correct 3. The MRI for each 52.8 foot (0.01 mile) segment has been measured (including excluded areas) 4. Incentive/disincentive is calculated correctly 5. Locations requiring corrective action are indentified. The Contractors data should be verified using the Ride Quality Analysis tool in ProVal. The Project Engineer should request verification testing if there is reason to believe the Contractors testing is not accurate. Contact the State Pavement Office for assistance using ProVal or verification testing. The Contractor is required to measure the smoothness of 52.8 foot segments that have an MRI greater than 125 inches per mile with a 10-foot straightedge. Locations that vary more than ⅛ inch from the lower edge of a 10-foot straightedge placed on the surface parallel to the centerline require corrective action. The goal of corrective action is to improve driver comfort by removing bumps that are causing the high MRI. If the Project Engineer determines that corrective action will not improve driver comfort the rough concrete pavement may be accepted with a credit as provided for in Section 5-05.5. Travel lanes that are not subject to incentives and disincentives for MRI testing are still required to meet straightedge requirements. The Contractor is required to check them no later than 5:00 pm following the day of paving. If these areas do not meet the straightedge requirement, corrective action is required.

Curing
Immediately following final finishing of the concrete or after free water leaves the surfaces, the curing compound should be applied. The purpose of curing, whatever method is used, is to prevent the loss of moisture required to hydrate the cement so that the concrete will gain its proper strength and durability. It is essential that a complete coverage of curing compound be applied to seal the exposed surface of the pavement. On most paving work, specifications will call for machine application of the curing compound. It should be seen that the spray nozzle is adequately protected from the wind by shielding so that the compound is not blown off the pavement surface. The Inspector shall check to see that the specified rate of coverage is obtained. The efficiency of the curing compound in preventing escape of moisture from the concrete is dependent upon the thickness of the membrane. For this reason, it is essential that the compound be evenly applied over the exposed surface at a rate of 1 gallon to not more than 150 square feet. Refer to Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(13) for additional requirements for curing. The curing membrane must be protected from damage by foot traffic or equipment. There is a certain amount of foot traffic required in sawing joints, operating the profiler and other operations. This traffic should be held to a minimum, and if damage from undue scuffing or other causes does occur, the area shall be re-sprayed with the required amount of curing compound. Care must be exercised so that curing compound is not sprayed into saw cuts, as the joint sealing compound will not adhere to the concrete in the joints if the curing compound is present. When pavement is being constructed in early spring or late fall, the Project Engineer must be alert to predictions of freezing weather, and see that the Contractor is prepared to protect the fresh concrete from freezing, as required in Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(14). When special protection against freezing is required, the protective earth or straw covering must be placed against the sides of steel forms, if used, as well as on the surface of the pavement, since steel offers poor insulation to the change in temperature. SS 5-05.3(17)
Opening to Traffic
Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(17) covers the requirements for opening cement concrete pavement to traffic. During the curing period designated for the concrete mix, the pavement must be properly barricaded to close it to all traffic. If necessary, the Contractor may be required to furnish a person to prevent traffic from using the pavement. When the pavement has developed a compressive strength of 2500 psi, as determined from cylinders made at the time of placement, it may be opened to traffic. The pavement should be cleaned either by brooming or a pickup sweeper prior to opening.

Repair of Defective Pavement Slabs
Broken slabs, slabs with random cracks, nonworking joints near cracks, edge slumping and spalls along joints and cracks must be replaced or repaired prior to completion of joint sealing. Areas of concrete pavement that are identified as needing replacement or repair need to be reviewed by the Project Engineer to determine if a repair or replacement of the concrete is most appropriate in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 5-05.3(22). There are times that small defects or spalls in the concrete should not be repaired as the repair is worse than leaving small defects or spall alone. The Project Engineer shall consult with the State Construction Office in making the determination on which areas should be repaired, replaced or leaving small spalls or defects alone.

Bridge Construction De-Briefing Session In an attempt to continually improve the quality of bridge contract plans, specifications and estimates and to obtain feedback on engineering and construction practices, the Bridge and Structures Office is available to assist in conducting post construction De Briefing Sessions for “Capturing Lessons Learned.” The purpose of these De Briefing Sessions is to provide designers with feedback on positive things that worked well and things that could be improved. The Project Engineer, Bridge Technical Advisor, or Bridge Design Unit Manager should consider initiating a De-Briefing Session on those projects where they feel feedback to the designers would benefit the quality of future construction plans. Suggested projects include Bridge Rehabilitation Projects, Bridges with complex staging, substructure conditions, or new material applications. Suggested attendees at these sessions should include Region Project Office Staff, State Construction Office, Bridge and Structures Office, Design Consultants, and the Contractor involved in the structural work. The Bridge and Structures Office will assist the Project Engineer in organizing and facilitating the De-Briefing Session once it is agreed to go forward with a DeBriefing Session. The Project Engineer will be responsible for making all contacts with Contractor personnel. The Project Engineer should determine the timing of the De-Brief session with respect to the contract work. Scheduling the session too long after the contract work is complete may diminish the Contractor’s willingness to participate or recall of the issues for discussion. Scheduling a session too soon before completion of all contract related activities may cloud issues currently under discussion. The Project Engineer should exercise caution in selecting the proper timeframe for this session. More information on these sessions, including De-Brief Meeting guidelines, typical agenda, and De-Brief report outline, are available on the Bridge and Structures Office’s homepage at www.wsdot.wa.gov/eesc/bridge/cecw/index.cfm.
GEN 6-01.2
General Inspection Procedures The intent of the Contracting Agency inspection is to provide Quality Assurance (Q/A) for the work performed. Often this task creeps into the Quality Control (Q/C) function which is the contractor’s responsibility. There is usually no need for an inspector to observe the entire construction operation unless there are compelling reasons. Because of the wide variety of types and designs of structures, the Project Inspector should be thoroughly familiar with all of the Contract documents as they provide the specific materials requirements, dimensions, and other details that make each structure unique.

Set up part of the inspection documentation records in advance so that the actual dates, dimensions, quantities, and other values can be more easily filled in as the work progresses.
GEN 6-01.4
Safety Nets and Staging Fall arrest and protection shall be provided. Reference WAC 296-880 Fall restraint, fall arrest systems. A Fall Protection Work Plan shall be on site. Standard Specifications Section 1-05.6 requires the Contractor to furnish sufficient, safe, and proper facilities such as walkways, railings, ladders, and platforms for inspection of the work. The Project Engineer should insist that the Contractor provide safe facilities and should not permit WSDOT personnel on the project when it is not safe for them.
SS 6-01.2
Foundations Elevations of bottoms of footings, as shown in the plans are determined from information secured from test holes or borings or other sources. The Project Engineer shall observe the character of the materials removed to confirm the material is similar to that identified in the test borings. If the material is similar, they shall note the elevation of such material and approve the footing elevation. If the material differs from the test borings, the State Construction Office shall be consulted for an evaluation. Except in solid rock foundations, it is necessary to carry all footings well below any possible line of scour. Footings in streams are often carried to greater depths when hard material exists than they would be in the same material where danger of scour exists. Footings on solid rock shall be well keyed into the rock to prevent sliding of the structure. Keys should not be less than 1 foot deep and the rock surface should be rough so it has more value as a key. Arch abutments may be designed with bottoms on an inclined plane. Care must be taken that the rock or other material is cut as nearly as possible to the plane shown. If this cannot be done, the material should be removed to a satisfactory foundation, cross-sections taken and the State Construction Office should be advised and requested to secure a new design of the abutment. Material at the heel, or back of the abutment, shall be carefully removed and all loose material removed. In placing concrete in arch abutments, the concrete is placed directly against the undisturbed foundation material at the back of the abutment for the reason that an arch abutment is subject to very high vertical and horizontal loads. Footings in hard material are sometimes sloped or stepped. Steps must be carefully made and if the material is not hard enough to stand vertically the steps shall be inclined or beveled. The slope shall not be steeper than the angle of repose. Backfilling to level up foundations or to fill holes will not be allowed except by permission of the State Construction Office. Under certain conditions, permission will be granted to fill a hole with a lean concrete mix. If the design soil pressure is low, unsuitable material may be replaced by granular material compacted to 95 percent density. If there is no contract unit price for the replacement material, an agreed unit price must be secured by change order. Just prior to placing concrete, all loose material shall be removed and, if in the dry, shall be well sprinkled with water before concrete is placed.
SS 6-01.4 Appearance of Structures Bridge traffic barriers, curbs, bridge railings and rail bases shall be carefully aligned to give a pleasing appearance. See Section 6-06 for further instructions.

Chapter 6
Load Restrictions on Bridges Under Construction It is important that bridges under construction remain closed to all traffic, construction equipment, and material storage (that will not become part of the bridge span) until the Substructure and the Superstructure, through the bridge deck, are complete for the entire Structure. The Contractor may request to allow traffic, construction equipment and material loads (in addition to those that will become part of the bridge span) if it is necessary and safe to do so through a Type 2E Working Drawing. See the Standard Specification for the specific submittal requirements. Completion includes release of all falsework, removal of all forms, and attainment of the minimum design concrete strength and specified age of the concrete in accordance with the Standard Specifications. Once the Structure is complete, Section 1-07.7 shall govern all traffic loading, including vehicle traffic and construction equipment. The Contractor may only store material on a bridge span under construction that will become part of that bridge span. The material shall not be stored within the middle third of the span. At the request of the Engineer, the Contractor shall provide supporting documentation of all material loads. The reasoning for not allowing materials in the middle third of the span is to avoid overstressing girders. They do not have full capacity until the bridge deck gains strength and becomes composite with the girders.
SS 6-01.9
Working Drawings The Contractor is required to submit for review detailed plans for falsework, concrete forms, cofferdams, shoring, and cribbing. These plans must comply with the requirements of the contract plans and specifications and shall be designed under the supervision of or by a Washington State licensed professional engineer and shall bear their seal and signature. The Project Engineer should review the submittal, when appropriate, for the following content: 1. Ground line at time of construction when falsework, shoring, and cribbing are involved. 2. Horizontal clearances to adjacent roadways, existing structures, and railroads when shoring and cribbing are involved. A change order is required for any deviation from the contract. Deviation from a working drawing requires Headquarters' review and concurrence. Review of these submittals must be completed before the Contractor starts construction of the structure. If a project has a large number of working drawings associated with it the Project Engineer should talk to the contractor about prioritizing his submittals. The project engineer should share this information with the State Bridge and Structures Engineer so that the review process can be accomplished in the most efficient manner for the contractor. The Contractor shall submit drawings per the contract and Section SS 1-05.3 of this manual.

Chapter 6
Structures
The Project Engineer will review the plans to see that they comply with the submittal requirements of the contract and send any comments to the State Bridge and Structures Engineer (or Terminal Design Engineer) about any field conditions or contract deficiencies that would affect the checking of the plans. When pre-contract reviewed formwork plans are used, the Contractor shall submit a copy of the plans to the Project Engineer. The Project Engineer must then advise the Contractor that construction may proceed unless a field condition needs to be resolved before doing so. Forms for concrete deck on steel or prestressed concrete girder spans shall be fully supported on the girders. They shall in no case extend to the ground unless the steel girders are also supported on piles or posts. The Project Engineer shall see that the falsework and forms are constructed in accordance with the submitted plans. If it becomes necessary, or the Contractor desires to deviate from the submitted plans, a revised plan for review shall be submitted and the Contractor shall not start construction in accordance with the revised plan until the review is complete. All revisions to the plan shall be reviewed by the State Bridge and Structures Engineer (or Terminal Design Engineer) to ensure the structural integrity of the falsework and formwork.
SS 6-01.12
Final Cleanup When the structure is completed, the Contractor shall clean up the site and remove all materials and debris. The decks of the structures shall be clean. The Contractor shall level off and fine grade all excavated material not used for backfill, and fine grade around all piers, bents, abutments, and on slopes so that the entire site and structure is left in a clean and presentable condition. Unless environmental permits require otherwise, remove all falsework piling, cofferdams, shoring, curbs, and test piles to a minimum of 2 feet below the finished ground line. Removal limits within a stream or channel are described in Standard Specifications Section 2-09.3(3)D. After a permanent or temporary bridge or a bridge modification is complete and preferably before opened to traffic, the State Bridge and Structures Office’s Bridge Preservation Section needs to perform an inventory inspection. The purpose of this inspection is to field verify certain contract plan details, to provide a base-line condition assessment of the bridge, and to identify any potential problem features. When the bridge is nearing completion, two to four weeks before completion, the Project Engineer should notify the State Bridge Preservation Engineer of the anticipated completion date. The Bridge Preservation Engineer will make arrangements with the Project Engineer for an inventory inspection.
SS 6-01.16
Repair of Defective Work The purpose of this section is to contractually allow structural repairs without requiring a change order and to define requirements for structural repairs. It is not intended to overwrite or duplicate submittal requirements or require submittals for repairs described elsewhere in the Contract Documents.

Chapter 6
The WSDOT Project Engineer shall consult with the ASCE and an appropriate licensed professional engineer (such as the engineer-of-record, the Bridge Technical Advisor (BTA), the State Bridge Construction Engineer, etc.) to make a determination of whether a repair procedure that is not pre-approved requires engineering as well as whether a preapproved repair procedure is appropriate for use for the intended repair. Pre-approved repair procedures for precast and prestressed concrete plants are located in their annual approval document. They are reviewed and approved by the State Construction Office. The process is described in the WSDOT Materials Manual, Standard Practice QC 6 and QC 7. Working drawing submittals for repairs are primarily intended to provide the Engineer an opportunity to review and comment on repair procedures, facilitate proper inspection of the repair work, provide documentation of the repair, and assist the Engineer in preparation of the as-builts. All repairs shall be documented in the as-builts. When construction issues at precast/prestressed concrete plants and steel fabrication plants need to be expedited, the fabricator may prepare a problem resolution form describing the problem and proposed resolution. The fabricator notifies the WSDOT Fabrication Inspection Office and receives their concurrence the problem has been accurately described on the Problem Resolution document. The concurrence is noted on the problem resolution form. The document is then emailed to both the Contractor (the Contractor forwards this on to the Project Engineer) and to the WSDOT Construction Office. The email addresses “structuralsteelprr@wsdot.wa.gov” for steel structures and “precastprr@wsdot.wa.gov” for precast concrete structures distribute to all of the WSDOT Construction Engineers and to the WSDOT Seattle Inspection Office. The WSDOT Construction Office reviews the document and prepares a recommendation for the Project Engineer. The WSDOT Project Engineer and the WSDOT Construction Office work together to address the fabricators proposed problem resolution. The Project Engineer will send the approval (or disapproval) to the Contractor and the WSDOT Fabrication Inspection Office. SS 6-01.16(2)A Concrete Spalls and Poor Consolidation (Rock Pockets, Honeycombs, Voids, etc.) This pre-approved repair procedure requires the Engineer to make a determination of whether the intended repair may affect structural adequacy. The Project Engineer shall consult with the ASCE and an appropriate licensed professional engineer (such as the engineer-of-record, the Bridge Technical Advisor (BTA), the State Bridge Construction Engineer, etc.) to make this determination. Repairs that may be considered to affect structural adequacy include but are not limited to:
• Areas that extend deeper than the outer layer of reinforcement in members (or portions of members) that are or will be in compression such as columns, walls and portions of beams. Note that many repairs in compression areas will be able to be effective over time as the original un-damaged concrete creeps and transfers compression to the repair. This is especially true for high strength, low shrinkage repair materials.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 6-5

Structures
• Areas in concrete that are already loaded by subsequent actions such as prestressing, release of falsework, subsequent material placement, or applied earth pressure
• Areas with significant reinforcing steel damage, corrosion or section loss.
• Areas with significant overhead work
• Areas that have been previously repaired
• Areas adjacent to post-tensioning anchorages
• Areas with numerous or large spalls in the concrete surface The full extent of the damage may not be known until the damaged concrete is removed. For this reason the Contractor is directed to stop work after initial concrete removal. The Project Engineer may require the Contractor to submit a modified repair procedure. This may be appropriate when the area or volume of concrete is significantly greater than originally estimated or reinforcement/embedments are damaged or displaced. Other unforeseen conditions may also arise which may bring the validity of the pre-approved repair procedure into question. The Project Engineer should consult with the ASCE and appropriate licensed professional if it is suspected that the pre-approved repair is no longer appropriate. The Project Engineer can then require a revised repair procedure be submitted by the Contractor. Shrinkage-compensating repair materials are made with an expansive cement or expansive component system in which initial expansion, if properly restrained, offsets strains caused by drying shrinkage. Shrinkage-compensating repair materials may not be appropriate if the repair area will not sufficiently restrain the initial expansion of the repair material with forms, surrounding concrete and reinforcement passing through the repair area.

GEN 6-02.1
Use of Epoxy Resins Quite frequently, the use of epoxy resin systems on our projects is considered; either at the design stage or during the progress of a contract. Generally this use is in connection with repair of distressed concrete or in setting rebar. Epoxy resins are quite versatile materials and are capable of providing the answer to numerous bonding or grouting problems. However, like a number of products, there is a tendency to treat them as a universal cure-all and they occasionally are applied without proper consideration of inherent limitations. Epoxy systems are capable of providing many different properties through the formulation of their various components. To a certain extent, the systems can be tailored to fit the particular need and conditions of time, temperature, humidity, etc., that will prevail. Use of a material under conditions beyond those for which it was formulated can result in considerable trouble rather than benefit. Probably the greatest potential for trouble exists in the use of epoxies at temperatures below which a normal reaction can occur. Generally speaking, unless a specially formulated epoxy is being used, trouble can occur when application is attempted below 50°F.

WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Structures
Chapter 6
The State Materials Engineer is available as a technical resource on the use of such systems, in the resolution of pertinent problems should they occur during preliminary design considerations, or as a result of problems during construction. It is strongly recommended that any contemplated use of epoxy resin systems at application temperatures below 50°F be checked with the State Chemical Materials Engineer to forestall potential difficulties. If epoxy resin is used, the following elements need to be carefully checked by the Inspector:
• Proper mixing and curing of the epoxy resin.
• Temperature and/or moisture limitations of the epoxy being used.
• That the areas are clean and prepared in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
• That the epoxy covers the entire repair area.
• That the epoxy fills the entire space between bar and the hole (if bars are being set with epoxy resin).
• That the epoxy is still tacky (not set) when it is being used to bond two structural elements together (just before elements are put together). For setting rebar or anchors, it is best to determine the volume required to be filled by the epoxy and measure the epoxy being used. A method of measurement should be agreed to with the Contractor for inspection purposes. Also, occasional samples should be taken of the epoxy resin being placed to be sure it is setting up properly. If there is any question of filling the void or adequacy of the epoxy resin, the Inspector shall advise the Contractor, document the discussion, and report it to the Project Engineer.

SS 6-02.3(2) Proportioning Materials Mix design, proportioning, and mixing concrete is the responsibility of the Contractor. General information regarding proportioning and mixing concrete is provided in Appendix A at the end of this chapter to provide a better understanding of the variables involved. SS 6-02.3(2)A Mix Designs The Standard Specifications require the Contractor to provide a mix design for all classes of concrete specified in the Plans except for those accepted based on a Certificate of Compliance. The mix design should be submitted on Proposed Mix Design (DOT Form 350-040). The same concrete Mix Design No. may be used in several of a concrete suppliers Plants. Note that a unique identification for the mix design is comprised of the combination of the Mix Design Number and the Plant Number. The average 28day compressive strength shall be selected in accordance with ACI 301, Chapter 4, Section 4.2.3.3 and ACI 201 shall be used to determine proportions. The Project Engineer should review all Contractor proposed mix designs for conformance to the contract. Specific items to look for are:
• Total water soluble or acid soluble chloride ion content – Verify the water soluble or acid soluble chloride ion content complies with Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(2). WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

To assist with the mix design review process the State Materials Laboratory has developed mix design checklists that can be found at the following link; wwwi.wsdot.wa.gov/MatsLab The State Materials Laboratory is available to assist with the review of the concrete mix designs. SS 6-02.3(4) Ready Mix Concrete SS 6-02.3(4)A Qualification of Concrete Suppliers All concrete production facilities which produce concrete other than commercial concrete or lean concrete will be prequalified. Commercial concrete and lean concrete may be batched in production facilities which are not prequalified. The concrete production facility prequalification requires certification by the National Ready Mix Concrete Association (NRMCA). Information concerning NRMCA certification may be obtained from the NRMCA at 900 Spring Street, Silver Springs, MD 20910 or online at www.nrmca.org. The NRMCA certification shall be valid for a two year period from the date of certification. The Contractor is required to submit Request for Approval of Materials Source (Form 350-071) listing the name and location of the plant which will supply the concrete and also the source of the cement, aggregates, and admixtures that will be used in the concrete. Concrete from the plant shall not be used until the plant has been approved. The Project Engineer shall take approval action based upon the batch plant prequalification submittal meeting the requirements of the Standard the Approved Source of Material Listing. If the batch plant prequalification submittal indicates that the scale certification has expired the Project Engineer shall confirm that the scales have been recertified or the source will not be approved.

Chapter 6
Whenever ready mix concrete is used on the project, the Inspector shall be alert to the condition of the trucks being used for delivery. All trucks used for delivery of concrete (other than commercial concrete or lean concrete) must be preapproved prior to use on the project. Preapproval of delivery trucks is a part of the plant approval process described in Section 6-2.2A. Approved trucks will be identified on an NRMCA truck list for plant manager inspected facilities. Approved trucks will be identified by an NRMCA sticker (for the years of approval) for NRMCA approved facilities. In some cases an approved truck may not have yet received an NRMCA sticker. In these cases, the ready-mix producer shall notify the Project Engineer in writing that the truck has passed NRMCA inspection, and is approved for use. The Inspector should verify that all delivery trucks meet the requirements of Standard All delivery must have operational revolution counters and a device to measure the amount of water added at the site. All trucks are required to be operated within the rated capacity stated on the manufacturer’s data plate. The Inspector needs to check the concrete as it is being discharged down the chute to ensure that the concrete is uniformly mixed. If the concrete does not appear uniformly mixed, the Inspector can request that the concrete producer re-inspect the truck. If the concrete delivery truck cannot deliver uniformly mixed concrete, the delivery truck needs to be rejected. When necessary, the Project Office shall make an inspection of the batch plant to confirm: the accuracy of the batching process; that the scales have current certifications; the accuracy of the water metering devices; and to sample the coarse aggregate and fine aggregate. SS 6-02.3(4)D
Temperature and Time for Placement
The purpose of upper temperature limits of concrete for placement is to limit the ultimate temperature of the concrete reached during cement hydration and curing. This in turn tends to reduce the thermal differential between the ambient environment and the concrete. The reduction in the thermal differential helps reduce cracking of the concrete by limiting tensile strains. Cracking, particularly in decks, reduces the durability of the concrete and reinforcement. Some techniques that concrete producers can use to meet the upper temperature for placement limit for concrete include:
• using minimum cement content,
• using pozzolans (such as fly ash) to replace a portion of the cement,
• using water-reducing admixtures,
• using air-entrainment,
• using large aggregate,
• shielding aggregate piles from direct sunlight,
• using cold water or chipped ice for mixing water,
• using liquid nitrogen.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 6-11
Chapter 6
Structures
While ideally the temperature of Class 4000D concrete for placement will be below 75 degrees F, it may be difficult for concrete producers to achieve this, especially during the warmer summer months. The specification allows the Engineer to approve requests from the Contractor to exceed the 75 degree F upper limit for placement, up to a maximum of 80 degrees F. Before allowing this, the Project Engineer shall obtain the approval of the ASCE. Circumstances that may warrant raising the upper temperature placement limit include:
• Concrete placements that begin consistently within the specification limits, but placement temperature rises later on
• Concrete that is within specification limits at discharge from the truck, but is subsequently heated past specification limits by placement with a concrete pump
• Time delays for placing concrete where trucks wait at the jobsite and heat up
• Availability of ice
• Expense and construction/safety risks of liquid nitrogen SS 6-02.3(5) Acceptance Concrete The Contractor is required to provide a certificate of compliance for each load of concrete delivered to the job. Based on who is supplying the mix, the format of the certification may vary. All certifications must contain the information required by the Standard Specifications. If a Contractor Certification sheet is not provided by the Contractor, the form provided by WSDOT may be used. Example forms are available as follows:
• Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance for Ready Mix Concrete (DOT Form 450-001)
• Proposed Mix Design (DOT Form 350-040) A Certificate of Compliance is all that will be required for acceptance of commercial and lean concrete. It is advised that as inspectors are collecting the Certificate of Compliance (batch ticket), they do a visual inspection of the concrete. Visual inspection should verify that the items listed on the batch ticket are included in the mix. If the concrete does not appear satisfactory for its intended use, it should be rejected. Prior to Placement It is the responsibility of the Inspector to compare the actual batch weights on the concrete delivery ticket to the proposed mix design weights. The cement, coarse and fine aggregate weights are required to meet the following tolerances: Concrete batch volumes less than or equal to 4 cubic yards: Cement Aggregate
+5 percent and -1 percent +10 percent and -2 percent
Concrete batch volumes greater than 4 cubic yards: Cement Aggregate
Page 6-12
+5 percent and -1 percent +2 percent and -2 percent

Chapter 6
If the total cementitious material weight is made up of different components, the component weights shall be within the following tolerances of the amount specified in the mix design: Portland cement weight Fly ash weight Microsilica weight
+5 percent and -1 percent +5 percent and -5 percent +10 percent and -10 percent
For all mix designs the water weight shall not exceed the maximum water specified in the mix design. These batching tolerances apply to all mixes. Acceptance testing will be performed by WSDOT in accordance with WSDOT standard test methods and Field Operating Procedures. Lean concrete and commercial concrete will be accepted based on a Certificate of Compliance, provided by the supplier as described in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(5)B. All other concrete will be accepted based on conformance to the requirements for temperature, slump, air content for concrete placed above finished ground line, and the specified compressive strength at 28 days. The Inspector must be familiar with the type of concrete mix and who is responsible for the mix. The Contractor is responsible for the mix design and is responsible for 28 day strength. The Inspector must be prepared to test materials for conformance. The Inspector must also be prepared to deal with nonconformance. Preparation as a concrete testing inspector requires knowledge of concrete properties and construction procedures. Knowledge of how to use testing equipment and understanding the reliability of testing is also important. A continual evaluation of the testing equipment is needed to be sure it is operating and performing as required. Care and caution are recommended when transporting testing equipment and handling test materials, i.e., cylinders, molds, fresh concrete cylinders, and other samples). Slump Acceptance The maximum slump for vibrated and nonvibrated concrete is listed in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(4)C. When a high range water reducer (super plasticizer) is used, the maximum slump limit may be increased an additional 2 in while the concrete is affected by the admixture. Air Content Acceptance All cast-in-place concrete above the finished ground line shall be air entrained. The air content shall be a minimum of 4.5 percent and a maximum of 7.5 percent, unless otherwise specified. When commercial concrete is placed in sidewalks, curbs, and gutters, air content is very important. It is recommended that the inspector perform air content testing sufficient to ensure that the concrete has between 4.5 and 7.5 percent air entrainment. The Contractor may elect to use air entrained concrete below finished ground line. If so, the 28-day compressive strength shall meet the requirements for the class of concrete specified.

Placement Time It is the Inspector’s job to ensure that:
• The concrete is placed in the forms as soon as possible after mixing, but no later than 1.5 hours after cement is added to the mix.
• The concrete is always plastic and workable while being placed.
• The concrete is placed continuously with interruptions no longer than 30 minutes.
• Each layer of concrete is placed and consolidated before the preceding layer takes initial set. Initial set has begun if the vibrator will not penetrate the preceding layer under its own weight while being operated. The discharge time may be extended to 1.75 hours if the temperature of the concrete being placed is less than 75°F. With the approval of the Project Engineer, this may be extended to two hours, if the temperature of the concrete being placed is less than 75°F. If it is apparent that the 30-minute time limit will be exceeded for a continuous pour, a construction joint should be established. The State Construction Office shall be contacted when this occurs. A vibrator can be used to determine if initial set has taken place when evaluating the need for a construction joint as described previously. In certain instances, it may be difficult to meet the above criteria due to long transit times. The Standard Specifications allow the Contractor the option of requesting in writing to extend the time for discharge. The extension of time will be considered on a case by case basis and requires the use of specific retardation admixtures and coordination with the State Construction Office. Point of Acceptance Acceptance tests for specification compliance are to be determined from samples taken at the discharge of the placement system for bridge decks, overlays, bridge approach slabs, and barriers, and at the truck discharge for all other placement. For bridge decks, overlays, bridge roadway slabs, bridge approach slabs, and barriers, acceptance samples should be taken as close to the point of deposition as possible. (e.g., taking a sample from the end of a pump down below the bridge instead of up on the deck is not acceptable as it may have substantially different characteristics.) If a pump is used as a placement system, the initial acceptance test must be delayed until the pump has been cleared of all initial priming slurry. Do not allow placement of pump slurry in the forms. The Inspector should arrive in advance of the concrete placement and prepare the testing location. It is the Contractor’s responsibility to provide adequate and representative samples of the fresh concrete to a location designated by the Engineer. Above all, the equipment must be in good working condition with records of the last calibrations for the air meter and scales. The Inspector should have all the information, including the mix design, and all the forms needed for documentation of the placement operation.

Test Cylinders Concrete test cylinders shall be molded in forms conforming to the requirements for single use molds as detailed in ASTM M 205. Cardboard test cylinder molds shall not be used. See Chapter 9 for instructions for making, curing, and shipping concrete test cylinders and for the number of test cylinders to be made. Extra cylinders that are tested for early removal of forms and falsework shall be the responsibility of the Contractor. Early cylinders are cylinders tested in advance of the design age of 28 days. Their purpose is to determine the in place strength of concrete in a structure prior to applying loads or stresses. The Contractor shall retain an independent testing laboratory to perform this work. This lab shall be approved by the Engineer. The cylinders shall be cured in accordance with WSDOT FOP for AASHTO R 100. Special cure boxes to enhance cylinder strength will not be allowed. The number of early cylinder breaks shall be in accordance with the Contractors need and as approved by the Engineer. Prior to the removal of any forms, the Contractor is required to furnish the Engineer with all test results. Forms shall not be removed without approval of the Engineer. If set retarders are used in a mix, the State Materials Lab should be consulted for curing, handling, and storage instructions prior to use. Retesting Concrete Once the Contractor has turned over the concrete for acceptance testing, no more mix adjustment will be allowed. The concrete will either be accepted or rejected. Multiple Placements from One Concrete Truck Only one set of acceptance tests are required per concrete truck. SS 6-02.3(6) Placing Concrete A Concrete Placement Checklist was developed as an inspection aid and is available on the State Construction Office SharePoint site in the Construction Manual Resources folder. If it is necessary or desirable to place structural concrete in service prior to the time stated in the Standard Specifications, authority must be obtained from the State Construction Office. In such cases, test cylinders from each pour are taken and tested by the Contractor to determine the early break strength. All sawdust, nails, dirt, and other foreign material, including ponded water, must be removed from within the forms and the forms shall be inspected and approved before placing any concrete. The bottom of footings and forms must be thoroughly soaked with water prior to placing the concrete so they do not absorb water from the concrete mix. Care must be taken to be sure there is no ponded water when placing the concrete.

Concrete in all reinforced footings shall be placed in the dry. All reinforcing, including vertical wall or shaft bars and dowels, shall be securely fastened in place before placing of concrete begins. Driving of dowel bars into concrete must not be permitted, except in seal concrete when the seal is also the footing block, but they must be placed immediately after the concrete is placed. The placing and spacing of footing reinforcing steel is as important as in any other part of the structure. Care must be exercised in placing reinforcing steel in the columns where it splices with the dowel bars into the footings. In many instances, if the dowel bars and column bars are not carefully placed, there is not enough space between the steel bars for proper placement of concrete. Considerable care must be taken in placing and vibrating the concrete in the columns so that no rock pockets are formed. Column details must be strictly adhered to since they are critical to the earthquake resistance of the bridge. Care must be taken in placing and vibrating the concrete of sloping walls or columns to get proper consolidation and to avoid rock pockets. Figure 6-1 Vacant
Concrete shall be placed in one continuous operation from top of footing to bottom of pier cap or crossbeam unless construction joints are shown in the plans or preapproved by the State Construction Office. Concrete shall be placed at the rate for which the formwork is designed. This rate, in ft of height per hour along with the concrete temperature, should be stated on the falsework plans. Spacing of studs, wales and form ties shall be as shown on the falsework plans. Rails, barriers, and parapets on retaining walls shall not be placed until all backfilling is completed. Vibrators shall be used at all times when placing concrete, unless otherwise specified. SS 6-02.3(6)A Weather and Temperature Limits to Protect Concrete Concrete may not be placed when rain is hard enough to:
• Cause a muddy foundation.
• Wash or flow the concrete. The temperature of the concrete for cast-in-place concrete must be between 55°F and 90°F during placement. The temperature for precast concrete that is heat cured must be between 50°F and 90°F. The air temperature must be at least 35°F during and for seven days after placement (unless the contractor has a cold weather plan in place). The temperature measuring device shall be capable of measuring the temperature of freshly mixed concrete to ±1°F with a range of 0°F to 130°F. SS 6-02.3(6)A1
Hot Weather Protection
• Cool the component materials of the mix, transport and placement equipment, and the contact surfaces at the site.
• Methods shall be reviewed prior to implementation.

Chapter 6
When the concrete is being placed in the bridge deck during hot weather, additional precautions must be taken in order to prevent surface evaporation. See Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(6)A for estimated evaporation rates. The temperature of the concrete at the time it is placed in the forms must be kept under 90°F. Concrete with high temperature loses slump rapidly and is difficult to place and finish. This temperature can be controlled by shading the concrete trucks while loading and unloading and shading the conveyors or pump lines used in placing the concrete. The forms and reinforcing steel should be cooled prior to placing the concrete. This can be done by covering them with damp burlap and then spraying them with cool water immediately prior to placing the concrete. Care must be taken to see there is no standing water in the forms when the concrete is placed. Water reducing retarder admixture should be used in the concrete so the water-cement ratio and slump of the concrete can be maintained within the specification limits. The mixing time of the concrete should be held to the minimum. The concrete must be placed and finished as soon as possible. If there is a delay in applying the curing compound after the concrete has been finished, a fog spray should be applied to reduce the moisture loss due to evaporation. If plastic cracks form and the concrete is still in a plastic state, they can be eliminated by revibrating the concrete and refinishing. Care must be taken to not revibrate the concrete after initial set has been obtained. The requirements for curing the concrete shall be enforced. As soon as the visible bleed water has evaporated from the finished deck, the curing compound should be applied. The curing compound should be applied in two applications to ensure full coverage of the concrete. The second coat should be applied in a direction perpendicular to that of the first application. The amount of curing compound applied in the two applications should meet the minimum amount specified. Immediately after application of the curing compound and initial set, the concrete deck should be covered in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(11). In summary, the difficulties arising from hot weather concreting may usually be minimized by: 1. Using cool mixing water. 2. Keeping the aggregate temperature as low as is economically feasible. 3. Reducing the length of mixing time. 4. Placing the concrete as soon as possible after mixing and with a minimum of handling. 5. Keeping the surfaces shaded during placing. 6. Placing curing compound as soon as possible. SS 6-02.3(6)A2
Cold Weather Protection
• Concrete shall not be placed against any frozen or ice-coated foundation, forms, or reinforcement.
• A plan for cold weather placement and curing is required, if temperatures are below 35°F or anticipated to be below 35°F in the next seven days.
• Heat aggregate and/or water to maintain mix temperatures above 55°F. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 6-17
Chapter 6
Structures
• Control temperature and humidity after placement by: – Enclosing concrete. – Heating to 50°F to 90°F for seven days. – Add moisture for six days (discontinue 24 hours before heat is stopped). – An accurate recording thermometer is required. – Corners and edges require special attention to prevent freezing. When heating water and aggregates, the approximate resulting temperature for a batch of concrete can be estimated from the following formula: X=
Wt + 0.22W′t W+ 0.22W′
Where X W
= =
temperature of the batch weight of the water
W′ t t′
= = =
weight of the aggregates and cement temperature of the water in degrees F temperature of the aggregates and cement
Several precautions must be taken when placing concrete in cold weather. If temperatures below 35°F are anticipated within seven days following placing the concrete, the Contractor will normally be required to enclose the structure and provide heat and moisture so the concrete will obtain its initial strength without freezing. The addition of moisture should be discontinued 24 hours before discontinuing the heat so there will not be an excess of moisture on the surface of the concrete to form ice in case of cold weather following the seven-day protection. If the temperature is below 35°F when placing the concrete, the concrete must be heated to at least 60°F by heating the aggregate and/or water in accordance with the Standard Specifications. The temperature of the concrete, as well as the slump, must be consistent from batch to batch. When heating water and aggregates, the resulting temperature for a batch of concrete can be computed from the formula in Section 6-2.3A(1). SS 6-02.3(6)B
Placing Concrete in Foundation Seals
When constructing foundations in streams and other locations below water, it is usually necessary to place a concrete seal in the cofferdam so that the cofferdams may be dewatered. The weight of the concrete seal resists the buoyant force on the cofferdam when it is dewatered. Seal concrete is placed underwater by means of a tremie. Concrete pumps may be used. Handling of the tremie requires the use of a crane to raise and lower it into place. Hand winches are sometimes used in small seals but they must be equipped with a brake and drum for quick release and stop. The tremie pipe shall be at least 10 inch in diameter, made of heavy steel pipe, with flange or sleeve connections. Sleeve connections are preferable for seals placed in pile foundations. Flanges sometimes hang up on tops of piles and the concrete charge is lost.
Page 6-18
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Structures
Chapter 6
The tremie pipe must be absolutely water tight, at the joints as well as at the connections to the hopper. The hopper should be of at least, one-half cubic yard capacity. Before any concrete is placed, the bottom of the tremie pipe shall be sealed with a plug. A satisfactory plug can be made with a 2-inch board slightly larger in diameter than the tremie pipe; on top of this board fasten a ¾-inch round piece cut to the neat size of the inside of the pipe. Place a piece of cloth or burlap over the end of the pipe and drive the plug in place. Lower the tremie until the plug rests on the bottom, then fill the tremie pipe with concrete. When the tremie is raised the weight of the concrete will push out the plug. The plug can be salvaged by fastening a piece of wire to it before it is lowered into the water. Further details for handling a tremie are found in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(6)B. The thickness of seals without piling are generally not less than 0.43 times the height of high water above the bottom of seal. Seals in footing with piling require special design. The thickness of the seal is computed for the water elevation shown in the plans. The cofferdams must be designed and vented for this elevation. The design and vent elevations are noted in the plans. If concrete is placed in the seal during a period of high water, the dewatering of the cofferdam will have to be delayed until the water level drops to the vented elevation. No change in the vent elevation shown in the plans shall be allowed without approval from the State Construction Office. Such approval should be obtained before the cofferdam is designed. All cofferdams must be vented at the elevation used for computing the seal thickness in order to prevent an unsafe hydrostatic pressure on the seal. Cofferdams shall not be dewatered before the concrete has been placed and cured. The vertical sheathing of the cofferdam or shoring shall extend below the bottom of the excavation in accordance with the working drawings. Sheet piles in cofferdams shall be placed tightly together so that there will be no flow of water through the cofferdams while seal concrete is being placed. The tops of seals should slope slightly toward one end. At that end, provision shall be made for a sump for the pump intake. Cofferdams should be tightly constructed so that a minimum of pumping is required after the cofferdam has been dewatered. Space for water courses shall be provided on top of the seal and around the footing block, between the footing block and the walls of the cofferdam. Before starting to place seal concrete, all equipment should be checked to see that it is in good working order. It is necessary that concrete in a seal be placed continuously until completion, with the end of the tremie always extending into the fresh concrete. It is not desirable to leave cofferdam struts and waling in the seal concrete but it is sometimes necessary to do so, especially in soft foundation material, when a set of struts and waling is required near the bottom of the cofferdam. The concrete displaced by such struts and waling is not deducted from the Contractor’s pay items. After the cofferdam is dewatered, a film of scum or laitance will usually be found on top of the seal. This must be cleaned off before the footing concrete is placed. If the seal is designed as a footing, the laitance will have to be removed only from the areas that will support pier shafts, columns, or walls. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

SS 6-02.3(9) Vibration of Concrete Vibrators are usually specified to be used when placing concrete. Their use is important for the purpose of consolidating the concrete in the forms, thus producing a dense uniform concrete. Adequate vibration is necessary for placing concrete in difficult places, such as under and around closely spaced reinforcement. When steel forms are used for curbs, traffic barriers, or rail bases, external vibration may be required to eliminate voids at the surface caused by entrapped air. It is desirable to have the Contractor designate one person to operate the vibrator. This person could then be instructed in its use and an effort could be made to have that person kept on the same work whenever it is required. The quantity of mixing water to be used shall be the minimum amount possible to produce the required workability. Vibrators shall be used only in freshly placed concrete. As soon as the concrete is dumped it should be spread out and vibrated by inserting the vibrator torpedo directly into the fresh concrete. However, it should be kept in one place only long enough to make the concrete uniformly plastic. Dependence should not be placed on the vibrator to work the concrete into corners and along the faces of the forms. Metal or wooden spades should be used to whatever extent is necessary in places where the vibrator cannot be satisfactorily employed, however, spades should be used only to accomplish complete filling of the forms and not for the purpose of puddling the concrete. In regard to the desired consistency of concrete and the use of vibrators, the Standard Specifications should be carefully studied and followed. Every effort should be made to see that the specifications are followed. Concrete shall be placed in accordance with the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(6). The Inspector should be alert to see that any method of placing concrete that causes segregation of the concrete mix be discontinued. Some of the conveyor belt systems tend to cause segregation of the mix after several exchanges from one belt to another. The Inspector shall see that the length of conveyor belt is limited so segregation does not occur. Aluminum pipe or sheeting shall not be used in contact with fresh concrete. In heavily reinforced sections, the maximum concrete slump may be increased 2 inches with the use of a high range water reducer, as discussed in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(4)C. It is anticipated that possible candidates for this increase of concrete slump may be columns, cross-beams, and post-tensioned box girder web walls and other heavily reinforced members. SS 6-02.3(10)
Bridge Decks and Bridge Approach Slabs
Bridge deck construction is critical because this part of the structure receives the most abuse from traffic and the environment. Construction of maintenance-free bridge decks requires close attention to details. One or two weeks before placing the concrete in the deck, a placement conference should be held to go over the procedures to be used and to emphasize the critical areas of construction. As a minimum, this should include a discussion of the rate of placement, personnel and equipment and backup equipment to be used, type of finish, and curing details. The rate of placement should normally provide for at least 20 feet of finished deck per hour.

Chapter 6
The position of the reinforcing steel is very important because of the thin concrete section. Adequate blocking and ties are necessary to hold the steel in place. If foot traffic on the reinforcing steel causes it to deflect, the spacing of the chair supports is not adequate. A pre-check of the screed setting for proper elevations and clearances to the reinforcing steel is essential prior to any concrete placement. The finishing machine should be run the full length of the placement after the screed is adjusted to check deck thickness and cover of the reinforcing steel, this check should also continue over all bulkheads and expansion joints to verify their clearances. The finishing machine should not be adjusted while it is finishing concrete to clear bulkheads and expansion joints. These adjustments must be made prior to the concrete placement. During the placement, frequent checks should be made of the actual cover obtained directly behind the finishing machine and recorded in the Inspector’s Daily Report. Quality concrete is required, particularly in the bridge deck. Uniform consistency of the concrete should be maintained throughout the placement. The water-cement ratio is very important. It should be the minimum possible to produce the required workability and not exceed the specification limit. To keep the water-cement ratio as low as possible, the specifications require the use of a water reducing additive for all bridge deck concrete. Frequent checks of the free water contained in the aggregates is necessary to determine the amount of water actually contained in the concrete mix. SS 6-02.3(10)A Preconstruction Meeting Construction of crack-free and maintenance-free bridge decks requires close attention to details during concrete placement and curing. One or two weeks before placing the concrete in the deck, a pre-deck pour meeting shall be held to go over the procedures to be used and to emphasize the critical areas of construction. Points of discussion should include concrete delivery and sampling, placement rates, personnel and equipment to be used, finishing, and curing details. The placement and operation of the temperature measuring and recording devices should also be discussed. The rate of placement should normally provide for at least 20 feet of finished deck per hour. Attendance at the pre-deck pour meeting should include: 1. Representing the Contractor, the superintendent, foremen in charge of placing and finishing concrete, a representative from the concrete supplier and the pump truck operator. 2. Representing WSDOT, the Project Engineer, Chief Inspector and key inspection and testing personnel. A representative from the State Construction Office should be invited. A sample pre-deck pour meeting agenda for use by the Project Office can be found on the Construction Manual Resources website. SS 6-02.3(10)D
Concrete Placement, Finishing and Texturing
Finishing of roadway slab and bridge approach slab surfaces shall be as outlined in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(10). The principal objectives to be attained are a good wearing surface and a smooth riding roadway. The Engineer should ensure that adequate preparation has been made to do a good job in accordance with the specifications. The Engineer should insist that a float be available. When a good strike-off
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

Structures
and finish has been obtained by a finishing machine, floating may be, and should be, kept to a minimum because excess floating can be detrimental. A light aluminum float carefully and sparingly used will not harm a well finished deck, but will expose poor adjustment and misuse of a good machine. It will also smooth out mortar ridges left by the finishing machine and seal the surface. The Contractor is required to check the deck with a 10-ft straightedge immediately after it is floated. Low and high spots can possibly be corrected by operating the finishing machine over the area (if the concrete is still plastic). The Engineer should be cautioned that hard floating of the concrete surface with aluminum floats may cause a chemical reaction between the aluminum and the fresh concrete which could decrease the strength of the concrete at the surface of the concrete. Excessive wear or pitting of the aluminum float could be an indication that chemical reaction is taking place between the float and the concrete. It is important that the texturing comb be used when the concrete is at the proper consistency. If the concrete is too soft, it will not retain the proper texture obtained by the comb and, if the concrete is too hard, the proper texture will not be achieved. The comb should be set up and ready to use well in advance of the time it will be required. Surface texturing is normally done with a comb except when an overlay is required. The finished and cured deck slabs must be checked with a 10-ft straightedge and corrected by cutting down the high spots and building up low spots until the entire surface comes within the specified tolerance. Sidewalks shall be finished smooth with a wood float and then brushed with a fine bristle brush. Use an edger tool at all joints and edges. Block lines on sidewalk surfaces are not desired on structures. SS 6-02.3(10)D3
Concrete Placement
During concrete bridge deck placement, it is important that the amount of concrete placed in front of the finishing machine be kept to a minimum, so it is placed, consolidated, and struck off before it starts to set. Set time may vary depending on a number of factors. The Standard Specifications specify that the rate of placement is such that the concrete is placed, consolidated, and struck off within 30 minutes, unless otherwise accepted by the Engineer at the pre-deck pour meeting. The Contractor should know by the pre-deck pour meeting if they will require more than 30 minutes and may request an extension at that time. One example of when they may need to place more concrete in front of the finishing machine is for bridges with extreme skews where concrete is placed to preload girders and equalize girder deflections. The timing should still be as minimal as possible. SS 6-02.3(11) Curing Concrete Proper curing of concrete is important to securing strong, good wearing concrete and in reducing cracking. Curing periods and methods specified should be strictly observed. The last step in ensuring a good concrete job is to provide proper curing. Concrete begins to cure from the time cement and water are added in the mixing chamber and continues for many years after. Concrete is very susceptible to damage during initial curing, if proper steps are not taken. Three of the most important factors are: Page 6-22
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Structures
Chapter 6
1. Surface drying (evaporation). 2. Rapid temperature changes between segments of the concrete as it is curing. 3. Stresses or loads applied before the concrete has reached adequate strength. All of the specifications regarding curing, form removal, hot and cold weather concreting, etc., are designed to provide protection for the concrete during this critical stage. For example: If the surface begins to dry, the surface will begin to shrink and cracking can occur. To prevent this, the Inspector should be aware that fog misting, curing compounds, wet blankets, plastic sheeting, etc., are designed to be applied before surface drying begins to prevent loss of surface moisture. Some concrete mixes such as microsilica and latex are very susceptible to surface drying and require closer attention due to the effects of thin lift application. Note: Curing compounds are not chemicals that cure concrete. They prevent water loss by forming a waterproof membrane. Two Classes (A and B) and Types (1 and 2) of curing compounds are used depending on what is being cured. Class A is a wax resin type of curing compound which can hamper bonding of HMA and pigmented sealer and can cause concrete surfaces to be slick; it is therefore not allowed on travelled surfaces such as bridge decks, bridge approach slabs, and sidewalks. Type 2 curing compound is generally desired because it is white and will reflect solar heat, and it is easier to verify that application quantity is sufficient. Type 1 (clear) is specified when aesthetics are of concern or removal isn’t required. For bridge decks, it is extremely important to keep the finished surface fogged until presoaked burlap can be applied. Also, the burlap should continue to be fogged until soaker hoses and white, reflective sheeting is placed. The presoaked burlap should be applied within one hour after the finishing machine has passed, unless otherwise accepted in the cold weather protection plan or by the Engineer during deck casting. Cold weather and mix design constituents can slow concrete set time, and placing burlap onto concrete that has not attained initial set can damage the deck surface. Like most materials, concrete expands when heated and contracts when cooled. Therefore, the concrete should not be subjected to extreme temperature changes as hardening takes place. Hardening of concrete is also slowed down by cooler weather. Concrete must not be exposed to freezing conditions to avoid permanent damage. Concrete (as it hardens) contains a high percentage of moisture and could crack if the water in the mix freezes and expands. Air entrainment will not protect the concrete from damage during the initial curing period. Summary 1. Prevent surface moisture loss. 2. Maintain constant temperature (no freezing). 3. Prevent stress loads.

Construction Joints
The specifications require that construction joints shall be located and constructed as shown in the plans. Approval to add, move, or delete construction joints must be obtained from the State Construction Office. Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(12) requires that shear keys shall be provided at all construction joints unless a roughened surface is shown in the plans, and where the size of keys is not shown in the plans, they shall be approximately one third of the area of the joint and approximately 1½ inches deep. Construction joints are to be either vertical or horizontal. Wire mesh, wire lath, and other similar items can be used for a roughened surface construction joint but shall be removed and the joint cleaned before making the adjacent pour. Construction joints in roadway slabs and approach slabs must be formed vertical and in true alignment. An edger shall not be used on the joint but lips and edgings must be removed before making the adjacent pour. If the joint is properly formed, a good straight edge will be obtained with a minimum amount of lips and edgings to be removed. Shear keys in construction joints shall be formed with 1½ inch thick lumber and shall be constructed the full size shown in the plans. For box girder webs, these shear keys are normally shown in the plans to be full width between stirrups. The specifications require shear key forms to be left in place at least 12 hours after the concrete has been placed. The plans will indicate certain joints to have a roughened surface. These joints shall be finished and prepared for the next pour in accordance with the instructions given in the specifications or as shown in the plans. Expansion dams or the expansion dam blockout shall be carefully placed before concreting the roadway decks. They shall also be carefully aligned for crown and grade. Blockouts for expansion joint seals must be carefully formed to the dimensions shown in the plans for proper placement and operation. Be sure to check that the rebar in the blockout does not conflict with the expansion joint anchors. The joint seal must be placed using a lubricant adhesive. SS 6-02.3(13)
Expansion Joints
Bridge expansion joints are installed to accommodate bridge movements while preventing water, salt, and debris infiltration to substructure elements below, thus they must be installed watertight. The Standard Specifications require strip seal and compression seal systems to be tested for watertightness by providing a 3 inch minimum head of water for at least one hour. In practice, this is often accomplished by building a trough with plastic sheeting and sandbags and applying a stream of water sufficient to maintain the required water head. Roadway cross-slopes often make it impractical to test the entire joint at once. This can be remedied by performing the test in sections along the joint. During the test, the expansion joint should be observed from the underside for any signs of leakage. In the case of joints behind abutments without underside access, the joint should be observed from the sides and front face of the abutment. Any amount of water observed is cause for repair.

Finishing Concrete Surfaces
As soon as possible after the forms are stripped, the concrete surfaces shall be examined and all lips or edgings where form boards have met, shall be removed with a stone or sharp tool. Bolt holes and rock pockets shall be filled with cement mortar and floated to a smooth finish. The mortar patch shall be the same color as the adjoining concrete surfaces. Finishing of concrete surfaces shall be done in accordance with the provisions of the Standard Specifications and special provisions. The amount of work necessary to complete the finishing satisfactorily, depends entirely on the quality of the original concrete work. If the forms have been poorly constructed and the concrete surfaces are rough and uneven, it will be necessary for the Contractor to do sufficient rubbing and finishing after the forms are removed to secure a satisfactory job. Grinding leaves a surface that is off color and should be kept to a minimum. The primary purposes of finishing formed surfaces are:
• To seal the surface from water and other elements that can rust or corrode metal ties and reinforcement within the concrete.
• To provide a uniform, pleasing appearance for surfaces that will remain visible to the public. There are two different classes of finish. They are: Class 1
• All rail bases, curbs, traffic barriers, pedestrian barriers, and ornamental concrete members.
• As designated in the Plans and in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(14). Class 2
• Required for all other surfaces. See the Standard Specifications for additional requirements. SS 6-02.3(17)
Forms and Falsework
Falsework construction is a critical part of the bridge construction process. Generally, the factor of safety used for design of falsework is less than that of permanent construction. Therefore, it is extremely important that the falsework is constructed in accordance with the falsework drawings. Any changes to the falsework drawings must be reviewed by the Bridge and Structures Office. The forms for the structure shall be constructed in accordance with the falsework and form plans and the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(17). In general, the forms used for all concrete surfaces which will be exposed, shall be faced with plywood. All plywood used shall be exterior type except where CDX is allowed by the specifications. All forms have to be strong enough to hold the plastic concrete in place until it has hardened. Forms should be designed to permit easy removal without damage to the concrete. Forms are a critical part of the concrete bridge construction process. Generally, the factor of safety used for design of forms is less than that of permanent construction. Therefore, it is extremely important that the forms are constructed in WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

accordance with the form drawings. Any changes to the form drawings shall be reviewed by the State Bridge and Structures Office. The Contractor is responsible for designing and constructing the forms and falsework for fixed-form concrete. The Contractor must submit detailed plans and calculations in accordance with Section 6-02.3(16): Prior to placing concrete, the Inspector should verify that all forms:
• Provide forming faces that are: – Smooth and firm. – Clean of dirt, laitance, oil, or any other material that would contaminate or discolor the concrete. – Treated with an approved form-release agent.
• Are mortar tight to avoid any leakage (including tape or caulking if needed for surfaces that will require Class 2 finish).
• Are constructed in accordance with the forming plans.
• Are adequately rigid and well supported to hold and retain the concrete without distortion or displacement.
• Are set at the locations, dimensions, lines, and grades as specified in the plans. If wood forms are used, see that plywood is used for the form faces with:
• The joints and grain generally in line with the line of the structure.
• The face grain of the plywood running perpendicular to the supports.
• No offsets or projections that would leave an impression in the concrete surface. Also verify that:
• Uniform chamfer strips are set at the correct line and grade as required for filleted edges.
• Adequate tie rods, snap-ties, hairpins, studs, walers, and braces are securely placed as needed support. If metal or fiberglass forms are used, the same basic requirements apply, but particularly check for:
• Any dents or other defects that would harm the uniformity of the concrete surface.
• Any rust or other foreign material that would discolor the concrete surface.
• Countersunk bolts and rivet heads.
• Adequate support clamps, rods, and pins. Prior to placing any reinforcing or concrete loads on the falsework, verify that:
• The bottom of the falsework is set on a solid foundation, with mudsills, minimum pile diameter, etc., all constructed per plans.
• The upper portion provides firm, uniform support.
• Devices such as screw-jacks and wedges are used to hold the forms at the correct elevation, and that they are free from defects, and undamaged or not bent.

• When wedges are used, they are placed in pairs to provide uniform bearing.
• The falsework construction is in accordance with the falsework plans and the Standard Specifications. Major failures with loss of life have occurred as a result of poor falsework and formwork construction. It is critical that the Inspector check these temporary structural elements very carefully. Any deficiencies must be corrected before construction loads are applied. If there is a question, the State Bridge and Structures, Construction Support Engineer, or the State Construction Office should be contacted. Suggested acceptance tolerances are as follows: 1. Bridges and similar structures: a. Variation from the plumb or the specified batter in the lines and surfaces of columns, piers, walls, and abutments. Exposed, in 10 feet 			 Backfilled, in 10 feet

Forms for concrete surfaces which will be exposed shall be treated with a parting compound consisting of a chemical release agent. Form oil or other oils shall not be used. The parting compound shall be applied before the reinforcing steel is placed. The forms shall be thoroughly wetted on both sides in advance of placing the concrete.

The basic requirements for the removal of any forms and falsework are that:
• The curing temperature was above 50°F during the cure period and that strength is adequate.
• No forms or falsework may be removed until the minimum time has been met as listed in Section 6-02.3(17)N or as authorized by the Engineer.
• All forms and falsework must be removed unless there is no access for removal (i.e., inside a box girder bridge).
• All forms and falsework must be removed in a manner that will not damage the structure. Timing is a key consideration in the removal of forms and falsework. In terms of curing, the concrete, forms, and falsework must remain until the concrete has sufficient strength to support itself. For finishing purposes, it is generally better to remove the forms as early as possible to finish the surface while it is still green. Therefore, the timing of falsework and form removal depends largely on the type of structure as well as how it is cured and finished. If forms are removed during the required curing period, the Contractor shall provide the required curing method to the exposed concrete surface as described in Section 6-02.3(11). SS 6-02.3(24)
Reinforcement
For most concrete structures, some type of reinforcement is required to resist high tension stresses. Reinforcing materials include:
• Uncoated deformed steel bars, which are most commonly used.
• Other types, such as welded wire reinforcement epoxy-coated bars, wire, prestressing cable. Note: Epoxy-coated bars require special handling to prevent damage to the coating.
• Wire ties and other devices to securely hold the reinforcement in place. The Contractor is responsible for determining and ordering quantities from the plans. As reinforcing steel is delivered and stored at the project site, the Inspector should verify that:
• All positioning, spacing, sizes, lengths, shapes, and splice locations conform with the plans.
• Any field bending is done as specified and any cracked or split bars are rejected. If in doubt, reject the bar in question. The Inspector should verify that the reinforcing placed is:
• Tied at all intersections if bar spacing is 1 ft or more.
• Tied at alternate intersections if spacing is less than 1 ft.
• Supported in accordance with the Standard Specifications.
• Tack welding is not allowed. It can severely damage the reinforcing steel.
• Check that clearances between the forms and the reinforcement are within ¼ in of those specified in the plans.

Chapter 6
• Check that splices are located and constructed only as shown in the plans using either: – Lap splicing: * Not permitted for No. 14 or No. 18 bars. – Welded splices: * Special inspection is required (steel fabrication inspector). * Advance review of welding procedures. * By certified welders (test welds). – Mechanical splicing (if allowed in the plans): * This type of splice must be approved by the State Materials Lab before use.
• Check that reinforcement is securely supported and held in place as follows: – By preapproved metal or plastic chairs, hangers, support wires, or mortar blocks that are at least as strong as the structure (mortar blocks require manufacturer certification). – With such supports having the correct dimensions to provide the required clearances.
• Check that all damaged epoxy-coated rebar is repaired in accordance with the Standard Specifications. See the Bar Identification Guide (Figure 6-2) for proper identification of rebar at the job site. The ASTM specifications for billet-steel, rail-steel, axle-steel, and low-alloy steel reinforcing bars (A 615M, a 616M, a 617M, and a 706M respectively) require identification marks to be rolled into the surface of one side of the bar to denote the producer’s mill designation, bar size, type of steel and minimum yield designation (see Figure 6-2). Grade 60 bars show these marks in the following order: 1st – Producing Mill (usually a letter) 2nd – Bar Size Number (#3 through #18) 3rd – Type Steel: S for Billet meeting Supplemental Requirements S1 (A 615M) N for New Billet (A 615M) R for Rail meeting ASTM a 617M, Grade 60 bend test requirement (A 616M) (per ACI 318-83) I for Rail (A 616M) A for Axle (A 617M) W for Low-Alloy (A 706M) 4th – Minimum Yield Designation

Bar identification marks may be oriented as illustrated or rotated 90 degrees. Grade mark numbers may be placed within separate consecutive deformation spaces. Grade line may be placed on the side opposite the bar marks. Reinforcing steel shall be placed in position as shown on the plans and held securely during the placement of the concrete. The strength of a reinforced concrete structure depends not only upon the amount of steel placed but also on its proper location. Improper location of the steel can impair the strength of the structure. In instances where reinforcing steel is shown in detail in specific relationship to other material and details such as inserts, openings, etc., the Inspector should make sure that this relationship exists when inspecting the placement of the reinforcing steel. If the shown relationship is impossible to maintain or results in a conflict with other details, the State Construction Office shall be consulted to obtain clarification of the details. The reinforcing steel shall be securely blocked from the forms by means of small mortar blocks, with a groove or tie wire embedded, not more than 2 inch square, or by other approved devices. If metal chair supports are used as supports for steel reinforcing bars, all surfaces of the chair supports not covered by at least ½ inch of concrete shall be treated in accordance with the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(24)C. Runways for wheelbarrows or concrete buggies used in placing concrete shall not be supported on the steel reinforcing bars. Steel delivered to the job far in advance of its use should be stored under cover to prevent rust. Mill scale is sometimes present on the reinforcing steel to such an extent that it must be removed. This is especially true with the larger bars. Removal can usually be accomplished by the use of wire brushes or by tapping the bars with hammers. Hardened concrete mortar must be removed from the reinforcing steel before placing the concrete. All reinforcing steel shall be in its proper place before concrete is placed. Driving of dowels, rail bars, etc., into concrete (wet setting) shall not be permitted. See the Standard Specifications for further details. Before concrete is placed, the reinforcing steel shall be inspected to see that it conforms to the plans and that the steel is properly fastened in position. The amount of cover of concrete over the reinforcing steel in bridge roadway slabs and bridge approach slabs is critical. The Inspector must verify compliance with plan dimensions in the slabs by an adequate number of measurements of the steel reinforcing bar locations in the forms before and immediately after placing concrete. These measurements can be taken at the same time checks on the depth of the concrete in the slabs are taken. These measurements shall be recorded as to depth and location and made a part of the project construction documents. When steel reinforcing bars protruding from columns or walls are exposed to weather for several months, they rust and exposed surfaces below become stained with rust. To prevent this, the bars should be protected to prevent rust. Coatings used for this purpose may prevent adequate bonding of concrete to the steel bars and should be removed from the bars before concrete is placed, except as allowed by the Standard Specifications.

Welding Reinforcing Steel
Reinforcing bars shall not be welded unless welding is indicated in the plans or special provisions. If welding is specified, the WSDOT welding inspector must be contacted for purposes of certifying welders and procedures. Reinforcing bars which are to be welded must be furnished of steel which is suitable for welding as specified. Only operators qualified as specified in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(24)E shall be allowed to weld reinforcing steel. AWS specifications require that Low Hydrogen type electrode (welding rod) be used for welding reinforcing steel. Generally, grade E7018 electrodes shall be used for grade 40 reinforcing bars and grade E8018 electrodes shall be used for grade 60 reinforcing bars. If semiautomatic welders are used equivalent grade electrodes shall be used. It is important that moisture be eliminated from the electrode and the steel reinforcing bars. The electrode must be prepared as called for in Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(25). To do this, a drying oven is essential and must be available and used at the site where welding is done. The recommended procedure for welding steel reinforcing bars is given in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(24)E. The Contractor shall submit a welding procedure to the Engineer for review. The Project Engineer shall transmit the Contractor’s welding procedure to the State Bridge and Structures, Construction Support Engineer for review. SS 6-02.3(25)
Prestressed Concrete Girders
Shop inspection of the manufacturing process of prestressed concrete products will be done by an inspector working under the direction of the State Materials Engineer. The State Materials Laboratory has instituted a procedure of inspecting each prestressed concrete plant in the State on an annual basis. During this inspection, the State Materials Laboratory obtains a list of the sources of the component parts to be used in manufacture of the prestressed concrete members. When the Contractor submits a request for approval of source of prestressed products, the complete member and the prestress plant which will manufacture it need only be listed. The Inspector prepares a weekly Fabrication Progress Report and Inspectors Daily Report, and submits them to the Project Engineer for information and records. When the prestressed unit is completed, including finishing, the Inspector will attach an Approved for Shipment tag, and/or the girder will be stamped with an “approved for shipment” and a lab I.D. number. The Approved for Shipment tag properly signed and dated or the “approved for shipment” and a lab I.D. number will be the Project Engineer’s basis for accepting the product at the job site. The Project Engineer will be required to inspect the item only for any damage which may occur during shipment or after the item arrives at the job site. Finishing of concrete surfaces of prestressed units shall be in accordance with Standard Specifications Sections 6-02.3(14) and 6-02.3(25)H unless specifically changed by the special provisions. The Shop Inspector shall require that the finishing done in the shop is in accordance with the specifications.

Prestressed concrete girders shall be maintained in a plumb, upright position at all times and shall be lifted by means of the lifting strands provided at the ends of the girders. All prestressed girders have been designed for a vertical pickup at the ends as indicated in the contract plans, and any other method will induce stresses which could cause failure of the girder during pickup. Some deviation from the vertical is safe for some girders. If the Contractor wishes to deviate from the vertical pickup, they shall have the proposed method analyzed by their engineers and shall submit the method, with supporting calculations, for review. The Project Engineer submits the calculations to the State Construction Office for review. If the girders are broken or damaged during handling or erection, they will have to be replaced at the Contractor’s expense. The girders shall not be placed on the finished piers or abutments until the concrete in the piers or abutments has obtained at least 80 percent of its design strength. If grout pads are required, they shall be constructed and cured as required by the plans and specifications before placing the girders. The girders must meet the dimensional tolerances listed in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25)I. SS 6-02.3(25)A Shop Drawings The Contractor is required to submit shop detail plans to the Project Engineer for review. The Project Engineer shall check these plans for compliance with the contract plans and specifications. Manufacture of these members shall not begin until the Contractor has received comments on the method, materials, and equipment they propose to use in the prestressing operations. Deviations from the shop drawings shall not be permitted. Welding of the reinforcing bars will not be permitted unless shown in the contract plans. The State Materials Lab has published a manual entitled “Inspectors Guide for Prestressed Plant Inspection and Quality Control” which contains more detailed instructions for this work. SS 6.02.3(25)K
Girder Deflection
Precast prestressed girders start creeping up immediately after prestressing strands are released in the casting bed. Over time, creeping or girder deflection upward continues. Bridge plans estimate the expected creep at 120 days, from prestress release to deck placement, and designate the letter “D” for this deflection. Theoretical girder camber at mid span vs. Actual girder camber measured in field, after girder erection, should be compared for compliance with Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25)K. The camber diagram is a parabolic curve. In order to have a smooth vertical profile the pad dimension on top of girder flange varies through the length of span (see Figure 6-3). This dimension is usually least (depending on the vertical profile curve) at center span and maximum at center line of bearings which bridge plans refer to as “A” dimension. The designation “C” is the amount of camber added to the deck grade elevations to account for the anticipated downward girder deflection due to all superimposed loads (slab, overlay, sidewalks, utilities and traffic barriers).
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 6-33
Chapter 6
Structures
Finished roadway grade elevations should be calculated along the center line of the prestressed girders at a minimum of every 10 feet for each span. Camber values at these locations need to be added to the finished roadway grade elevations to compensate for the girder deflection due to superimposed loads. Equation 6-1 calculates the camber at any point along the span. Y = C – 4C (M – 0.5)2 Where Y C M
= = =

camber at any point along the span length in inches deflection due to superimposed dead load at span mid point in inches location of span in decimal percent
The following example shows how tenth point span camber can be calculated. Example: Calculate camber at 0.20 point span for a prestress girder when girder length (ctr. - ctr. bearing) is 174.2 feet and “C” dimension at mid span given as 3 inches (see Figure 6-4). Y Y
= 3 – 4(3) (0.20 – 0.5)2 = 1.92 inches
Once the girders are set in place and before any load is added to the girders, elevations are taken at the tenth point locations (or minimum spacing of 10 feet as determined by the span length) to be used to determine an adjusted “A” dimension. The adjusted “A” dimension is determined by subtracting the as built elevations from the calculated finished roadway grade elevations plus camber to determine the new adjusted “A” dimension at each location. The adjusted “A” dimension is used to string line between two adjacent points to determine soffit location.

Post-Tensioned Concrete
The construction of cast-in-place post-tensioned bridges requires considerable attention to details of construction by the Contractor and Inspectors. The State Construction Office is available to present job-specific training on post-tensioned bridges. They should be contacted after the post-tensioning shop drawings have been reviewed and before posttensioning ducts and anchors are to be placed. In addition to the falsework and form plans for the structure being reviewed by the Bridge and Structures Engineer, post-tension detail plans shall be submitted for review as shown in the Shop Plans and Working Drawings Table in Section 1-2.4H. Included in these details will be the anchoring details, jacking forces, lift off forces, tendon profile, elongation of the tendons, and the tendon stressing sequence. In many structures, the dead load of the structure is increased at the jacking ends during the jacking operation. In these cases, the falsework at the jacking ends must be designed to carry the additional dead load. The installation of the post-tension system begins with the placing of assemblies consisting of bearing plate, transition cone or trumpet and grout inlet. Duct sections consisting of rigid conduit are assembled with couplers and are tied to the stirrups. Anchorages and bearing plates are securely fastened to the forms to prevent movement and loss of mortar during concreting. Connections between trumpets and ducts, ducts and couplers, and ducts and vent saddles are taped with a durable and waterproof tape to prevent intrusion of mortar. It is necessary that the ducts be located in the position shown in the post-tension details in order for the structure to function as designed. A misaligned duct will cause increased friction and localized stress which can result in failure of the member during the stressing operation. The Inspector must check to see that the ducts are properly located and securely fastened in place to prevent movement during concreting. On continuous structures, vents must be placed at the high and low points of the tendon and grout inlets at the ends of the tendon. At the completion of the duct installation and prior to placement of concrete in the top slab, a device of slightly smaller diameter than the inside diameter of the duct shall be blown through the ducts to ensure no undetected damage or blockage has occurred (see Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(26)E. The prestressing reinforcement strand is delivered to the site in sealed reel-less packs or reels containing desiccant to prevent corrosion. It is necessary that the prestressing reinforcement is free of rust and kept clean while it is assembled, stressed, and grouted. Normally, the grouting shall take place within 10 days of the time the strand is removed from the packs to prevent the accumulation of rust. The Inspector should check the reels of strand intended for use and reject those which show damage to the strand or visible rust. See Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(26)F for further requirements. Some projects may be designed for the use of high strength steel rods instead of the strand. These rods come in various sizes to give the required steel area for the tendon in one bar instead of bundling several strands in the tendon.

Jacking operations shall not be started until the concrete in the structure has cured for the specified time or reached the specified strength. Jacking shall be carried out in the sequence shown on the post tension details to minimize the amount of eccentric loading on the structure. During the jacking operations, no person should be directly behind either end of the tendon. Occasionally a tendon will let go, resulting in a very dangerous situation. Each jack used to stress tendons shall be equipped with either a pressure gauge or a load cell along with certified calibration charts for determining the jacking force. Gauging devices should be re-calibrated at intervals of not more than 180 days; however, if during the progress of the work, any gauging system appears to be giving erratic results, or if gauge readings and elongation measurements indicate materially different stresses, the jack and the gauges shall be re-calibrated. A starting load, usually 20 percent of the jacking load, as shown in the post tensioning schedule, is applied to the tendon. The purpose of this starting load is to take up the slack in the tendon so that an accurate elongation measurement may be made. This load is applied by hydraulic jacks and measured by the jack gauges. During the stressing operation, the tendons shall be jacked to the specified load and the jacking load and elongation shall be recorded. Also the elongation after seating must be measured and recorded (see Figure 6-5). In the event of discrepancies between measured elongations and calculated elongations (see Stress Acceptance Criteria), the entire operation should be carefully checked and the source of error determined and corrected before proceeding further. A discrepancy between the elongation and the jacking force usually indicates that the gauge on the jack is not correctly calibrated, there is undue friction between the duct and the tendon, or the tendons are not properly anchored. Stress Acceptance Criteria Strand Tendon (lengths 50 feet and less): 1. The tendon may be accepted provided: The measured elongation is equal to or exceeds 93 percent of the calculated elongation. 2. A force verification lift-off is performed: The verification lift-off force is between -5 percent and +5 percent of the calculated force. Strand Tendon (lengths greater than 50 feet and less than 150 feet): 1. If the measured elongation is between -7 percent and +7 percent of the calculated elongation, the tendon can be accepted. 2. If the measured elongation exceeds 107 percent of the calculated elongation, confirm the jack/gauge calibration, and then perform a force verification lift-off: a. If a force verification lift-off is performed on one end of the tendon only and the lift-off force is between -1 percent and +5 percent of the calculated force, the tendon can be accepted. b. If a force verification lift-off is performed on both ends of the tendon (jacking end and anchor end) and the lift-off forces are between -5 percent and +5 percent of the calculated force, the tendon can be accepted.

The grout used is fluid and quite different from the mortar we usually associate with the term grout. The component materials of the grout mix must be accurately measured. The maximum amount of water specified must not be exceeded. The grout should be screened after it has been mixed and before it is added to the grout equipment to remove lumps which might cause clogging of the ducts. Immediately, prior to grouting, the ducts shall be blown out with oil free compressed air. Grout is applied continuously by pumping under moderate pressure at the lower end of the duct toward an open vent at the upper end until all entrapped air is forced out the open vents. The open vents are closed under pressure of issuing grout after a steady solid stream of grout is discharging. The grouting pressure is gradually increased to a minimum of 100 psi and 200 psi maximum and held at this pressure for a minimum of 10 seconds. The grouting entrance is then closed.

After grouting of the tendons, the recesses for the anchorages are cast solid with concrete. A complete record must be kept of the stressing operations. An example of the Post-Tensioning Record (DOT Form 450-005) is shown in Figure 6-5. The following explanations will help in completing the record: A. Required jacking force for the tendon is obtained from the post-tensioning details. B. Gauge pressure is obtained from the certified calibration chart for the jack to obtain the required jacking force listed in “A” above. C.

Seating take-up is the difference in the elongation measured at full force and the elongation measured after the tendon has been seated and the jacking force reduced to the initial force of 20 percent of full force. However, since the elongations are measured at the end of the jack, the elongation of the tendon from the wedges to the measuring point must be accounted for to obtain the true seating takeup. After finding the difference between the full jacking force elongation and the 20 percent of full jacking force, (I1) the elongation of the tendon inside the jack must be subtracted from the difference to obtain the true seating take-up. (I2) The elongation of the tendon inside the jack is approximately 1/16 inch per foot. This seating take-up should be the same as the required take-up in “E” above. It is important that the specified seating take-up be obtained as it has an appreciable effect on the stress in the tendon.
J. Percent elongation per tendon is a comparison of the calculated elongation and the measured elongation. If the elongation obtained at full jacking force is not reasonably close to the required elongation, the following conditions are usually indicated:
• There is more (or less) friction in the tendon than was anticipated in the calculations of the post-tension details.
• The gauging devices on the jack are not properly calibrated.
• The strands of a tendon are not properly anchored. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

If tendon stressing is performed at an air temperature below 60°F, the Contractor should not be allowed to use jack pressure gauges that utilize oil or glycerin. This will ensure accurate jack pressure readings. The reason for this is that these gauges tend to react slowly at lower temperatures. What can happen with these gauges is the jack operator will bring jack up to the required gauge pressure and shut the jack off. Since the gauge is slow in reacting, it will continue to rise until it “catches” up, resulting in over stressing the tendon. Once this occurs, the tendon will usually need to be replaced. J.

SS 6-03.3(7) Shop Plans The Contractor shall submit shop plans of all steel fabrication for review. Fabrication of the steel shall not be started until the shop plans have been reviewed by the Bridge and Structures Engineer (or Terminal Design Engineer for the Ferries Division projects) and the materials source and fabricator have been given approval by the State Materials Engineer. The State Materials Engineer shall advise the State Bridge and Structures Engineer (or Terminal Design Engineer) when the materials source or fabricator has been approved. The plans will not be returned to either the Contractor or the fabricator by the Project Engineer until the approval of source has been given by the State Materials Engineer. WSDOT reviews the shop plans for sufficiency of the materials and connections and not for the correctness of dimensions. Some details of the design drawings may, with the approval of the State Bridge and Structures Engineer (or Terminal Design Engineer), be changed to suit the erection methods the Contractor desires to use. These revisions may require a change order. The Contractor shall submit eight sets of all shop detail plans required for fabrication of the steel directly to the State Bridge and Structures Engineer and two sets to the Project Engineer. For the Ferries Division projects, all ten sets shall be submitted to the Terminal Design Engineer. If a railroad is involved, four additional sets are required for each railroad involved. See the shop plans and working drawings table in Section 1-2.4H. The Project Engineer should advise the State Bridge and Structures Engineer of any conditions that would affect the checking and review of the drawings. These comments should be shown with a green color marker on the Project Engineer’s copy. Shop inspection is performed either by inspectors or representatives of the State Materials Laboratory. Material Acceptance Reports are obtained by these inspectors and provided to the Project Engineer upon completion of the shop fabrication. Erection plan sheets generally accompany the shop plans. Prior to completion of the project, the Contractor is required to furnish shop drawings on mylar or equivalent, which will be sent to the State Bridge and Structures Office for their permanent file. These drawings must be suitable for reproducing by microfilming. SS 6-03.3(7)A Erection Methods Falsework and erection plans for structural steel structures shall be submitted for review in the same manner as for concrete structures. Camber diagrams are normally shown in the contract plans. It is the Fabricator’s responsibility to fabricate the members to the prescribed camber shown in the plans. The Fabrication Inspector should verify that the members are fabricated in accordance with the shop drawings.

The use of heavy equipment for erection purposes requires the review of the State Bridge and Structures Engineer. See Standard Specifications Section 6-01.6. Laying out work for structural steel spans requires greater accuracy than for other structures. Use precise instruments, standardized tapes, scales and thermometer when making layout. Spacing of piers, bents, and anchor bolts shall be as shown in the plans, providing the span after fabrication in the shop is the correct length. The fabrication shop is required to furnish a sketch showing the length of span and amounts of camber measured in the shop at the time the spans are assembled. The Project Engineer should have a copy of this sketch before erection is begun. The lengths as measured in the shop seldom vary more than ¼ in to ⅜ in from the design drawings, and there is sufficient play in the anchor bolt sleeves for this tolerance. Allowance will be made on the design drawings for stretch of the span due to loss of camber. The Project Engineer shall compute camber elevations from the shop camber measurements taken by the shop. Elevations shall be set above the falsework at each panel point for the camber blocking. Most erectors set the camber blocks high to allow for settlement of the falsework. The amount of allowance for settlement should be decided by the erector. The Project Engineer shall give the exact elevations for the finished camber. Elevations shall be given and carefully checked as an error means that an unnecessary amount of jacking and adjusting may be required. The adjustment of spans is often a source of argument between erectors and engineers. Accurate work on the part of the Engineer will do much to avoid such arguments. Elevations set on the falsework before the load is applied may not be correct after the load is applied. It is the responsibility of the Contractor to determine the allowance that may be necessary to compensate for settlement in the falsework. It is easier to lower the span than to raise it. SS 6-03.3(9) Handling, Storing and Shipping of Materials Structural steel members shall be handled carefully to prevent twisting, bending, or scraping the member. The material shall be supported on suitable skids or platforms to keep it off the ground or out of water and it shall be protected from deterioration by rust. Structural steel members should not be unloaded and stored on adjoining concrete approach spans. If the Contractor proposes to use the concrete approach spans to support the structural steel members, the proposal must be submitted in writing to the Bridge and Structures Office for review. This proposal shall include drawings describing the support locations, loads, and supporting stress calculations. The structural steel members shall be placed on timber blocking, spaced so that the weight will be carried on the girders (load carrying members) and not on the comparatively thin concrete deck slab. Bridge decks are designed for carrying traffic and not as storage or dock space. This is especially true for concrete sidewalk slabs. Sidewalk concrete slabs shall not be overloaded by loads such as building material, tool sheds, or paint sheds.

Straightening Bent Material
Methods for straightening of plates, angles, other shapes, and built-up members shall not produce fracture or other injury to the metal, and shall be reviewed by the State Construction Office. Distorted members shall be straightened by mechanical means or by the carefully planned and supervised application of a limited amount of localized heat. The temperature of the heated area shall not exceed 1,100°F (a dull red) and shall be controlled by temperature indicating crayons, liquids or bimetal thermometers. Following the straightening of a bend or buckle, the surface of the metal shall be tested for evidence of fracture. SS 6-03.3(25)
Welding and Repair Welding
Welding of structural steel shall be in accordance with the requirements in Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(25). Welding will not be accepted as a substitute for bolting and should be done only where indicated in the plans. Adding even small welds not shown in the plans can induce high stresses in the members. This could seriously impair the strength and structural capability of the structure involved. The structure has been designed assuming that no additional welding will be done. The approval of the Assistant State Construction Engineer is required before doing any welding not shown in the plans. Good workmanship and proper materials are essential. Welding operators should be qualified for the type of welding they are required to do. Welding procedures shall be reviewed by the Bridge Engineer before starting to weld on the structure. Welding defects should be corrected as indicated in the Standard Specifications. Low hydrogen type electrodes must be dry when used. The care and use of these electrodes as given in the Standard Specifications should be completely observed. No relaxation of these requirements can be tolerated. SS 6-03.3(30)
Painting
Steel structures shall be painted in accordance with the requirements in Standard Specifications Section 6-07. SS 6-03.3(32) Assembling and Bolting Before erection of the steel is commenced, the structural steel members shall be inspected for damage during shipping and handling. Any members that have been damaged must be repaired or replaced before being erected. All members should have been match-marked and shall be assembled in accordance with the erection drawings from the Contractor. As the erection progresses, the Inspector should compare assembled members against the erection plans to see that proper members are in correct positions. If during assembling, it is discovered that various members do not fit together, do not allow undue force to be applied to make them fit. The application of such a force can introduce stresses in several components of the structure. These stresses can be of a magnitude high enough to cause serious structural problems. The structure has not been designed to take these stresses. In such cases, the Assistant State Construction Engineer shall be informed. Page 6-44

Structures
Chapter 6
Structural steel members that are improperly fabricated, or do not fit, shall be rejected and either repaired or replaced with new. If the Contractor elects to repair the structural member, the proposed repair procedure shall be reviewed by the Assistant State Construction Engineer prior to any repair work. Unless otherwise shown or specified, structural steel connections shall be bolted. Simple truss spans shall be completely erected with all field-bolted connections and/or splices held in place with the minimum number of drift pins and bolts as specified in Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(32). Once the minimum number of drift pins and bolts are installed in all the connections, final adjustments for span length and camber shall be made prior to completion of bolting and release of falsework. The assembly and bolting sequence for all structural steel structures shall strictly follow the erection plan. Erection and bolting sequences, especially cantilever and arch spans, are usually detailed in the contract documents. Field connections shall be pinned and bolted in accordance with the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(32). This Section applies to connections and splices made in the field. Connections are when one structural steel member is bolted directly to another structural steel member; such as, cross-members and braces. Splices utilize structural steel plates to connect two structural steel members; such as, a plate girder. It also requires all connections and splices be securely drift-pinned and bolted before the weight of the member can be released or the next member is added. The field erection drawings must specify pinning and bolting requirements. Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(32) then specifies the required minimum number of pins and bolts for field connections and splices. Steel railings may be erected in place at the same time the trusses are erected but they shall not be finally aligned or bolted until after the concrete deck is placed. Railings shall be true to line, and for single spans shall show the camber of the span. For two or more spans the railing shall show a uniform camber over all of the spans; that is, the individual camber of each span shall not be carried in the railing. SS 6-03.3(33)
Bolted Connections
All bolted connections are designed by WSDOT to be friction connections. A friction connection transfers the stress by friction between surfaces in contact and does not depend on shear or bearing between members and bolts. The friction is provided when the connection or splice members are compressed through tension on the bolts (measured by turn-of-nut or direct-tension-indicator method). To develop design contact surface friction, all bolts in a bolted connection must be properly tightened to the minimum specified tension. The Standard Specifications recognize that final design loads are not present during erection of the structural steel members. Therefore, during erection, all the bolts are not needed in order to develop the friction necessary in the connection or splice for erection loads. The Standard Specifications recognize this and require a minimum percentage of the holes to be filled during erection; for instance, 50 percent for normal structures and 75 percent for cantilevered structures. These holes are filled with a combination of drift pins and bolts. Drift pins are required to properly align the members since bolts are usually smaller in diameter than the holes. Bolts are required to develop the minimum friction required to transfer erection loading. The minimum friction or load-carrying capacity is not developed until the bolts are tightened to the specified minimum tension. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 6-45
Chapter 6
Structures
Once the member is released from its support (support falsework or crane), the Standard Specifications specify the procedure required to complete bolting of each connection. Sometimes fabricators will temporarily bolt-splice plates to the appropriate member. The fabricator will usually use the minimal number of bolts to secure the splice plate during shipping and handling. These temporary bolts shall be removed and replaced with highstrength bolts. Structural steel field connections are made with high tensile strength bolts conforming to the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 9-06.5(3) and the special provisions. A special heat treatment gives these bolts a high tensile strength. WSDOT designed bolted connections generally operate by a transfer of stresses by friction between surfaces in contact and do not depend on shear or bearing between the members and the bolts. Therefore, it is imperative that the contact surfaces of the metal shall be properly cleaned and the required minimum tension be obtained in the bolts. The required tension in the bolts may be obtained by using either the Turn-of-Nut method or the Direct Tension Indicator (DTI) Method unless the specifications for the project state otherwise. If required because of bolt-entering and wrench operation, tightening by either procedure may be done by turning the bolt while the nut is prevented from rotating. Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(33) requires a hardened washer under the turned element. Therefore, if the bolt is turned, a hardened washer is required under the bolt head. A hardened washer is also required with the DTI Method. Bolted parts shall fit solidly together when assembled. Where an outer face of the bolted parts has a slope greater than 1:20, with respect to a plane normal to the bolt axis, a beveled washer shall be used to compensate for the lack of parallelism. See Figure 6-6. Bolts shall be tightened beginning from the center of each connection towards the edges of the connection. All joint surfaces, including those adjacent to the bolt heads, nuts or washers, shall be free of scale, except tight mill scale, and shall also be free of burrs, dirt, and other foreign material that would prevent solid seating of the parts.

*At the manufacturer’s option, Type 3 bolts may have additional distinguishing marks to indicate the bolt is atmospheric corrosion resistant and of weathering type.
AASHTO specifications require that bolts bear specific identification marks. The following identification is marked on the top of the bolt heads: Nuts of all classes, in nominal diameter M5 and larger, shall be marked with the property class designation (5, 9, 10, 12, 8S, 10S, 8S3, 10S3) on the top or bearing surface, on the top of flange, or on one of the wrenching flats. Additionally, nuts of Classes 10, 12, Page 6-46

Chapter 6
8S, 8S3, 10S, and 10S3 shall be marked with a symbol to identify the manufacturer. For Classes 8S3 and 10S3 nuts, the manufacturer may add other distinguishing marks to indicate the nut is atmospheric corrosion resistant and of a weathering grade of steel. Type 3 bolts must be used when the structure is not being painted (WSDOT rarely utilizes unpainted structural steel for new structures). Nuts and washers used with Type 3 bolts must also have weathering characteristics. Each fastener shall be tightened to provide, when all fasteners in the joint are tight, at least the minimum tension shown in the Standard Specifications for the size and grade of fastener used. Turn-of-Nut Method When the turn-of-nut method is used to provide the specified bolt tension, all of the required minimum number of bolts within a bolted connection or splice shall be brought to a “snug tight” condition. The bolts shall be tightened to “snug tight” in a systematical order to ensure that all parts of the joint are brought into full contact with each other. This usually requires that the bolts located near the center of the connection or splice be tightened first. Then all remaining bolts shall be tightened from the center progressing toward the outer edges. “Snug tight” is defined as the tightness attained by (1) a few blows from an impact wrench, or (2) the full effort of a man using an ordinary spud wrench. The “snug tight” requirement also establishes the starting point for full tensioning by the turn-of-nut method. Once the bolts are snug tight, the outer face of the nut and protruding part of each bolt shall be match-marked with crayon or paint. The match-marking provides the control to both ensure the bolt does not rotate during tightening and measure the nut rotation. The required minimum nut rotation is listed in Table 4 of Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(33). During this tightening operation, there shall be no rotation of the part not turned by the wrench. Contractors often suggest a tightening method that eliminates marking the bolt as required in the turn-of-nut method. This suggested method requires calibration of the air impact wrench(es) and the inspection torque wrench. After calibration, the Contractor wants to snug tighten each bolt, then tighten to minimum tension using the air impact wrench without marking the nut and bolt. This method is heavily dependent upon the torque wrench test and is not accepted by WSDOT. Direct Tension Indicator Method (DTI) When the direct tension indicator method is used to provide the specified bolt tension, all of the required minimum number of bolts within a bolted connection or splice shall be brought to a “snug tight” condition. The bolts shall be tightened to “snug tight” in a systematic order to ensure that all parts of the joint are brought into full contact with each other. This usually requires that the bolts located near the center of the connection or splice be tightened first. Then all remaining bolts shall be tightened from the center progressing toward the outer edges. “Snug tight” is defined as the tightness attained by (1) a few blows from an impact wrench, or (2) the full effort of a man using an ordinary spud wrench.

This method uses a direct-tension-indicator washer that has formed protrusions on one face, leaving a gap. As the bolt is tensioned, the formed gap is reduced. The measurement of this gap verifies the bolt tension. Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(33) addresses the maximum gap opening for direct tension indicators. WSDOT has two concerns associated with the use of direct-tension-indicator washers. These concerns are (1) potential corrosion within the washer gap and (2) undetected bolt loosening as bolt tightening of a connection or splice proceeds. Following is a brief discussion of each item: 1. Potential Corrosion – The Specifications address this potential corrosion problem by limiting the maximum gap opening for painted and unpainted structures. These gap opening limits are governed by both tension requirement and required corrosion protection. The direct tension indicator manufacturers address only the minimum bolt tension requirement. It is, therefore, very important that the Inspector be aware of this additional concern of potential corrosion. 2. Undetected Bolt Loosening – The manufacturers of the direct-tension-indicator washers emphasize the ease and reliability of their product. They claim, and it is true, that if the gap is reduced to the specified maximum opening, the respective bolt is properly tensioned. The concern we have is that through the process of tightening all the bolts in a connection or splice, a warped plate may be progressively flattened, potentially loosening the initially tightened bolts. If this happens, the indicator washer still indicates the bolt(s) are fully tensioned. For this reason, WSDOT requires that bolt tension inspection, usually with a calibrated torque wrench, be performed. The Inspector should be aware of this potential problem and observe the tightening procedure with this in mind. SS 6-03.3(33)B
Bolting Inspection
The Inspector shall determine that the requirements of the Standard Specifications are met in the work. The Inspector shall observe the installation and tightening of bolts to determine that the selected tightening procedure is properly used and shall determine that all bolts are tightened and, in the case of the direct-tension-indicator method, that the correct indication of tension (gap) has been achieved. Bolts may reach tensions substantially higher than the value in Table 3 of Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(33), but this is not cause for rejection. The condition of the bolts is critical to the bolt-up operation and inspection. Bolts to be installed in the structure shall be lubricated in accordance with the Standard Specifications. A good check is a nut that is easily turned on the entire threaded portion of the bolt. The following inspection procedure shall be observed for: 1. Bolts tightened Using the Turn-of-Nut Method – The Contractor, in the presence of the Engineer, shall use an inspection wrench which may be a torque wrench. Calibration of the inspection torque wrench is explained in a following section. Bolts that have been tightened using the turn-of-nut method shall be inspected by applying, in the tightening direction, the inspecting wrench and its job-inspecting torque to 10 percent of the bolts, but not less than two bolts, selected at random in each connection. If no nut or bolt head is turned by this application of the job Page 6-48
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Structures
Chapter 6
inspection torque, the connection shall be accepted as properly tightened. If any nut or bolt head is turned by the application of the job inspecting torque, this torque shall be applied to all bolts in the connection, and all bolts whose nut or head is turned by the job inspecting torque shall be tightened and re-inspected. As an alternate, the Contractor may retighten all of the bolts in the connection, and then resubmit the connection for the specified inspection. 2. Bolts Tightened Using the Direct-Tension-Indicator Method –The Contractor, in the presence of the Engineer, shall use a feeler gauge to verify that each bolt has been properly tensioned to the maximum specified gap. If a bolt that has had its direct-tension-indicator washer brought to full load loosens during the course of bolting the connection, the bolt shall have a new direct-tension indicator washer installed and be re-tensioned. Reuse of the bolt and nut are subject to the provisions in the Standard Specifications. Calibration of Inspection Torque Wrench Five bolts of the same grade, size, and condition as those under inspection shall be placed individually in a calibration device capable of indicating bolt tension at least once each working day. There shall be a washer under the part turned in tightening each bolt. Each bolt shall be tightened in the calibration device by any convenient means to the specified minimum tension. The inspecting wrench then shall be applied to the tightened bolt and the torque necessary to turn the nut or head 5 degrees (approximately 1 inch) at a 12 inch radius) in the tightening direction shall be determined. The job-inspection torque shall be taken as the average of three values, thus determined after rejecting the high and low values. If the bolts to be installed are not long enough to fit in the tension calibrator, five bolts of the same grade, size, and condition as those under inspection shall be tested using Direct-Tension-Indicator (DTI) to measure bolt tension. This tension measurement test shall be done at least once each inspection day. The DTI shall be placed under the bolt head. A washer shall be placed under the nut, which shall be the element turned during the performance of this tension measurement test. Each bolt shall be tightened by any convenient means to the specified minimum tension as indicated by the DTI. The inspecting wrench shall then be applied to the tightened bolt and the torque necessary to turn the nut 5 degrees (approximately 1 inch) at a 12 inch radius) in the tightening direction shall be determined. The job-inspection torque shall be taken as the average of three values, thus determined after rejecting the high and low values. Figure 6-7 shows the operator calibrating a hand-indicator torque wrench. The bolt is brought to the proper tension by either method described above. The dial on the wrench was set at “zero” and sufficient torque applied to rotate the nut 5 degrees in the tightening direction. At this point, the wrench dial shows the kips required to further rotate the nut or bolt head. The torque wrenches used by inspectors of both the Contractor and WSDOT should be tested and compared at the same time for purposes of uniformity.

Setting Anchor Bolts
Anchor bolts are usually plain round bolts with the head and plate washer on the lower end and the thread and nut at the top end. These bolts are set in pipe sleeves to allow room for adjustment of the span. Location of anchor bolt sleeves is very critical and must be verified by the inspector. Also, the exposed length of anchor bolts should be checked to ensure enough thread is exposed out of the pier cap to tie down the lower bearing assembly. Anchor bolt sleeves, when anchor bolts will not be grouted until after freezing weather, must be protected against damage from expanded ice by filling the sleeves with ad nonevaporating antifreeze solution. Without exception, when piers and superstructures are constructed under separate contracts, the anchor bolt sleeves shall be filled with a nonevaporating antifreeze solution by the substructure Contractor. Before the bolts are grouted, the antifreeze solution shall be removed, the space well cleaned and the holes then filled with grout. The antifreeze solution shall be diluted with water and completely removed from the sleeves or it will have a detrimental effect on the filler grout. See Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(18). SS 6-03.3(36)
Setting and Grouting Masonry Plates
It is important to set bearings level on all piers. Bridge plan bearing details usually show a leveling method. Bearings shall be set so that they are at zero movement at 64°F after the total load is applied and the span is released. The amount of offset varies with the length of the span and the temperature at time of erection. Anchor bolt holes and the void underneath masonry plates shall be grouted, after all structural steel is erected and adjusted for length and camber, and at least seven days before the deck concrete is placed. Portland cement shall be used for grouting and the procedure should be as outlined in Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(36).

Do not grout underneath masonry plates with dry mortar unless specifically shown in the plans. The Contractor shall build forms around the masonry plate about 4 in high and pour grout in the form from one side until the whole area is well filled. Use a wire or steel band to keep the grout flowing. After the grout has taken its initial set, remove the form and cut the edges of the grout with a trowel to about a 45 degree bevel from the bottom of the shoe to top of the pier. Do not allow the finished grout to extend above the bottom of the masonry plate. SS 6-03.3(39)
Swinging the Span
As required in Standard Specifications Section 6-03.3(39), the masonry plates shall be grouted and steel work, except railing, completely bolted and released from the falsework before forming for the roadway slab begins. Expansion dams shall not be bolted down until after the span is released from the falsework. The camber diagram shown in the plans, especially for welded steel plate girders, quantifies the calculated deflection of the steel girder weight and the deflection of the girders due to the concrete slab weight. The camber diagram for the weight of the steel girders only is utilized by the girder fabricator. Once all the temporary girder supports are removed, it is important that elevation control points on the top of the flanges of the girders or floor beams be established and permanently marked before any external load, such as form lumber, reinforcing steel, etc., is applied. These control points should be located at proper intervals to establish elevations for formwork and finished roadway slab grades. These control points should be at the span tenth points or at cross-frame locations (panel points). Once these control point elevations are established, fills at each of these control points shall be calculated utilizing the camber diagram for the weight of the roadway slab and the profile grade. These control point fill values shall be used from that point on because it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to calculate the deflection of the girders as formwork and reinforcing steel are added. These control point fill values will be used for the final adjustment of the roadway slab finish machine. A pouring sequence for the roadway slab may be shown in the plans to reduce the size of the concrete pours, control deflection, and minimize tension cracking of the concrete slab during construction. Placing and finishing the concrete in the roadway slab shall be the same as for Concrete Structures covered in Section 6-2.

Vibration Monitoring during Pile Driving On some projects, pile driving vibrations will be monitored for potential damage to adjacent structures or buildings. When that monitoring indicates a potential for damage, the Project Engineer should ensure that the minimum size hammer specified for the piling being driven is actually being used. If so, and vibrations are still potentially damaging, the State Construction Office should be notified to determine if preboring or jetting should be used to reduce vibrations. Should preboring or jetting, or other methods be determined necessary, such work shall be considered a change in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-04.4.

Pile Driving Records Pile driving records are to be kept in the Pile Driving Record Book (DOT Form 450-004) or on the Pile Driving Log (Form 450-004A), which becomes part of the project final records. This book has sufficient room for a condensed pile driving history, pile layout, and miscellaneous notes in addition to the driving log for each pile. Number the piles on the sketch in the pile layout and use these for the Pile No. on the pile driving log. The pile driving record book contains instructions for completing the driving log. In order for this log to furnish complete information on the pile driving work, it is imperative that it be filled out completely in accordance with the instructions in the book. If more space is necessary, use more than one page for the pile. Items in the heading which are the same for several piling, may be marked “Same as Pile No. ___.” The piling should be marked every foot of their lengths with crayon or paint unless there is some other method of determining when each foot of the pile has been driven. Count and record the number of blows per foot and hammer energy as the pile approaches bearing.

SS 6-05.3(2) Ordering Piling Piling shall conform to the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 9-10. When piling is received on the project, it shall be inspected and a notation made in the Section of Miscellaneous Notes in the Pile Record book. Untreated timber piles will be inspected in the field and accepted for use there. All other piling, except concrete piles cast on the job, will be inspected by Fabrication Inspectors before delivery. The lengths of piling required are determined by driving test piles or by other information which may be available. The Project Engineer provides the Contractor with an order list for timber and precast concrete piles. This list must show the length of piles required below cutoff (the top of the pile within the footing). The Contractor should be informed that the lengths shown on the order list should be increased, at their expense, the necessary amount to provide for fresh heading and to reach from the cutoff elevation up to the position of the driving equipment. Payment for piling will be made for the number of feet shown on the order lists except that if greater lengths are driven, with the concurrence of the Project Engineer, payment will be made for the lengths actually driven below cutoff. Itemized lists for cast-in-place piles or steel piles will not be furnished by the Engineer. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

SS 6-05.3(3) Manufacture of Precast Concrete Piling SS 6-05.3(3)A Casting and Stressing Curing beds for steam cured concrete piles shall not rest directly on the floor but shall be elevated enough to permit the complete circulation of steam around the piles. Lifting loops shall be removed to ½ inch below the surface of the concrete and the hole filled with mortar. Concrete piles shall be handled as described in the Standard Specifications, the Standard Plans, or as shown in the plans in order to avoid excessive deflections and strains. SS 6-05.3(6) Splicing Steel Casings and Steel Piles When steel piles must be spliced and splicing details are not shown in the plans, the splice should be made with a single V-butt weld over the whole cross-sectional area of the pile. Welding shall be done with specified welding rod and suitable equipment in accordance with American Welding Society Specifications and good industry practice. A qualified welder is required. See Standard Specifications Section 6-05.3(6). No Engineer’s order list will be given for steel piling. SS 6-05.3(7) Storage and Handling SS 6-05.3(7)A Timber Piles Chain slings will be permitted in handling treated timber piles. Treated timber piling shall be furnished and driven full length, i.e., without splices. The entire length shall be pressure treated. Therefore, the pile tip shall not be cut after treatment. If splices become necessary and the order length furnished by the Engineer is insufficient, the State Construction Office should be contacted for direction. However a splice probably will not be considered if it cannot be located below the permanent water table elevation. SS 6-05.3(7)B
Precast Concrete Piles
Precast concrete piles require special care in storage and handling, especially when raising them into the leads. The general method of attaching slings for handling is described in the Standard Specifications. Long piles must be supported at the ends and at intermediate points to prevent undue bending and cracking of the concrete. In special cases the plans may show the method for lifting long piles. Some pile driving crews lack experience with concrete piles and handle them as they are accustomed to doing with timber piles. Such handling will probably result in damage to the concrete piles and must not be allowed. SS 6-5.3(7)C Steel Casings and Steel Piles Steel piling shall be handled in such manner as to prevent bending of the flanges, and when stacked they shall be supported in such a manner that the piles will not bend. No Engineer’s order list will be given for cast-in-place concrete piling.

SS 6-05.3(9) Pile Driving Equipment SS 6-05.3(9)A Pile Driving Equipment The type and size of hammers to be used to drive piling are specified in Standard Specifications Section 6-05.3(9)B. The Project Engineer shall require the Contractor to furnish full information on any hammer proposed for use so it can be determined whether or not the hammer meets the requirements of the specifications and that the bearing capacity of driven piles may be computed. It is very important to verify that the drop of the ram is in accordance with the submitted data. Otherwise, the pile bearing calculations will not be correct. A useful formula to determine the drop of a single acting diesel hammer determined from measuring the blows per minute is: Stroke Formula (ft of drop) = (4.01((60/BPM)2)-0.3) Where BPM is the blows per minute of the hammer. This drop can then be used in the bearing equation shown in Standard Specifications Section 6-05.3(12) to determine the bearing of the piling. This formula calculates the drop from the rate of blows per minute that the hammer is hitting at and makes it no longer necessary to watch the top of the hammer and estimate the distance that hammer is coming out of the casing. Since the rate the hammer runs at is dependent on the drop of the hammer, and this hammer drop is accelerated at a constant by gravity, the distance the ram travels can be determined from the formula. SS 6-05.3(9)B
Pile Driving Equipment Minimum Requirements
Standard Specifications Section 6-05.3(9)B and the special provisions, govern the hammer size by specifying the minimum ram weight and the minimum energy required for each type of pile, required bearing, and hammer. The most commonly used hammers are air, hydraulic, or diesel activated. The hammer energy output is simply the weight of the ram times the distance the ram falls. This energy determination is a simple matter with a drop, hydraulic, or air/steam activated hammer. The measurement of the energy output of a diesel activated hammer is more complex. The minimum energy required by the specifications is the energy output of the hammer at the point of impact at the required pile bearing. The hammer needs to operate at or above the required minimum energy level in order to achieve the specified pile bearing capacity. The Project Engineer may concur with the Contractor’s proposed hammer if it meets the criteria of the Standard Specifications and the special provisions. During field operations, the pile driving hammer must be capable of delivering at least the required minimum energy at the required pile bearing value. The State Construction Office should be consulted for any other hammer submittals or insufficient performance in the field. Drop hammers, which are rarely used, must be weighed, in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 6-05.3(9)B, before any piles are driven. The drop hammer stroke should be carefully measured. This can be done by taping a piece of rope or rag around the hammer line at the height above the hammer for the drop desired. The hammer operator can then gauge the drop with reasonable accuracy. The stroke (drop) of the hammer ram must be consistent with the required minimum energy.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Page 6-55
Chapter 6
Structures
Air or steam activated hammers lift the ram by either air or steam pressure to a predetermined distance and release the ram. The energy is produced by the falling ram. These hammers usually operate at 50 to 60 blows per minute depending on the hammer manufacturer. A count of the actual blows per minute will provide verification that the hammer is operating properly. If the blows per minute exceed the published manufacturer’s data sheet for the specified minimum energy, and the Contractor is not able to find and rectify the problem, the State Construction Office shall be notified. No additional piling are to be driven until the problem is resolved. Hydraulic activated hammers lift the ram by hydraulic fluid pressure to a predetermined distance and then release the ram. The energy is produced by the falling ram. There are two types of hydraulic activated hammers, single and double acting. The hydraulic activating systems for both of these types of hammers are totally enclosed using a vegetable oil medium, rendering them environmentally friendly. The method for measuring the energy output is different for each type of hydraulic activated hammer. The energy output for each type can be varied by using simple adjustment procedures. Again, the respective hammer must be operating at or above the specific minimum energy when the required pile bearing capacity is reached. Diesel activated hammers lift the ram by energy produced when diesel fuel is ignited. The energy produced is a combination of the fuel explosion and the drop of the ram. There are two types of diesel activated hammers, single and double acting. The method for measuring the energy output is different for each type of diesel activated hammer. Diesel hammers produce a variable energy. The variable energy output of a diesel hammer is dependent on a number of factors, which include fuel quality, fuel setting, soil conditions, and resistance from the pile being driven. As the pile resistance increases, the energy output of a diesel hammer usually increases. The manufacturer’s maximum energy value for each diesel hammer is measured in the laboratory using a hammer in tip top shape. For this reason, it is a good idea to have a hammer on the project with a maximum rated energy higher than the contract minimum required energy. A good rule of thumb when selecting a diesel hammer is that, if 80 percent of the maximum energy of a hammer equals the contract minimum required energy, the diesel hammer will produce sufficient energy to meet the contract energy requirements. A single acting diesel activated hammer is open at the top, and at the top of the ram stroke a portion of the ram is usually visible. The bearing value of the pile being driven is determined by the number of blows per foot at a blows per minute rate. The energy output of a single acting diesel hammer is determined by the blows per minute of the running hammer. The manufacturer is required to submit this energy data. The rate (blows per minute) is dependent on how high the ram raises up (stroke) due to the diesel fuel combustion. Thus, the longer the stroke, the greater the energy and the longer it takes. In other words, as the rate (blows per minute) decreases, the energy output increases. A double acting diesel activated hammer is closed at the top. This closed top acts as a pressure chamber driving the ram back down where the diesel fuel explosion occurs. The bearing value of the pile being driven is determined by the number of blows per foot at a measured pressure within the top bounce chamber. The energy output of a double acting diesel hammer is determined by the measured bounce chamber pressure while the hammer is operating. The manufacturer is required to submit this energy data. Each double acting diesel hammer comes with a hose running from the bounce chamber to a box containing a pressure gauge. There is usually a button on this pressure gauge box. Page 6-56
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Structures
Chapter 6
When the button is depressed the gauge is activated with the bounce chamber pressure. If this button is depressed continuously, the hammer efficiency decreases because of the pressure bleed off created by the pressure gauge operation. The button should only be depressed periodically when an energy reading is required. The pressure reading and corresponding energy shall meet the minimum energy at the required pile bearing value. The Contract allows the use of vibratory hammers to initially set piles. As of yet, there is no reliable means of determining the actual bearing capacity of a pile driven by a vibratory hammer. Often, the contractor wants to initially set piles with vibratory hammers if the soils and/or limited access are such that impact hammer operation would be difficult. The Contract allows this but requires that an impact hammer be used to acquire the bearing capacity. Since static friction is usually much higher than dynamic friction, the actual bearing capacity is determined while the pile is in motion. This requirement is governed by the contract requirement that the pile must be driven at least an additional 2 feet using an impact hammer with the blow count (blows per inch) constant or increasing. If the contractor uses a vibratory hammer to initially set the piles, there must be a comprehensive procedure to ensure proper location an plumbness of each pile. This is usually accomplished by providing a rigid steel template and using good conscientious control while setting and initially driving each pile. SS 6-05.3(9)C
Pile Driving Leads
Pile driving leads shall be fixed at the top and bottom as discussed in Standard Specifications Section 6-05.3(9)C, to ensure that the piling can be accurately driven both as to position and batter. SS 6-05.3(10)
Test Piles
A careful study should be made of the foundation exploration data shown in the plans and/or included in the Geotechnical Report before driving any test piles. Care should be taken that the test piles are not stopped on a relatively thin hard layer overlaying softer material. After the test piles have been driven, an effort should be made to correlate the results with the foundation data before ordering the permanent piles. The results from driving the test piles should be discussed with the Regional Operations/Construction Engineer if they do not correlate with the foundation data. Test piles shall be driven to at least 15 percent more than the ultimate bearing capacity required for the permanent piles, except where pile driving criteria is determined by the wave equation. When pile driving criteria is specified to be determined by the wave equation, the test piles shall be driven to the same ultimate bearing capacity as the production piles. Test piles shall penetrate at least to any minimum tip elevation specified in the Contract. If no minimum tip elevation is specified, test piles shall extend at least 10 feet below the bottom of the concrete footing or groundline, and 16 feet below the bottom of the concrete seal. Preboring, jetting, or other means may be used to secure minimum penetration with the test pile if such means is necessary and will be used for the permanent piles. The reason for driving the test pile is to obtain information for ordering the permanent piles, and to obtain additional information relative to driving the permanent piles.

It is the responsibility of the Contractor to supply test piles of sufficient lengths to provide for variation in soil conditions. If the piles furnished are not long enough, or are unsuitable in other ways, it will be necessary for the Contractor to supply acceptable piles. Followers will not be permitted in driving test piles. A follower is a member interposed between a pile hammer and a pile to transmit blows while pile head is below the reach of the hammer (pile head below the bottom of leads). The State Construction Office should be notified of the date test piles will be driven. Test piles shall also be recorded in the pile driving record book. In addition, following the driving of each test pile, the Test Pile Record form shall be completed and sent to the appropriate offices the following day. This form should be filled in completely, including the rate/pressure of the hammer. Record the bearing value of the test pile for each foot as it is driven. SS 6-05.3(11) Driving Piles It is suggested that the State Construction Office be contacted before any piling are driven. SS 6-05.3(11)A Tolerances Foundation piles must be driven true to line and in their proper position so that full bearing and lateral support is secured for each pile. Each pile has been definitively positioned in the design, and piles should be driven as nearly as practicable to the position shown. Any variation of 6 inches or more from the plan shall be reported to the State Construction Office before accepting the pile. The tolerance for all types of battered piles is ¼ inch in 12 inches. Any deviation exceeding this tolerance shall be reported to the State Construction Office for evaluation. Care shall be taken in driving steel H piles to ensure that the driven pile is oriented as close as possible to that shown in the plans. Pile design usually involves horizontal forces due to temperature, concrete shrinkage, earthquake, and wind as well as axial forces, and if a driven pile is not aligned as shown in the plans, the pile may become overstressed due to excessive bending stresses. Any deviation of more than 20 degrees from the pile axis or more than 6 inches from the position shown in the plans shall be reported to the State Construction Office for evaluation and acceptance. Large diameter prestressed concrete cylinder piles are not completely covered in the Standard Specifications. The requirements of the special provisions must be observed. Accuracy of placing and driving is most important. Every effort should be made to prevent these piles from drifting out of line or out of plumb during driving, but care must be taken to avoid applying excessive lateral force which may crack the pile. These piles do not have to be very far out of plumb before excessive overstress occurs. When a driven pile is found to be cracked or is out of plumb, it should be referred to the State Construction Office for a decision regarding corrective action to be taken. SS 6-05.3(11)D Achieving Minimum Tip Elevation and Bearing Piling shall be driven to develop the bearing value as shown in the plans or in the Standard Specifications. The penetration of the piles under the last few blows must be carefully gauged and the bearing value computed by use of the formula shown in the Standard Page 6-58

Specifications. Pile driving specifications should be administered with a great deal of common sense. There is no substitute for experience and good judgment. Often the foundation reports contain two pile tip elevations, “estimated tip” and “minimum tip” elevations. The estimated tip elevation is simply the elevation that the tip is estimated to be driven to and is utilized to determine driving length quantities in the bid item for furnishing piling. Minimum tip elevations are often specified in the contract plans. These are usually to ensure that piles do not hang up on logs, a thin hard soil layer and other obstructions, or to achieve a minimum pile penetration (e.g., uplift and/or lateral load capacity). Minimum tip elevations are also specified where resistance to uplift is taken into consideration in the design of the foundation seal thickness. The minimum tip elevations should be higher than the estimated tip elevations. The Project Engineer should always review the tip elevations in the plans and compare them to the foundation report recommendations. Any discrepancies should be reported to the State Construction Office. The minimum tip elevations is a design parameter that may come from the geotechnical design or the structural design. A pile tip elevation that is less than minimum cannot be accepted in the field, it must be reviewed by the State Bridge and Structures Office, the State Bridge Construction Office, and the State Geotechnical Engineer. If, during the initial pile driving operations, minimum tip is not being achieved, no additional piling should be driven until concurrence is obtained to change the minimum tip elevation, or the contractor will have to change his method of installation so that the minimum tip elevation can be achieved. The use of water jets may be required for driving piles, especially for concrete piles. The piles must be driven at least 6 inches after the jet is removed, or to the required bearing. Do not allow the nozzle of the jet to penetrate below the tip of piling previously driven. Mark the jet pipe in such manner that the operator and Inspector can determine the depth required. The State Construction Office should be notified if water jets are proposed for use. Preboring may also be used to secure the minimum specified penetration. Usually the prebored hole should be slightly smaller in diameter than the pile and the depth of preboring should be less than the minimum specified penetration. However, conditions may exist which make it necessary that a larger hole be prebored and the space around the pile be filled with sand while the pile is being driven to the specified bearing. Unless water-jetting, preboring, or other means of securing minimum penetration is specified and payment is provided for in the contract provisions, this work will be at the Contractor’s choice and expense. However, the procedure used must be reviewed by the Engineer and shall result in a satisfactory pile and will not damage the integrity of the structure, roadway, adjacent structures, or utilities. Any damage done must be repaired to the satisfaction of the Engineer at the Contractor’s expense. Where the specified minimum tip elevations cannot be reached the State Construction Office shall be notified. SS 6-05.3(11)F Pile Damage Rejected piles shall be removed or cut off 2 feet below the bottom of the footing. Rejected casings for cast in place piles that are left in place shall be filled with sand.

In driving precast concrete piles, several layers of plywood or a 3½ inches wood block should be placed between the top of the pile and the steel driving head of the hammer. Care should be taken to prevent crushing of the pile head before the desired penetration is reached. Where crushing occurs, the top of the pile should be checked to determine if the end is square with the body of the pile; also, the hammer should be checked to determine if a fairly flat blow is being delivered to the pile. In driving concrete piles, it may be advisable, in order to prevent crushing of the head and to obtain the required penetration, to operate a hammer at less than full throttle until just before completing the driving, after which the throttle should be fully opened in order to obtain the true bearing value of the pile. SS 6-05.3(13)
Treatment of Timber Pile Heads
The handling and driving of treated piling require special care. Heads of piles should always be freshly cut, and rings or wire mesh screens placed on top during driving. In wet weather the final cutoff should be at least 1 foot long and the creosote, pitch and fabric cover placed immediately after the pile is cut. Do not make a cutoff and then wait until the next day to place the cover. Fabric covers should be well tacked to the pile and neatly trimmed to within 3 inches of the top of the pile so that the fabric will not have ragged edges. A follower driving cap should be used on treated piles. This is to help hold the pile in line to minimize the use of chocks in the leads during driving. Timber piles must be strapped in accordance with the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 9-10.1 before they are driven. SS 6-05.3(15)
Completion of Cast-In-Place Concrete Piles
The casings for piles cast in place shall be carefully checked after driving, for water tightness and deformation of the casing due to the driving of adjacent piles. A mirror for reflecting light into the casing is the most common method for this check. On cloudy days, a flashlight may be lowered into the casing. Immediately after driving, the pile casing shall be covered to prevent dirt and water falling into it. All debris and water shall be removed from the casing prior to placing the reinforcing steel cage. No water will be permitted in the casing when concrete is placed. Due to the ever increasing loading from earthquake activity, most cast in place piling require reinforcement for the full depth of the pile. This full depth reinforcement presents extreme difficulty in placing concrete with a rigid conduit the full depth, especially if the pile is battered. For this reason, Class 4000P concrete is required. This class of concrete has small aggregate and fly ash making the mix rather sticky and cohesive, which reduces the likelihood of segregation during placement. This concrete shall be placed continuously through at 5 foot rigid conduit directing the concrete down the center of the pile casing, ensuring that every part of the pile is filled and the concrete is worked around the reinforcement. The top 5 foot of concrete shall be placed with the tip of the conduit below the top of fresh concrete. The Contractor shall vibrate, as a minimum, the top 10 feet of concrete. In all cases, the concrete shall be vibrated to a point at least 5 feet below the original ground line.

Railing Alignment Railings shall be carefully aligned, both horizontally and vertically, to give a pleasing appearance. On multiple span bridges, the rail and wheel guard or curb heights at the ends of each span should be varied a sufficient amount to produce a uniform camber or grade from end to end of the bridge. At the beginning and ends of horizontal curves and through vertical curves, the height of curbs may need to be varied so that the rail heights will be uniform above the curb. On any structure on which occurs a break in grade, horizontal curve with superelevation, vertical curve, or a combination of the three, the Project Engineer should plot to a large scale, the profiles of the roadway grades at the curb lines. From these profiles the grades for the tops of the curbs and railings can be properly determined. A slight hump in the rail over the whole structure is usually not objectionable, but a hump and then a sag is not permissible.

GEN 6-07.1
General When inspecting bridge painting for steel structures, the Inspector should prepare a plan for the structure they will be inspecting. This plan will enable the Inspector to locate sections of the structure where painting activities occurred. An Inspector’s Daily Report should be filled out after every work day with the activities performed and related to the Inspector’s bridge plan. In the daily report, the Inspector should identify the activities such as cleaning, blasting, and applying the base, intermediate, and finish coats. These daily reports should accurately represent the work accomplished and any noted deficiencies. The Inspector should become familiar with the latest safety requirements. Contract environmental requirements should be reviewed as well. Manufacture and shop mixing of paint materials are controlled from the State Materials Laboratory. Each container in each shipment of paint should bear a lot number, date of manufacture, type of paint and manufacturer’s name. When quantities of paint required for a particular job are 20 gallons or less, they may be manufactured and shipped without inspection and testing by the laboratory. A certificate of compliance with specifications signed by the manufacturer shall be presented to the Project Engineer by the Contractor at the time the paint is brought to the project site.

All paint shall be thoroughly mixed before using. Paint may be mixed by stirring with hand paddles or by using power stirrers. All paints bearing dates of manufacture over one year old should be sampled on the basis of one sample per batch. Paint showing appreciable deviation from normal should be sampled and set aside until checked and released by the State Materials Laboratory. The paint should be capable of application at the required thickness without any sags or runs. If it is not possible to do this, the State Materials Laboratory should be contacted for necessary steps to be taken. SS 6-07.3(9) Painting New Steel Structures SS 6-07.3(9)I Application of Field Coatings New steel, shop coated before erection, shall have all erection and transportation scars, rivet heads, and welds cleaned and spot coated. If a dirt film has accumulated on the steel during the erection period this must be removed by flushing. All concrete residue must be removed from the floor system after the deck pour is completed. Generally, this may be accomplished by flushing before the residue has set up and while the pour is in progress. All coatings shall be applied per the manufacturers recommendations. Brushes and spray equipment should be in good condition. An intermediate stripe coat should be applied to the metal edges, inside angles, welds, bolt heads, nuts and rivets prior to the application of the full intermediate coat of paint. The use of inspection mirrors is required for reflecting light into the interior of boxed sections or members for locating painting defects. The Inspector must check to see that the proper film thickness of paint is applied. Wet film thickness is to be measured immediately after the paint is applied and the dry film thickness is to be measured after the paint has become thoroughly dry and hard. It is difficult to measure the dry film thickness of paint on galvanized metal so it is necessary to measure the wet film thickness for each coat of paint as it is applied. When an Inspector finds an area where the painting does not meet the specifications, they should mark the area with contrasting brightly colored alkyd paint from an aerosol can. A light coat of this spray paint will not adversely affect the paint job and it will effectively mark the area to tell whether correction work was performed on the area. Marking the area with spray paint provides the Inspector with an easy method of marking deficient areas and provides the Contractor a ready method of locating the areas that require additional work. This will also free the Inspector to concentrate on areas of serious deficiencies without losing control over those requiring minor corrections. When marking the final coat, be careful to mark only the area to be reworked. Adequate staging, scaffolding, ladders, and fall protection are required to be provided by the Contractor to ensure safety to workmen, room for good workmanship, and adequate facilities for proper inspection. Technical assistance and equipment are available at the State Materials Lab, and on request can be provided at the job site to ensure a good paint job.

Surface Preparation Prior to Overcoat Painting
Cleaning for removal of rust or corrosion spots in repainting and cleaning of new steel shall mean “commercial” abrasive blasting as defined in the Standard Specifications or the special provisions. Wire brushing and scraping shall normally be limited to removal of dirt and loose paint where corrosion is not involved. All rust which cannot be removed by abrasive blasting shall be removed with chisels, hammers or other effective means as directed by the Engineer. When called for in the Standard Specifications or the special provisions, the entire structure shall be pressure flushed with water from the top down before other cleaning or painting is started. The nozzle should not be more than 9 in from the surface being cleaned. A biodegradable detergent may be added to the water jet to remove oil and grease. Biodegradable detergents shall be reviewed by the State Materials Laboratory and precautions taken to avoid harmful residue on the steel. In addition to the initial pressure flushing, all abrasive blasting residue must be removed after blasting and spotting and before application of additional paint. Pressure flushing may be required for this purpose if the Project Engineer deems it necessary. On repainting projects, the Engineer or Inspector should observe and report to the State Bridge and Structures Engineer any spot or area where corrosion or other deficiencies are of such extent as to threaten the strength of the steel member. They should also observe areas where water becomes trapped to ultimately endanger the steel through corrosive action, and advise the Regional Operations/Construction Engineer, so the condition may be corrected. SS 6-07.3(10)F Collecting, Testing, and Disposal of Containment Waste During the preparation and painting of steel bridges, it is very important that the Inspector be aware of the potential impact to the surrounding environment. The air, water, and land quality are of major concern. WSDOT and environmental agencies are working together to establish guidelines for bridge painting. Policies and procedures involving environmental concerns will be addressed in the contract. Compliance to these specifications should be closely monitored. Many bridges that are being repainted have been previously painted with lead based paint. When this is the case, the Contractor must submit a “Lead Health Protection Program” (WAC 296-155-176). The waste generated from cleaning the bridge (bird guano, paint chips, etc.) must be tested as outlined in the contract provisions. Handling and disposal of this wasted must be as prescribed by current state law. Contact your Regional Environmental Office regarding disposal of lead paint waste.

This information is necessary for the Contractor QC and WSDOT QA, if desired. A Grade Controlled structure requires a Contractor survey of the existing grade profile and includes measurement of the asphalt depth prior to pavement removal when removal is to be achieved by rotary milling/planing. The Contractor needs to know the existing planing depths, in advance, to avoid damaging the concrete. The Contractor needs to know the Final Grade Profile for tolerance acceptance. When scraping is the method of Full Removal, the asphalt depths do not need to be known prior to removal. The Project Engineer must review the Contractor survey for safe planing depths and adjust the Final Grade Profile to meet the desired uniform depth specified in the Plans. Adjusting the Final Grade Profile and planing depths should consider the following: 1. Contractor survey for removal: Submittal review should always assume the existing asphalt depths were unknown or inaccurate at the Design stage and use the measured depths provided in the survey. Grade Controlled, Partial Removal milling depth should not be within 0.10 foot or 1¼ inches of the concrete structure at any location to preserve the deck and membrane. Full Removal planing should not contact the concrete deck surface. Prior to milling, the Project Engineer must check the asphalt depth to the original concrete surface at all locations. The maximum mill depth should be as close as possible or to within 0.01 foot or 1/8 inch of the top of the existing deck, and not below. The planed surface should be uniform, flat, and not remove the concrete. Ideally, the asphalt removal exposes the deck without removing a layer of concrete rebar cover. Practically, there will be areas of thin pavement in previous rutts, and areas of over milling or damage. In these areas, the asphalt depths will vary and appear as inconsistent data because

the original grade has changed. Using the Contractor survey, it is up to the Project Engineer to determine original grade and safe removal depths. Profile changes are often undocumented and buried on structures that have been widened in the past. Excessive pavement depth also contributes to inconsistent surveyed data. 2. Contractor survey for Final Grade Profile: The survey includes the profile beyond the structure for two reasons: a. To provide a smooth transition from the existing roadway to the structure profile grade. b. To identify existing problems in the transition zone. If there is a grade profile problem on or off the structure, the Project Engineer should address the Final Grade Profile adjustment with the Contractor. If it is necessary to raise or lower the Final Grade Profile, or transition the grade, the maximum rate of grade adjustment or slope is 0.2 percent (1’/500’), per Standard Plan A60.30. Skewed bridge ends, cross slope transitions, and significant summit or sag vertical curves require extended grade transitions. If previous paving has not been transitioned smoothly (too short), the length of the transition must be extended. If extending the transition places it outside of the project limits, contact the HQ Construction Office. An improper transition is unacceptable for two reasons: a. This is the common cause of many “bumps at the bridge” and may reduce the load rating. The Bridge Office may have to restrict truck loading if the transition is bad enough. b. It is a waste of Maintenance resources to place a temporary wedge patch to address smoothness. SS 6-08.3(4) Partial Depth Removal of Bituminous Pavement from Structure Decks Grade Control applies to Partial Removals when a grade correction is required on or off the structure. Partial Depth or Mill/Fill planing should never contact the concrete deck surface, see SS 6-08.3(2)1, Paragraph 1. Milled areas which contact the concrete deck or membrane should be marked for repair as damaged concrete and require a membrane repair. SS 6-08.3(5) Full Depth Removal of Bituminous Pavement from Structure Decks Prior to milling operations, the Inspector must verify the rotor head ¼ inch tooth spacing and tooth length tolerance. Common planer tooth spacing of 5/8 inch or planer teeth that are not uniform length provide a surface that is too rough for waterproof membranes. Planer teeth that are worn down and not sharp severely damage concrete. Remove loose, unbonded, or substandard HMA prior to placing a membrane. HMA in good condition and firmly bonded to the concrete does not have to be removed or chained. A Chain Drag applies to the remaining area of exposed concrete to identify repairs.

SS 6-08.3(6) Repair of Damage due to Bituminous Pavement Removal Operations Full Removal planing must be uniform and smooth where occasional tooth strikes in the deck are unavoidable within the planing tolerance. Milled areas below the maximum mill depth tolerance should be marked for repair as damaged concrete. Planer damage consisting of concrete edges and ridges should be repaired flush to grade with a grout material to avoid stretching or tearing the membrane when HMA is compacted. Do not pay for this work in the Bridge Deck Repair item. SS 6-08.3(7) Concrete Deck Repair Standard Plan A-60.40, “HMA Overlay Further Deck Preparation” is available for reference and details of Bridge Deck Repair. A qualified Region Materials staff or Inspector must be available during or shortly after the removal process in order to complete a Chain Drag test timely. The chaining identifies the existing Bridge Deck Repair quantity on the structure, whereas the Plan quantity for the Bridge Deck Repair item is an estimate that limits the cost risk and closure time to the contract. Administration of Bridge Deck Repair should follow these guidelines: 1. Section 1-04.6, Variation of Estimated Quantities applies for payment since the Chain Drag quantity and the Plan quantity will seldom match. 2. If the Chain Drag testing indicates more repairs than the Plans, it is preferred but not mandatory to negotiate more or all of the repairs within the contract. If the chained quantity exceeds 125 percent of the Plan quantity, contact the Bridge Office and the HQ Construction Office for a recommendation to proceed because excessive Bridge Deck Repair may not be cost effective and concrete deck rehabilitation may be required. 3. If the contract cannot complete all repairs, the priority repair areas are: a. Full depth repairs or holes in the deck b. Areas with exposed rebar to protect the steel c. Fill in spalled areas to provide a level surface for the membrane d. Delaminated areas 4. The Project Engineer must submit the Chain Drag Report spreadsheet to the Bridge Deck Program Manager in the Bridge and Structures Office in order to manage the concrete deck needs statewide. The Chain Drag Report spreadsheet can be obtained on the State Construction Office SharePoint site. A Chain Drag Report documents the deck conditions after Contract. The spreadsheet has instructions to document the area (square foot) of patches, spalls, delaminations and other defects. The primary function of the report is to describe the total patching completed in the contract, and to note any deck defects or paving construction issues for future reference. The secondary function is to document the amount of incomplete repair, which is the basis for estimating the future Bridge Deck Repair quantities in the next Full Removal. Page 6-66

If rotary milling exceeded the depth tolerance and damaged the concrete, these areas are marked for repair at the contractor’s expense in accordance with Section 6-08.3(6), Repair of Damage due to Bituminous Pavement Removal Operations. SS 6-08.3(8) Waterproof Membrane for Structure Decks The Contractor must install the Bridge Deck Waterproof Membranes in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommended products and installation documents. Primers must cure or the membrane may not stay in place during compaction. At night, a hand held spotlight will show a dull finish when the primer has cured vs shiny when wet. Cooler temperatures or higher humidity will take longer to cure. Inspect the membranes during placement for construction defects that poke holes during compaction; and while paving to ensure the paver does not drag on the membrane or other equipment does not tear the membrane with turning movements. SS 6-08.3(9)A Protection of Structure Attachments and Embedments Bridge expansion joints vary in size, materials and complexity. Contractor placement operations must not leave BST or HMA in expansion joints. The Contractor shall remove all materials dumped through the joints to the substructure. Bridge Maintenance is not funded to clean up or repair this contract work. SS 6-08.3(11) Paved Panel Joint Seals and HMA Sawcut and Seal The Contractor must mark the locations of the exact ends of sawcut for a string line before paving unless there is a gap in the bridge curb clearly indicating the location. Usually, it will be difficult to find after paving and sometimes the gap in the curb does not line up with the expansion gap. Watch for joints that have a jog or are not a straight line from curb to curb. Standard Plan A-40.20, Detail 3 or Detail 4 shows HMA ¼ inch higher than concrete. This should apply to all paving up against any hard materials in the surfacing, such as steel joints or headers, for the following reasons: 1. This insures compaction effort is applied to the HMA and not the hard material. Lack of compaction in the butt joint is the primary reason for raveling and early failure of HMA, which is a chronic maintenance problem. It is acceptable for HMA to be placed flush at the gutter line to avoid ponding where compaction is not critical. 2. The slightly raised grade prevents snowplows from destroying the bridge joint. 3. Within a short period of time, the tires provide additional compaction and/or rutting that will produce a smooth surface with the best performance.

Concrete Barrier
SS 6-10.3
Construction Requirements
SS 6-10.3(2) Cast-In-Place Concrete Barrier On some projects, the Contractor has the option of using slipform techniques in addition to the usual fixed forms as specified in Standard Specifications Sections 6-02.3(6), 6-02.3(11)A, 6-02.3(24)C, 6-10.3(2), and 9-03.1(2)B. In either method, barriers and rail bases should be carefully aligned both horizontally and vertically to give a pleasing appearance; refer to Standard Specifications Section 6-01.4. The vertical adjustment for the pleasing appearance is intended for localized camber and deck profile variables. This adjustment is not intended to eliminate grade breaks, such as vertical curves and superelevation transitions. The Project Engineer should plot to a large scale the profiles of the roadway grades at the curb lines. From these profiles, the grades for the tops of traffic barriers, pedestrian barriers, and rail bases can be properly determined. A slight hump in the barriers or rail base over the whole bridge is not usually objectionable. On the safety-shape traffic barriers, some of the height variation may be accommodated in the vertical face at the base. Any height variation shall maintain the 2 foot 8 inch total height. The vertical toe face at the base is usually 3 inches unless the structure is receiving an immediate overlay. To accommodate the overlay, the vertical face at the base is increased to 3 inches plus overlay thickness. The front face geometry of the safetyshape traffic barrier is critical and should not be varied except as noted herein. Ideally, all height adjustment required to provide a pleasing appearance should be accomplished by modifying the total height of the traffic barrier by varying the vertical toe face at the base, i.e., 2 inch minimum. The front and back faces of the traffic barrier are parallel on the upper part to accommodate all height adjustment necessary. The 7 inch height of the intermediate sloping face shall be maintained. To ensure proper alignment, carefully check the top of forms or the Contractor’s control wire prior to placing concrete. On slipformed traffic barriers and pedestrian barriers, the same cross-Section as shown for fixed-form construction shall be used, except the top chamfer may be shaped to a ¾ inch radius. Although slipforming may be allowed in the contract, the reinforcing steel bars may not be sufficient to resist the forces during the concrete placement operations. The contractor should evaluate the stiffness of the reinforcing and, if necessary, provide additional reinforcing steel crossbracing, both longitudinally and transversely. Slipformed concrete is usually placed with a slump of 1¼ inches plus or minus ¼ inches. This slump is critical and should be carefully controlled by the Contractor. It is not unusual to encounter conditions which produce sections of unsatisfactory barrier or rail base due to slump, finish, alignment or other problems. When this occurs, do not hesitate to have the unsatisfactory sections removed. Occasional removal is inherent in slipform construction. Placement of the reinforcing steel bar cage to ensure adequate concrete cover and proper reinforcing bar location is very important and difficult to check for slipformed traffic barrier, pedestrian barrier, and rail bases. When fixed forms are used, final adjustment of the reinforcing steel bar cage can be accomplished after the forms are set prior to concrete placement. The slipform method does not present this opportunity. For that reason, Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(24)C requires that the Contractor check Page 6-68
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40 
Structures
Chapter 6
reinforcing steel bar clearances and placement prior to slipform concrete placement. This check can be accomplished by either the use of a template or by operating the slipform machine over the entire length of the barrier. The final grade control must be set prior to the check. All reinforcing steel deficiencies must be corrected by the Contractor. SS 6-10.3(5) Temporary Barrier The condition of temporary concrete barrier shall be verified with a visual inspection by the Engineer. Any section of temporary barrier determined to be in good condition is allowed to be used on the project. Any section of temporary barrier determined not to be in good condition shall be handled as follows: 1. For temporary barrier sections being placed in a new run of temporary barrier: Any section(s) deemed not to be in good condition by the Engineer will be rejected and are not allowed to be installed in the new run of temporary barrier. The rejected barrier section(s) shall be removed from the project. 2. For temporary barrier sections that have already been placed in a run of temporary barrier: Any section(s) which are deemed not be in good condition by the Engineer shall either be repaired immediately to the Engineer’s satisfaction, or the section shall be removed from the temporary barrier run and replaced with a section of temporary barrier determined to be in good condition by the Engineer. The rejected barrier section(s) shall be removed from the project. Temporary concrete barrier sections shall be deemed to be in good condition and may be accepted when they have:
• Only minor blemishes (i.e. dirt, scuffs, traffic marks, superficial surface cracking, etc.)
• No excessive amounts of cracks (1/2 inch or deeper) or chips
• No spalls in the concrete with a depth greater than 1.5 inches
• End connection hardware that is intact, undamaged, and functional Temporary concrete barrier sections shall be deemed not to be in good condition and rejected when they have:
• One or more cracks that penetrate through the entire section
• One or more spalls in the concrete with a depth of greater than 1.5 inches
• Exposed rebar or bolts that are protruding through the barrier surface
• Cracked or broken concrete that could be easily dislodged if struck by a vehicle
• End connection hardware that is deformed, bent, broken, corroded/rusted, or no longer functional

Geosynthetic Retaining Walls
GEN 6-14
Description Geosynthetic retaining walls may be Standard Plan walls or specially designed walls that are used in both permanent and temporary applications. Permanent walls usually have different material acceptance requirements than temporary walls and usually have a facing to protect the geosynthetic from damage and sunlight. In temporary applications, it is common to see a Standard Plan wall called out in the Plans. When this occurs, the wall is still a temporary wall. The Standard Plan wall was called out because the internal design of the wall has already been completed for the Standard Plans. This simplifies the submittal process and speeds up construction, as internal design is not needed. Regardless of the wall’s status as permanent or temporary, most geosynthetic walls require the Contractor to do some geometric design to lay out wall lift heights and layer elevations to meet the specific geometry needs in the Plans and achieve the proper grades and lines of the Contract.
SS 6-14
Geosynthetic Retaining Walls
SS 6-14.2 Approval of Material Geosynthetic reinforcement for permanent geosynthetic retaining walls are accepted on receipt of “Satisfactory” test reports from the State Materials Laboratory. Sampling must be completed by a tester qualified in sampling geosynthetic material. Section 9-33.4(3) defines a “lot” and outlines the process for retesting. The Project Inspector must be familiar with the retesting procedures and understand the definition of a “lot”. It is important to discuss the acceptance procedures with the Contractor well before the material is needed, as testing can take up to 30 days. Geosynthetic materials for temporary geosynthetic walls do not need to be tested and are accepted by Manufacturers Certification of Compliance, unless specified otherwise in the Contract. The handling and storage requirements in Section 2-12.2 apply to both permanent and temporary geosynthetic retaining wall materials. Gravel borrow for structural earth walls is used in the construction of geosynthetic retaining walls. Refer to section SS 2-03.3(13), Borrow for more information.
SS 6-14.3
Construction Requirements Type 2 Working Drawings must be followed by the Contractor with respect to geosynthetic material type, material strength, and geosynthetic reinforcement length. The Project Inspector must ensure the requirements for backfill and compaction are met. Temporary geosynthetic retaining walls have the same construction requirements as permanent retaining walls.
SS 6-14 3(2) Submittals The Contractor is required to submit Type 2E Working Drawings complying with the requirements of the Standard Specifications, Standard Plans, and Contract Plans prior to Work performed on the geosynthetic retaining wall. The Project Office should verify that Page 6-70

Chapter 6
working drawings include all required submittal elements and have the correct plan and profile geometry prior to forwarding for further review per Figure 1-1 (Working Drawings, Shop Plans, or Submittal Type). Geosynthetic retaining wall designs are provided in the Standard Plans and/or Contract Plans for each Contract. The designs dictate the wall geometry, material strength requirements, and geosynthetic reinforcement length. The Contractor, by way of the Type 2E Working Drawings, can determine where steps are needed to facilitate the plan profiles. The Contractor also can determine the lift thicknesses for each layer, as allowed by the wall design. The geosynthetic reinforcement lengths shown in the Contract documents are based on wall height and do not change. This is an important note when determining measurement limits.
SS 6-14.4
Measurement The Standard Plans or Contract Plans show the measurement limits for structure excavation, backfill, and compaction as the limits of the geosynthetic reinforcement. At abutment walls, measurement for the face of wall would include both the area of the wall parallel to the roadway as well as the area of wall transverse to the roadway. In that same situation backf
