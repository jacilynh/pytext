ill is only measured once. If wall drains are called for in the Plans at the back of the reinforcement, the measurement for backfill should be extended to the back of the drains. As stated previously the reinforcement lengths are determined by the design provided in the Contract and do not change. In a cut wall situation, it may then be necessary to compensate the Contractor for required excavation beyond the limits of the reinforcement under the Specifications for shoring or extra excavation class A or shoring or extra excavation class B, per the Contract documents. In either case, backfill for extra excavation and shoring is included in the shoring or extra excavation items. Based on Section 2-03.4 embankment compaction is also measured.

Shafts
SS 6-19
Shafts Drilled shaft foundation construction is often very technical and is always critical because the shafts are supporting the structure. Any shaft foundation malfunction will be devastating both economically and safety wise. Construction of maintenance free bridges requires close attention to details during the construction of drilled shaft foundations. Training on shaft construction is available through the State Construction Office. The training covers specifications, equipment, site geological conditions, and general questions. At least 5 working days before any drilled shaft foundation work begins, a conference should be held to go over the procedures and equipment to be used and to emphasize the critical areas of construction. As a minimum, this meeting should include a discussion of the contractor’s shaft installation plan and order of work. In addition to this discussion, both WSDOT personnel and the Contractor’s personnel should discuss specifics of the

project; such as, Crosshole Sonic Log Testing (CSL Testing), site subsurface conditions, site access, traffic control, staging areas, excavation disposal, slurry storage and transfer, slurry disposal, and environmental protection. Meeting attendees should include key personnel from WSDOT, the Prime Contractor, and the shaft drilling Contractor. The WSDOT personnel should include the Project Engineer, key inspection personnel, and representatives from the Geotechnical Division, the State Materials Laboratory, and a representative of the State Construction Office. Nondestructive Testing of Shafts There are two main types of non-destructive tests that WSDOT allows for drilled shafts. Cross-hole Sonic Logging (CSL) and Thermal Integrity Profiling (TIP). Either method is acceptable. Both tests need to be performed by an experienced tester, and the findings/ report require the seal of the engineer in responsible charge of the testing. Shafts poured in the dry do not require nondestructive testing, but all others do. For Quality Assurance (QA) purposes, WSDOT has moved to contractor supplied nondestructive testing of shafts. This means that the drilled shaft contractor or a testing subcontractor will test the shafts and provide the Contractor a report. The Contractor is then responsible to forward the report to the Project Engineer (PE). The PE is responsible to review the report and if the test report does not identify anomalies, the PE may allow construction of the shaft to continue. If the test report identifies anomalies, the PE shall not allow shaft construction to continue on that shaft, may suspend further shaft construction on the project, and shall forward the test results and Inspector Daily Reports to the Construction Office. The Construction Office will provide the PE with further instructions. WSDOT has retained the right to perform Quality Verification (QV) testing on 10 percent of the shafts that are tested by the Contractor. The purpose of the QV testing is to verify the Contractor’s results. Currently, WSDOT is only performing CSL tests for verification. The PE is responsible to select shafts for QV testing and shall coordinate the testing with the Contractor and the Geotechnical Office. Ideally, WSDOT QV tests should occur on the same day as the Contractor’s QA test, to minimize delays and impact to the Contractor. If the Contractor has selected TIP testing for shafts, the PE must identify the QV shafts during cage fabrication so that CSL tubes can be installed when the cage is fabricated. Once the shaft concrete has been successfully placed, call the Geotechnical Office to schedule QV CSL testing. Contact

A key aspect of the QV test is comparing the WSDOT test results to the Contractor’s test results. Accordingly, the PE will need to forward the Contractor’s test report to the Geotechnical Office as soon as possible. The Geotechnical Office will prepare a report for the QV test. If the WSDOT test corroborates the Contractor’s test, no further action will be necessary. If the tests disagree, the Construction Office will provide the PE with instructions. Page 6-72

Buried Structures
6-20.1
Construction Requirements Many of the instructions for the construction of culverts covered in Section 7-02 are equally applicable to the construction of buried structures. Equipment should not operate across buried structures until the backfill has been constructed as required in the Installation Plan (see Standard Specification Section 6-02.3(2)F).
Precast Concrete Buried Structures Fabrication Precast forms may not be able to produce the exact geometry shown in the Plans. Standard Specification Section 6-20.3(1)A2 allows for alternate designs to accommodate minor deviations. When the deviations exceed the limits specified, the alternate structure proposal must meet the Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP) requirements in Standard Specification Section 1-04.4(2)A. For Class 1 and Class 2 concrete three sided structures and concrete split box culvers, unless otherwise shown in the Plans, the Contractor is required to progressively shop assemble the top and bottom units of at least the first 3 adjacent units for inspection of fit-up for each set of forms used. The shop assembly may be considered successful if:
• Joints and units align and meet construction tolerances
• Point or edge loading does not occur within joint locations The fit-up should be performed on a flat, solid surface such as concrete or solid ground with a layer of sand.
• WSDOT Fabrication Inspectors are typically onsite to observe the fit-up and verify tolerances are met. It is encouraged that a Contractor’s representative and staff from the Project Office also attend to observe. As an alternate to being physically present, the Contractor and Project Engineer may agree to observe the fit-up via a video conference. The Project Engineer may delegate a representative to accept the fit-up. The Fabrication Inspector should not stamp Approved for Shipment until the Project Engineer or delegate has approved the fit-up. This should all be discussed at the PreConstruction Conference. Bedding Preparation The quality of the bedding prepared by the Contractor has significant impact on the difficulty of installation and quality of the final project. It is best practice to install bedding for flat precast units as flat and even as possible on the proper grade. High or low points in the bedding or soft/unsuitable materials can cause gaps or steps in the joints between units. A mud slab or leveling pad may be considered as bedding preparation for some buried structures. It could provide a flat, even, dry, and firm foundation and prevent loose material from inhibiting jointing efforts.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.40

Chapter 6
Structures
Installation Standard Specification 6-20.3(2)F requires the Contractor to submit a detailed Installation Plan. It is important that this Installation Plan address in detail the circumstances described below. Sequence of installation is important. Unit installation sequence should be such that precast units can be lowered into their final position if possible. It is best practice to avoid sliding units on bedding material, as loose or disturbed bedding material can become trapped within the joints. When sliding the units cannot be avoided, trapping material within the annular joint space could be prevented by preparing a narrow channel or trough across the front of the previously set unit to capture any loose or disturbed material as units are jointed. Alternatively, a metal plate, or other material, could be placed over the bedding material at the joint. Precast units may need to be pulled together to achieve the required joint openings and maintain compression of the butyl rubber sealant. Once the required joint gap is achieved, jointing forces should be maintained for at least 30 seconds to ensure the butyl rubber gasket is seated and distributed evenly within the annular space of the joint. It may be necessary to brace or weigh down previously set units to inhibit movement during jointing. Ensure precast concrete units join squarely. Also, it is best to avoid jointing one side first and then trying to join the other side, as this can cause damage to the units. Bedding material leveling adjustments can be made after unit placement by a gentle side to side movement of the unit to encourage it to settle into the bedding. The Contractor may make alignment adjustments by jacking from the side of the trench or trench box, ensuring the jacking load is distributed over a large area on the precast unit to avoid damage. They can also be made by gently pulling or pushing with an excavator (using a suitable buffer). Leveling and alignment adjustments should not be done using a downward pressure on the units. It is important to maintain geometric control and perform real time geometric checks as units are placed. This will help avoid:
• Over or under runs for the total length of the buried structure
• Misaligned vertical joints between lower and upper units for split box culverts
• Out of tolerance joint adjustments Point loadings on precast units should be avoided. Point loadings can be caused by construction equipment, uneven joints or lack of adherence to tolerances. They can cause corner, edge or “dinner plate” spalling or shear cracks. If the Installation Plan has not addressed some of these topics, they should be discussed at the Pre-Construction Conference so there is no misstep while the Work is being performed.

Structural Plate Buried Structures Assembling Those inspecting the installation of metal plate structures should be familiar with the requirements of AASHTO LRFD Bridge Construction Specifications Section 26. Standard Specifications Section 6-20.3(8)B requires construction of metal plate structures to conform to those requirements. All Class 2 structural plate buried structures shall meet the structure dimension tolerances for the assembly of long span structures. Structure shape shall be checked regularly during construction by the Contractor as described in Standard Specification Section 6-20.3(9)A. Installation deflection inspections by direct measurement shall be performed by the Contractor immediately after construction and 30 days or more after construction as described in Standard Specification Section 6-20.3(9)A. These activities are critical as metal structural plate structures may not function or distribute loads properly otherwise. Manufacturers of multi-plate structures are required to supply detailed assembly instructions with their structures, which should be closely followed. Plates on different parts of the structure can be of different sizes and thicknesses. Ensure that the correct plates are used in the correct locations. Plates should be labeled with unit identifiers shown in the working drawings as well as the thickness or gage in accordance with Standard Specification Section 6-20.3(7)B. It is important that the bottom plates be correctly positioned for alignment and grade of their edges before the other plates of the section are bolted up so the completed structure will be in proper alignment. If the structure starts to creep or spiral, the only way to correct this condition is to remove the plates to where it is in correct alignment and reconstruct the structure. High-strength bolts are used in bolting the plates together. In order for the connections to function as designed, the bolts must be tightened to the specified tension. Section 6-02.3(33) covers the instructions for construction and inspection of high tensile strength bolts. Impact wrenches must be calibrated as specified since overtightening may overstress the bolts and under-tightening will not give the connection the required strength. If more than one crew is assembling the structure, the impact wrenches must be calibrated to tighten the bolts to the same torque. Bolts have been observed to loosen and back out during compaction of backfill so it may be beneficial to tighten the bolts towards the higher end of the range of recommended torque.

Submittal For Contractor supplied designs, the Project Office shall ensure fabrication shop drawings are not submitted prior to approval of the site specific Plans, Specifications and supporting calculations. Fabrication shop drawings shall reflect any and all comments made during the review of the Plans, Specifications and calculations. In order to help reduce the duration and number of review cycles, it is recommended that WSDOT reviewers for buried structures be available for direct meetings with fabricators to help resolve review comments. This will help address concerns raised by precasters that the duration and number of review cycles is causing hardship during construction. Recommended meeting invitees include the Project Engineer or PEO representative, ASCE, BTA, Contractor representative, and fabricator. The BTA or Bridge and Structures Office reviewer shall ensure all communication conforms to Construction Manual Section GEN 1-00.11(2).

GEN 7-01.1
Roadway Subdrainage Underground streams and seepage zones which require installation of water collection systems may be encountered in roadway excavation. The gradation of gravel used in water interception channels is of prime importance. Gravel backfill for drains has been developed for this use. This drain material is an open graded gravel which will become plugged with fines if not protected with a filter. It should always be used with a filter cloth which has proven effective in inhibiting the infiltration of fines. The filtration ability of construction geosynthetic depends upon the Geotextile Class. The class must be determined following the guidance in the Design Manual M 22-01 Exhibit 630-1. When installing perforated drain pipe, the perforations should be in the lower half of the pipe. This will minimize infiltration of fine material and ensure longer service. Where a subdrain installation is intended to pick up flow from intermittent seepage zones, nonperforated pipe should be used between the seepage areas to avoid possible loss of water into otherwise dry areas. In some cases, it may be necessary to supplement the pickup system with a carrier pipe system. It is imperative that if the Engineer requires the installation of water collection systems not already included in the plans, or a modification is made to the collection system in the plans, to update to the hydraulic report. Detailed as-builts of the added system(s) must be prepared, documented, and preserved in WSDOT’s records by the Engineer so that maintenance can be performed and the systems can be identified on future projects. The Project Engineer’s attention is directed to the fact that control of water during construction is the responsibility of the Contractor. See Section 2-03.4 for temporary water pollution/erosion control.

GEN 7-02.1
General Instructions The life of the roadway depends largely upon proper drainage, and it is essential to give diligent attention to adequacy as well as to quality of construction. In addition to providing for the passage of existing natural drainage channels through the project, a highway drainage system must provide for the collection and disposal to natural drainage channels of all rainfall on the right of way and of all ground water flow that may be intercepted during roadway construction. It is attempted during location and planning to provide for necessary drainage systems, however, particularly with respect to underground water flow, it is impossible to foresee all drainage problems that may result from the construction of the highway. It is the responsibility of the Project Engineer to evaluate the sufficiency of the provided drainage systems and to initiate action for changes or additions where necessary. The Project Engineer should carefully review all provisions of the applicable environmental documentation, right of way agreements, and other commitments made by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) which have direct bearing on the project. Many of these commitments involve drainage matters. Although such elements should have been incorporated into the design, in some cases, they have been overlooked or require revision. Such a lack of oversight which directly affects adjacent property or individuals is sure to trigger an immediate negative response reflecting on WSDOT integrity. The Project Engineer should go over the project, particularly during severe storms, closely observing the quantity and action of the storm water runoff to determine the sufficiency of openings and ditches or the need for larger openings and ditches than those contemplated, reporting the results of this observation to the Regional Office. Any changes made in the size of drainage openings must be approved by the Regional Office before the Contractor is advised of the change. Tables showing the allowable heights of embankments over the various types of pipes are in the Hydraulics Manual. Quite often, upon locating culverts to fit the drainage conditions, the height of embankment is more than was anticipated during the location work. After the culverts are staked, a check should be made to see that the allowable embankment height for the particular type of pipe is not exceeded. It is also important to check that minimum cover requirements, during all stages of a project are also satisfied. Pipe arches shall not be constructed until the site has been investigated by the Regional Materials Engineer and the materials and methods for the construction have been approved by the Regional Materials Engineer.

Roadway Surface Drainage Curb and gutter systems must be constructed in such a manner that water will not pond on the roadway or flow at random over fill slopes. Manholes, catch basins, and spillways should be checked for location, size, and number to ensure efficient removal of collected water. Controlled drainage should be carried to a point beyond the roadway to where damage to the roadway cannot occur. Water pockets are very apt to be formed in superelevation transitions and roadway width transitions, especially where the roadway grade line is quite flat. It is necessary that the Project Engineer investigate these areas to be sure that proper drainage is installed. In placing the grates for catch basins and gutter inlets, it is imperative that they are placed at the proper elevation. If they are placed too low, they constitute a traffic hazard and if they are placed too high, they will not intercept the water. In keeping with design safety requirements, many culvert entrance structures utilize catch basins or grate inlet facilities. Such installations are particularly susceptible to deciduous debris and roadside trash. Grate opening size allowing passage of such debris is very critical in rural and mountainous locations. Surface ditches may be necessary above cut slopes to prevent water from flowing over the cut face. Roadside ditches at the ends of cut sections should be diverted well away from the adjacent embankment to avoid erosion of the fill material.
GEN 7-02.3
Design of Culverts Present standard design practice permits the Contractor to select the type of culvert and drain pipe to be installed except in those instances where a specific type is called for in the plans. Approved types are detailed in the contract plans and specifications. When changes or additions are determined necessary by the Project Engineer, consideration must be given to the type of pipe being furnished to the project. Specific types should be required only when engineering considerations substantiate that preference should be given to one type or another. Corrugated metal pipe arches fill a need where headroom above the invert is restricted and where more capacity and wider clearance for discharge of debris is required than would be afforded by a multiple pipe installation. Due to the method of forming the pipe arches, it is usually more difficult to obtain a well-fitting joint. The construction of the joints must receive careful attention when the installation is in material susceptible to erosion.
SS 7-02.3(1) Placing Culvert Pipe - General The ability of the culvert to withstand the height of cover as shown in the tables is based on the culvert being constructed in accordance with the Standard Specifications and the Standard Plans. All phases of culvert installation should receive thorough attention and inspection to achieve that end.

Grade and Flow Line Unless shown otherwise in the plans, the flow line grade of a culvert should match the stream channel which it replaces. Where the flow line grade of a culvert is relatively steep, debris and sediments tend to pass more easily through the culvert, but increased abrasion in the invert and increased erosion potential at the outlet can be expected. Where the flow line grade is relatively flat, sediment deposition within the culvert can become a problem. This is especially true with culverts that are placed on a flatter grade than the existing stream channel. When necessary to construct an inlet channel to the culvert, the channel shall provide a smooth transition into the culvert without constricting the flow. The destruction of vegetation, and rip rap resulting from the modification of culverts will lead to an increase in erosion around the culvert. The outlet side of the culvert is particularly susceptible to increased damage, even under normal flow. If you disturb or change either the culvert inlets or outlets during construction, consideration needs to be given to providing protection. This protection should extend upstream or downstream as needed. At the completion of the work all culvert inlets, outlets, and the channels leading to and from them shall present a neat and workmanlike appearance. At the completion of the contract, they shall be open and ready for operation. Foundation Care must be taken to ensure that the ground upon which pipes are to be laid has sufficient stability to support the pipe without excessive or nonuniform settlement. Where the underlying soil is soft or spongy, or subject to excessive consolidation under load, adequate support shall be obtained by excavating and removing the unstable soil and replacing it with satisfactory (usually granular) material, provided this procedure is feasible. In some cases, installation of the pipe should also be laid with a slight camber to overcome anticipated settlement. Where the unstable foundation soil is of such depth that the above procedure is not practical, other means must be used. This may involve the use of partial backfill of granular material to spread the load, placement of a timber or brush mat, the construction of a pile and timber cradle, or other such means. Before selecting a method, the Regional Materials Engineer should be consulted. Uniformity of support is essential to successful installations. Where transition is made from foundation soils that may consolidate to firm, unyielding ground, special consideration should be given to the transition zone. The Regional Materials Engineer should be consulted. Bedding Where pipe is laid on existing ground, care must be taken to ensure full, uniform support along the barrel of the pipe. Hand shaping and checking with a template may be necessary. When placing concrete pipe with bell-type joints, depressions must be constructed to receive the bell so that full barrel support is achieved. Isolated stones or boulders which may cause point bearing must be removed.

Chapter 7
When granular bedding material is used (as is usually the case in trench construction or where rock soils exist), workers sometimes become careless on the assumption that the bedding material will in itself ensure adequate support. Inspection should ensure that proper depth is used and that the pipe is seated in the bedding material to provide full, uniform barrel support. Care must be exercised in placing pipe in rock fills or where solid rock, hardpan, or cemented gravel is encountered. Pipe installed on these hard materials must be bedded on a cushion of suitable earth, fine gravel, or sand at least 6 in in depth to eliminate concentrated points of loading. Gravel having sizes larger than 1 in should not be used for bedding material. The importance of good quality material and good installation practices cannot be overstressed. The load supporting capacity of the pipe is directly affected by the quality of the bedding. When suitable material is not readily available on the project for bedding the pipe, Gravel Backfill for Pipe Zone Bedding should be used. Normally, this material is to be used only from 6 in below the pipe to the limits shown on the Standard Plans. In areas of rock embankment, where there is only fragmentary rock material available on the jobsite to backfill the pipe installation, gravel backfill for pipe zone bedding should be used for the backfill within 12 in of the sides and top of the pipe. If it is necessary to remove the material under the pipe excavation zone to produce a firm foundation, this void should be backfilled with Gravel Backfill for Foundations which is more stable than Gravel Backfill for Pipe Zone Bedding. If the Engineer deems it desirable or necessary to construct part of the embankment prior to construction of the culvert, the embankment shall be constructed at least 5 diameters of the culvert each side of the installation and compacted to 95 percent of the maximum density of the material. The embankment shall be constructed to a minimum height above the pipe invert elevation of at least one half the diameter of the pipe, more if equipment is to be routed over the pipe installation. No tractors or other heavy equipment shall be operated over the top of the pipe until the backfill has reached a height of 2 ft above the top of the pipe. If the Contractor elects to construct the embankment to final grade, shoring will be required for embankments more than 4 ft in height above the bottom of the trench. The upper limit for measurement of structure excavation is a maximum of 4 ft above the invert of the pipe as specified in Standard Specifications Section 2-09.4. Concrete pipe must be laid with the bell or groove end up grade. Metal pipe with riveted or resistance spot welded seams must be laid with the outside laps of circumferential joints pointing up grade and with the longitudinal laps positioned other than in the invert. It is important that concrete pipe with elliptical reinforcement, fabricated to form an elliptical section, be installed with the “top” or “bottom” position as marked on the pipe exactly on the vertical axis. There are special cases, such as on side-hill installations, where the imposed load will be at some angle other than vertical. In these cases, the pipe should be tilted to meet the direction of load. Theoretically, a small departure from the correct position does not greatly affect the supporting strength of the pipe, as the
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.38 
Page 7-5
Chapter 7
Drainage Structures, Storm Sewers, Sanitary Sewers, Water Mains, and Conduits
reinforcement cages may not be shaped to true ellipses, or they may not remain in the true shape during placing of the concrete. Practically, the steel may be in such a position that a large percentage of its effectiveness is lost a short distance away from the vertical axis. Elliptically reinforced concrete pipe is manufactured with lift holes in the top of the pipe or is clearly marked to simplify true positioning. Many culvert pipe failures have resulted because of carelessness in installation with respect to position of the vertical axis. Backfill The load supporting strength of any pipe is directly affected by the condition of the material around and above the pipe as well as the bedding material under the pipe. In general, the higher the degree of compaction of the fill or backfill under the haunches and along the sides of the pipe, the less the pipe will deform under load. Also, the higher the compaction, the less the material along side the pipe will consolidate. Consolidation can result in an increased transfer of embankment load onto the pipe. For these reasons, the backfill or embankment material adjacent to the pipe should be selected material free from large rocks and lumps, containing sufficient fines so that it will compact to a relatively impervious mass and it must be compacted to a density and width not less than that required by the Standard Specifications or Standard Plans. Care must be taken to obtain proper compaction under the haunches of the pipe and to place and compact the backfill uniformly on both sides of the culvert. Firm support must be obtained. Caution shall be used to avoid over-tamping to the extent that the pipe is lifted out of position. Many failures of culvert pipe in the past could have been avoided by proper backfilling. No type of pipe can withstand heavy embankment loads unless the backfilling is performed in strict accordance with the Standard Plans for Pipe Zone Bedding and Backfill and the Standard Specifications. Placement of Fill Over Culverts The load that will be imposed on a culvert pipe is affected largely by the manner in which the embankment around and above the culvert is constructed. The maximum height of fill allowable over various sizes and types of pipe and pipe arch culvert is dependent upon backfilling and constructing the embankment over the culvert in strict compliance with the Standard Plans and the Standard Specifications. Careful attention shall be given to constructing pipe installations in accordance with the appropriate standard except as modified by special provisions. Equipment shall not be permitted to operate across the culvert until the embankment has been constructed 2 ft above the culvert. The operation of equipment over the culvert installation shall be in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-07.7. Mitered ends of metal and thermoplastic culverts may require some type of weighted protection to keep the end of the culvert from floating due to hydrostatic pressure. Usually concrete headwalls are specified for this purpose. Concrete headwalls must be constructed as soon as the embankment is constructed to the height of the headwall so the mitered ends of the culvert will be protected when the first storm is encountered.

Payment There is no specific payment for any bedding or backfill material placed in the pipe zone, as covered in Standard Specifications Sections 7-08.4 and 7-08.5 unless the proposal specifically includes an item for bedding materials. When bedding materials are included in the quantities, they are measured and paid by the cubic yard. If there is no item for bedding materials, all costs associated with furnishing and installing the bedding and backfill material within the pipe zone are included in the unit contract price for the pipe. It should be noted that if the Contractor constructs pipe in excess of the length designated by the Engineer, the excess length will not be measured or paid for. It is quite often undesirable to have culvert pipe constructed in excess of the necessary length from both hydraulic and aesthetic considerations thus the Engineer should have the excess removed at the contractor’s expense when this occurs.

GEN 7-04.1
General Instructions Most of the instructions for the construction of culverts covered in Section 7-02 are equally applicable to the construction of storm sewers. The grade line that storm sewers are constructed on is rather critical since the capacity of the pipe is dependent on its flow line grade. The storm sewer system has been designed to carry the anticipated flow if it is constructed on the grade lines shown in the plans. It is quite important that the effect on the capacity of the pipe be checked whenever it becomes necessary to vary the flow line grade to avoid obstacles that may be encountered on construction. Careful attention must be paid to the construction of the joints or the storm sewer line may not meet the tests that may be required in the contract.

Erosion Control and Water Pollution Control
GEN 8-01.1
Introduction Federal, State, and local water quality regulations prohibit sediment and other pollutants associated with construction activity from impacting air and water quality. The requirements in this section exist to comply with these laws and the required Permits, and to prevent impacts to water quality. However, the scope and complexity of each project will affect what each project needs to do to manage these aspects of construction. This section is predominantly written from the Transfer of Coverage (TOC) perspective because it is WSDOT’s standard practice for Design-Bid-Build (DBB) projects to transfer Construction Storrmwater General Permit (CSWGP) coverage to the Contractor the day after Contract execution. The TOC process helps ensure Contractors are invested in the Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control (TESC) planning, implementation and CSWGP compliance. In some cases, it may not be appropriate to transfer Permit coverage (e.g., Contracts with long winter shutdown or with multiple overlapping phases). Procedures vary for non-transfer DBB projects and Design-Build (DB) projects in which the Contractor obtains CSWGP coverage (see TESC Section 4-1.6.11 for more information). TOC is addressed in Division 8-01 of WSDOT’s Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction (Standard Specifications), and additional TOC guidance is referenced in the TESC Manual and available on the Erosion Control Policies & Procedures webpage. Once WSDOT transfers Permit coverage, the Contractor becomes responsible for all Permit requirements and WSDOT’s role becomes that of compliance assurance through Contract enforcement. Inspection of erosion control work is a specialized task and it is important that the Project Engineer allocate adequate Inspector resources and provide proper training for enforcement of the Contract Work. Internal training expectations can be found in TESC Section 1-1.2, and in 8-01.3.1.A of this chapter. A detailed list of inspection expectations can be found in TESC Section 4-1. It is important for the Project Office to communicate early and often with regulatory agencies and other stakeholders. Establishing open communication early, prior to construction, sets up a good working relationship that may prove invaluable later in case problems occur during construction. Permits often require notification to regulatory agencies prior to conducting construction activities. The Project Engineer should consider inviting representatives from regulatory agencies to participate in the preconstruction conference to discuss environmental concerns. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Construction Stormwater General Permit (CSWGP) is one of the most common permits on our Contracts. While many of the requirements in this section exist to comply with CSWGP conditions, even if a Contract does not have a CSWGP, the Contractor is required to comply.

Contracts not required to obtain Permit coverage must comply with all Federal, State, Tribal, or local laws, ordinances, and regulations that affect work in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-07.1. Washington State laws and regulations as codified in the Washington Administrative Code (WAC) and the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) provide specific requirements related to the protection of waters of the state (Chapter 173-201A WAC, Chapter 173-200, and Chapter 90.48 RCW). This section of the Construction Manual does not replace the Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control (TESC) Manual. Inspectors that are tasked with TESC inspection should reference the TESC manual for in-depth guidance.

Definitions Best Management Practice (BMP) – means physical, structural, and/or managerial practices that, when used singularly or in combination, prevent or reduce pollutant discharges. BMPs typically fall into three categories: design, structural, and procedural. Design BMP – procedures or practices that minimize the erosion-related risk of a project, either during or after construction. Examples include projects that minimize the gradient and continuous lengths of temporary grade slopes or projects that phase work or save existing vegetation to minimize risk. Structural BMP – devices that are installed in the field during construction. They may be designed to control erosion (source control) or sedimentation (treatment). Procedural BMP – procedures or practices that minimize the erosion-related risk of a project, either during or after construction. For example, weekly site inspections and discharge sampling are important procedural BMPs that must be used to determine if site BMPs are functioning as needed or if they need to be maintained or enhanced.

Erosion and Water Pollution Control Process
SS 8-01.3(1)A TESC and SPCC Plans The TESC Plan and the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan are used to manage erosion and spill-related risks during construction. Together, the TESC and SPCC plans are designed to meet the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) requirements of the CSWGP, and ensure smaller Contracts that do not trigger the CSWGP do not violate water quality standards. Projects Covered by a CSWGP The Contractor is required to either adopt and modify the TESC Plan provided by WSDOT, or develop their own TESC Plan in accordance with the Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Manual (TESCM) – The Contractor’s TESC plan must be submitted as a Type 2 Working Drawing for review and comment in accordance with the Contract. The TESC Plan review checklist is available on the Erosion Control Policies and Procedures website and will be used by the Project Engineer when reviewing the TESC Plan. Projects Not Covered by a CSWGP WSDOT requires an abbreviated TESC plan for Contracts that disturb soil and have the potential to discharge waters of the state, but do not trigger CSWGP coverage. While Contract plan sheets are not required with an abbreviated TESC plan, they may help ensure the Contractor understands where BMP placement is needed to protect Waters of the State. The Contractor is required to take measures to minimize discharges and prevent discharges wherever feasible. If discharges cannot be prevented, ensure they are managed to prevent impacts to Waters of the State and conduct monitoring. If evidence suggests a compliance issue (e.g. a turbidity plume, oil sheen) in the receiving water, the Contractor must initiate the Environmental Compliance Assurance Procedure (ECAP).

Qualified Personnel Once the TESC Plan is ready for implementation, qualified personnel must be assigned to install, maintain, inspect, and test the system. The ESC Lead, Project Engineer, and Inspectors play crucial roles in the implementation of the plan and therefore must have the proper training and qualifications. Typically, the roles and responsibilities for erosion and sediment control are as follows: ESC Lead Responsibilities:
• attend the Pre-Construction Conference
• implement the TESC Plan including the installation and adaptive management of all BMPs
• maintenance of all BMPs
• develop and maintain a tracking table to show identified TESC compliance issues are fully resolved within 10 calendar days
• update the TESC Plan to reflect current field conditions
• sample and report water quality, as required
• develop and maintain the Site Log Book, as required
• perform and document site inspections of TESC BMPs
• be the primary point of contact on the Contractor’s Emergency Contact List for TESCrelated issues Training and Certification: The ESC Lead must have a current Certificate of Training in Construction Site Erosion and Sediment Control (CESCL) from a course approved by the Department of Ecology. Project Engineer Responsibilities:
• overall responsibility for enforcing the Contract
• delegate authority as appropriate
• ensure site inspections are occurring
• verify non-compliance events are escalated and reported
• ensure TESC Plans are maintained to reflect current field conditions
• confirm reporting and documentation requirements are met
• understand specific site requirements, including all Permits issued by regulatory agencies If the Contractor fails to comply with the Contract requirements the Project Engineer may impose a suspension of work in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-08.6. The Project Engineer should also use the Prime Contractor Performance Report to encourage good behavior and reward excellent environmental compliance. Page 8-4

Project Inspectors Responsibilities:
• ensure BMPs are installed correctly
• verify DMR reporting is occurring monthly as required, and perform discharge compliance verification sampling if accuracy of data is in question
• verify the TESC Plan is reflective of current site conditions
• verify BMP maintenance and adaptive management
• communicate and work with the ESC Lead regarding deficiencies, or other matters as necessary
• escalate known deficiencies within Project Office structure Training and Certification: The WSDOT Construction Site Erosion and Sediment Control Class offered through HQ Erosion Control Program is required every three years for Inspectors involved with the design, implementation, or verification inspection of TESC BMPs. Implementation of the Plans The Contractor must meet AKART (All Known, Available, and Reasonable methods of Prevention, Control and Treatment) as defined in WAC 173-218-030 prior to discharging from the construction site. To meet the AKART requirement the ESC Lead must select, install, maintain, and adaptively manage BMPs as required to ensure continued functional performance throughout construction. The ESC Lead documents this work in the TESC Plan. Inspecting BMP installation is necessary to ensure proper methods and materials are used. Improperly installed BMPs will not be effective and can contribute to an erosion or non-compliance event. Some temporary products have materials requirements outlined in Standard Specifications Section 9-14. If a Contractor wants to exceed the maximum acreage exposure limits allowed by Standard Specifications Section 8-01, they must request approval from the Project Engineer. If the Project Engineer grants the Contractor’s request to exceed these limits, the Contractor must provide to the Project Engineer revised TESC and SPCC plans, commensurate with the scope and risk of the variance proposed, stating what measures will be used to protect the project site from erosion damage, how water quality and sensitive areas will be protected, and include the schedule of methods employed to regain adherence to Standard Specifications Section 8-01. The CSWGP prohibits the Project Engineer from increasing the time periods required in Standard Specifications Section 8-01 for covering erodible soil that is not being worked.

Adaptive Management and Feedback/Maintenance The ESC Lead and Inspectors must inspect the area surrounding the installed BMPs to ensure they are installed and functioning properly, looking for signs of erosion, turbid water, or sheen. When BMP adaptive management is necessary, the ESC Lead must update a tracking table to show that identified TESC compliance issues are fully resolved within 10 calendar days after the issue was identified. The on-site TESC plan and SPCC plan must be updated with any changes including changes to BMP types and locations and changes to discharge points. These changes can be made by hand or electronically, as long as it can be accessed on-site. In all cases, the ESC Lead must document what adaptive management was done and include a completion date. If effective adaptive management is not feasible within 10 calendar days, Department of Ecology may approve additional time if the ESC Lead requests an extension within the initial 10 day timeframe. As construction progresses, modifications of BMPs and the TESC Plan are necessary and required by the CSWGP to address changing site conditions. There are three common triggers to indicate when ESC Leads need to make these changes: 1. Visual monitoring or site inspection findings indicate BMPs are not performing as required. Under no circumstances should concentrated flow be allowed to develop. This type of flow can cause significant damage to the site as well as water pollution. 2. A change in work activity, site conditions, schedule, or design that impact erosion related risk(s). 3. A discharge sample over 25 NTU SS 8-01.3(1)C
Water Management
Several different permits can require water quality monitoring whether work is being done in the water or on land. Sampling frequency and location, compliance triggers, planning and reporting requirements vary depending on the type of Permit or certification issued. For projects with a CSWGP: The two most common measurements for pollutants are turbidity and pH: 1. Turbidity measures the clarity of water in nephelometric turbidity units (NTUs), most commonly using a turbidometer. The CSWGP establishes monitoring benchmarks between 25 to 250 NTU. 2. Water impacted by pH modifying sources must be characterized and, if authorized, must be neutralized prior to discharge to ensure it is within the range 6.5 to 8.5. Projects that involve in-water work may be issued a Hydraulic Project Approval (HPA), a Letter of Verification (LOV), or a 401 Individual Water Quality Certification. Compliance for in-water work is evaluated differently than work covered by a CSWGP. In-water sampling (e.g., upstream and downstream) is different than discharge sampling for a CSWGP.

The Permittee is required by law to report any water quality exceedance or Permit violation to the Department of Ecology. WSDOT has developed an internal ECAP, outlined in SS 1-07.5 of the Construction Manual that must be implemented immediately by the individual discovering the potential non-compliance event. Documentation/Compliance/Reporting Monthly reporting requirements begin as soon as the CSWGP is issued by Department of Ecology, even if construction has not yet started or a discharge has not occurred. Project Office staff are required to submit monthly Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs) until the CSWGP is transferred to the Contractor. When WSDOT remains the Permittee, the Project Office is responsible for all Permit requirements including discharge sampling and the monthly DMR submittal to Department of Ecology’s WebDMR system. The Contractor will identify an ESC Lead to perform the Permit required site inspections. Once ground disturbing construction begins, weekly site inspections and discharge sampling become required. Site inspections are required at a minimum weekly and within 24 hours of a runoff event. Inspection and discharge sampling of temporarily stabilized, inactive sites may be reduced to once every calendar month with Project Engineer approval. The Project Engineer should consider the risks associated with less frequent inspections before approving reduction of inspections, including BMP failures, erosion potential, and seasonal factors. Discharge monitoring must occur weekly and be scheduled around the weather, using a calibrated turbidometer (refer to TESC 4-1.3 for more details). Testing equipment must be onsite at all times, and must be calibrated per the manufacturer instructions. An updated calibration log must be maintained and stored with the equipment. The Inspector needs to be aware of benchmarks and when they are exceeded. The Contractor is required to document, adaptively manage, and report (if necessary) when this happens. Documentation The Site Log Book information may be kept electronically by the Permitee, but must be accessible on-site and must contain the following:
• Permit coverage issuance letter or completed Transfer of Coverage (TOC) form
• Updated TESC plan, SPCC plan, other related plans (e.g., chemical treatment plan)
• Discharge sampling data
• Site inspection reports
• Documentation of BMP adaptive management
• Contact information for onsite ESC Lead who perfom site inspections
• Other Permit related documents or approvals (e.g., sanitary sewer Permit, Administrative Order, approval for use of chemical treatment) The Inspector should be checking the Site Log Book periodically to ensure it is kept up to date. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.38

Environmental Compliance Assurance Procedure (ECAP) & Environmental Report Tracking System (ERTS) Transparency with regulatory agencies when non-compliance occurs builds trust and sends a message that good faith efforts are made. ESC Leads or other on site personnel must notify the Project Engineer immediately upon discovery of a water quality standard exceedance or other situation that may lead to a violation of the CSWGP by initiating ECAP. All effort will be made to cease the exceedance or rectify the non-compliance event before any work in or around the area resumes. The ECAP is an internal procedure designed to escalate potential non-compliance issues. This may need to include notification of regulatory agencies, organization of cleanup activities, or further enforcement of the Contract up to or including suspension of part or all of the Work causing the non-compliance. WSDOT staff who observe a potential non-compliance event must submit specific information to their supervisor after the initial notification has been made. Refer to the procedure contained in SS 1-07.5 for more information on ECAP. Initiating ECAP ensures that the non-compliance events are identified and fully addressed including preventing it from recurring. The Project Engineer and Regional Environmental Manager (REM) will work together on an appropriate response to the notification trigger. Minor non-compliance events that do not pose a threat to human health or the environment may be addressed and reconciled at the project level. When the Permit has been transferred and the ECAP process is triggered, the Contractor shall fill out the ECAP Form (WSDOT form #422-011) and provide it to the Project Engineer within 48 hours of the non-compliance event. In contrast to ECAP, Environmental Report Tracking System (ERTS) is a reporting system required by the CSWGP. While it is meant to escalate significant or severe noncompliance events similar to ECAP, ERTS is the notification system of the Department of Ecology. ERTS reports must be completed by the Permittee within 24 hours of a discharge of 250 NTUs or more or if non-compliance with WQS is confirmed. Department of Ecology must also be notified of events that pose a threat to human health or the environment. ECAP is initiated prior to submission of a report in ERTS. An ECAP report will usually have the same information required by ERTS.

SS 8-01.3G Completion/Close-out/Restoration The CSWGP makes an important distinction between temporary and final stabilization. Termination of the Permit cannot occur until the project has reached final stabilization and the Contract work is physically complete. For final stabilization, all temporary BMPs must be removed unless approved by the Project Engineer to remain, and all exposed soil areas must be fully stabilized with permanent BMPs such as vegetation, rock, or equivalent permanent stabilization measures. Care must be taken to minimize soil disturbance upon removing temporary BMPs. Non-biodegradable BMPs must also be removed and soil must be permanently stabilize prior to submitting the Notice of Termination form. All Permit requirements must be performed until the CSWGP has been terminated. Some projects may choose to leave sediment control BMPs such as silt fence in place until permanent vegetation has established, even if the duration extends beyond Contract completion. However, if the silt fence is left in place, the Permit cannot be terminated and all of the CSWGP requirements still apply, including the monthly reporting requirements. The Project Engineer may elect to coordinate with WSDOT Maintenance forces to arrange for silt fence or other BMP removal occurring after the Contract is completed. Once Physical Completion has been granted the Contractor is required to submit a Notice of Termination (NOT) to the Project Engineer for review prior to submitting to Department of Ecology. Project Office staff must walk the site to ensure the NOT requirements have been met prior to NOT submittal. Once the Project Engineer confirms the requirements have been met, the Contractor must submit the NOT to Department of Ecology. If requirements have not been met, the NOT cannot be submitted to Department of Ecology. Prematurely submitting the NOT is a Permit violation. If the site has not achieved final stabilization, yet all other Contract work is complete, and the project is “waiting for grass to grow”, the Contractor may request to transfer the CSWGP back to WSDOT. If the CSWGP is transferred back to WSDOT (at the Project Engineers discretion), the Project Office becomes fully responsible for CSWGP compliance including site inspections, discharge sampling, and reporting until the CSWGP is terminated. To terminate the CSWGP after it is transferred back to WSDOT, the Project Office must submit the NOT to Department of Ecology. Once a NOT is submitted, Department of Ecology may request a site visit or notify the Permittee that the termination request is denied. If no contact is made by Department of Ecology, the Permit is considered terminated the 31st calendar day after the date Department of Ecology received the NOT form. Once the CSWGP is terminated, it should be “inactive” in Department of Ecology’s PARIS database. The Project Engineer should check the status of the Permit in PARIS to make sure it is “inactive”. If the Permit status is active in PARIS, monthly DMR requirements will continue to generate in WebDMR and the Permittee (WSDOT or the Contractor) may need to follow-up with the Department of Ecology Permit administrator to ensure the terminated Permits have been inactivated in PARIS.

Temporary Seeding
Temporary seeding is the establishment of a temporary vegetative cover on disturbed areas by seeding with an annual herbaceous plant (i.e. cover crop such as sterile wheat) which is quick to germinate than other species used for permanent establishment. Temporary seeding can stabilize disturbed areas that will be inactive for an extended period. SS 8-01.3(2)D
Temporary Mulching
Temporary mulching is a method of soil cover for temporary erosion prevention and control. It is also used to improve the soil environment for establishing vegetation. Organic mulches such as straw, wood fiber, chips, compost and bark are most effective for these purposes. Both organic and synthetic tackifiers can be added to bind the mulch, seed, and fertilizer to the disturbed soil surface until vegetation is established. These tackifiers can reduce the displacement of soil particles, seeds, and mulch caused by wind or rainfall. SS 8-01.3(3) Biodegradable Erosion Control Blanket A In order to control the possible erosion resulting from fast runoff on steep slopes, biodegradable erosion control blankets are often used. Blankets also get used on flatter slopes where erodible soils are encountered. Using biodegradable erosion control blankets can provide a quick temporary protection until the grass has grown enough to be permanent protection for the soil, but the blanket cannot be expected to hold up to concentrated flows, so top of slope protections should be made to prevent such flows from developing and hitting the slope. Ditching, drains or dispersion BMPs such as compost socks should control drainage from above or beyond the raw slope. Every effort should be made to ensure that this kind of runoff is diverted away from the slope. In some cases, as determined by geotechnical analysis, permanent erosion control blankets or turf reinforcement mats (non-biodegradable) may be needed to stabilize a slope. Emergency Projects Department of Ecology uses the Federal expectations as outlined in the EPA’s Construction General Permit for emergency-related projects. Emergency projects require immediate authorization to avoid imminent endangerment to human health or the environment, public safety, or to reestablish public services. Such projects are authorized to discharge immediately on the condition that a complete and accurate NOI is submitted within 30 calendar days after commencing earth-disturbing activities. Department of Ecology’s Regional Permit Administrators should be contacted as soon as possible as their project specific expectations may vary. WSDOT’s emergency projects should operate as if covered under a CSWGP, including collecting discharge samples as soon as earthdisturbing work begins (document sample data onsite until a Permit is issued and data can be reported in WebDMR). While no TESC plan is required for emergency projects, these projects shall use the other site log book documentation requirements (e.g. record of implementation of Permit requirements such as the site inspections and adaptive management of BMPs) to meet the pollution prevention intent of a TESC plan.

Roadside Restoration
GEN 8-02.1
General The Roadside Policy Manual sets forth the following policy: The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) recognizes roadsides as an asset. WSDOT manages roadsides, balancing operational and environmental functions and lowest life cycle costs consistent with a reliable, safe, and sustainable transportation system. Roadsides are an important component of highway planning, design, operation, and maintenance because of the operational and environmental benefits the roadside provides. In reality, these functional benefits are interrelated and inseparable, and they affect the appearance of the roadside. Properly designed and maintained vegetation complements the functions of the roadway, integrates the roadway into the surrounding landscape, and has a positive effect on the traveling public. Roadside restoration is the process of replacing or rehabilitating functions lost through construction or other roadside disturbances. According to RCW 47.40.010, the “planting and cultivating of any shrubs, trees, hedges or other domestic or native ornamental growth, the improvement of roadside facilities and view points, and the correction of unsightly conditions, upon the right-of-way of any state highway is hereby declared to be a proper state highway purpose.” Proper implementation of this section is key in insuring the roadside features and functions are properly restored and continue to fulfill their intended purpose after the project is completed. It is understood that roadside restoration is often one of the last activities and it is for that reason that it is so important that inspections are timely and thorough. This section is written to provide a unified source of information for project personnel engaged in construction phase roadside restoration activities. When questions of adequacy of roadside restoration materials and procedures are encountered, or when differences of opinion concerning the acceptance or rejection of materials occur and the answers are not readily found in this section, the Region Landscape Architect or HQ Landscape Architect should be consulted for assistance. In cases where insect damage and diseases are suspected, the services of an entomologist or plant pathologist may be required. Ongoing coordination is needed between the Project Engineer, Inspectors, and Landscape Architects to assist in the successful completion of the project and a successful hand-off to Maintenance at the end of plant establishment.

Landscape Terminology Acid Soil/Alkaline Soil – The acidity or alkalinity of a soil is measured in terms of its pH. Various plants respond differently to pH variations. Generally, the soil west of the Cascades is acidic, while east of the Cascades is more basic. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A pH measurement of 7 indicates a neutral soil; a pH measurement below 7 indicates an acidic soil; and a pH measurement above 7 indicates an alkaline soil or basic soil. Generally, plants are selected for a particular area based on their ability to survive without a need to change the pH of the soil. Balled and Burlapped (B&B) – Plants are prepared for transplanting by digging them so that the soil immediately around the larger, central roots remains undisturbed. The ball of earth and root is then bound in burlap or similar mesh fabrics. An acceptable B&B root ball should contain 90 percent (visual estimate of volume) of the earth material held together with root system when removed from the burlap. The soil must remain moist, but not fully saturated, before planting. Bare Root (BR) – Most deciduous plants are dug when dormant. The roots are cleaned, pruned, and usually stored in moist material. Roots must remain moist and not allowed to dry out. Botanical Name – The botanical, or scientific name is the plant name, written in Latin, which is used universally. The common name is the name used in a local area, and is not necessarily the same name used in other areas. The correct botanical name is usually found in “Standardized Plant Names” and is available from the Landscape Architect. The botanical name usually consists of two names, Genus and Species, but may include additional names. Genus: Species: Variety: Example: Genus: Species: Variety:
1st word 2nd word 3rd word (if appropriate) Sambucus racemosa melanocarpa Sambucus Racemosa Melanocarpa
Branch – An offshoot from a trunk or main stem. It could be also called a bough or a portion of a main stem. Bud – A small protuberance on a stem, branch, or cutting containing an undeveloped shoot, leaves or flowers. Caliper – The diameter of the trunk of a deciduous tree is measured 6 inch above ground level, up to 4 inch caliper size. If greater caliper than 4 inch, it is measured at 4.5 feet above ground level. The measurement at 4.5 feet is commonly referred to as diameter at breast height (dbh).

Cambium – A thin layer of generative tissue lying between the bark and the wood of a stem, most active in woody plants. The cambium produces new layers of phloem on the outside and of xylem (wood) on the inside, thus increasing the diameter of the stem. Healthy cambium is green in color. Cane – A primary stem which starts from the ground of a shrub or at a point not higher than ¼ the height of the plant. A cane generally only refers to growth on particular plant material, such as roses, etc. Clumps – Plants with at least double the number of canes required for standard material; trees with three or more main stems starting from the ground. Vine maples are sometimes sold by the clump. Collected Material – Trees, shrubs, or other plant material collected from native stands, including Christmas tree stock and plants from native stands or forest plantings. After one growing season at the nursery, they are no longer considered collected material. Compost – Stable, mature, decomposed organic solid waste that is the result of the accelerated aerobic biodegradation and stabilization under controlled conditions. The result has a uniform, dark, soil like appearance that smells like rich earth. Any ammonia smell indicates the compost is immature and a Solvita test should be run on the material. Container Grown – Plants grown and delivered to the job site in plastic pots or other containers. Container grown plant should not be allowed to dry out while in the container. Usually, plants grown in containers are in a very free draining soil mixture made up of nutrient free components. Container grown plants have a tendency to dry out and decline in vigor when not under the care of the nursery. Container grown material should have a firm root ball which will hold 90 percent (visual estimate of volume) of the ball material when removed from the container. Good container grown materials will hold virtually all of the soil in the root zone when a good growing medium is used. Some root growth should be visible in the outer edges of the ball. Excessive roots at the bottom of the ball indicate lack of proper root pruning. Excessive roots at the side or bottom of the container could indicate a root bound condition. Cuttings – Cuttings are detached leaf buds or portions of branches which under favorable circumstances are capable of producing roots when placed in a growing medium. Common species used as cuttings are willow, cottonwood, and red osier dogwood. DBH – Diameter at breast height. This is a standard measurement of a standing tree trunk and is measured at a height of 4.5 feet.

Miscellaneous Construction
Fertilizer – Any natural or artificial material added to the soil or directly to the leaves to supply one or more plant nutrients. Generally, a complete fertilizer refers to a fertilizer that contains nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium (NPK). Occasionally, sulfur (S) is used, especially in alkaline soils to lower the pH. Indications on a container are usually numerical 10-8-6 or 20-10-5, etc. These numbers indicate the percentage of actual nutrient element available, i.e., 10 percent nitrogen, 8 percent phosphorous, and 6 percent potassium (108-6). Other minor nutrients are sometimes added to NPK such as magnesium, manganese, boron, iron, zinc, calcium, etc. Applying the wrong type of fertilizer can harm or kill plants. Consult with the Regional Landscape Architect or HQ Design Landscape Architect before applying fertilizers not specified in contract. In addition, approval by the State Construction Office may be required and approval by the Project Engineer and Regional Construction/Operations Engineer’s Office is required (see the Change Order Check list). Heeling In – A method of temporarily storing plants by covering roots with moist sawdust, mulch, soil, or a mixture of other materials capable of good moisture retention, to keep the roots from drying out. Herbicide – A herbicide is a pesticide chemically formulated to control or destroy weeds. Herbicides are broken down into two main groups: Postemergence Herbicide and Preemergence Herbicide. Postemergence herbicide is a plant killing material that acts on the active growing surface of a plant after the plant has emerged from the soil. It is usually most effective during the rapid growth of the plant. Preemergence herbicide is a plant killing herbicide which acts to prevent the seeds, bulbs, tubers, stolons, etc., from sprouting (before-emergence). Inoculated Seed – Seeds of the legume family that have been treated with nitrogen-fixing bacteria to enable them to make use of nitrogen from the soil atmosphere. Mulch – Mulch is any loose material placed over soil, usually to retain moisture, reduce or prevent weed growth, insulate soil, or improve the general appearance of the plant bed. Additional fertilizer is sometimes necessary in order to offset the loss of plant nutrients used by the microorganisms that break down the mulch, especially when using non-native stock. Mycorrhiza – A beneficial group of fibrous fungi that attach to the roots and absorb water and nutrients in solution and transfer this solution to the roots of plants. In effect, they multiply the plants’ root systems many times. These can be seen as fine white netting on moist compost or bark mulch. This is a good thing and not something to be concerned about. Node – A small protuberance on a stem, branch or cutting containing an undeveloped shoot, leaves or flowers.

Pesticide – A pesticide is any substance or mixture of substances intended to control insects, rodents, fungi, weeds, or other forms of plants or animal life that are considered to be pests. Root Ball – Ball of earth encompassing the roots of a plant. Generally, the root ball will have a good portion made up of root networks. A “manufactured-root ball” is one where the root system is not adequate to hold the soil in place. Manufactured root balls should not be accepted, since the root system is not developed sufficiently. Rootbound (Pot Bound) – The condition of a potted or container plant whose roots have become densely matted and most often encircle the outer edges of the container. Generally, this condition is a result of holding the plant in the container for too long a period. Root bound plants should be rejected. See Standard Specifications Section 9-14.6(2). Circling roots will eventually kill the plant. Root Collar (Plant Crown) – Root Collar is the line of junction between the root of the plant and its stem, also known as the plant crown. The plant needs to be planted so the root collar is at or within an inch above the soil surface. Runner – A long, slender, trailing stem that puts out roots along the ground. Where the nodes make contact with the ground, a new plant is produced. (For example: Kinnikinnick or wild strawberry.) Soil Bioengineering – Soil bioengineering combines the use of live plants or cuttings, dead plant material, and inert structural members to produce living, functioning land stabilization systems. Soil Amendment – A mixture of a growing medium, such as compost with the native top soil. Vigorous – Plants that demonstrate vigorous growth have bright green cambium, strong stems and healthy leaves with no indication of stress (discoloration of leaves, insect damage, or wilt). Plants growing in a vigorous condition also have a well formed and healthy full crown with plump, firm and moist roots that have light growing tips during the growing season. A vigorous stand of grass has a lush, rich-green appearance with no dead patches or major gaps of growth within the established area. A stand of grass that displays rusting, wilting, stunted growth, diseased grass, or browning and yellowing of leaves is not considered vigorous. Watering-in – Watering-in is a process used to settle the soil with water by eliminating air pockets during the planting process. This is also known as “puddling”.

SS 8-02.3(2) Work Plans SS 8-02.3(2)A Roadside Work Plan The Roadside Work Plan is a Type 2 Working Drawing that is required for all projects that disturb the roadside beyond 20 feet from the pavement or where trees or native vegetation will be removed. The Roadside Work Plan is intended to ensure that all impacts to the roadside vegetation and soils are minimized, preparatory activities are planned and coordinated with planting, and planting is coordinated with the removal of erosion control items. The Roadside Work Plan is required to be submitted prior to performing work that disturbs the earth. Project Engineers should forward questions on Roadside Work Plans to the Region Landscape Architect or the HQ Design Landscape Architect. The Contractor’s progress schedule should show the order in which the Contractor proposes to perform the roadside restoration work and it is expected that the Progress Schedule will be reviewed in conjunction with the Roadside Restoration Plan. The Roadside Work plan must indicate the proposed timing to perform the work and must include the following activities: Limiting Impacts to Roadsides The Plan should show the limits of Work including locations of staging or parking. In the case of staging and parking areas, these areas could become compacted and the Plan may need to address protection and/or decompaction. The Plan should also indicate areas outside the clearing limits where vegetation must be removed for access or other reasons such as stockpiling of topsoil. Preservation and stockpile of topsoil or other native materials is expected for areas outside the clearing limits.

Roadside Restoration The Plan must include a discussion of how and when the propagation and procurement of plants will occur. Contracts with large quantities of plants should show these activities in the Progress schedule. Delays have occurred due to unavailability of plants in the past. Means and methods to limit soil compaction where seeding and planting are to occur, such as steel plates, hog fuel access roads, wood mats for sensitive areas (including removal) and decompaction for unavoidable impacts. The Plan should indicate when erosion control items will be incorporated or removed. Lawn Installation The Plan should indicate the schedule for lawn installation work. It must also discuss the establishment and maintenance regimen for lawns. SS 8-02.3(2)B
Weed and Pest Control Plan
This plan is required when the proposal contains the item “Weed and Pest Control,” and prior to application of any chemicals or weed control activities, the Contractor shall submit a Type 2 Working Drawing. The Weed and Pest Control Plan is intended to ensure that only approved pesticides are applied by licensed applicators. Only those pesticides listed in the table Herbicides Approved for Use on WSDOT Rights of Way and approved as part of the Weed and Pest Control Plan may be used. Refer to the website for the list of approved herbicides: www.wsdot.wa.gov/maintenance/roadside/herbicide_use.htm. The Contractor may request written authorization from the Engineer to use herbicides that are not on the list. In that case it is recommended that the Project Engineer consult with the Region or HQ Landscape Architect prior to approving the request. The Plan also requires SDS sheets are submitted in order to fulfill hazard communication. The Plan must include provisions to ensure worker safety until re-entry time periods have elapsed. The Project Engineer should review the Working Drawing for completeness and consult with the Region or HQ Landscape Architect, as necessary. SS 8-02.3(2)C
Plant Establishment Plan
This Type 2 Working Drawing is required when the proposal contains the item “PSIPE__”, and must be completed prior to Initial Planting. The Plant Establishment Plan shall describe activities necessary to ensure continued health and vigor of planted and seeded areas in accordance with the requirements of Sections 8-02.3(12) and 8-02.3(13). Should the plan become unworkable at any time during the first-year plant establishment, the Contractor shall submit a revised plan prior to proceeding with further Work. The Plant Establishment Plan shall include: 1. Proposed scheduling of joint inspection meetings, activities, materials, equipment to be utilized for the first-year plant establishment. Section 8-02.3(13) requires the Contractor to meet monthly or at an agreed upon schedule with the Engineer for joint inspections. This plan should state when those inspections will occur. WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.38

2. Proposed adaptive management activities to ensure successful establishment of seeded, sodded, and planted areas. The plan should address when watering and fertilizer will be applied. 3. A contact person. This should be the person responsible for all plant establishment activities, including regular inspections and plant replacement. 4. Management of the irrigation system, when applicable. The plan should include provisions for regular inspection and winterization. SS 8-02.3(3) Weed and Pest Control Weed and Pest Control occurs in strategic areas and includes various methods. Product use, type and timing of application could affect target species control success. Improper weed and pest control application could damage desirable species to remain and cause inadvertent harm to people and the environment. The person applying the pesticides must be a licensed applicator and perform work according to Weed and Pest Control Plan. The licensed applicator is responsible to only apply according to the label to ensure the proper material is used on the specific target, and with an appropriate timing of application. The pesticide label will give instructions such as intended use of the product, directions for use, and warnings. Ensure all chemical pesticides are delivered to the job site in the original containers or if pre-mixed off-site, obtain certification of the components and formulation from the supplier. The licensed applicator or operator shall complete WSDOT Form 540-509, Commercial Pesticide Application Record, each day the pesticide is applied and furnish a copy to the Project Engineer by the following business day. The Project Engineer is to distribute a copy of this record daily to the Region Operations or Maintenance Engineer and to the Roadside Maintenance Section at the HQ Maintenance and Operations Office in Olympia. Only herbicides listed at the Roadside Vegetation Management website shall be used. Damage to adjacent areas, either on or off the Highway Right of Way, shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the Project Engineer or the property owner at no cost to the Contracting Agency. SS 8-02.3(4) Topsoil With increased focus on stormwater in Washington and new understanding of the role of soils in the mitigation of water quality and quantity, engineered soil and soil amendments have become an important stormwater Best Management Practice (BMP). Topsoil is a biologically active system of minerals, organic matter, air, water, and microorganisms that can take thousands of years to develop. Topsoil nourishes and provides structural support for plant roots and absorbs and cleans water. Most of our roadside projects strip away the desirable existing topsoil leaving behind a compacted layer unsuitable for plant growth. This requires the landscape architect to either amend existing soils or add suitable topsoil back on site.

Miscellaneous Construction
Chapter 8
Be aware that not all topsoils are created equal. SS 8-02.3(4) describes the main differences between Topsoil Type A, B and C. Imported topsoil (Topsoil Type A) can be used to provide a medium for plant growth when native soil has been removed or is highly disturbed. Remove, stockpile, and replace existing topsoil when appropriate. Existing topsoil can have necessary nutrients, organic matter, and microorganisms. The use of existing topsoil onsite (Topsoil Type B) can reduce the costs of disposing of excess excavated material. An examination of the site with an inventory of existing vegetation is necessary prior to determining when to use existing topsoil. Stockpiling of topsoil might not be advisable when noxious weeds and their seeds are present. Consult the Landscape Architect for assistance. Topsoil Type C is also existing naturally occurring native topsoil meeting the requirements of Topsoil Type B but obtained from a source provided by the Contractor outside of the Contracting Agency owned right of way. The Engineer needs to approve the material prior to removing from the proposed source. Ensure the project obtains the specified material to ensure not only healthy and viable plants, but to ensure topsoil quality and type that meets what the project bid and paid for. Certain topsoil can exceed heavy metals, chemicals or other soil properties detrimental to plant growth and sometimes harmful to humans and the environment. In this case, designers may require soil testing (to determine acceptable soils on our right of way) in addition to meeting the material standard requirements. When provided in the Contract, topsoil should be evenly placed on the slopes at the specified depth for areas to be seeded. After placement of top soil, large clods, hard lumps, rocks 2 inches in diameter or larger, and litter shall be raked up, removed, and disposed of by the Contractor. Refer to Standard Specifications Section 8-02.3(4) for more information. SS 8-02.3(5) Roadside Seeding, Lawn and Planting Area Preparation Complete preparation steps prior to installation of plant materials according to the requirements of the Contract Plans and Specifications:
• Weeds are controlled throughout the entire planting and seeding areas, as called for by the Contract Specifications. Inspect weed root systems to ensure complete weed eradication. The interior color of dead or dying roots is usually tan or brown, whereas healthy roots are usually white. If the weed’s root systems are still alive, delay planting until they can be killed. Perennial weeds with extensive root systems such as Canada thistle, Japanese and Bohemian knotweed, horsetail, wild pea, field bindweed, and quack grass (see Common Weeds of the United States – United States Department of Agriculture) should only be controlled with herbicides by a licensed applicator, to avoid the spread of live plant parts that might produce further weed patches with manual removal.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.38 
Page 8-19
Chapter 8
Miscellaneous Construction
• Areas to be seeded are to be prepared after final grading so that the soil surface is rough and loose, with ridges and furrows (narrow depressions) perpendicular to the slope or to the natural flow of water. This will slow the water velocity, increase water detention and infiltration, decrease runoff, and promote grass growth. This can be done through catwalking, the use of a cleated roller, crawler tractor, or similar equipment. Refer to Standard Specifications Section 8-01.3(2)A for more information.
• Seed and fertilizer are to be uniformly applied on the slopes at the rate and mixture specified in the Contract. Application shall be by hydro-seeder, blowing equipment, properly equipped helicopters, or power drawn drills or seeders. Where areas are inaccessible for this equipment, or when specified, approved hand seeding will be permitted.
• The Project Engineer should measure using the appropriate means to verify the acreage or square foot for seeding, fertilizing and mulching.
• During the seeding and fertilizing operation, the Inspector must verify that the material is placed at a uniform rate and compare the amount of seed and fertilizer applied, by counting the number of bags of material, with the area covered to verify that the proper rate of application is being placed.
• The seed and fertilizer may be applied in one application provided the seed and fertilizer are not mixed more than 1 hour prior to application. Mixing more than 1 hour prior to application will damage the seed. Otherwise, the seed shall be applied in a separate application prior to fertilizing and mulching. Lime, if specified should be applied separately from the seed and mulch.
• Planting holes, pockets, or beds are excavated to the required size and depth, and spaced as shown on plans.
• The backfill mixture is prepared and stockpiled according to Contract Specifications.
• The planting holes are excavated to the sizes indicated in the Contract Plans. The Standard Plans contain minimum planting hole diameters. SS 8-02.3(6)
Soil Amendments
The decision to use a soil amendment depends upon the existing soil and the desired outcome. Some soil amendments might encourage unwanted exotic vegetation, while the combination of other soil amendments with native soils might favor native vegetation. Planting Media – Various additives are sometimes used to improve the root growing environment of the soil that exists on a site. Generally, soil amendment consists of compost. Additives may be either used as a blanket or incorporated into the existing soil. Check the planting (growing) media material against the specification.
Page 8-20
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.38 
Miscellaneous Construction
Chapter 8
SS 8-02.3(6)A Compost Compost is used for multiple functions on projects. It serves as a soil amendment, may be a component of topsoil, and is used as an erosion control BMP when applied as a blanket over soil.
• Prior to placement review the compost for physical contaminants (plastics, concrete, ceramics, metal, etc.) and ammonia odor.
• The permanent protection of earth cut and fill slopes should be accomplished as soon as possible. When provided in the Contract, compost blanket should be evenly placed on the slopes to a depth specified, prior to seeding or other planting. The timing and scheduling of the compost application may occur as early as possible for erosion control purposes and not necessarily immediately prior to seeding and planting operations. If compost is applied days or weeks before seeding and mulching, or in arid and/or windy climates, the soil or compost needs to have a tackifier applied to prevent the compost from blowing away. SS 8-02.3(6)B
Fertilizers
Apply fertilizers in accordance with the Specifications. Cross check the label on the bag or container with the Specifications. When water soluble nitrogen fertilizers are used, particularly in lawn areas, adequate moisture is needed to prevent fertilizer burn of the grass. SS 8-02.3(7) Layout of Planting, Lawn and Seeding Areas The layout of planting areas in wetlands or stormwater facilities is critically important to the wetland’s success. Many plants have exact water requirements and will not thrive or even survive if planted in water too deep or too shallow. Changed conditions happen frequently during the grading phase. Work with the Landscape Architect to ensure the hydrology of the grades are finished to the necessary elevations before planting. Close coordination with the designer during the grading and plant layout phases can identify potential problems and fix them before they become costly mistakes. Tree locations might need to be adjusted to anticipate the size of the tree when fully grown for:
• Minimum clearance to roadways
• Signs
• Mowing edge setbacks
• Structures
• Sight lines
• Drains
• Existing utilities Planting areas might also need to be adjusted to align with the plans and the disturbed areas, and the edge should create a “flowing” outline that is aesthetically pleasing and mowable. It is important that sufficient stakes are used to clearly outline the planting areas. Again, the Landscape Architect should be consulted to ensure proper planting area placement.

• Review the plan sheets, quantities, details, Specifications, and other provisions in the Contract with the Contractor. Questions or interpretations can be answered or problems resolved through discussion with the Region Landscape Architect.
• All materials that have Specification requirements shall have an approval of source prior to incorporation or use on the project. The Contractor is required to submit samples of materials to verify that the materials adhere to the specifications. See Chapter 9 for further instructions and Section 8-2.6 for examples.
• The Inspector should check and accept the stakeout of all planting areas and planting hole locations prior to excavation. Minor relocation of planting areas and holes can be done at this time to avoid utility lines, rock outcrops, drainage ditches, signs, obstructions, or impervious or wet soil conditions. If minor relocation of plantings is not possible, the Inspector should contact the Landscape Architect to adjust the design requirements or quantities. SS 8-02.3(8) Planting SS 8-02.3(8)A Dates and Conditions for Planting Planting must be done during the planting windows, per the Standard Specifications to allow for maximum growth during the rainy season. SS 8-02.3(8)B
Plant Installation
Proper storage and handling of plant material is expected of the Contractor to ensure healthy plant material prior to planting. Plant Material Drying out, excessive heat and cold, and other environmental stresses can be extremely detrimental to a restoration effort. The planting plan was developed to respond to the contract impacts, but the quality and treatment of the materials on the site will be of the utmost importance to ensure success. Inspection During Planting – Planting stock on hand and ready for planting at the construction site should have been inspected upon delivery, in accordance with the checklist under “Inspection at the Construction Site”. Inspection at the Nursery – Upon Contractor request, inspections may be done at the nursery. However, acceptance is only given once on-site inspection determines the adequacy of the material to meet the specifications. The Region Landscape Architect or HQ Landscape Architect should perform this inspection and make recommendations to the PEO to be communicated to the Contractor.

WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.38 
Miscellaneous Construction
Chapter 8
Inspection at the nursery or other source of supply should include the following: 1. Review the general condition of the plant in the block from which the stock is to be taken: a. Uniformity of Leaf Coloration – Yellowing or other leaf discoloration could indicate poor drainage, fertilizer deficiency, herbicide damage, insect damage, or disease, and may not meet specifications. b. Bud Development – During dormant periods of the growth cycle, plants should have buds that are firm, moist, and uniformly spaced. A slight cut into the bark may be made to determine that the cambium, or growing layer just beneath the bark, is moist and green. c. Uniformity of Growth – Acceptable plants in any given block should exhibit uniform vigor and health. d. Spacing of Plants in the Nursery Row – Sufficient spacing is needed to permit vigorous development of the individual plant. e. Soil – Plants to be balled and burlapped must be grown from soil that will hold a firm ball. Reject broken or loose balls due to the potential for damage to the hair roots. f.
Presence of Weeds – Reject containers with an abundance of weeds in the containers. An overgrown, weed-infested nursery block indicates lack of care and the plants growing in it may be in a poor state of vigor.
2. Check individual plants for freedom from defects such as: a. Decay – Reject trees with spots of decayed tissue on the trunk and branches. b. Sunscald or Sunburn – Plants with damage to cambium tissue and bark due to sun scald on the south or southwest side are unacceptable due to the potential for secondary insect and/or disease infestation. c. Abrasions of the Bark – Abrasions severe enough to damage the cambium tissue may be sufficient for rejection. d. Girdling Roots – Roots that grow around another root or a stem are cause for rejection. e. Improper Pruning – Pruning cuts should be made just outside the branch collar and close to the trunk or supporting branch. When a cut is made to encourage branching, it should be made back to a bud. Improperly pruned stubs that have died back are a significant point of entry for disease organisms. f.
Frost Cracks – Long vertical splits in the bark and/or wood may occur on the south and southwest sides of young and thin-barked trees. Such cracks may be invaded by canker or decay-producing fungi and bacteria.
g. Signs of Injury – Dead leaves, dry buds; dieback of twigs and branches; blackened sapwood and sudden, discolored patches of bark (sunscald) on the trunk or limbs.
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.38 
Page 8-23

Miscellaneous Construction
h. Diseases – Look for abnormal growth of leaves, twigs, fruits, discoloration of leaves and bark, unusual discharges of sap through the bark, etc. Reject plants showing evidence of disease. i.
Insects – Look for insect eggs, spider webs, or evidence of damage from insect feeding on leaves, twigs, buds, or other plant parts. Examine the trunks of trees for borer holes which appear as tunnels drilled into the bark and inward into the wood of the trunk. Reject trees with evidence of borers or other insect damage. Often sawdust-like material can be found below bore holes.
3. Check individual plants for proper habit of growth as follows: a. If a particular habit, i.e., single stem, multiple stem, has been specified, plants must conform to this requirement. b. If no particular growth habit has been specified, then the current American Standard for Nursery Stock, Z60.1 as published by the American Association of Nurserymen should be used as a guide c. Top growth on shade and flowering trees should be symmetrically balanced, have a single leader, and well-developed branching characteristic of the species. d. Evergreen trees should be uniformly dense. Sheared plants, such as Douglas fir sheared for Christmas trees, are not allowed, unless specified. e. Shrubs should be well branched in a manner characteristic of the species. If not specified in the contract, the standards for size and number of branches by species listed in the current American Standard for Nursery Stock, Z60.1 applies. 4. Remove a random sampling of plants from their containers to verify that the root system is healthy. Reject root-bound plants and plants that have insufficiently developed root systems to hold the soil together. Healthy roots will hold the soil mass together yet not be crowded around the outside perimeter of the container. 5. Tag planting stock meeting the above criteria with seals placed on all plants or representative samples at the nursery to assist in future inspection of these plants when delivered on the job site. Seals placed on planting stock for later identification do not imply acceptance on the construction site. Inspection at the Construction Site – Acceptance of stock may only be given at the construction site according to the Standard Specifications. It ensures that the plants delivered are from an accepted source, are in a healthy and undamaged condition, and conform to sizes, quantities, and standards called for in the specifications. Plant inspection lots should be established and a representative number of plants should be inspected in accordance with Section 9-4.44. Inspect the condition of the plant and verify that proper handling procedures have been followed from the time of initial inspection to delivery at the construction site. If there are questions about the following checklist, consult with the Landscape Architect for clarification.

Chapter 8
Inspect plants delivered to the construction site for the following: 1. All planting stock are of the genus, species, variety, and sizes specified and conform to the contract specifications for the particular species, or variety, regarding straightness of trunk, branching structure, proportion, and size of material. 2. Individual plant measurements meet the contract specifications. If a particular detail of measurement has not been specified, the current edition of American Standard for Nursery Stock, Z60.1 shall be used. 3. Use judgment and selectivity to sample plant materials. Inspect the entire lot for the same criteria as in the nursery inspection. Ensure each shipment of plants is free of disease and insect pests, and meets all applicable State and Federal certification requirements. All necessary quarantine or State nursery inspection certificates accompany each shipment. 4. All trees and a representative sample of shrubs are legibly tagged with the correct botanical name, common name, and size to agree with the specifications and plant list. Bare-root plants have been shipped in bundles with each bundle properly tagged. 5. Inspect planting stock as the material is being unloaded, or immediately thereafter, so that plants that are obviously unacceptable can be set aside for removal from the project site. a. It is sometimes helpful to mark the pots of unacceptable plants with a dot of spray paint to ensure they are set aside to return to the supplier. b. Set plants in blocks of 10, 25, 50, or 100 containers for ease of counting plants – block size is dependent on the scale of the project. 6. Large root stubs on nursery grown balled or bare-root stock are indicative of lack of proper care and root pruning, and sufficient grounds for rejection of such plants. Root stubs frequently characterize “collected” stock and precautions should be taken to ensure that root systems are adequate 7. Damage to plant material caused by improper operation of mechanical diggers may be sufficient cause for rejection at the construction site. Plants dug with equipment leave a cone-shaped ball; these should be carefully checked to make sure that an excessive portion of the root system has not been cut away Feeder roots are the newly formed roots, usually white in color.

8. Bare Root Plants: a. Where root formation is irregular on bare-root plants, measure the average spread of the roots, considering all sides of the plant, rather than the maximum root spread. The Inspector may allow moderate deviations (±10 percent) from exact measurements in the case of plants which normally have irregular root systems. Example: Vine Maple. b. Bare root plants must be dormant when gathered and prepared for shipping. The normal test for dormancy is observation; if the plant has been subjected to cooling environment and the majority of the leaves have fallen naturally it is a good indication of dormancy. Expert advice from the Landscape Architect should be obtained in all other cases. Bare-rooted plants meeting the quality expectation have adequate live, damp, fibrous roots, free of rot and mold. Earth balls should be unbroken and of specified size. c. Precautions should be taken to prevent the drying of root systems in all shipments of plants to ensure arrival in good condition. During transport, plants must have been protected by a covering such as canvas or plastic sheeting. Bare-root plants should have been protected by moist burlap, sawdust and surrounded by plastic, etc. Under no conditions should the roots system have been allowed to dry out. All plants must exhibit normal health and vigor. d. Reject plants with roots that have dark brown tips, are shriveled, dried up, soft, slimy, smelly, or moldy. e. Reject plants with dull green, streaked, or brown cambium. The inspector is authorized to examine cambium on randomly selected woody plants by removing a thin scraping of bark with a fingernail, small knife, or other tool. f.
Following completion of inspection, all plants accepted should be carefully stored as required below until planted.
9. Quality – The size and quality of planting stock are standardized as much as is practicable considering that the materials are live and may vary due to growing conditions. Judgment should be exercised and allowances made for reasonable variation in growth and appearance. Interim Care of Planting Stock – Plants not planted on the day of arrival at the site should be stored and handled as follows:
• Outside storage should be shaded and protected from the wind.
• Plants stored on the project should be heeled-in to protect them from drying out at all times by covering the bare root or balls with moist sawdust, wood chips, shredded bark, peat moss, or other accepted mulching material. Plants, including those in containers, should be kept in a moist condition until planted by using a fine mist spray or soaker hose, instead of a heavy stream which may cause damage.

Chapter 8
• Avoid damaging plants being moved from the storage area to the planting site. Balled and Burlapped (B&B) plants should be protected against drying and handled carefully to avoid cracking or breaking the earth ball. Plants should not be handled by the trunk or stems.
• Bare-root plants should be watered when removed from the heeling-in bed to protect the roots from drying and they must be planted quickly.
• Should damage occur, or be found at this time, the plants should be rejected and removed from the site.
• At the time of planting, the Inspector should be alert for any damaged soil balls, leaders, major branches, or roots. Pruning is permitted to remove minor damaged branches, if it will not affect the characteristic shape of the plant (see Western Garden Book – Pruning Techniques). All rejected plants should be replaced during the current planting season. All broken, torn, or damaged roots should be pruned, leaving a clean cut surface to help prevent rot and disease.
• In order to ensure against reuse of discarded plants, seals should be removed and the trunk or stems above the root crowns should be marked with a small spot of paint or dye. Since discarded plants are the property of the Contractor, they should not be marked or mistreated in such a way as to make them unfit for other uses. Planting Operation – The Contract Specifications identify the work necessary to accomplish the planting. The following is a checklist of horticultural practices that may be used by the Inspector.
• Plantings should be performed only during the specified planting season according to the specifications.
• Check for proper positioning of the plants and the spread of the root system in the planting hole. For example, on live stakes, the buds must point up, see Standard Plan H-10-15-00.
• When laying out shrub and ground cover beds, define the perimeter by placing plants in a flowing line that clearly outlines the bed border. The interior should then be staked in accordance with the plant pattern and spacing.
• Before B&B plants are set into the planting hole, burlap, twine, and all other foreign materials shall be completely removed.
• Check for correct depth of the root collar. Tree root collars should be above the soil but roots must be completely covered by soil. Occasionally, Contractors leave a portion of the rootball above the soil on the assumption that the mulch will cover it up. This is not an acceptable practice. Plants should not be planted deeper than the root collar – this is the point where the roots begin to spread from the trunk. In some cases, trees may have been planted too deeply at the nursery so make sure root collars are visible above the soil surface before planting.
• Before backfilling, especially in drilled holes, the sides and bottoms must be scratched and loosened to break all “glazing.” This promotes moisture transfer between different soils (existing and backfill).
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.38 
Page 8-27
Chapter 8
Miscellaneous Construction
• Place accepted backfill material around plant roots or plant balls, being careful not to damage the ball or the fine root system of bare-rooted plants. Do not allow backfill which is frozen or saturated.
• Eliminate air pockets in the backfill by filling, tamping, and watering. It is required in the Standard Specifications to water the plants thoroughly before the backfilling of the pit is completed. Container plants should be moist at the time of planting.
• When the above operations have been completed, unless otherwise specified, the Standard Plans planting detail H-10-10-00 requires a berm of soil to be formed from soil around the perimeter of the pit to form a basin or saucer to facilitate watering and retention of rain or irrigation water. When planting on slopes, the berm should be on the downhill side only. This allows the plant to catch runoff from up slope.
• Plants should be mulched to the specified depth with accepted mulch material. The Standard Plans require mulch to be feathered away from tree root collars. When mulching ground covers, ensure the plants are not buried in mulch.
• Excessive moisture in a planting area is defined as visible water in an area not designated as a wetland, and may require elimination or adjustment of planting in that area. Consult with the Region Landscape Architect when excessive moisture is encountered. Mounding may be considered when it is necessary to raise the bed above the water table. Planting in saturated soil often kills the plant because the water keeps oxygen from reaching the plant roots. SS 8-02.3(8)C
Pruning, Staking, Guying, and Wrapping
Plants should be wrapped and staked only if specified. Details for staking are shown in Standard Plan H-10-10-00.
• Trees normally should not be pruned except for broken branches, unless otherwise specified or directed.
• All staking and tying shall be removed at the end of the first year of plant establishment to prevent damage to the plant. SS 8-02.3(9) Seeding, Fertilizing, and Mulching Seed mixes are chosen specifically to meet different functions that include erosion and weed control, aesthetics, and permit obligations. Applying the incorrect seed mix to an area can lead to costly erosion and weed control problems.
• Collect seed labels from each bag and check them against the Specification.
• Verify all the applicable licenses, endorsements, and seed test certification from a certified seed testing laboratory as stated in the Specifications. Seeding for permanent erosion control must be done during the seeding windows, per the Standard Specifications to allow for maximum germination and establishment during the rainy season.

WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.38 
Miscellaneous Construction
Chapter 8
Seed on soil is not considered adequate erosion control until a stabilizing cover of vegetation is established. For this reason, mulch is often applied with seeding to provide immediate coverage. Straw, wood strand mulch, and compost often get used with seeding application, as do a variety of hydraulically-applied erosion control products (HECPs). West of the summit of the Cascade Mountain Range, HECPs may be applied with seed and fertilizer. Each pass must be applied from a different direction to get complete coverage of the soil. East of the summit of the Cascade Mountain Range, the seed and fertilizer must be applied in a first pass. Short-term mulch may be added as a tracer. Consult with the Region Landscape Architect or the HQ Design Landscape Architect if assistance is needed. Mulch is uniformly applied to the seeded areas within 48 hours after seeding. Straw mulch is to be applied with a forced air spreader. Straw mulch may not be practical in windy areas or in areas of concentrated flow. HECP is normally applied with a hydroseeder. Checks are necessary to determine that the mulch is applied uniformly and at the required rate. HECP should completely cover the ground surface with no gaps. In areas that cannot be reached by a mulch spreader, hand methods resulting in uniform application may be used. SS 8-02.3(10)
Lawn Installation
Lawn installation is not a typical restoration roadside practice but it may be required in more built or developed areas and be a result of project commitments. Refer to the Standard Specifications for dates and conditions for lawn installation and establishment. SS 8-02.3(11) Mulch Mulches can be used on the surface for temporary erosion prevention and control and incorporated into the soil to improve the soil environment for establishing vegetation. Organic mulches such as straw, wood fiber, chips, Compost Type 2, and bark are most effective for these purposes. SS 8-02.3(12)
Completion of Initial Planting
The planting is complete when:
• 100 percent of plants are installed and watered-in. Watering is required by Standard Specifications Section 8-02.3(8) as a part of plant installation
• The planting areas are completely cleaned up.
• All repairs to irrigation systems have been completed, mulch is applied, and weeds are completely controlled.

Plant Establishment
Plant establishment begins at Initial Planting Acceptance. The major items included in plant establishment are watering, weed control, litter pickup, start up and shut down of irrigation systems, and replanting. Weather and soil conditions dictate the need for watering. Over-watering is as harmful as under-watering. Plant establishment work is needed to ensure the survival and ongoing vigor of the plants. Inspection During the Plant Establishment Period Plants may be planted in any given area a considerable period of time prior to the granting of initial planting acceptance. During the interim between when plants are installed and initial planting acceptance the Contractor is responsible for the upkeep of planting areas and continued growth of plants. Although planting stock has been properly selected, delivered to the planting site in a vigorous, healthy condition, and planted in accordance with good horticultural practices, survival and normal growth depend to a large degree upon appropriate care during the establishment period. A well rounded program of horticultural practices used during the establishment period may include watering, fertilizing, pruning, insect, disease, and weed control, and replacement of unsatisfactory plants in accordance with the specifications. When plant establishment starts the area should be inspected to make sure that all plants are in place and healthy. Monthly inspections of the planting areas should take place with the Contractor on or near the first of each month during the Plant Establishment Period to spot any potential problems to which the Contractor needs to attend. If differences of opinion concerning the need for a particular procedure occur, and the answers are not readily found in this guide, the Inspector should consult with the Region or HQ Landscape Architect. The project Specifications should clearly indicate the length of the establishment period, which may vary from one area of the state to another, depending on the local conditions, project commitments, climate, and the type of plant materials utilized. A minimum of three years of plant establishment work is required for all planted areas in western Washington, and planted and/or seeded areas in eastern Washington. The default period for plant establishment performed by the Contractor in the Standard Specifications is a minimum of one year. Subsequent years will be funded from Capital Program Development & Management through environmental mitigation and roadside restoration funding. Work will be managed by WSDOT. A. Inspection Checklist – The following inspection checklist includes the primary items which should be observed periodically during establishment.
• The project areas are weeded.
• Plants that have sagged, fallen over, or are otherwise not situated in a natural growing position, as appropriate for the species, may require repositioning.
• Firmly embed stakes or reinstall as necessary.

• Protect the root mass to avoid disturbance to the root mass. Replace topsoil as required if soil has subsided.
• Staked trees are straight. Adjustment of stakes may be needed. Where used, protective wrapping on trunks or stems is secure.
• Damage due to vandalism, vehicles, or fire is noted and corrective action taken.
• Record damage caused by animals (i.e., deer, rodents) and seek advice on protective measures.
• Report infestations of insects and disease to the Landscape Architect for corrective action.
• Broken branches have been pruned just above the break.
• Where discoloration of foliage occurs, especially in evergreen material, seek advice on corrective measures. Once evergreen foliage is brown recovery is not possible.
• Dead and severely damaged plants are removed immediately and replaced during the next appropriate planting period.
• Mulch is to the correct overall depth. Add or replace as required.
• Berms and water basins (constructed for the purpose of retaining water) are functioning properly. Repair and rebuild as necessary.
• If natural rainfall during the establishment period is insufficient for normal plant growth, supplemental water has been supplied.
• Supplemental fertilizers have been applied if required by the Contract Specification. B. Inspection at the End of the Plant Establishment Period – Conduct a plans-in-hand review of each planting area or bed to determine that the arrangement, number, and species of healthy plants called for on the Planting Plans are present. This inspection is of major importance to the ultimate success of the project; include a Landscape Architect, the Inspector, and Contractor on the inspection team. Remove all plants rejected during the inspection and replace with new plants that meet all of the requirements of the contract and the Standard Specifications. The final acceptance of the project is not complete until all plant establishment requirements have been satisfactorily made. SS 8-02.3(14)

Bioengineering
Soil bioengineering is the use of plant material, living or dead, to alleviate environmental problems such as shallow rapid landslides, and eroding slopes and streambanks. In bioengineering systems, plants are an important structural component, not just an aesthetic component. Soil bioengineering may be used as a BMP to stabilize and revegetate slopes and stream banks when changes in condition require adaptation to control sediment and erosion. For more information on the uses of soil bioengineering, see the Roadside Manual M 25-30 Chapter 740, and the Roadside and Site Development website. SS 8-02.3(16)
Roadside Maintenance Under Construction
For larger construction projects that span multiple seasons, certain areas of the roadside will require additional work when WSDOT maintenance crews have no access within project limits. Expectations for roadside mowing and ditch maintenance are outlined in the Standard Specifications if the item “Roadside Maintenance Under Construction” is included in the Contract.
SS 8-02.5
Payment The Project Engineer shall make an inspection of the planting areas before payment is made, to determine if the required work has been accomplished and the number and species of plants shown on the Planting Plans are in a healthy condition. No payments shall be made for plants that are not in a healthy condition, although partial payment may have been made following a previous inspection.

Irrigation System
GEN 8-03.1
General The objective of irrigation on WSDOT contracts is to help ensure plant survival by supplementing natural precipitation during dry periods. This can often be accomplished with far less water than that required to obtain maximum growth and yields. Application rates of irrigation systems are, therefore, designed from the standpoint of minimum moisture requirements of the plants. A properly designed and installed irrigation system will distribute water uniformly over the intended planting area at a predetermined precipitation rate, or by irrigating within the root zone of plants by bubblers or a drip system. Many factors influence the efficiency of a system’s operation and must be taken into consideration during the design stage. In addition, care must be taken when inspecting installation of the irrigation system to ensure that the system not only follows the designer’s intent, but also fully conforms to the Standard Specifications, project plans and provisions, and the manufacturer’s requirements and recommendations. The most efficient and economical irrigation design is only as good as its installation, and this depends upon careful and thorough inspections.

GEN 8-03.2
Chapter 8
Inspection Thorough inspections, carefully conducted during construction, are of utmost importance to help ensure proper installation. To be adequately prepared for inspecting the installation of irrigation systems, it is of great benefit for the Inspector to have previous knowledge, preferably some experience, in at least one of the various aspects of irrigation design, installation, and maintenance. This not always being possible, it becomes necessary for the Inspector to first familiarize themselves with those portions Standard Specifications Sections 8-03 and 9-15 and contract documents that pertain to inspection and irrigation systems before attempting the necessary inspections. In addition, since irrigation inspection requires such varied and versatile knowledge and experience, it is advisable for the Inspector to obtain additional advice and/or assistance from WSDOT personnel having the expertise in these specialty areas. An inspection shall be conducted on all irrigation system components delivered to the project site to determine acceptance or rejection. If at any time, until the system is completed and turned over to WSDOT, components are found that are damaged, defective, or not formally accepted for use on the project, they shall be rejected. Information indicating acceptance or rejection of components shall be properly documented and maintained by the Inspector at all times.
SS 8-03.2
Materials All components intended for use in an irrigation system must receive acceptance prior to their incorporation into the project as required in Section 9-49.9. Acceptance of items is determined from information supplied on the Request for Approval of Material (RAM) (WSDOT Form 350-071) and accompanying catalog cuts. Items selected off the Qualified Products List are already accepted for use and do not require the submittal of a RAM. All components of the irrigation system shall be listed and identified by their corresponding bid item number where applicable. Sufficient information must be included to positively identify each item listed. Each item shall be identified by size, catalog number, and the name of the manufacturer. If samples are requested for preliminary evaluation, it will be the Contractor’s responsibility to obtain and submit the designated items to the Project Engineer for testing. Unless destructive testing is required, all items will be returned to the Contractor upon completion of testing, at which time accepted items may be incorporated into the project.

Layout of Irrigation System Irrigation is installed before planting. The outlines for turf areas and planting beds shall be designated prior to staking the irrigation system. If adjustments to a head-to-head irrigation system are required, they must produce a system which will provide a uniform spray pattern without leaving dry areas. Spray heads to be located adjacent to the perimeter of planting beds should be laid out first to approximate as closely as possible the designed or accepted revised configuration of the planting area. The remainder of the planting area should then be filled with the spacing between heads not to exceed that which is shown on the plans or recommended by the manufacturer. Review all layouts and measure the distance between adjacent heads to ensure that full coverage of water will be attained. If the pattern is not uniform in coverage, or if the distance between heads exceeds that recommended by the manufacturer, the layout will need to be adjusted. Unless otherwise specified in the project provisions, all irrigation systems shall be completed, tested, accepted, and properly backfilled before planting can begin. Advise the Regional Landscape Architect when the irrigation system has been staked in the field.
SS 8-03.3(5) Installation Once the irrigation system layout has been staked and accepted by the Project Engineer, the Contractor may commence excavation. Trench bottoms shall be relatively smooth to provide support along the entire length of pipes to be installed. In addition, and as specified in Standard Specifications Section 8-03.3(2), trench bottoms shall be of sand or other suitable material free from rocks, stones, or any material which might damage the pipe. All system components shall be installed in accordance with the project plans and documents, using methods or techniques recommended by the respective component manufacturers. Solvent welding is a technique used to bond PVC pipe and fittings together. The solvent cement used in this type of installation is, as its name implies, a solvent which dissolves those portions of the pipe and fittings surfaces to which it is applied, to form a continuous bond between the mating surfaces. During the construction of PVC solvent weld joints, excess cement is forced out by the insertion of the pipe into the fitting socket. This excess cement, if not immediately removed, will dissolve the surface of the pipe at its point of accumulation and will result in a permanently weakened spot. It is necessary, therefore, that this excess cement be wiped at the time the joint is made and that the Inspector check to ensure that it has been done.

Plastic pipe is subject to considerable expansion and contraction with temperature changes. To provide for this, pipe should be snaked from side-to-side in the trench. Care shall be taken during the installation of the pipe to ensure that rock, dirt or other debris is not allowed to enter the open ends of the pipe. Protection from freezing must be provided as specified in the project documents. Either a three-way valve with compressed air fitting for blowing water out of the lines, or drain valves placed at the low point of each lateral must be used. If the three-way valve and air fitting is to be used, it must comply with one of the designed installations accepted for use by the Washington State Department of Health. If drain valves are used, care must be taken to ensure that the lateral lines are properly sloped to provide complete drainage. When handles are included as an integral part of the valves, the Contractor shall remove the handles and give them to the Engineer for ultimate distribution to the Maintenance Division. SS 8-03.3(6) Electrical Wire Installation Electrical control wire between the automatic controller and the automatic control valves, shall be bundled together at 10-ft intervals and snaked from side-to-side in the trench, either adjacent to or beneath the irrigation pipe. Snaking of the wire helps eliminate wire stressing or breakage caused by expansion or contraction of the earth due to variations in moisture content or extreme seasonal temperature fluctuations. Placement of the wires adjacent to or beneath the irrigation pipe is for protection against damage from possible future excavation. After partial backfilling of the irrigation trench, detectable marking tape shall be placed above the irrigation and wiring lines to facilitate future location of the lines. This is shown in the Plans. Electrical splices shall be permitted only in valve boxes, junction boxes, pole bases, or at control equipment. No direct burial splices shall be allowed. Types of electrical splices allowed in WSDOT irrigation projects shall be only those accepted for use by the State Materials Laboratory. Accepted electrical splices are listed in the Qualified Products List or may be accepted through the use of a RAM. SS 8-03.3(10) As-Built Plans The Project Engineer is required to submit As-Built Plans in accordance with Section 10-3.11. Accurate As-Built Plans are a valuable and necessary aid in designing and constructing future projects for the area, and for maintenance and repair of the irrigation system. Therefore, it is imperative that these As-Built Plans show the true location, size, and quantity of components installed. Standard Specifications Sections 1-05.3 and 8-03.3(10) state that the Contractor is responsible for supplying working drawings, corrected shop drawings, schematic circuit diagrams or other drawings necessary for the Engineer to prepare corrected plans to show the work as constructed. To help ensure accuracy of this information requires that the Contractor or field representative record each change as it is completed. In addition, WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.38

the Inspector shall inspect and verify this information prior to the commencement of backfilling. Upon completion of this, all working drawings and pertinent information shall be submitted for the Project Engineer’s acceptance and use in preparing the As-Built Plans. The Contractor may also be required to conduct a training and orientation session for WSDOT personnel covering the operation, adjustment, and maintenance of the irrigation system. The Project Engineer shall arrange to have the maintenance personnel who will be involved with the irrigation system attend this orientation session. The As-Built Plans shall be available so they can be reviewed and all features explained. One copy of the AsBuilt Plans shall be presented to the maintenance personnel at that time, along with parts lists, keys to vaults, and service manuals for all equipment. SS 8-03.3(12)
Cross-connection Control Device Installation
A cross-connection is any actual or potential connection between a potable water supply and a source of contamination or pollution. Backflow is the unwanted reverse flow of liquids in piping system and is the major means by which contamination of potable water can occur. Backflow is the result of either back pressure or back-siphonage. Backflow from back pressure can occur any time pressure produced in the non-potable piping system is greater than that existing in the potable side. Backflow from back-siphonage is the result of a negative or subatmospheric pressure within a potable water system, causing contaminants from the non-potable side to be suctioned in. Irrigation systems supplied by domestic potable water systems are potential pollution hazards to the potable water. Such cross-connections require protection to prevent the possibility of backflow. A backflow prevention or cross-connection control device is any device, method, or type of construction used to prevent backflow into a potable water system. An accepted backflow prevention or cross-connection control device is one that has been investigated and accepted by an appropriate regulatory agency. The approving or regulatory agency for backflow prevention, cross-connection control devices for the state of Washington is the Department of Environmental Health. This agency periodically publishes a list of accepted cross-connection control devices. The HQ Design Landscape Architect will maintain a copy of this list to assist the regions. The local water purveyor determines the type of backflow prevention device to be used to protect domestic water supply systems under their jurisdiction. This determination is based upon the water purveyor’s estimation of the probability of backflow occurring and the degree of hazard created if it should. Once the type of device to be used has been determined, the device shall be selected from the Department of Environmental Health current list of accepted cross-connection control devices.

SS 8-04.3
Construction Requirements
SS 8-04.3(1) Cement Concrete Curbs, Gutters, and Spillways The Standard Specifications specify the class of concrete to use when constructing the various items. Quite often the Contractor places the concrete for these miscellaneous items at the same time of placing concrete for other work. When this is the case, it is usually more convenient for the Contractor to use the same class of concrete for all the work during the day. At the Contractor’s request, the Project Engineer may accept a higher class of concrete in lieu of the class specified at no increased cost to WSDOT. This substitution should be documented in the diary, Inspector’s daily report, or other records.

Guardrail
GEN 8-11.1
General Instructions Guardrail is designed to minimize exposure to roadside hazards. Since guardrail is expensive to construct and requires continual maintenance, it should be constructed only where specific conditions justify its use. Conditions may change between the design and construction phases of work. Contact the Design Project Office if there are any questions regarding the placement location or type of new runs of guardrail. It is good practice to double check the location, layout and arrangement of new guardrail and terminals in the field after the embankment has been constructed but before the guardrail has been installed. Consult with the Design Project Office if any apparent problem is discovered at the site and certainly before deleting or modifying a run of guardrail.

Ramming or driving will be permitted only if allowed by the Engineer and if no damage to the pavement, shoulders and adjacent slopes results therefrom. The post holes shall be of sufficient dimensions to allow placement and thorough compaction of selected backfill material completely around the post. SS 8-11.3(1)C
Terminal and Anchor Installation
Installation of guardrail terminals shall be supervised by the manufacturer’s representative, or an installer who has been trained and certified by the manufacturer within the last 5 years for the specific device being installed. The Inspector will verify that a copy of the installer’s certification is on file prior to installation. After installation is complete, the Inspector will collect an original signed manufacturer’s terminal assembly/inspection checklist for every terminal installed. A copy of the checklist will be attached to the Inspector’s Daily Report and the original will be retained at the Project Office. The Project Engineer should invite the area Maintenance Superintendent to the preconstruction conference to discuss final inspection of the guardrail terminals. The area Maintenance Superintendent can give the Project Engineer the contact information for the Lead Technician assigned to the project at this time. The Lead Technician assigned will be the point of contact for final guardrail terminal inspection. At intervals determined by the Project Office and the Lead Technician, or at a time and date agreed upon, the Inspector and Lead Technician will conduct a final walk through of the new guardrail and end terminals installed on the Contract. It is suggested this final walk through occur while the Contractor is still on-site, and before opening to traffic. The walk through will allow the Inspector and Maintenance Technician to perform the following tasks:
• Conduct a final inspection of the new guardrail and end terminals using the installation checklists provided by the installer (performed by the Lead Technician and Inspector)
• Enter installation checklists into the maintenance database HATS (performed by the Maintenance Technician)
• Conduct an as-built survey and inventory of the location of each guardrail terminal and enter information into HATS (performed by the Maintenance Technician)

Construction Requirements Since preservation of natural growth is being stressed, clearing will have to be performed specifically for the fence construction on many projects. In these cases, only the width necessary to accommodate the fence construction should be cleared. Some grading is usually necessary to prevent short and abrupt breaks in the ground contour that will affect the aesthetic appearance of the top of the fence. Care needs to be exercised to prevent clogging natural drainage channels while grading the fence line.

Cement Concrete Sidewalks
SS 8-14.3
Construction Requirements
SS 8-14.3(2) Forms Forms may be of wood or metal and full depth of the sidewalk. The forms should be straight or uniformly curved and in good condition. In rest areas and park areas where the sidewalks are normally laid out in a winding pattern rather than in straight lines, care must be taken in setting the forms so that the sidewalk will present a pleasing appearance with no kinks or angle breaks. The forms must be braced and staked sufficiently to maintain them to grade and alignment. Usually, spreaders are necessary to properly space the forms and hold them in position until the concrete is placed. If the Contractor uses thin strips of form material for winding sidewalks, more than one thickness with staggered joints should be used to obtain the smooth flowing lines. In forested areas, all roots should be removed or cut back. After the forms have been set, the foundation shall be brought to the required grade, compacted and well dampened. Prior to placement of concrete, the inspector shall verify that the forms are set to line and grade, and shall check the forms for cross-slope and grade of the sidewalks and ramps, for conformance with the Plans, and to ensure that the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) are met. If there are junction boxes, cable vaults, manholes or other utilities present in the sidewalk or ramp surface, they must be flush with the sidewalk or ramp surface.

SS 8-14.3(3) Placing and Finishing Concrete Air entrained concrete Class 3000 (or Commercial Concrete) shall be used for construction of sidewalks. After the concrete is placed, it should be struck off with a straightedge. The concrete should be troweled smooth with a steel trowel and then lightly brushed in a transverse direction with a soft brush. On grades of over 4 percent, the surface shall be finished with a stipple brush or as the Engineer may direct. Following brushing of the surface, the concrete shall be edged and jointed as shown in the plans or the Standard Plans. In areas adjacent to existing sidewalks, the jointing pattern should be similar to the existing pattern. Consideration should be given to placing crack control joints adjacent to cracks in the existing sidewalk if they are not going to be repaired. If the cracks in the existing sidewalk are full depth, they may cause reflective cracking in the new adjacent sidewalk. Expansion joints shall be constructed at the locations and of the sizes as detailed in the plans or in the Standard Plans. All concrete sidewalks shall be properly cured. During this curing period, all traffic, both pedestrian and vehicular, shall be excluded. Vehicular traffic should be discouraged and by no means allowed until the concrete has reached its design strength. There is a risk that the sidewalk can be damaged as it was not designed to take these loads. Before any decision to allow vehicles on a sidewalk there should be a clear agreement that any damage will be repaired and who will pay for it.

Illumination, Traffic Signal Systems, and Electrical
GEN 8-20.1
General Illumination and traffic signal systems, due to the very nature of the work, are a highly specialized type of installation. In designing these systems, every effort is made to avoid problems for construction, maintenance, and the utility company. If problems arise, the Engineer should contact those responsible for the design and operations for help in solving them.
GEN 8-20.2
Inspection Inspection on electrical projects involves two aspects of work. The first of these is the physical aspect wherein conformance to the plan requirements relative to the materials used and general construction techniques must be the criterion for judgment. An Inspector who is thoroughly familiar with the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 8-20 and with normal construction techniques should be assigned the inspection responsibility for this portion of any signal or illumination project. The Fabrication Inspector shall be consulted if lighting or traffic signal standards arrive on the jobsite without prior inspection. The second aspect of electrical work involves the conformance by the Contractor with the contract requirements in addition to the requirements of the State electrical construction codes and the National Electric Code. This aspect of inspection must be performed by
Page 8-40

Chapter 8
an electrical Inspector. A further consideration within this aspect of work involves any changes authorized in the contract plans as it may affect circuit stability, circuit adequacy, and the ability of related electrical control devices to properly function through any such change of plans. The performance testing of the system is part of the second aspect of the electrical work. Electrical work is a specialized field of endeavor within WSDOT; therefore the Project Engineer must arrange for the assistance of an electrical Inspector from the Regional office. The electrical Inspector shall make periodic inspections throughout the course of construction of all electrical projects and shall advise the Project Engineer of appropriate times to enable the Project Engineer to occasion the required field tests of electrical circuits, as discussed in Standard Specifications Section 8-20, at such times that cause a minimum interference of the work scheduled by the Contractor. Should any question arise on a project pertaining to the technical nature of the work, the Project Engineer shall consult with the electrical Inspector or with the Regional Traffic Engineer, if necessary. Our plans and specifications are designed generally to conform with existing national electrical codes. There are instances when the Department permits methods of construction that are considered equivalent to state and national codes. Generally, local inspection authorities do not inspect highway work that is within the state highway right of way. From time to time, however, the Department of Labor and Industries or local electrical inspectors may visit a project to inspect or review the Contractor’s work. They should be treated courteously and their judgment respected. The Department does have authority to permit alternate methods when equivalent objectives can be met if the work is within the State right of way. Should any question arise over a conflict between our plans and their opinions, the matter should be referred to the State Construction Office for advice.

Working Drawings for Illumination and Signal Standards The Contractor is required to submit working drawings for all types of signal standards and for light standards without pre-approved plans. Pre-approved plans are listed in the Contract Provisions and on the Bridge and Structures website. If light standards with pre-approved plans are proposed, a working drawing submittal is not required. There are two different approval procedures for shop drawings. They are the State Bridge and Structures office approval, and Project Engineer approval only. In either case, the Contractor is required to submit one set of drawings as a Type 2E Working Drawing per instructions in Standard Specifications Section 1-05.3. The two approval procedures include the following: A. Bridge and Structures Office Approval
• Light standards without pre-approved plans.
• Types II, III, IV, V signal standards without pre-approved plans.
• Type SD (Special Design) signal standards. B. Project Engineer Approval Only
• Types PPB, PS, I, RM and FB signal standards.
• Types II, III, IV, V signal standards with pre-approved plans. After the Contractor has submitted working drawings, the Engineer shall make a field check of both contract plans and working drawings. The Project Engineer is responsible for checking the geometric features of these items. Specific items that should be checked include the following:
• Foundation locations.
• Light source to base dimension (H1), if required in the special provisions and clearance to overhead utility wires.
• Mast arm lengths. If foundation offsets are changed, mast arm lengths must be adjusted.
• Horizontal dimensions from single standard pole centerline to signal head attachment points.
• Vertical dimensions from signal standard base plate to signal mast arm connection points. Assistance is available from the Traffic Design office in estimating mast arm deflection to ensure vertical clearance requirements are met.
• Orientations of mast arms and all pole-mounted appurtenances.
• Signal head mounting details.
• Hand hole location and orientation.
• Base treatment for lighting standards (fixed, or slip, or breakaway).

If there are no changes to dimensions or orientations, the Project Engineer shall mark the drawings with a statement that all standards shall be fabricated according to dimensions and orientations shown in the Contract. If there are corrections, the Project Engineer shall note all corrections on one set of shop drawings, with green markings only, and attach copies of signal standard chart and/or luminaire schedule from contract, noting any dimension changes in green. Or the Project Engineer may note the changes in a list form and submit it with the PDF within the email. The State Bridge and Structures office will conduct a structural review, and make comments in red, incorporating the Project Engineer’s geometric review comments. The working drawings for supports without pre-approval shall be submitted to the State Bridge and Structures office, which will coordinate approval with the State Materials Laboratory as necessary. After approval, the State Bridge and Structures office will retain one set and forward the approved PDF file to the Project Office. The Project Engineer will forward the approved PDF file to the Fabrication Inspector, the Region Signal Superintendent (or designate), and the Contractor, who will forward to the Fabricator. See the Shop Plans and Working Drawings Table in Section SS 1-05.3. If pre-approved shop plans have been submitted, a structural review by the State Bridge and Structures office is not required. The Project Engineer shall mark all changes in red on the PDF file. The Project Engineer will then forward to the Regional Operations/ Construction Engineer, the Fabrication Inspector, the Region Signal Superintendent, and the Contractor, who will forward to the Fabricator.

Sufficient cover must be provided to protect the conduit from damage as provided in Standard Specifications Section 8-20.3(5). At locations where plastic conduit is allowed and hard rock is encountered within the minimum depth required, steel conduit should be substituted for the affected runs, and the depth adjusted as necessary. SS 8-20.3(5)B Conduit Type SS 8-20.3(5)B1
Rigid Metal Conduit
Installation of conduit should be supervised to ensure against physical abrasion of the conduit or for rust on threads which would destroy the integrity of the galvanizing. Electrically caused corrosion of metallic conduit is easy to avoid by proper construction supervision. If the causes of this type of corrosion are not properly inspected and controlled, the extent of electrically caused corrosion is commonly far more severe than the chemically caused corrosion. In any metallic conduit system, the metallic conduit itself serves an electrical function. This function is to provide a low resistance return path for electricity which may leak out of an electrical conductor due to scraped insulation, cracks, or other causes. A point at which electricity can leak or escape from an electrical wire is called a “fault”. When electricity flows through any non-insulated path (conduit), it can establish an electrical phenomenon called electrolysis. Electrolysis results in the transfer of metal from one location to metal at another location. Through this means, the metal that was used to make the metallic conduit may be transferred to other locations on the same conduit run or to other metallic appurtenances. With the ultimate degeneration of conduit at any point, the return path for the electricity through the conduit system itself is destroyed. In the event that a portion of a conduit was destroyed in this means and with the subsequent damage or failure of electrical conductors beyond that point, electricity would not have the ability to complete the circuit from the wire through the conduit system and return to service enclosure which would, in turn, cause a fuse to blow or a circuit breaker to trip. Hence, the protection offered by our electrical overload equipment is totally nullified. To prevent this type of ultimate failure of the electrical system, all conduit joints should be carefully inspected to ensure that they are physically tight and that a good electrical bond does exist from one piece of conduit through the nipple to each adjoining piece of conduit. Additionally, conduit threads should be painted with an accepted corrosion inhibiting conduit paint. Any loose or improper union between conduit sections or Page 8-44

conduit and junction boxes is a point of high resistance to the flow of electricity. When such a condition exists and with the faulting of an electrical conductor within the system, electricity does not have an easy return to its point of service. Electricity then takes alternate routes through the earth, structures, etc. This, in particular, establishes the condition of electrolysis and results in even greater failure of the physical system. The physical system failure attributed to this may present itself from two to five years after construction. The seriousness of this matter cannot be overstressed in electrical construction. It is so important that if one factor, and only one factor, was to be examined on each electrical project, it would be the search for conditions that would result in electrolysis and the sloppy workmanship that causes them. Additionally, to prevent electrical damage to the conduit system and, in particular, during the time of project construction, the conduit shall not be used as a temporary neutral return nor shall the conduit be used for the ground of construction equipment, i.e., welders, hand tools. SS 8-20.3(5)B2
Conduit Plowing
Prior to installation, conduit shall be inspected for damage and deformities. For High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) conduit, this shall be done while the conduit is still on the reel. The inspector also needs to verify that HDPE conduit meets the thickness requirements in the Contract (examples: Schedule 80; SDR 9). The inspector should verify that the plow shoe is marked as required by Standard Specifications Section 8-20.3(5)E2. The inspector should monitor the plow operation to ensure that the mark remains below ground for the entire run. Should the mark come above ground, required actions are defined in Standard Specifications Section 8-20.3(5)E2. Spot checks of conduit depth are recommended. The most effective method for verifying conduit depth is continuous monitoring of the plow shoe during the plowing operation. The plow trench tends to cave in behind the plow, making measurement after placement difficult. SS 8-20.3(6) Junction Boxes, Cable Vaults, and Pull Boxes In most designs, precast concrete junction boxes are being used. These boxes are simple to install. A sump is excavated and partially filled with gravel. The open-bottom box is then seated by working it into the gravel until the required grade is reached. Care must be taken in junction box location to provide for drainage. Junction boxes and conduit should be placed away from areas that water is funneled to prevent it from entering into the conduits. For example, the bottom of ditches, sag vertical curves should be avoided or other low spots where water is likely to collect.

SS 8-20.3(8) Wiring An electrical system is only as good as its conductors, terminals and splices, and it is important that the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 8-20.3(8) be strictly adhered to. If there is any doubt concerning the adequacy of a connector, the advice of the Regional Electrical Inspector should be obtained. Practically all wiring for traffic signal and illumination systems is exposed to the elements, and it is very important that all splices be insulated with waterproof material, as prescribed in Standard Specifications Section 8-20.3(8) and 9-29.12. SS 8-20.3(9) Bonding, Grounding Because of the hazards of electrical shock, all grounds and ground bonds referred to in the plans and in the special provisions should be given special attention to ensure their effectiveness and completeness. See Standard Specifications Section 8-20.3(9) and Standard Plan for Typical Grounding Detail. SS 8-20.3(10)
Service, Transformer, and Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Cabinets
Generally, Type “B,” “C,” “D,” and “E” service cabinets etc., will be factory assembled from drawings submitted with the material lists. Type “A” service equipment will be assembled in the field. Care shall be taken to ensure compliance with all provisions of the plans and specifications, and to determine that all bonds and grounds are complete. Relations With the Serving Utility Generally, during the design of an illumination or traffic signal system, the serving utility is consulted concerning the availability of power, the voltage needed, the location of the most convenient point of service, and agreements are prepared prior to the awarding of the contract. The Project Engineer should review all utility agreements and contact the serving utility as soon as the Contractor commences work to arrange for the actual service connections and other work which may have been agreed upon. The matter is important since, in many cases, the utility will have to extend lines, install transformers, and do other related work. Upon completion of the contract, the Project Engineer will instruct the serving utility to direct all future billings to the appropriate maintenance division. Electrical Safety Tags Commencing at the time that the serving utility makes the power drop to WSDOT electrical service cabinets, electrical safety tags shall be used. Any electrician working on any main or branch circuit shall cause that circuit to be de-energized and shall place an electrical safety tag at the point that the circuit is open. The electrician shall sign the electrical safety tag and only that electrician may make subsequent circuit alterations or remove the tag. If the circuit that the electrician de-energized to work on is serving traffic, the electrician shall arrange the work so the circuit may be energized for nighttime operation. The electrician shall remove the safety tag and energize the circuit before leaving the jobsite Page 8-46

Chapter 8
and upon returning to work on the circuit, shall de-energize it again and place an electrical safety tag back on the circuit. SS 8-20.3(11) Testing All illumination and traffic signal systems shall be tested as outlined in Standard Specifications Sections 8-20.3(11) and 8-20.3(14)D. Particular care shall be taken in the performance of test No. 3. The Project Engineer shall insure that readings of the megohmmeter taken on every electrical circuit are furnished to the Regional Electrical Inspector. Caution must be exercised in the performance of this test to protect control mechanisms from damage due to the nature of the test voltages used. Also, the records made of this series of tests must identify the readings observed with each branch of the electrical circuit involved. Representative sampling of the Contractor’s test readings may be made by the Electrical Inspector using State test equipment. Field Test No. 4 of Standard Specifications Section 8-20.3(11) is to be performed on all illumination and signal projects. It is especially important that the Project Engineer obtain the consultation of the Regional Traffic Engineer in this portion of the field test when the tests are being performed in a traffic signal controller. Since the mechanism in these controllers is so interrelated and complex, only persons thoroughly schooled in such control mechanisms are qualified to determine when particular timing circuits and sequences are functioning properly. The simple turning on of an electrical switch and watching a light come on is not an acceptable electrical test. SS 8-20.3(13)
Illumination Systems
SS 8-20.3(13)A Light Standards In erecting lighting standards or signal standards, rope or fabric slings should be used to reduce the danger of damage to galvanized or finished aluminum surfaces. Existing Illumination Systems Where existing illumination or traffic signal systems are to be removed, and the material stockpiled at the site of the work for delivery to WSDOT, it will be advantageous if prior arrangements are made to have Department personnel meet the contractor at the delivery storage site. These arrangements should be made with either the Regional Maintenance Engineer or the Regional Traffic Engineer. Existing Communication Conduit Repair When existing communication conduits are likely to be encountered during construction, the contractor should be prepared to immediately restore any communication conduit and cables damaged by the contractor’s activities. This includes all types of conduit, including those with innerduct, and electrical and/or fiber optic cables. When existing communication conduits are present within the project work area, the Engineer should coordinate a meeting between the contractor and WSDOT Maintenance personnel to develop a pre-approve repair procedure for damaged communication

conduits and cables. This plan should include the method of repair, how long the repair would take, and the availability and type of repair kit to be used. Communication conduit damaged during the work shall be repaired with an approved manufactured repair kit appropriate for the size and type of conduit. The repair kit shall be provided by the contractor. Replacement communication conduit and cable shall be subject to the acceptance requirements of the appropriate Standard Specifications. Damaged communication conduit and communication cables shall be repaired and the communication system shall be fully operational within 24 hours of being damaged. Temporary splices or repairs may be accepted in order to restore operation; however any temporary repairs that do not meet the requirements of the Standard Specifications shall be removed and replaced with permanent repairs in accordance with the Standard Specifications. SS 8-20.3(14)
Signal Systems
Traffic signal systems are a very specialized type of work. All work shall be done in strict accordance with the plans, the special provisions, and the Standard Specifications. The Regional Traffic Engineer will be responsible for the proper timing of each signal installation and will assist the Engineer in any way needed to ensure the proper completion of the work. The checklist (Figure 8-1) is provided to assist the Project Engineer in identifying the specific tasks that must be completed prior to signal turn-on. This checklist is a guide, and line items may be added or deleted as necessary to fit each specific signal installation. SS 8-20.3(17)
”As-Built” Plans
The Project Engineer is required to submit As-Built Plans in accordance with Section 10-3.7. For proper maintenance and repair of the electrical system, it is imperative that the location of all conduits and the diagram of all circuits be properly shown on the AsBuilt Plans. Normally, the conduits should be constructed in the locations shown on the contract plans. Many times these conduits are positioned in a particular place to eliminate conflict with future construction. Standard Specifications Section 8-20.3(17) requires the Contractor to submit any corrected shop drawings, schematic circuit diagrams or other drawings necessary to prepare the corrected as-built plans.

Permanent Signing
GEN 8-21.1
General The complex design of today’s freeway facilities has created an increased demand on signing. Signing is one of the features a layperson readily can evaluate on a new facility. Improper or inadequate signing detracts from the quality of the basic construction features of the project. Misplaced or irregular usage of signs on interchanges creates a critical hazard to traffic and hinders the proper operation of the facility. Today’s destination sign has increased in size to the extent that it is no longer a minor installation and the amount of time required to install an average freeway sign project has been extended to the point that close cooperation between all forces on highway construction projects is vital so that the facility is signed properly when opened to traffic. Any sign that is erected on a section of roadway carrying traffic ahead of the time the message on the sign will be applicable to the traffic shall be covered in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 8-21.3(3) until the appropriate time for uncovering it. It is essential that signs with conflicting messages not be displayed.
SS 8-21.2
Materials All materials for installation on permanent signing projects should be selected off the Qualified Products List (QPL) or listed on the Request for Approval of Materials (RAM). Materials listed on RAM which are not listed on the QPL shall be submitted to the State Materials Laboratory for appropriate action as soon as possible. This list shall be complete and cover all materials which are identified on the plans or in the specifications. The list shall include the source of supply, name of manufacturer, size and catalog number of the units, and shall be supplemented by such other data as may be required including catalog cuts, detailed scale drawings, wiring diagrams of any nonstandard or special equipment. All supplemental data shall be submitted in accordance with Section 1-05.3.
SS 8-21.3
Construction Requirements
SS 8-21.3(1) Location of Signs Since it is impossible to visualize the actual physical features of final grade elevations, vertical curves, trees, and other factors that affect proper sign placement in the initial sign plan stage, it becomes necessary to make adjustments in sign location just prior to installation. The Project Engineer and Regional Traffic Engineer should coordinate a study of each location to determine that each sign will be in the most efficient location for visibility and nighttime reflectivity. Advance Destination signs may be moved up to 500 ft in either direction if severe ground or slope conditions are encountered. If the sign must be moved more than 500 ft, consideration should be given to revising the distance on the sign. All sign locations shall be staked by the Engineer prior to installation by the Contractor. Following staking of the signs, the Project Engineer should furnish the Contractor with the list of post lengths for steel posts. For wooden posts, the Contractor should be able to Page 8-52

order posts in commercial lengths from the approximate lengths shown in the plans. Final lengths of timber posts will be determined or verified by the Engineer at the request of the Contractor prior to fabrication. SS 8-21.3(2) Placement of Signs A “fabrication approval” decal dated and signed by the Sign Fabrication Inspector shall appear on the back of all permanent signs that are received on the project. Signs without such indicated acceptance shall not be permitted on the project. Damaged signs shall be rejected at the project site. At the completion of a sign installation, the Project Engineer shall request the Regional Traffic Engineer to assist in making a final inspection. SS 8-21.3(9) Sign Structures SS 8-21.3(9)A
Shop Drawings for Sign Structures
Working drawings of sign structures shall be reviewed by the Project Engineer for conformance with the Standard Plans Section G. The Project Engineer approves plans in conformance with the standard plans. Any request to deviate from standard plans should be reviewed by the State Bridge and Structures Office. The working drawings of special design sign structures and/or special sign fittings shall be submitted to the State Bridge and Structures office, which will coordinate approval with the State Materials Laboratory. After approval, the State Bridge and Structures office will retain one set and forward the approved PDF file to the Project Office. The Project Engineer will forward the approved PDF file to the Fabrication Inspector, the Region Signal Superintendent (or designate), and the Contractor, who will forward to the Fabricator. If a structural review is not required by the State Bridge and Structures office, the Project Engineer shall mark all changes in red on a PDF and distribute In accordance with the Working Drawings, Shop Plans, or Submittal Type in Section SS 1-05.3. All drawings shall be clearly marked (See SS 1-05.3 ) before returned to the Contractor, whether reviewed and checked by the Project Engineer or the State Bridge and Structures Office. The Project Engineer is responsible for checking the geometric features of these items. Specific items that should be checked include the following:
• Foundation Location
• Handrail fitup with VMS Door Opening The special provisions of the contract deal to a great extent with the proper fabrication of the signs to be installed and the manufacturing process requiring the use of approved application equipment. It is necessary, therefore, that the firm who actually makes the signs be approved as a source of supply. Such approval is made by the State Materials Laboratory.

It is important to ensure the proper torque is applied to bolts connecting the bases when installing Standard Plan G-24.10.00 through G-24.60.00 Sign Structures. Procedures for assembling and inspecting high strength bolts are covered in Section 6-3.6B. All base assemblies shall be checked with a torque wrench. This can be accomplished either by observing the Contractor’s torquing or by the Inspector utilizing the Region’s torque wrench. Documentation of the torquing method used should be accomplished by proper entries in the Inspector’s Daily Reports.

Materials
General The quality of materials used on the project will be evaluated and accepted in various ways, whether by testing of samples, visual inspection, or certification of compliance. This chapter details the manner in which these materials can be accepted. Requirements for materials are described in Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction M 41-10 Section 1-06 and Division 9. The State Materials Engineer is responsible for the state’s materials approval and acceptance program, and the Quality Assurance Program. Any changes or deviations to the approval or acceptance of materials, or the Quality Assurance Program beyond what is allowed in this chapter will require approval from the State Materials Engineer or the Assistant State Materials Engineer. The State Materials Engineer can issue changes via memorandums or emails that amend and replace the directions and policies in Chapter 9 Materials as well as materials approval, acceptance and Quality Assurance Program policies and directions in this manual to address unforeseen issues. It is the Project Engineer’s responsibility to accept materials in accordance with this chapter. For materials that do not meet specification requirements, the Project Engineer shall contact the State Construction Office which will coordinate with the State Materials Engineer or Assistant State Materials Engineer to determine the appropriate action.

PE Authority for Materials Approval and Acceptance This chapter covers the Project Engineer’s authority to approve and modify the acceptance of certain materials while maintaining normal approval and acceptance by the State Materials Laboratory and Region. The use of these processes mentioned within this Section are to be implemented prior to work being performed and not to retroactively justify deficiencies discovered after the completion of work, with the exception that Reducing Frequency of Testing is implemented during the work. It is recommended that the Project Engineer office review the original Record of Materials to determine if items can be modified within the guidelines of this section. The Record of Material should be actively maintained per Section 9-1.2C. Materials accepted in accordance with these options shall be identified in the Project Engineer’s preparation of the Certification of Materials under Section SS 1-09.12, Audits. The options that are available to the Project Engineer for approving and modifying the acceptance of materials are the following sections:
• Section 9-1.1A Sampling and Testing for Small Quantities of Materials
• Section 9-1.1B Reducing Frequency of Testing
• Section 9-1.1C Project Engineer Discretionary Materials Approval/Acceptance
• Section 9-1.1D Optional Approval/Acceptance for Materials

Materials
The Reduced Acceptance Criteria Checklist DOT Form 350-120 shall be completed and retained in the materials file when Reducing Frequency of Testing, Sampling and Testing for Small Quantities of Materials and Project Engineer Discretionary Materials Approval/ Acceptance are invoked. All information requested on the checklist shall be filled in completely. Any items that do not require approval from the State Materials Laboratory and the State Construction Office may be approved at the Project Engineer level. For approval of changes beyond the Project Engineer’s authority (items marked with a “yes” and an “x” on DOT Form 350-120), a request must be transmitted to the State Materials Laboratory and may require approval from the State Construction Office as well. The completed checklist shall accompany the request and represents the minimum information required to process the modification. The State Materials Laboratory and the State Construction Office have final authority to approve or reject any request for modification. Written approval by the State Materials Laboratory and State Construction Office constitutes agreement with the proposal. The signed checklist and all supporting documentation are to be placed in the project Materials File. For approval contact the following:
• State Materials Laboratory – Areas of responsibility: All changes to materials approval and acceptance, and to Standard Specifications Division 9. Initial contact: Materials Quality Assurance Engineer
• State Construction Office – Areas of responsibility: Standard Specifications Divisions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11. 9-1.1A Sampling and Testing for Small Quantities of Materials The Project Engineer may elect to accept small quantities of materials without meeting minimum sampling and testing frequencies using the following criteria. The use of this process is to be implemented prior to work being performed and not to retroactively justify deficiencies discovered after the completion of work. An item can be accepted as a small quantity if the proposed quantity for a specific material is less than the minimum required testing frequency Materials that will not be considered under the small quantity definition are:
• Concrete with a 28-day compressive strength of 4000 psi or greater. Some issues that the Project Engineer may consider prior to use of small quantity acceptance are:
• Has the material been previously approved?
• Is the material certified?
• Do we have a mix design or reference mix design?
• Has it been recently tested with satisfactory results?
• Is the material structurally significant?

Chapter 9
Small quantity acceptance could be visual, by certification, or other methods and the basis of acceptance shall be documented on DOT Form 350-120. For visual documentation, an entry should be made in the project records as to the basis of acceptance of the material, and the approximate quantity involved. The small quantity acceptance may be used for any quantity of the following:
• Curbs and sidewalks
• Driveways and road approaches
• Paved ditches and slopes Where jobsite mixing of concrete occurs in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(4)B small quantity acceptance can be used for acceptance of packaged concrete meeting the requirements of ASTM C 387. The packaged concrete bag must state that the concrete meets the requirements of ASTM C 387. 9-1.1A Reducing Frequency of Testing Reducing the frequency of testing of materials is intended for WSDOT projects with a high volume of materials. In instances of uniform material production where the statistical acceptance testing data shows the material is running well within specification limits deviations from the testing frequency schedule may be instituted. Sampling frequency reduction may be considered only after ten consecutive samples taken at the normal testing frequency indicate full conformance with the specifications. The sampling and testing frequency will revert back to the normal frequency if there are any failing tests. The use of this process is to be implemented prior to work being performed and not to retroactively justify deficiencies discovered after the completion of work. The Statistical Analysis of Materials (SAM) program will be utilized to develop and support approvals to reduce testing frequency and/or to eliminate selected test properties. Testing on selective materials may be reduced or eliminated without statistical data on select material, for example selective relief would be reduction/elimination of fracture determinations and sand equivalent testing for production from quarry sources. All deviations from the testing frequency must be documented in the project records, and fully explained by the Project Engineer. Lack of personnel, equipment, and facilities will not be considered sufficient reasons for such deviation. The authority given below to approve deviations to testing frequencies shall not be subdelegated within the regions.
• The Project Engineer, licensed as a Professional Engineer in the State of Washington, may initiate and approve up to 10 percent deviations from the testing frequency schedule. The Project Engineer does not have the authority to reduce sampling frequencies for the following materials: Hot Mix Asphalt, Warm Mix Asphalt, Structural Concrete and Cement Concrete Pavement.
• The Region Materials Engineer, licensed as a Professional Engineer in the State of Washington, may approve requests from project engineers for an additional 10 percent deviation from the testing frequency schedule. The Region Materials WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.39

Materials
Engineer does not have the authority to reduce sampling frequencies for the following materials: Hot Mix Asphalt, Warm Mix Asphalt, Structural Concrete and Cement Concrete Pavement.
• Elimination of fracture and/or SE from a Quarry Site requires approval from the Region Materials Engineer. Elimination of any other testing will require approval of State Materials Engineer or the Assistant State Materials Engineer.
• Request for sampling frequency deviations exceeding the Project Engineer and Region Materials Engineer reduction authority requires approval from the State Materials Engineer or the Assistant State Materials Engineer.
• Request for sampling frequency deviations for Hot Mix Asphalt, Warm Mix Asphalt, Structural Concrete and Cement Concrete Pavement require approval from the State Materials Engineer or the Assistant State Materials Engineer. A copy of all testing frequency deviations with substantiating data approved by the Project Engineer and/or the Region Materials Engineer will be sent to the State Materials Engineer. 9-1.1A Project Engineer Discretionary Materials Approval/Acceptance In advance of or during the course of the project, in the interest of economy and efficiency, noncritical items of work may be identified for which the Project Engineer is allowed to approve the Request for Approval of Material (RAM), and may choose to modify the normal inspection or testing procedures. In taking these actions, the Project Engineer is acting under the professional responsibility inherent in all actions as a representative of the department and as a Licensed Professional Engineer. Full accountability of such actions is expected. The scope of such actions should not exceed $20,000 for a single bid item, nor exceed $50,000 for an entire project. Approval above these dollar amounts requires approval from the State Materials Engineer or Assistant State Materials Engineer and the State Construction Office. The use of this process is to be implemented prior to work being performed and not to retroactively justify deficiencies discovered after the completion of work. The nature of the work to be accepted in this manner will generally be limited to minor and isolated items. Acceptance would typically involve dimensional conformance to the plans and a visual determination that the materials are suitable; however, the Project Engineer may require some testing or other means to support a decision. In such an action, the Project Engineer should be guided by the principle of achieving the intent of the contract, attaining reasonable expectations of service life proportional to cost, and protection of public safety. The changes in acceptance procedures will only be made to work occurring outside of vertical lines through the horizontal limits of the traveled way. Consideration should be given to the consequences of subsequent failure, ease of replacement, whether or not there is a high variability in the quality of similar work, or any other pertinent facts. Actions taken in accepting such materials should be identified in the project records with acknowledgment by signature of the Project Engineer, licensed as a Professional Engineer in the State of Washington.

9-1.1A Optional Approval/Acceptance for Materials The materials listed in Table 9-1 may be accepted by visual acceptance at the option of the Project Engineer. The Project Engineer’s Office can test or require additional documentation for any of the materials in this section if quality appears to be in question per Standard Specifications Section 1-06.1. Visual Acceptance requires Field Verification per Section 9-1.5, unless additional documentation is stipulated in the Contract Documents. The use of this process is to be implemented prior to work being performed and not to retroactively justify deficiencies discovered after the completion of work. The Project Engineer is allowed to approve the Request for Approval of Material (RAM). If there is a question on the quality or ability of the material to perform its intended use, it is the responsibility of the Project Engineer to determine if it is appropriate to accept the materials by visual acceptance or if additional acceptance testing or certification is required. This includes contacting the Headquarters or Region Subject Matter Expert for assistance in assessing whether additional acceptance testing or certification is required for a material. Other items can be considered for addition to this list. Suggestions are encouraged and may be made to the State Construction Office or the Materials Quality Assurance Engineer at the State Materials Laboratory. The “Buy America” requirements apply to all federally funded projects.

Control of Materials The succeeding parts of this chapter outline the detailed method to be used in the control of materials. The expenditure made for materials is a large portion of construction costs. If faulty materials are permitted to be incorporated into the project, the cost of replacement may exceed the original cost. Section 9-2 Materials Fabrication Inspection Office – Inspected Items Acceptance explains the process for the acceptance of fabricated items, and the types of Fabrication acceptance markings used to identify approved fabrication items. Section 9-3 Guidelines for Job Site Control of Materials provides the engineer with additional information to assist in determination of the point of acceptance for materials from WSDOT and Contractor sources, the basis of acceptance, verification sampling and testing, and the sampling and testing frequency guide. Section 9-4 Specific Requirements for each Material provides specific requirements about each material that includes the following information: 1. Approval of Material 2. Preliminary Samples 3. Acceptance or Acceptance/Verification 4. Field Inspection 5. Specification Requirements 6. Other Requirements
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.39

Materials
Section 9-5 Quality Assurance Program defines the requirements for the materials tester to become qualified. The requirements for the Independent Assurance Program are also included. Section 9-6 Radioactive Testing Devices explains policy on the administration of radioactive testing devices. Section 9-7 WSDOT Test Methods/Field Operating Procedures defines the testing procedures and lists the equipment that are used in the field. 9-1.2A Materials Management Computer Programs There is a series of material management computer programs that have been developed to aid the Project Engineer office’s in tracking, approving, accepting, and testing materials.
• Record of Materials (ROM) – A listing of the construction items that have been identified from the plans and specifications for each project. The ROM, which is organized by Bid Item - Sub Item, identifies the kinds and quantities of materials, the standard Acceptance Methods and the number of acceptance and verification samples required for each material that will be used on the project. It also lists the acceptance requirements for materials requiring other actions, such as fabrication inspection, manufacturer’s certificate of compliance, shop drawings or catalog cuts. The ROM is also used to track material deficiencies and has various reports available for tracking materials documentation. The ROM is not a payment or purchasing document.
• Aggregate Source Approval (ASA) – A program that tracks aggregate sources, approvals and expiration dates for the different aggregate material types that could be used on a construction project. This application is designed to allow the user to query the database for the intended source of aggregate to be used, determine if it is approved, and print the ASA report.
• Qualified Product List (QPL) – A program that lists products that have been found capable of meeting the requirements of the Standard Specifications or General Special Provisions under which they are listed and, therefore, have been “Approved.” These may be “Accepted” in the field by fulfilling the requirements of the Acceptance Code and any notes that apply to the product.
• Statistical Analysis of Materials (SAM) – A program that is used for the statistical acceptance of materials according to Standard Specifications Section 1-06. The testing data will be kept electronically for quality and compliance audits and for historical references. The program will generate the reports showing the composite pay factors and project totals.
• Materials Testing System (MATS) – A testing program where all materials testing will be recorded. This includes the testing performed at the State Materials Laboratory, the Region Materials Laboratory, and the project office acceptance testing. The program will generate the transmittal, provide for tracking the samples throughout the testing process, and automatically bills for the testing performed. The program will also provide a report detailing the test results, and distribute the reports according to the established distribution list.

Materials Forms A number of form letters have been prepared as an aid to the Project Engineer in transmitting information to the State Materials Laboratory. In order to minimize delays to completion of material testing, transmittal letters should include all the information that is pertinent to the sample in question. In order to assist the State Materials Laboratory, copies of the transmittal letters should be retained in the Project Engineers Office. The following is a list of the forms that may be used for transmittal of samples and/or information to the State Materials Laboratory:

Record of Materials The Record of Materials (ROM) is used to track material type, make/model, approval, acceptance, field verification documentation, Certificate of Materials Origin and other materials documentation. The ROM is organized by Bid Item – Sub Item and the program also tracks deficiencies and has various reports available for tracking documentation. The ROM is not a payment or purchasing document. The program is located at: http://webapps.wsdot.loc/Materials/Tracking The Construction Materials - Materials Quality Assurance Section (MQAS) uploads the initial materials and acceptance criteria into the ROM shortly after the contract is awarded. This initial listing of materials identifies the types and planned quantities for all materials requiring acceptance. It further identifies the minimum number of acceptance and verification samples that would be required based on the Summary of Quantities. The Project Office uses the ROM computer program to maintain the materials documentation information for each State Contract that is administered by that office except as follows. When the MQAS does not provide the initial upload of materials
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.39

Materials
acceptance into the ROM, the Project Office is not required to use the ROM computer program. When an initial materials and acceptance criteria is not uploaded into the ROM by the MQAS, the Project Engineer may request the MQAS to set up a blank ROM template for the Project Office to populate, track, and maintain permanently incorporated materials, or the Project Engineer may utilize other documentation methods to track and document permanently incorporated materials that are placed on the Contract. The Project Office utilizes the ROM program to track all permanently incorporated materials that are placed on the Contract. Temporary materials are also tracked in the ROM when the contract documents contain temporary material requirements. The Project Engineer is responsible for the accuracy of the ROM, other documentation methods used, and Certification of Materials. Acceptance requirements shown in the ROM can be modified by referencing the properly submitted QPL page or the approved Request for Approval of Materials. Reviewing the contract plans and provisions may identify additional materials documentation requirements as well as construction items that shall be added to the ROM and tracked for completion throughout the course of the project work. In order to ensure clarity upon completion of the work and to allow for easy certification of the project by both the Project Engineer and the Region, the ROM needs to be maintained throughout the course of the project. “Maintained” and “maintain” means the ROM is updated to reflect materials placed within 30 calendar days of the material payment. This includes material type, make/model, approval, acceptance, field verification documentation, Certificate of Materials Origin and other materials documentation. For materials used in the Contract, the Project Office is required to maintain the Status Work Completed (WC)/Documentation Complete (DC) /Not Used (NU) fields in the ROM. For materials that are listed in the ROM, but are not used in the project the WC, DC, and NU fields may be left blank in the ROM until the project work is complete, at which time all materials not used in the ROM need to have the “Not Used (NU)” status of work field completed. The Project Office is required to maintain quantities paid, quantities placed, quantities field verified for materials that have sampling frequencies, WSDOT Fabrications Inspection items, where the Acceptance Criteria requires quantities such as Manufacturer Certificate of Compliance, or when quantities are noted in the initial materials and acceptance criteria. Any changes to the acceptance requirements, additional permanently incorporated materials used, or any additional materials added to the project by Change Order or Force Account need to be documented and tracked either in the ROM or for Contracts that do not use the ROM program documented and tracked by other methods in the project records. A copy of the ROM Materials Documentation Report shall be included in the final records or if the ROM program is not used a copy of the documents used to track the above information shall be included in the final records. The Project Engineer is encouraged to contact the MQAS for assistance with questions on materials documentation requirements.

Certification of Materials Origin For Contracts Advertised Prior to January 11, 2016 Projects that include Federal funding, or any project defined in the Federal Record of Decision under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), must meet the requirements of “Buy America” (23 CFR 635.410, 23 USC 313). This provision, incorporated into the contract by General Special Provision, applies to all products containing steel or iron permanently incorporated into the project. The Contractor may choose to utilize minor quantities of foreign steel or iron, as described in the General Special Provision. Minor amounts of foreign steel and iron may be used in the project provided the cost of the foreign material used does not exceed one-tenth of one percent of the total contract cost or $2,500.00, whichever is greater. Included in this amount is state supplied materials, Proprietary items and Contractor provided materials. WSDOT makes a tracking sheet available as either a FileMaker form or an Excel spreadsheet at: http://sharedot/eng/cn/hqconstr/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootF older=%2Feng%2Fcn%2Fhqconstr%2FShared%20Documents%2FBuy%20America&F olderCTID=0x012000EC3BE7FA6C2AE7439BB67EED30CD322B&View=%7B5247 7B85-35C4-41E1-9B8E-53C8D6577A14%7D The “Buy America” provision applies to products that are manufactured predominately of steel and iron if the product consists of at least 90 percent steel or iron content when it is delivered to the jobsite for installation. The 90 percent is a percentage of the total monetary value of the manufactured product. To determine the 90 percent value, divide the raw steel or iron costs by the total manufactured product costs (without taxes, shipping, handling, or other fees applied), and if the percentage is equal to or greater than 90 percent of the final manufactured product costs, then the “Buy America” provision applies. Determining whether a product is a steel or iron manufactured product, the jobsite includes the locations where any precast concrete products are manufactured. For example, in the specific case of “precast concrete products,” the casting yard/facility is considered part of the “jobsite.” Therefore, the iron and steel materials delivered to the precast yard/facility are subject to the “Buy America” provision. The Contractor shall provide the completed and signed Certification of Materials Origin (CMO) to the Project Engineer prior to such items being incorporated into the permanent work. This certification may be supplied using DOT Form 350-109 or another form containing all the same information as required by DOT Form 350-109. It is the responsibility of the Project Engineer to ensure the CMO is on file prior to placing or paying for products that are made of steel or iron. CMOs for domestic steel or iron from fabricated inspected items will be retained by the fabrication inspection office. The exception is 30 inch diameter or less concrete pipe (see Sections 9-4.16 and 9-4.21). The Project Engineer is required to ensure these CMOs are on file prior to placement and payment.

Materials
In all cases, Certification of Materials Origin (CMO) must be completed and signed prior to incorporation of the steel or iron materials into the project. It is the responsibility of the Project Office to ensure that the CMO is on file prior to placing or paying for steel or iron materials, as defined below. Fabricated Items
• WSDOT Fabrications Inspection Offices will review the supporting documentation, i.e., Mill Certificates and CMOs prior to inspecting and Stamping/Tagging the fabricated material. The Fabricator/plant is required to supply the Fabrications Inspector the DOT Form 350-109 completed and signed with each item prior to inspection.
• The project field inspector is required to document in the IDR, QPL Contractor Product Information Page, or Field Note Record (FNR) prior to placement that the fabricated material is identified with a “D” – Domestic or “F” – Foreign per Section 9-1.5. Fabricated items bearing an “F” or not bearing any Stamp when delivered to the job site requires that the Project Engineer office obtain the DOT Form 350-109 from the Contractor and retain this form in the project records. Non-Fabricated Items
• The Project Office is required to obtain, and place in the materials file, a completed Certification of Materials Origin for any materials containing iron or steel. This certification may be supplied using DOT Form 350-109 or another form containing all the same information as required by DOT Form 350-109. In summary, if a CMO is required, the Project Office is responsible for obtaining and filing the CMO prior to placement of or payment for the material unless the material is a fabricated item with a “D” stamp documented in the file. Examples of products that are subject to “Buy America” provision include, but are not limited to the following:
• Steel or iron products used in pavements, bridges, tunnels or other structures, which include, but are not limited to the following: fabricated structural steel, reinforcing steel, piling, high strength bolts, anchor bolts, dowel bars, permanently incorporated sheet piling, bridge bearing, cable wire/strand, pre-stressing/post-tensioning wire, motor/machinery brakes and other equipment for moveable structures.

9-1.2F Project Material Certification The Project Engineer is responsible for obtaining all required materials documentation or otherwise ensuring that all required materials testing is completed, all with satisfactory results, prior to the materials being incorporated into the project. The Project Engineer is also responsible for maintaining a comprehensive accounting for the materials incorporated into the project in order to support the Region’s Certification of Materials. Managing and accounting for materials used in the construction of a project are to be administered in the same manner regardless of its funding source; Federal, State, or a combination of both. The Region is responsible for periodic reviews of each project’s materials documentation at the Project Engineer’s Office. Upon completion of the project the Region will prepare a Region Materials Certification letter listing all variances that were identified and their resolution. On projects that involve Federal participation where material deficiencies are documented, these deficiencies must be resolved with the State Construction Office through the Region before the Region Certification of Materials can be completed. On projects that involve State Funds only, documented deficiencies must be resolved with the Region prior to the Region Certification of Materials. The Regional Administrator or their designee is responsible for signing and distributing the certification letter. The State Materials Laboratory will also perform Construction Quality Audits on a sampling of active projects statewide where the materials have yet to be certified. 9-1.2F(1) (I)
Definitions
Certification
A Region Materials Certification based on a documented evaluation of the project’s materials inspection, sampling, testing, and other materials acceptance activities for their conformance to the contract documents, Standard Specifications, and this manual. The certification reflects the project’s conformance with the Record of Materials as adjusted by the Project Engineer for: 1. Actual project quantities utilized. 2. Acceptance practices as provided for in this chapter. 3. Adjusted sampling/testing frequencies as provided for in Section 9-3. 4. Work added by Change Order. (II)
Variance
An identified difference between the materials acceptance requirements noted in this manual, the contract documents, the Standard Specifications, and a review of the completed projects Record of Materials. All variances must be noted. Such notations must include the basis by which the material was accepted and how the requirements for that material were met. Any variance between the recognized acceptance requirements and the Project Engineer’s use of the material must be resolved with the Region, State Construction Office, and/or State Materials Laboratory, as appropriate.

9-1.2F(2) Project Material Certification Process The Project Engineer Office completes the Contract Materials Checklist (DOT Form 350-115) prior to Completion of Final Project Records. Any contract materials checklist items marked “No” constitute a Materials Certification deficiency. a. Each “No” requires the contract item number for the affected item to be shown along with an attachment to the Materials Checklist detailing the circumstances of use, the method used for acceptance of the material, the Project Engineer’s evaluation of the material, suitability for its application, and determination as to whether or not it may have met the specification in spite of the materials documentation oversite. b. If the project is federally funded, the Project Engineer should also include a recommendation for Federal participation in light of the use of undocumented materials. The Project Engineer Office submits the completed Contract Materials Checklist Form along with documentation of materials variances to the Construction Division Documentation Engineer The Construction Division Documentation Engineer will review the contract materials checklist variances and coordinates with FHWA to determine federal funding eligibility for variances. The Documentation Engineer will send a letter of resolution to Region identifying degree of federal participation on the project. An example of the Region Materials Certification letter and its distribution is available on the Construction SharePoint site.
9-1.3
Approval of Materials Prior to use, the Contractor must notify the engineer of all proposed materials to be permanently incorporated into the project in accordance with Standard Specifications Section 1-06.1. Some temporary items may require approval if required by the Contract Documents. This may be accomplished by a Qualified Product List (QPL) submittal or by submitting a Request for Approval of Material (RAM) DOT Form 350-071. When materials are approved, it does not necessarily constitute acceptance of the materials for incorporation into the work. All additional acceptance actions, as noted by the code on the RAM or QPL must be completed prior to the materials being used in the work. 9-1.3A Aggregate Source Approval and the Qualified Products List 9-1.3A(1) Aggregate Source Approval The State Materials Engineer establishes requirements for aggregate source sampling, testing and approval of aggregate sources in the Aggregate Source Approval (ASA) database. The ASA engineer at the State Materials Laboratory maintains and updates the

Chapter 9
ASA computer database, records source approvals, and coordinates with source owners and the Region materials engineers on sampling and testing for source approvals. The Region Materials Engineer, licensed as a Professional Engineer in the State of Washington, manages the aggregate sources in their region. This includes:
• Being the primary point of contact for privately owned aggregate sources located in their Region – This includes communication on approval, disapproval, discussion of test results, etc. The QPL/ASA Engineer is available to assist the Region Materials Engineer with arrangements for testing and payments required. Evaluation letters will be sent by the QPL/ASA Engineer to the aggregate source point of contact.
• Providing the recommended approval time or disapproval for privately owned aggregate source to the QPL/ASA Engineer – The length of approval time will not exceed 5 years and may be less than 5 years based upon the Region Materials Engineers determination of the quality of materials in the source. – For aggregate sources having variable quality, the Region Materials Engineer may have remarks added to the ASA database indicating that the aggregate source approval is on a stockpile basis. The Region Materials Engineer may approve these aggregate sources by either a stockpile(s) or on a project-by-project basis provided the aggregate source approval duration has not expired. – Can initiate and approve up to a 3 month extension of an aggregate source on a project-by-project basis for a WSDOT construction project as long as the extension is approved prior to the aggregate source/material expiration date. 9-1.3A(2)
Qualified Products List (QPL)
Products listed in the QPL have been found capable of meeting the requirements of the Standard Specifications, General Special Provision, Bridge Special Provision and Standard Plans under which they are listed and, therefore, have been “Approved.” These products may be “Accepted” by fulfilling the requirements of the Acceptance Code and any notes that apply to the product. If the Contractor elects to use the QPL, the most current list available at the time the product is proposed for use, shall be used. During the life of the Contract, acceptance methods for materials in the QPL may change, becoming more stringent or less stringent. The acceptance method detailed on the originally submitted QPL page will continue to be the acceptance method for the life of the contract, unless the Contractor submits a new QPL page for the material. This is the case regardless of whether the acceptance method becomes more stringent or less stringent. Instructions are given in the QPL for processing QPL submittals. Contractors and Project Offices are encouraged to use the QPL database for submittals. The QPL database is constantly updated with additions and/or deletions and can be accessed at https://www.wsdot. wa.gov/biz/mats/QPL/QPL_Search.cfm The Project Office shall review the material submittal for consistency with the Bid Item and shall promptly notify the Contractor of any concerns, working with the Contractor toward resolving these issues. QPL submittals inconsistent with the intended use for WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.39 
Page 9-19
Chapter 9
Materials
the Bid Item should be marked “unacceptable for intended use” and returned to the Contractor. Copies of QPL pages for materials that are to carry a WSDOT Fabrication Inspection “Stamp/Tag” or Sign Inspection “Decal” shall be forwarded to the WSDOT Headquarters Fabrication Inspection Office. 9-1.3B
Request for Approval of Material – Submittal The Contractor submits all Request for Approval of Materials (RAM) to the Project Office using the WSDOT RAM form DOT Form 350-071. The coding of the RAM is to determine if the proposed material on the RAM is capable of meeting the established standards and defining the material acceptance method. Acceptance determines if the material being placed on the contract meets the established standards. If a RAM is submitted with a material found on the QPL, the Project Office may code the RAM as defined in Section 9-1.3B(1). RAMs submitted by the Contractor that contain errors should be returned to the Contractor for correction. The Project Office needs to provide details to the Contractor on why the RAM is being returned, noting what needs to be corrected. The Project Office may elect to modify the RAM submitted by the Contractor to clarify minor errors. Any modifications by the Project Office to the Contractor’s submitted RAM shall have written documentation from the Contractor showing the Contractors request to modify the RAM, and contain the specific details that were missing in the original Contractor submittal. The written documentation from the Contractor shall be attached to the RAM that was modified. If a RAM is submitted with a material not identified under the Project Office Approval Coding (Section 9-1.3B(1)), the Project Office shall submit the RAM to the Construction Materials - Materials Quality Assurance Section for coding. The Project Engineer or delegated representative will sign, date, and code the items with a “7” –”Approval Pending” and forward it to the Materials Quality Assurance Section at MLRAM@wsdot.wa.gov. If the RAM is not filled out correctly it will be returned to the Project Office prior to any action being taken. A copy should also be returned to the Contractor at this point to inform them that the RAM has been sent to the Materials Quality Assurance Section for approval. Submit any additional documentation, including appropriate transmittals that may assist the RAM engineer in approving the proposed material; such as Test Reports, Catalog Cuts, Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance, etc. The page number of the Special Provision or Plan Sheet will also aid in expediting the approval process. The Materials Quality Assurance Section may elect to delegate approval of some specialty items. All RAMs shall be signed and dated by the Project Engineer and copies distributed as indicated at the bottom of the RAM form.

Project Engineer’s Office Approval Coding
QPL Reference Materials
The engineer may code the RAM if the product listed on the RAM is identified in the QPL by make, model, batch, color, size, part no., etc. The product must also be listed in the QPL under the appropriate Standard Specifications for the intended use as indicated by the Bid Item and Specification Reference shown on the RAM. The RAM should be coded with the 4-digit QPL acceptance code and any notes and/or restrictions restated as “Remarks” on the RAM. (II) Aggregates Aggregate Sources will be approved by consulting the Aggregate Source Approval database for the use intended. The Project Engineer shall approve the RAM, coding when there is a sampling frequency in Section 9-3.7 with a “1” – “Conditionally Approved: Acceptance based upon Satisfactory Test Report.” Aggregates that do not have a sampling frequency should be coded per requirements of the ASA database. Print the ASA Report and attach it to the approved RAM. The Region Materials Engineer may have added remarks to the ASA database for aggregate sources having variable quality. Contact the Region Materials Engineer prior to use. It has been demonstrated that some of these sources can provide quality material through diligent production and stockpile management. The Region Materials Engineer may approve these aggregate sources by the stockpile(s) or on a project-by-project basis. Review the approval date on the ASA Report to verify that the approval of the aggregate source has not expired or will not expire before the end of your contract. If the aggregate source is approved at the beginning of your project, it does not mean that it is approved for the duration of the project. If the aggregate source requires evaluation, contact the Region materials office for further direction. If samples are required, the Region materials office will coordinate with the Materials Quality Assurance Section QPL/ASA Engineer to obtain the necessary samples in accordance with SOP 128. The remarks in the ASA Report also need to be reviewed to make sure that there are no additional requirements or restrictions on the material that you intend to use. If you are using concrete aggregate, review the ASR values to see if ASR mitigation is required for the concrete mix design. (III)
Optional Approval/Acceptance
The Project Engineer may elect to approve some materials by invoking Section 9-1.1D. This process allows the Project Engineer to approve the RAM. The PE needs to verify the material being approved meets the requirements listed and is for the same specifications as the material listed in Section 9-1.1D. After verifying concurrence with Section 9-1.1D, the Project Engineer shall approve the RAM, coding with an “8 – Approved per CM Section 9-1.1D.”

Proprietary Materials
Where the Contract Documents state “shall be…” and list products by specific name and model, the Contractor needs only to complete the RAM indicating to the engineer the intended choice. The engineer shall approve the RAM, coding with an “8” – “Source Approved” and note the page number where it is listed in the Contract Documents as a proprietary product. Occasionally proprietary materials will have additional acceptance criteria and these criteria need to be noted on the RAM. On occasion the Subject Matter Expert for the material being placed may ask for additional documentation. The “Buy America” requirements apply to Proprietary materials used on all federally funded projects. The “Buy America” requirements should be addressed by the Designer prior to including the material into the Contract Special Provisions. Ultimately it is the responsibility of the Project Engineer to verify that the requirements are met. (V) Agency Supplied Materials An approved RAM is not required for Agency Supplied Materials. If a RAM is submitted to the PEO, the engineer shall approve the RAM, coding with an “8” – “Source Approved” and note the page number where it is listed in the Contract Documents as an Agency Supplied Material. Additional acceptance criteria may be required by the Contract Special Provisions or Plans. The “Buy America” requirements apply to Agency Supplied materials used on all federally funded projects. The “Buy America” requirements should be addressed by the Designer prior to including the material into the Contract Special Provisions. Ultimately it is the responsibility of the Project Engineer to verify that the requirements are met. (VI)
Concrete and Asphalt Batch Plants
For Concrete Batch Plants, the Project Engineer office shall ensure requirements of Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(4)A are met prior to approving the RAM. For Asphalt Mixing Plants, the Project Engineer office shall ensure requirement of Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(1) are met. There is no approval on the RAM required for Asphalt Mixing Plants, however coding the RAM with an “8” – “Source Approved” would be appropriate. (VII)
Recycle Materials for Aggregate
Requirements for recycled materials in aggregates are described in Standard Specifications Section 9-03.21 which applies to recycled hot mix asphalt, recycled concrete aggregate, glass aggregates and steel furnace slag. The Project Engineer is required to verify that recycled material imported to the job site is not classified as a Dangerous Waste per the Dangerous Waste Regulations WAC 173-303. Recycled materials obtained from the Contracting Agency’s roadways will not require testing and certification for toxicity testing or certification for toxicity characteristics. The Project Engineer needs to do the following in order to determine and document the recycled material is not classified as a Dangerous Waste and is acceptable for use on a WSDOT project: Page 9-22
WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01.39 
Materials
Chapter 9
• Have the Contractor provide documentation identifying what recycled materials the Contractor is proposing to use and sampling documentation.
• Have the Contractor provide testing information from representative samples of the recycled material and check to ensure the recycled material is below the Maximum Concentration of Contaminates for the Toxicity Characteristics in the Toxicity Characteristics List in WAC 173-303-090.
• Have the Contractor certify that the recycled material is not a Washington State Dangerous Waste per WAC 173-303. The Project Engineer can contact the WSDOT Hazardous Materials Program to help evaluate sample approach, lab results, help in determining if changes in the recycled material warrant additional testing, or other assistance as needed. The Hazardous Material Program can be reached at 360-570-6656. The Contractor is required to do sampling and testing for toxicity of the recycled material at the frequency specified in Standard Specifications Section 9-03.21(1) prior to combining with other materials and not less than one sample and test from any single source. If the Project Engineer suspects the recycled material may be contaminated based on a change in odor, appearance, or knowledge of the source of material, the WSDOT Hazardous Materials Program should be contacted to determine if a verification sample should be tested for toxicity. Sample results are expected to exhibit the average properties of the stockpile of material being proposed for use. The final blended product shall meet the acceptance requirements for the specified type of aggregate. Once it has been determined that the recycled material is not classified as a Dangerous Waste the Project Engineer shall code the RAM either as an “8” Source Approved or as a “9” Submit samples for preliminary evaluation depending on what type of aggregate material the recycled material is being proposed for. The RAM should be coded with an “8 & 1” and noted as “certification and acceptance testing per Standard Specifications Section 9-03.21” in the remark field for the following aggregate materials; Section 9-03.8 Aggregates for Hot Mix Asphalt (recycle HMA only), Section 9-03.10 Aggregate for Gravel Base, Section 9-03.12(1)B Gravel Backfill for Foundations Class B, Section 9-03.12(2) Gravel Backfill for Walls, Section 9-03.12(3) Gravel Backfill for Pipe Zone Bedding, Section 9-03.12(4) Gravel Backfill for Drains, Section 9-03.12(5) Gravel Backfill for Drywells, Section 9-03.13 Backfill for Drains, Section 9-03.13(1) Sand Drainage Blanket, Section 9-03.14(1) Gravel Borrow, and Section 9-03.14(2) Select Borrow. The RAM should be coded with a “9” and noted “source properties evaluation and indicate the standard specification being proposed” in the remarks field for the following aggregate materials; Section 9-03.8 Aggregates for Hot Mix Asphalt (recycle steel furnace slag only), Section 9-03.9(1) Ballast, Section 9-03.9(2) Permeable Ballast, Section 9-03.9(3) Crush Surfacing, Section 9-03.12(1)A Gravel Backfill for Foundations Class A, and Section 9-13.1 Riprap and Quarry Spalls. Include copies of the toxicity tests results with the preliminary sample that is submitted to the State Materials Laboratory for evaluation of source properties.

Materials
Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1695 requires the use of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) in the amount of 25 percent on all WSDOT projects. This requirement only applies to those materials listed in Standard Specification Section 9-03.21 table that allow the use of RCA, see Section SS 1-06.6. To encourage and streamline the use or RCA on WSDOT projects the State Materials Laboratory developed quality control plans for RCA. There are three tiers of quality for RCA;
• Tier 1 pertains to those aggregate materials that do not require preliminary testing for source property requirements such as LA Wear, WSDOT Degradation, and Specific Gravity and applies to Standard Specifications Sections 9-03.10 Aggregates for Gravel Base, 9-03.12(1)B Gravel Backfill for Foundations Class B, 9-03.12(2) Gravel Backfill for Walls, 9-03.12(3) Gravel Backfill for Pipe Zone Bedding, 9-03.14(1) Gravel Borrow, 9-03.14(2) Select Borrow, 9-03.14(2) Select Borrow (greater than 3 feet below subgrade and side slope), 9-03.14(3) Common Borrow, 9-03.14(3) Common Borrow (greater than 3 feet below subgrade and side slope), 9-03.17 Foundation Material Class A and Class B, 9-03.18 Foundation Material Class C, and 9-03.19 Bank Run Gravel for Trench Backfill. See Section 9-4.11 for approval and acceptance requirements.
• Tier 2 pertains to RCA from WSDOT projects and returned concrete. Returned concrete is concrete that was returned to the concrete plant that was produced from a WSDOT approved aggregate source. For a reclamation facility to participate in Tier 2 the reclamation facility must be compliant with WSDOT Standard Practice QC 9 “Standard Practice for Approval of Reclamation Facilities for WSDOT Recycled Concrete and Returned Concrete”. See Section 9-4.11 for approval and acceptance requirements.
• Tier 3 pertains to RCA from stockpiles of unknown sources. For reclamation facility to participate in Tier 3 the reclamation facility must be compliant with WSDOT Standard Practice QC 10 “Standard Practice for Approval of Recycled Materials Facilities from Stockpiles of Unknown Sources” See Section 9-4.11 for approval and acceptance requirements. Reclamation facilities that are compliant with WSDOT’s quality control plans will be listed on the QPL under Standard Specifications Section 9-03.21(1)B. (VIII)
Preliminary Evaluation Samples
The Project Engineer may elect to approve some materials by submitting samples for testing by coding the RAM with a “9” –“Submit Samples for Preliminary Evaluation.” This authority is applicable only to the materials that the State Materials Laboratory is capable of testing. The Project Office shall review the established specifications and contract documents for compliance prior to submitting the sample for testing. The Project Engineer can contact the State Materials Laboratory if assistance is needed to determine their testing capabilities. The State Materials Laboratory can be reached at 360-709-5400.

Acceptance Methods for Materials Materials acceptance is accomplished by several different methods. Once a material is approved and has demonstrated the ability to meet the applicable specification, a proper method of acceptance is determined for that type of product. The approved Request for Approval of Material or submitted Qualified Product List page will state the acceptance method. Types of Acceptance methods are Sampling and Testing, WSDOT Fabrications Inspection, Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance, Miscellaneous Certificates of Compliance, Shop Drawings, Catalog Cuts, Optional Approval/Acceptance for Materials, Visual Acceptance or Reduced Acceptance Criteria. Sampling and testing is the highest level of acceptance method showing conformance to the requirements. All designated acceptance documentation is to be approved and retained prior to material being placed except for verification samples and Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance within the restraints of Standard Specifications Section 1-06.3. 9-1.4A Testing Project Engineer offices are responsible for tracking the acceptance/verification tests performed on their contracts. Refer to Standard Specifications Section 1-06.2(1) and this chapter for testing criteria and frequency information. This chapter also includes a large variety of test procedures that may be performed in the field office lab or at the jobsite by a qualified tester. All testers shall be qualified to perform sampling/testing for those acceptance tests found in the Construction Manual M 41-01. 9-1.4A(1)
Reference Test Report
When a Satisfactory Test Report is required, a Reference Test Report may be used if allowed in Section 9-4 for that specific material. A Reference Test Report as listed below will not be allowed for HMA Mix Designs or other materials unless allowed per Section 9-4. A Reference Test Report shall consist of a printed copy of the current electronic QPL database page showing “referenced” lots previously tested during the current calendar year. The lot number in the QPL must match the lot number of the material used. The information will be listed in the “description” field for specific materials in the QPL. The QPL page used as the “Reference Test Report” shall be within the same calendar year that the material is used on the project. The QPL page must reflect the same specification as the material to be used and be received prior to installation of the intended material. The use of a test report from another contract is not acceptable as a Reference Test Report.

Statistical Acceptance With SAM
The Statistical Analysis of Materials program (SAM) has been developed to calculate the percent within limits of materials being statistically accepted per Standard Specifications Section 1-06.2(2). When the test results for at least three samples has been entered, the program will calculate the percent within limits based on the upper and lower acceptance limits, calculate the pay factor for each, and calculate the composite pay factor (CPF) for the material being evaluated. (I)
Initial Material Set-up
When a contract requires statistical analysis to be used, the “lot” acceptance criteria for the material needs to be entered into SAM. A lot is defined as 15 sublots; the final lot may be increased to 25 sublots. All samples from a material type, i.e., gravel backfill for walls, mineral aggregate, concrete aggregate, or CSBC shall be evaluated collectively. For paving concrete, each class of mix shall be evaluated collectively. For hot mix asphalt, each job mix formula, and all changes to that job mix formula shall be evaluated collectively. Make sure that this information is correct. Once test data has been entered, the lot acceptance criteria cannot be altered. There are three ways to establish the lot acceptance criteria: 1. Select the material. The appropriate specifications will be automatically retrieved. 2. For HMA, you can enter the mix design number, and the JMF, the acceptance specifications, the tolerances, price adjustment factors, and the upper and lower acceptance limits will be automatically retrieved. 3. Pick User Define and you will be able to add new requirements, or edit existing requirements. For HMA, make sure that you calculate the upper and lower acceptance criteria based on the tolerance limits. If there is a change to the HMA job mix formula, (JMF), the program allows you to copy existing lots. The original mix design and a “-1, -2, -3…” number is added, and you are allowed to edit the JMF. These JMF’s will be evaluated collectively. It is important to delete lots that are not used from the program. The statistical acceptance results are used by other programs to evaluate the material. (II)
Inputting Test Results
Once the testing has been completed, the test results need to be entered into the program for the material being tested as soon as possible. Once the office starts using the Materials Testing Program for the field testing, the test results will be retrieved into the statistical program. (III)
Review Work
As with all materials documentation, this information entered into the statistical program needs to be reviewed regularly to make sure that there are no mistakes. If an error has been found in the test data, the original data can be revised. If an error has been found in the lot acceptance criteria, all of the test data will have to be deleted and re-entered under the new lot. Page 9-28

Contractor Access
The PEO documentation engineer will give the contractor access to the statistical program. This will allow the contractor access to the statistical program for the work order they are working on to view the acceptance results. They will not be able to change the lot acceptance criteria or any test results. They will be able to access the acceptance portion of the program, and view the gradation report, the compaction report, and the contract detail report. 9-1.4B
Fabricated Items
9-1.4B(1)
Stamp/Tag
Items that are inspected and found to meet contract document requirements by the WSDOT Materials Fabrication Inspection Office are identified by a Stamp or Tag. This type of inspection is generally performed at the manufacturing or fabrication plants. There are various types of Stamps or Tags used for acceptance of inspected items, which attest that the item was in full conformance with the specifications at the time of inspection. The inspected items, along with the type of Stamp or Tag designation, are covered under Section 9-2. It is the responsibility of the Project Engineer office to notify the WSDOT Materials Fabrication Inspection Office when their inspection services are needed by sending a ‘cc’ of the approved RAM or submitted QPL page to WSDOT Fabrications at fabinspect@wsdot.wa.gov. The Contractor or the Fabricator may also contact the WSDOT Materials Fabrication Inspection Office for needed inspection.

Pipe Acceptance Report The WSDOT Materials Fabrication inspection Office periodically inspects and witnesses testing of concrete pipe less than 30 in in diameter at approved fabricators. During this inspection, samples of each type, size, and class of pipe are inspected and tested to verify compliance with the Standard Specifications. For a 90-day period from the date of manufacture, concrete pipe less than 30 in in diameter may be shipped and accepted based on “Concrete Pipe Acceptance Reports.” The concrete pipe that ships must be at the age or older than the concrete pipe tested and represented by the Concrete Pipe Acceptance Report. This report is prepared by the Materials Fabrication Inspector and copies are thereafter supplied by the fabricator to accompany each shipment of pipe. All documentation associated with inspection and acceptance of concrete pipe, and the Concrete Pipe Acceptance Report will be kept at the point of manufacture.

Guidelines for Job Site Control of Materials
9-3.1
General The intent of sampling and testing is to ensure that the material provided to the project conforms to the specifications. The frequency schedule in Section 9-3.7 covers the minimum requirements for sampling and testing at the project level. The Project Engineer is responsible for obtaining the number of samples necessary to ensure adequate control of the material being produced under the circumstances and conditions of the particular project. There may be cases where production is just getting under way, where source material is variable or marginal in quality. Also operations from commercial sources when small lots of material are being sampled (as for barge loads of aggregate) or when stockpiles are built and depleted may require more frequent sampling and testing. A minimum of one acceptance test is required unless the Project Engineer reduces materials acceptance per Section 9-1.1. When in doubt as to sampling requirements, refer to Record of Materials (ROM), Request for Approval of Material (RAM), and Section 9-4. In some instances, items usually sampled by project engineers representative may be sampled and tested by representatives of the State Materials Laboratory or other representatives. Such items as shown in this chapter, when properly identified with an “APPROVED FOR SHIPMENT” Tag, may be accepted for use by the Project Engineer without any further sampling or testing.

Sample Types 9-3.2A Preliminary Samples and Tests Preliminary samples are intended to show the general character of the materials available or proposed for use. The sample may be taken from a natural deposit, the general stock of a dealer, or elsewhere. The material sampled may require further treatment before it will meet the specification requirements. Preliminary samples are a basis for approving which aggregate site or brand of material will be considered for use. Deliveries cannot be accepted on the basis of preliminary samples unless the samples represent an identified lot of materials. Unless specified for a particular purpose, preliminary sampling and testing of materials from a potential source are not mandatory functions. It is to be performed when requested by the Project Engineer, Region Materials Engineer or the State Materials Laboratory on the Request for Approval of Material DOT Form 350-071. 9-3.2A(1)
Sampling and Testing for Aggregate Source Approval
A pit or quarry source owner may contact the State ASA Engineer directly to request an ASA source approval and will pay all sampling and testing charges. If the Region or project offices elect to sample a pit or quarry for source approval for a project and this is paid by project funds, the samples will have to be obtained by the Region Materials Engineer’s designated representative according to WSDOT SOP 128 and include all of the required documentation. 9-3.2A(2)
Sampling and Testing for Preliminary Hot Mix Asphalt Mix Design
These samples are used to determine if the aggregate source is capable of meeting the mix design specification requirements. Preliminary samples shall be taken in accordance with WSDOT FOP for AASHTO R 90 and consist of a minimum of 200 pounds of mineral material. Contact the Region materials office if preliminary samples are required. Give full details of type of construction proposed. 9-3.2B Acceptance Samples and Tests Acceptance samples and tests are defined as those samples tested for determining the quality, acceptability, and workmanship of the materials prior to incorporating the materials into the project. The results of these tests are used to determine conformance to the contract requirements. The minimum frequency for sampling and testing of acceptance samples is detailed in Section 9-3.7. The Code of Federal Regulations, 49 CFR, has listed certain materials to be hazardous. When shipping hazardous materials using a common carrier, i.e. UPS or Fed Ex, the USDOT and the carrier have special requirements that need to be followed. The following is a list of hazardous materials that we commonly sample and test on our projects; paint, epoxy part B, pigmented sealer, form release oil, and polyester resin. When these materials or other hazardous materials need to be sent for testing, contact the Region Materials Laboratory for shipping instructions. The Region Materials Laboratory needs to contact the shipper for proper shipping requirements. Page 9-40

Verification Samples and Tests Verification samples and tests are used for verifying the reliability of a manufacturers test results when acceptance of the material is based upon a Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance. In the event of a failing verification test, the Project Engineer office will be notified by the State Materials Laboratory or the State Construction Office. The Project Office needs to verify whether the material has been used. If the material was used, the Project Engineer office shall contact the State Construction Office which will coordinate with the State Materials Engineer or Assistant State Materials Engineer to determine the appropriate action.
9-3.3
Test Numbering A separate series of numbers, starting with “No. 1” in each instance, shall be used for acceptance, independent assurance, and verification samples for each type of material for which there is a separate bid item. Verification samples shall be referenced to the corresponding Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance.
9-3.4
Point of Acceptance 9-3.4A State Owned Source Material produced from a State owned source may be accepted either as it is placed into stockpile or as it is placed in hauling vehicles for delivery to the roadway. The sampling and testing frequency during stockpiling shall be in conformance with Section 9-3.7. 9-3.4B
Contractor’s Source If stockpiled material is set aside exclusively for use on WSDOT projects it may be accepted the same as a state-owned source. If stockpiles are constructed for general use, materials for WSDOT projects shall be tested for acceptance from samples taken by the Project Engineer representative in accordance with WSDOT FOP for AASHTO T 2. The engineer will determine the exact point of acceptance. If an existing stockpile was built without acceptance testing during material production, and later set aside exclusively for use on state projects, the material may be accepted with satisfactory test results from samples taken by the Project Engineer representative in accordance with WSDOT FOP for AASHTO T 2. The sampling and testing frequency shall conform to Section 9-3.7.

Basis for Acceptance The basis of acceptance of Hot Mix Asphalt is by statistical or visual evaluation. The basis of acceptance of aggregate is by statistical or non-statistical evaluation. The method to be used is specified in the Standard Specifications or Contract Documents. 9-3.5A Basis for Acceptance – Statistical Evaluation For materials being accepted using statistical evaluation procedures, random samples will be evaluated to determine quality level within a defined tolerance band. Acceptance, bonus, and disincentive procedures are defined in the contract documents. Test results with acknowledged errors or equipment deficiencies are to be immediately discarded without recourse and another sample run. 9-3.5A(1)
Contractor HMA Retest
Test results for Hot Mix Asphalt may be retested at the request of the Contractor, as defined in the Standard Specifications Section 5-04.3(9)B7. This specification allows the Contractor to request a retest of any sublot, provided the request is submitted in writing and within seven calendar days after the specified test results have been posted to a WSDOT website. A split of the original acceptance sample must be tested utilizing different equipment and a different qualified tester. It is therefore necessary that a split of every field sample (i.e., opposite quarter from acceptance test) be saved in a secure area, accurately marked, and be available for retesting if necessary. The specification requires that the retesting be performed in the Region Materials Laboratory or the State Materials Laboratory. When the Contractor requests a retest, it is expected that the split sample be sent and tested as quickly as possible. This will require that testing of these samples be prioritized. By expediting the retest, problems that may exist in testing or with the material being produced can be identified and corrected, lessening the impact to both the Contractor and WSDOT. 9-3.5B
Basis for Acceptance – Non-Statistical Evaluation
9-3.5B(2) Aggregate When the test results for aggregate that are accepted by non-statistical evaluation fall outside the specification limits, the aggregate will be statistically evaluated according to the Standard Specifications Section 3-04.3(5). For materials that do not meet specifications, the Project Engineer office shall contact the State Construction Office which will coordinate with the State Materials Engineer or Assistant State Materials Engineer to determine the appropriate action.

9-3.5C Basis for Acceptance – Performance Graded Asphalt Binder and Emulsified Asphalt The basis for acceptance of asphalt binder and emulsified asphalts is compliance with existing specifications as modified to include the tolerance as follows: 1. If a binder or emulsified asphalt sample fails to meet the required specifications, the binder or emulsified asphalt samples prior to and subsequent to the failed sample will be tested. Samples of asphalt binder or emulsified asphalt will continue to be tested until samples taken both prior to and subsequent to the failing samples meet the specifications. 2. If a binder or emulsified asphalt sample does not meet the specifications but is not more than 10 percent outside the specification limits and the binder or emulsified asphalt sample prior to and subsequent to the out of specification binder or emulsified asphalt both meet the specifications, there will be no price adjustment. 3. If the binder or emulsified asphalt sample is more than 10 percent out of specification or if the binder or emulsified asphalt sample is less than 10 percent out of specification and the binder or emulsified asphalt sample prior to or subsequent to the out of specification sample does not meet the specifications, the HMA or emulsified asphalt will be rejected.

Note 1 Mix design conformation samples shall be submitted to the State Materials Laboratory Bituminous Materials Section. For all projects, beginning with the first Acceptance sample, submit one sample (two representative quarters) every 10,000 mix tons. The conformation samples should be taken in conjunction with and be representative quarters of the acceptance samples taken for the project as described in FOP for AASHTO R47. Note 2 The first sample of asphalt binder will be taken with the second Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) mix sample. Note 3 The frequency for fine, course, and combined concrete aggregate samples for CC Paving and CC Structures shall be based on the cubic yard (CY) of concrete. Note 4 Sample the first truck, and each load until loads meet specifications, and then randomly test one load for every 100 CY. If at any time one load fails to meet specifications, continue testing every load until two successive loads meet specifications, and then randomly test one load for every 100 CY. Note 5 For materials placed in a non-structural application outside the roadway prism such as slope flattening or shoulder dressing, acceptance for compaction may be based on visual inspection to the satisfaction of the engineer. Note 6 The gravel borrow for structural earth walls shall be tested for Los Angeles Wear and Degradation prior to placement and the test data may come from an approved source in the aggregate source approval database. For geosynthetic reinforcement, the gravel borrow shall be tested for pH prior to placement. For metallic reinforcement, the gravel borrow shall be tested for pH, resistivity, chlorides, and sulfates prior to placement. If the resistivity of the backfill material equals or exceeds 5,000 ohm-cm, the specified chloride and sulfate limits may be waived. If the aggregate source has variable quality, additional testing may be required. Contact the Regional Materials Engineer or the State Geotechnical Engineer for direction. Note 7 The following concrete applications shall be accepted based on a Certificate of Compliance in accordance with Standard Specification Section 6-02.3(5)B and sampling and testing of the aggregate is not required;
