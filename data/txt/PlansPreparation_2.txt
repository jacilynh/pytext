Legal Descriptions

200.01
The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) prepares a variety of survey records as required by state law. Many of the survey records support the locations of state highways, sundry sites, ferry terminals, railroads, airports, and other WSDOT assets.
The documents include Records of Surveys, Monumentation Maps, State Land
Plats, Department of Natural Resources (DNR) monument removal permits, and legal descriptions. Note: Land Corner Records, as required by RCW 58.09.040, are excluded from this section at this time.
The following sections provide details for the preparation of survey records. 200.02
Record of Survey
A Record of Survey (ROS) is the foundation document for state highway right of way alignment and related boundaries. A Record of Survey may also be prepared when locating the boundaries of other state-owned properties for public and state use. These documents will be used as a basis for existing and proposed right of way centerline alignments and other agency capital improvement projects. The Record of Survey maps may be referred to in legal instruments and are permanently recorded at the county auditor's office in the county in which the survey exists.
Copies should also be retained at the WSDOT Headquarters (HQ) and DNR in Olympia.
A Record of Survey is not required on all projects. Many safety and surface treatment projects neither revise highway alignments nor require boundary determinations. The Project Manager must consult with the region Cadastral Engineer or region surveyor to determine the impact, if any, to survey monuments within and adjacent to the work zone. WSDOT has a responsibility to protect and preserve existing survey monumentation (RCW 58.09.130). Refer to Exhibit 2-1 to help determine when a survey document is to be prepared.
The Record of Survey is intended to be a “stand-alone” document. To obtain this “stand-alone” status, follow the guidelines below.

If it has been determined that a survey is necessary, it is the responsibility of the region to assemble data and prepare a Record of Survey for locating and defining the centerline alignment in its mathematical position within the Public Land Survey System. The Record of Survey is prepared to the specifications of RCW 58.09, WAC 332-130, and specific WSDOT and county codes or guidelines.

Division 2
Survey Records 200.02(3) English Units Only
Records of Survey are to be prepared in English U.S. Survey feet only. 200.02(4) Alignment
The R/W centerline, from which the right of way is to be legally described, is shown as a continuous solid line for the full length of the project, with its alignment data shown. If the R/W centerline is being retraced and the alignment data varies from plan data, both original and retraced alignment data is shown. This will provide a more complete understanding of the differences between the plan and retraced centerline. In those instances where the existing and proposed centerline alignments may be graphically shown, the existing alignment will be shown with a different line type than the proposed centerline (solid line).
In those instances where stationing does not run in the same direction as mileposts, or other right of way oddities are noted that do not conform to the current Right of Way Plan standards and a new Right of Way Plan is to be prepared, additional sheets will be added showing the revised alignment and any changes. The additional sheets will reverse the direction of stationing to have both the stationing and mileposts running congruently and provide a basis to bring the
Right of Way Plans into conformance, per Division 1 of the Plans Preparation Manual (see
Exhibits 2-2a and 2-2b).
The existing stationing shall be tied to the new centerline stationing by station and/or bearing equations. The new Right of Way stationing shall be tied to all section and quarter-section lines where such corners have been found. A computed tie from an existing Record of Survey showing the breakdown of the sections is acceptable. A reference to the survey used shall be noted on the new Record of Survey.
R/W width data should not be shown on the Record of Survey. Caution is advised as right of way limits have dynamic characteristics, whereas the right of way centerline is a more stable entity.
For projects proposing to acquire additional rights of way, it is suggested to show the centerline only.

200.02(5) Control Features
Where such features exist, the Record of Survey shall show, but is not limited to: GPS network points, government subdivision corners, platted subdivisions, donation land claims, national park or forest boundaries, Indian reservations, farm units, and property corners. Show a minimum of two bearing and distance ties from the new R/W centerline, with stations noted to an existing and recorded monument of a government subdivision corner, particularly the monuments from which the title reports originate. 200.02(6) Survey Report
A Survey Report is a summary of all the main elements that were used to generate the Record of
Survey or other survey documents. The purpose of the Survey Report is to provide documentation of the controlling elements of decisions made throughout the project. A
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 2-3 Survey Records
Division 2 separate file folder should be kept with the project folder summarizing those elements. This
Survey Report will become the basis of the Narrative, which may be placed on the Record of
Survey or Monumentation Map.
A Survey Report is not required as part of the preparation of a Record of Survey. However, it is highly recommended that such a report be prepared in the event a question ever arises regarding the survey, so that an answer may be determined by the surveyor (or another if the surveyor is not available).
A copy of the Survey Report shall be archived in the Survey/_SurveyDoc folder of the Standard
CAE Project folder structure. This will ensure all survey documentation regarding alignment decisions, datums, control monuments, secondary control monuments, and other relevant information is available to current and future users of the plans.
Documentation should include, but not be limited to: • Horizontal and vertical datums identified. • Horizontal and vertical control points identified. • Control network points identified with a sketch. • Sketches and/or photos of control points. • State Plane Coordinates (SPC) to Project Datum worksheets. • List of Records of Survey/Land Corner Records, RR maps, and other reference material. • List of WSDOT Right of Way Plans. • List of deeds and other property rights documents. • Sketches and/or photos of alignment monuments. • Monuments identified as potential disturbance to project. • Summary of all General Land Office (GLO) monuments held or rejected, with supporting evidence. • Sketches of conflicting information supporting decisions. • Summaries of key determinations critical to resolution of alignments. • Basis of Bearings monuments identified. • Basis of Stationing identified.

200.02(7)
Narrative
The Narrative is an optional explanation added to the Record of Survey. The purpose of the
Narrative is to provide additional explanation of how final determinations were made, which may be difficult to show graphically. Circumstances may dictate whether a Narrative is to be written, but it is recommended that one be prepared for all surveys.

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 2
Survey Records 200.02(8) Record of Survey Details (a) Record of Survey Map Requirements
A Record of Survey may be signed only by a Professional Land Surveyor. One of the main purposes of a Record of Survey is to define ownership boundaries or baselines from which real property boundaries are defined. According to the definitions given in RCW 18.43.020, this task falls under the practice of land surveying.
The Washington Administrative Code requires that all Records of Survey meet a minimum standard (see WAC 332-130-050 for a complete list of requirements). This standard not only defines the size of the sheet and minimum text heights, it also includes information regarding professional certification and archiving data. All Records of Survey are to be recorded with the county auditor’s office. Certain counties may have delegated this action to another office, such as the county surveyor’s office, so check with each county to find out where this document is to be recorded. There is a recording fee that accompanies the document. This fee varies from county to county.
A checklist has been prepared (see Exhibit 2-3) to help preparers ensure they include the minimum requirements for recording this document. It is not an all-inclusive list, as additional notes and information may be added to help with the interpretation and understanding of the survey and its purpose. (b) Record of Survey Map Requirements (WSDOT Recommendations)
Records of Survey prepared for WSDOT have multiple purposes and are used by a variety of departments and offices. It is not uncommon for a Record of Survey to be a very pertinent document several years after its completion. To coordinate the variety of uses and potential time span involved, a few standards have been introduced to define the purpose of the survey, with additional data to provide for a consistent interpretation of the document.
Some of the additional requirements are to help archive and allow easy retrieval of the document. Others are to help with a consistent interpretation after time has elapsed and allow the user to follow or understand differences discovered while performing the survey. This will be especially helpful if the surveyor or the surveyor’s records are not available to answer or resolve questions.

200.02(9) Coordinates: Maps Showing Control Network Scheme Required (RCW 58.09.070) (a) If a Record of Survey displays Washington State Plane Coordinates (SPCs), it must have a control network schematic identifying the network used to control the survey. (b) Use a control network scheme diagram to show how the SPCs were determined from the known base points (see Exhibit 2-4). A statement such as “the WSRN network was used” is acceptable if it includes the base stations and calibration points used. Base stations vary in reliability, so a statement regarding which base stations were used is necessary for repeatability.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 2-5 Survey Records
Division 2 (c) Datum defined: RCW 58.20.120 states that the Washington Coordinate System of 1983 is the designated coordinate system in Washington. • WAC 332-130-060 and WAC 332-130-070 defines the use of the datum tag and epoch date to be reported (i.e., NAD83 (CORS) (2002.00)) • As adjustments by National Geodetic Survey (NGS) to the North American Datum (NAD) of 1983 continue to refine the geoid model, it is important to note which datum is being used. In order to prevent datum crossovers or mixing of datums, the adjustment year must be indicated on the Record of Survey. (d) Except in remote locations or on extremely small-scale projects, project datum coordinates will be used to produce the Record of Survey. A table or worksheet showing the calculations converting SPCs to project datum coordinates is provided and kept with the Survey Report file. 200.02(10)
Recording Coordinates
When reference has been made to State Plane Coordinates, the scale, elevation, and combined factors shall be stated for the survey lines used in computing ground distances and areas (see
Exhibit 2-4). These factors should become the basis for coordinating all mapping and data conversion processes for that specific project. 200.02(11)
Drawing Standards
All Records of Survey are to be prepared with English units, with Bentley MicroStation using the
WSDOT Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) Expanded Level environment. Consistent drafting procedures must be observed to attain maximum accuracy and clarity. Line weights, symbols, and text fonts and sizes are to conform to the standards shown in the Electronic Engineering
Data Standards (EEDS) manual. No text shall have a line running through it.

200.02(12)
Equipment and Procedures Used (WAC 332-130-100) • Equipment used • Procedures used • GLO history for corners
A statement identifying the type of equipment and procedure used shall be placed on the
Record of Survey. This note may be included in the Narrative or be a separate note on the sheet.
All GLO corners shown as found will identify which Record of Survey (ROS) or Land Corner
Record (LCR) references the monument found. If a GLO monument is found that is not noted on a previous ROS, then a Land Corner Record shall also be prepared. 200.02(13)
Metric Equivalent
Conversion to U.S. Survey Foot shall use 1 meter = 39.37 inches exactly.

Submittal
Prior to submission to the county auditor, the preparer shall submit an electronic file or paper copies of Records of Survey to the Region Cadastral Engineer or Survey Office and the HQ Survey
Support Section for review, along with compiled survey notes, calculations, references, and any other information used for alignment, section subdivision, and boundary determination.
Headquarters will return review comments to the region for review and further discussion. The region will then return all comments to the Surveyor of Record. Records of Survey shall be certified by a Professional Land Surveyor. The region will provide the county in which the alignment exists with the appropriate Mylar® if required and paper original copies for acceptance. Also included in the county submittal will be a separate copy for the county auditor to place the recording information and signature, which will be retained by the surveyor. Copies may then be made for WSDOT archiving and region filing. Following county acceptance, the region will send one (1) accepted paper copy to the HQ Survey Support Section.
The number of copies submitted for recording are: • One (1) original Mylar® or paper copy for the county (see county requirements or submittal requirements). • One (1) paper copy for WSDOT archives.

Monumentation Map 200.03(1) Introduction
The purpose of a Monumentation Map is to show the right of way baseline with ties to General
Land Office (GLO) corners for future retracements of said baseline.
A Monumentation Map is intended to be a survey document that focuses on the alignment monuments that have been set during or after construction and their relationship to the project control points, GLO corners, property corners, road intersection points, and so on.
A Monumentation Map may be certified by either a Professional Land Surveyor or a Professional
Engineer (RCW 58.09). Although state law allows a Professional Engineer to certify certain survey documents, the Professional Engineer’s authority is limited by practice and staying within the limits of the project. Although the Monumentation Map is typically filed with the county engineer’s office, the filing requirements of this document vary from county to county. It is best to contact the county engineer’s office, surveyor’s office, or auditor’s office to determine filing requirements and fees for that specific county.

200.03(2) Type 1 Monumentation Map
A Type 1 Monumentation Map includes a full and complete analysis of the R/W alignment control baseline, including, but not limited to, the baseline’s relationship to pertinent deeds and cadastral ties to the Public Land Survey System.
The Monumentation Map is intended to be a “stand-alone” document. To obtain this “stand­ alone” status, follow the guidelines below. 200.03(3) Type 2 Monumentation Map
The primary purpose of a Type 2 Monumentation Map is to identify existing monumentation and to coordinate said monumentation with the State Plane Coordinate System (NAD 83/91) or current datum. A copy of the Type 2 Monumentation Map can be used as part of the application to destroy or remove a survey monument.
The Type 2 Monumentation Map is intended to serve as a monument inventory tool. A Type 2
Monumentation Map shall clearly state on the face of the document that no analysis was performed. All geodetic coordinates shall be derived by survey methods, and all plan data will be taken from existing and approved Right of Way Plans.
Page 2-8
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 2
Survey Records
If monumentation is found to be on a construction alignment and is related to cadastral ties, it must be clearly noted on the face of the Type 2 Monumentation Map that said monumentation may not have a direct correlation to the Right of Way baseline.
For future use and benefit, it would be advantageous for the construction contract number to be identified on the Type 2 Monumentation Map plan showing the monuments identified on the plan sheets.
The Monumentation Map is intended to be a “stand-alone” document. To obtain this “stand­ alone” status, follow the guidelines below. Refer to Exhibit 2-3 for a checklist of mapping elements to be included on the Monumentation Map.
Use Exhibit 2-1 as a guide to determine which type of Monumentation Map is needed for your project.

If it has been determined that a monumentation map is necessary, it is the responsibility of the region to assemble data and prepare a Monumentation Map for locating and defining the centerline alignment or geodetic monument location in its mathematical position within the Public
Land Survey System. 200.03(6) English Units Only
Monumentation Maps are to be prepared in English units only. 200.03(7) Alignment
For a Type 1 Monumentation Map, the R/W centerline, from which the right of way is to be legally described, is shown as a continuous solid line for the full length of the project, with its alignment data shown. The retracement alignment will be shown on the Type 1 Monumentation
Map. If the R/W centerline is being retraced and the alignment data varies from plan data, both original and retraced alignment data is shown. If a new Right of Way Plan is to be prepared, additional sheets will be added to the Monumentation Map showing corrections to stationing and other plan anomalies discovered, to conform to Division 1 of the Plans Preparation Manual (see Exhibits 2-2a and 2-2b).
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Division 2
The existing stationing must be tied to the new centerline stationing by station and/or bearing equations.
R/W width data will not be shown on the Type 1 Monumentation Map.
For all Monumentation Maps, the R/W centerline is shown as a continuous solid line for the full length of the project. A rotation note or Bearing Equation should be included on the
Monumentation Map to provide an angular adjustment from the approved R/W plans to the
State Plane Coordinate data used to prepare the Monumentation Map.
No alignment analysis or adjustments are performed on the centerline. Right of way width data will not be shown on the Type 2 Monumentation Map. 200.03(8) Control Features
Where such features exists, the Monumentation Map shall show, but not be limited to: government subdivision corners, platted subdivisions, donation land claims, national park or forest boundaries, Indian reservations, farm units, and property corners. A Type 1
Monumentation Map centerline retracement alignment will show at least two bearing and distance ties from the new R/W centerline, with stations noted, to an existing and recorded monument or government subdivision corner, particularly the monuments from which the title reports originate.
A Type 2 Monumentation Map will make a reference to the existing Right of Way Plan for ties to the GLO corners.

200.03(9) Survey Report
A Survey Report is a summary of all the main elements that were used to generate the
Monumentation Map or other survey documents. The purpose of the Survey Report is to provide documentation of the controlling elements of decisions throughout the project. A separate file folder should be kept with the project folder summarizing those elements. This
Survey Report will become the basis of the Narrative, which may be placed on the
Monumentation Map.
A Survey Report is not required as part of the preparation of a Monumentation Map. However, it is highly recommended that such a report be prepared in the event a question ever arises regarding the survey, so that an answer may be determined by the surveyor (or another if the surveyor is not available).
A copy of the Survey Report shall be archived in the Survey/_SurveyDoc folder of the Standard
CAE_Project folder structure. This will ensure all survey documentation regarding alignment decisions, datums, control monuments, secondary control monuments, and other relevant information is available to current and future users of the plans.
Documentation should include, but not be limited to: • Horizontal and vertical datums identified.
Page 2-10

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 2
Survey Records • Horizontal and vertical control points identified. • Control network points identified with a sketch. • Sketches and/or photos of control points. • State Plane Coordinates to Project Datum worksheets. • List of Records of Survey/Land Corner Records, RR maps, and other reference material. • List of WSDOT Right of Way Plans. • List of deeds and other property rights documents. • Sketches and/or photos of alignment monuments. • Monuments identified as potential disturbances to the project. • Summary of all GLO monuments held or rejected, with supporting evidence. • Sketches of conflicting information that supports decisions. • Summaries of key determinations critical to resolution of alignments. • Basis of Bearings monuments identified. • Basis of Stationing identified. 200.03(10)
Narrative for Both Type 1 and Type 2 Monumentation Maps
The Narrative is an optional explanation added to the Monumentation Map. The purpose of the
Narrative is to provide a medium in which the surveyor is able to provide additional explanation regarding how final determinations were made, which may be difficult to show graphically.
Circumstances may dictate whether a Narrative is to be written, but it is recommended that one be prepared for all Monumentation Maps. 200.03(11)
Monumentation Map Details
RCW 58.09 and RCW 18.43 allow survey maps and documents to be certified by a Professional
Land Surveyor or a Professional Engineer.
The Monumentation Map’s main focus is the right of way centerline alignment. Right of way limits may vary during negotiations and revisions, but the right of way centerline alignment does not fluctuate as often as the corridor’s right of way limits.
Mapping of a Type 1 or Type 2 Monumentation Map will be very similar to a Record of Survey.
The Type 2 Monumentation Map will typically show the monuments found and a State Plane
Coordinate for that point. (a) Map Requirements
The county recording official's information block may vary within each county. Confirm all county filing or recording information before submitting documents for filing. A fee may or may not be required. Check with the county engineer’s office or the county auditor’s office to determine whether a filing or recording fee must accompany the Monumentation Map.

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 2-11 Survey Records
Division 2
A checklist has been prepared to help the preparer identify filing and WSDOT standard requirements. (See Exhibit 2-3 for monumentation mapping elements.) Additional elements may be included on the Monumentation Map if it is determined that these elements will assist in clear interpretation of the map. 200.03(12)
Equipment and Procedures Used (WAC 332-130-100) • Equipment used • Procedures used • GLO history for corners (Type 1 only)
A statement identifying the type of equipment and procedure used shall be placed on the
Monumentation Map. This note may be included in the Narrative or be a separate note on the sheet.
All GLO corners shown as found will identify which Record of Survey (ROS) or Land Corner
Record (LCR) is being referenced indicating the monument found. If a GLO monument is found that is not noted on a previous ROS, then a Land Corner Record shall also be prepared. 200.03(13)
Coordinates: Control Network Scheme Required (RCW 58.09.070)

(a) If a Monumentation Map displays Washington State Plane Coordinates (SPCs), it must have a control network schematic identifying the network used to control the survey. (b) Use a control network scheme diagram to show how the SPCs were determined from the known base points (see Exhibit 2-4). A statement such as “the WSRN network was used” is acceptable if it includes the base stations and calibration points used. Base stations vary in reliability, so a statement regarding which base stations were used is necessary for repeatability. (c) Datum defined: RCW 58.20.120 states that the Washington Coordinate System of 1983 is the designated coordinate system in Washington. • WAC 332-130-060 and WAC 332-130-070 define the use of the datum tag and epoch date to be reported. • As adjustments by NGS to the North American Datum (NAD) of 1983 continue to refine the geoid model, it is important to note which datum is being used. In order to prevent datum crossovers or mixing of datums, the adjustment year must be indicated on the
Monumentation Map. (d) Except in remote locations or on extremely small-scale projects, project datum coordinates will be used to prepare the Monumentation Map. A table or worksheet showing the calculations converting SPCs to project datum coordinates is provided and kept with the
Survey Report file.

The original Mylar® or paper copy (with county filing information) will be retained permanently by the HQ Survey Support Section. 200.04
State Land Plats 200.04(1) General
Land Plats are required when a highway facility crosses state-owned property under the jurisdiction of DNR or when WSDOT must obtain materials from such land. Land Plats are requested by HQ Real Estate Services. They are prepared by the HQ Survey Support Section and processed through HQ Real Estate Services, and they conform to the final Right of Way Plan.
All survey data required to prepare the Land Plat will be provided by the regions: datum, horizontal and vertical control monuments, references, electronic data file, and DGN base map files. Additional survey information may be necessary due to the type of plat required.
Additional information regarding water rights is usually needed to determine shorelands and bedlands.
Stations and offset dimensions are required for both right of way lines and the centerline where they enter and leave each section under DNR’s jurisdiction. The total area, right of way acquisition, and remainder for each 40-acre tract, as well as Basis of Bearings and any coordinate system used, are also required. Ties to all subdivision corners are required, whether they are calculated or found. The plat must conform to the GLO plats and/or any other recorded surveys. Copies of any recorded surveys or plats can be obtained from the DNR Public Land
Survey Office in Olympia.
The Land Plat is intended to be a “stand-alone” document. To obtain this “stand-alone” status, follow the guidelines below.

A Land or Aquatic Plat being prepared for DNR must meet the requirements listed on its website (Land or Aquatic Plat requirements). The guidelines DNR provides vary depending on the type of site and type of property right being acquired.
Refer to Exhibit 2-6 for a checklist of the DNR Land Map Requirements. 200.04(8) Coordinates: Control Scheme Required (RCW 58.09.070)
Currently, a control scheme is not required on Land Plats. However, this option would be beneficial for future survey retracement projects. (a) Use a control scheme (network diagram) to show how the Washington State Plane
Coordinates (SPCs) were determined from the known points (see Exhibit 2-5). A statement such as “the WSRN network was used” is acceptable if it includes the base stations and calibration points used. Base stations vary in reliability, so a statement regarding which base stations were used is necessary for repeatability. (b) Datum defined: RCW 58.20.120 states that the Washington Coordinate System of 1983 is the designated coordinate system in Washington. • WAC 332-130-060 and WAC 332-130-070 define the use of the datum tag and epoch date to be reported. • As adjustments by NGS to the North American Datum of 1983 model continue to refine the geoid model, it is important to note which datum is actually being used. In order to prevent datum crossovers or mixing of datums, the adjustment year must be shown on the Land Plat.

Permit to Remove or Destroy
The Application to Remove or Destroy a Survey Monument is an official state permit required by
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to remove a survey monument. Guidance in preparing this document is provided by DNR. Any survey monument that is inaccessible (including survey monuments that are covered for a short period of time) is considered destroyed. The permits are permanently filed at DNR in Olympia. A completion report indicating that the survey monument has been replaced or permanently removed is also required.
The Permit to Remove a Survey or Monument is intended to be a “stand-alone” document. To obtain this “stand-alone” status, follow the guidelines below. 200.05(1) References

The current Application to Remove or Destroy a Survey Monument form may be found on the
DNR Public Land Survey website. 200.05(2) Region Responsibility
It is the responsibility of the region to assemble data and prepare an Application to Remove or
Destroy a Survey Monument. A Survey Map, Record of Survey, or a Type 1 or Type 2
Monumentation Map may be prepared as an exhibit indicating the location, type, and record of each survey monument. Headquarters Survey Support will provide assistance when requested by the region. Permits to remove or destroy a survey monument are not required to be approved by Headquarters. 200.05(3) English Units Only
Application sketches and drawings are to be prepared in English U.S. Survey feet only. 200.05(4) Alignment
If a survey map is prepared as an exhibit to the application, the right of way centerline and alignment data shall be shown. Station and offsets to all survey monuments shown on the face of the survey map should also be shown. A bearing and distance tie may be shown when appropriate. 200.05(5) Control Features
The Application to Remove or Destroy a Survey Monument shall show, but not be limited to:
GPS network points, government subdivision corners, platted subdivisions, donation land claims, national park or forest boundaries, Indian reservations, farm units, and property corners. All control features may be detailed on a Record of Survey or on either a Type 1 or Type 2
Monumentation Map.
Another option, a separate diagram for each monument showing the station and offset to the right of way alignment, description of the monument, and reference monuments with distance and angle ties to reference monuments, may be provided. All reference monuments should be outside the established work zone to prevent accidental disturbance of these reference points.
A State Plane Coordinate may be counted as one of the reference points.
The number of reference monuments required perpetuating a monument will depend on the purpose of the monument. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has varied requirements depending on the corner monument’s purpose (for guidelines, see the BLM manual, sections 4­
93 to 4-113). DNR follows these requirements for all General Land Office corners. The number of reference monuments set for all other monuments will be determined by the project environment during and after construction, the length of time the monument will be removed, and other factors determined by the surveyor.
Geodetic monuments are maintained by the HQ GeoMetrix Office, which shall: • Be notified when the work zone has been determined.
Page 2-18

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 2
Survey Records • Be notified of all geodetic monuments within the proposed work zone for appropriate action • Make the decision to destroy or reset these monuments. 200.05(6) Coordinates: Control Scheme Required (RCW 58.09.070) (a) The application form requests that a State Plane Coordinate (SPC) on all associated monuments be noted on the form. A statement of how the SPCs were derived shall also be on the form. (b) Datum defined: RCW 58.20.120 states that the Washington Coordinate System of 1983 is the designated coordinate system in Washington. • WAC 332-130-060 and WAC 332-130-070 define the use of the datum tag and epoch date to be reported. • As adjustments by NGS to the North American Datum of 1983 model continue to refine the geoid model, it is important to note which datum is actually being used. In order to prevent datum crossovers or mixing of datums, the adjustment year must be shown on the Permit to Remove or Destroy a Monument. (c) If project datum coordinates were used to produce the Permit to Remove or Destroy a Monument, provide a table or worksheet showing the calculations converting SPCs to project data and store in the Survey Report file. 200.05(7) Recording Coordinates
When reference has been made to State Plane Coordinates, the scale, elevation, and combined factors shall be stated for the survey lines used in computing ground distances and areas. 200.05(8) Drawing Standards
All Permits to Remove or Destroy a Survey Monument shall be accompanied by a Record of
Survey, Monumentation Map, and Construction Alignment sheet, with all monuments identified or individual sketches provided of each monument. Space is provided on the form space is limited as should be reserved for single monument removal applications.
Drafting standards shall meet the requirements of 200.2(11). All individual sketches will be neat and concise, and will clearly note all monuments and reference dimensions. Sketches do not have to be drawn to scale. 200.05(9) Metric Equivalent

This Division of the Plans Preparation Manual provides guidance and instructions for preparing contract plans for WSDOT projects. The contents of this Division can be applied to the majority of the projects designers will encounter. It is understood that no two projects are the same and that it is not possible to provide information for every circumstance that may be encountered.
There will be those projects, or portions of projects, that do not fit the standard applications. In those cases, recognize the need to adjust the standards to best depict the work to be accomplished.
This Division shows representative information and examples to use as a basis to make decisions on what is to be included in the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E), and how it is to be shown in the plans. The main objective is to assemble a thorough package that contains the precise information required by a contractor to submit a responsive bid and for WSDOT to get an acceptable finished product. Providing too much information can, at times, cause as many problems as not providing enough. Contract Plans need to be biddable, buildable and maintainable. Contract Plans include only that information necessary for the contractor to properly bid and construct (biddable and buildable) a project. Information intended for WSDOT inspectors should not be included, as contract plans are for the contractor, not the engineer. In addition, where appropriate, consolidate and reduce plan sheets. Projects requiring contractor surveying will require more detail and information than a project being surveyed by WSDOT.

400.01(1)
Contract Plans and Provisions
The Plans, Specifications, and Estimates are some of the documents required for the advertisement of a project.
The Contract Plans and Contract Provisions must set forth the work in a clear and concise manner to avoid misinterpretation.
The Contract Plans are to conform to the geometric design as documented in the Design
Approval (DA), the Project Development Approval (PDA) package, and the Design
Documentation Package (DDP). (See the Design Manual Chapter 300 for more information.)
All plan details and Contract Provisions are to be specific to the project being developed. It is acceptable to use details and provisions from previous contracts. They should be examined closely and modified as required to ensure they are specific to the current project.

Page 4-1

Contract Plans
Division 4
Deviations from Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) policies and standard practices require approval by the appropriate approving authority, in accordance with the Design Manual, well in advance of advertisement of the project, during project development.
Coordinate design schedules early with all specialty groups involved with the project. Involve the
Headquarters (HQ) Bridge and Structures Office when structures are involved to ensure the project will be completed in a timely manner. Real Estate Services and Environmental are also critical to meeting project ad dates. Understanding specialty groups schedules, to incorporate into your project schedule is of vital importance.
Avoid duplication within the Contract Plans and Provisions. Information that is contained in the
Contract Plans does not belong in the Provisions. Information that is contained in the Provisions does not belong in the Contract Plans.
Reduce the volume of the plans by using logical combinations of plan series to best display the information. Displaying unnecessary or duplicative information may cause confusion during bidding, resulting in higher bid prices. A series of plan sheets with minimal information, makes it difficult to coordinate different items of work. This could also lead to increased prices by bidders estimating the project. Complete and accurate information on the correct series of plan sheets is what creates biddable and buildable contract plan sets.
Standards are not developed to stifle design, but to provide consistency across the state. We strive for consistent use of state standards, regardless of where the project is located. We also recognize that unique situations may require varying from the standards. When standard materials are called for, the contractors and the suppliers know what is needed and what to expect for testing and approvals. When the same work is specified and represented in the plans the same way, the contractors develop an understanding of our expectations. Using standard items and construction methods is almost always more economical. Proprietary items should be avoided unless there is proper justification.
Review guidance and checklists
Use the Plans Preparation checklist to organize and ensure items required for the project are included.
For reviewing items needed for your completed project, use the Plans, Specifications and
Estimates checklist. This checklist contains the type of information that will be examined during the Stewardship Process Review, conducted by Headquarters and the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) at the end of the project.
Contact your Region Plans office for a region specific checklist.

Office at the time of their delivery. If for some reason the scope of the project has changed so dramatically that the official project title must be changed, the title change must be negotiated with and agreed to by the Region Program Management Office and the Region Plans Office. v) Provide justification and obtain approval from the HQ Construction Office or current delegated authority in each region for use of nonstandard time for project completion specifications. w) Provide justification and obtain early endorsement, then approval from the HQ
Construction Office Assistant State Construction Engineer for using project-specific specifications that alter the Standard Specifications or revise, delete, replace or supplement any General Special Provisions (GSPs) or any Region General Special
Provisions beyond the fill-ins. x) Coordinate early with the Region Traffic Office on the preparation of all signal, illumination, ITS, and other design elements needed to be incorporated in the PS&E preparation. y) Ensure the Contract Plans/Contract Provisions are stamped in accordance with WSDOT
Executive Order E 1010, Certification of Documents by Licensed Professionals, and
Appendix 2, Applying Professional Stamps. z) Check the current Design Documentation Checklist and Project File Checklist for additional reports or requirements that apply to the project.

400.02(2)
Alterations to Plans and Project Specifications
Alterations to plans or specifications should be performed and sealed by the person who originally sealed them. They may be performed and sealed by a different licensed professional acting within their area of expertise if necessary. Licensed professionals who sealed the original documents shall be notified of changes to their work that are considered practice of engineering and shall be given an opportunity to review and comment, if possible. Licensed professional engineers who are no longer WSDOT employees or who are not available through a consultant services agreement need not be notified of changes to their work.
Changes regarding quantities, payment estimates, time lines, etc., are typically not considered technical changes or practice of engineering and therefore would not require sealing by a licensed professional. Changes not considered technical changes or practice of engineering should still be reviewed by the original designer/submitter of that item of work and should not be changed by the Project Manager without the specific permission of the original designer/submitter. 400.03
Headquarters Assistance/Review
Various offices of expertise are available for assistance if requested by the region. For examples of transmittal memos to Headquarters or region support offices, contact your Region Plans
Office for assistance.

Drafting Requirements 400.04(1)
General
How the plan information is displayed on the plan sheets impacts the usefulness of the plans. To get the best possible bid and the best possible finished product, the plans must present the information clearly and concisely. Everyone who examines the plans should be able to determine what work is required and arrive at a single interpretation of the information.
To ensure a clear and singular interpretation: • Avoid overcrowding of plan sheets by displaying only information relevant to the plan series. • Draw the plans with appropriate drafting standards as specified in this manual and the
Electronic Engineering Data Standards Manual.
Determine what information is required for the contractor to bid and construct the project and for WSDOT to administer the project. The requirements of other readers such as FHWA and various Headquarter offices also need to be considered. Many of the requirements in this manual, such as “Begin Federal Aid” and “End Federal Aid” Number and Section Lines shown on the Vicinity Map, may not be required to construct or administer the project but have value to other users of the Contract Plans.
Determine what information does not add value, creates clutter on the plans and confusion for the reader. Following are some examples of information that should not be included in plan sheets and some ways to help eliminate excess plan sheets: • Alignment and R/W Plans where no changes in alignment and R/W are planned or where the alignment and R/W staking is being conducted and maintained by WSDOT. • Quantity Tabulations for all items of work or where only a few items of work are listed.

Page 4-8
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans • Right of way lines that have no ties add no value. If right of way needs to be shown, it should have ties showing where it is. • Future alignments that have nothing to do with construction of the project can clutter a plan sheet making it hard to find the needed information. • Showing existing pavement markings/edge of existing roadway on Paving Plans or
Pavement Marking Plans. • Showing items slated for removal on a Site Preparation Plan and not anywhere else in the plans. • Repeating plan sheets just to keep the same number of sheets in each series. Use break lines to eliminate sheets of nonchanging information. If there is no drainage code on a
Drainage Plan sheet, the sheet shouldn’t be included in the series. Also, for Paving Plans and Pavement Marking Plans, if nothing changes between intersections or interchanges, use break lines to eliminate sheets. • Whenever possible, avoid the practice of cross-hachuring, patterning, or shading of large areas to represent areas to be paved, planed, or anything else. The roadway sections should adequately show the areas to be planed and paved. The use of large areas of crosshachuring could hide or detract information being displayed on the sheet. • Profile sheets showing overlay, grinding and inlay, or paving exception areas of the project add no value. Show only the portions of the project that have a change in the vertical alignment of the roadway under construction. In the same way repeating information already shown on roadway sections on paving plans without showing dimensions adds no value to the contract.
If it does not provide needed information or add value to the plans—REMOVE IT!
The following section provides general rules for showing dimensions and data on contract plans. 400.04(1)(a)
Displaying Dimensions and Data
Our engineering applications produce roadway designs to high levels of precision. This is beneficial in design; however, these levels of precision are often unnecessary in construction.
This section provides general information for displaying dimensions and data on contract plans.
Generally, show a dimension, station, offset, etc. only to a level of precision being sought and avoid adding decimals or extra trailing zeros when it is not necessary. This represents a more achievable, constructible level of precision to the contractor.
Understanding that there will be exceptions, apply the following basic rules for displaying dimensions and data on plans.
Roadway Sections •

Horizontal elements, lane and shoulder widths – show in feet. If a horizontal dimension is to the nearest foot, then display the dimension as a whole number.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-9 Contract Plans
Division 4
Examples: an 11-foot lane is shown as 11’ not 11.0’. If the lane width is 11.6’, then show as such; do not round it to 12’. •
Station limits – round to the nearest foot when practicable. If the roadway section goes to the bridge seat, use the bridge seat station. •
Materials depths – generally shown to hundredth of foot, as in: 0.25’
Plans •
Stations and offsets – show to the nearest foot; omit trailing decimal zeroes where practicable. As an example: if a Right of Way (R/W) offset is at Station L 14+00.00 with an offset of 60.00’ show as L 14+00 at 60’. •
Horizontal control points on plans, including begin and end of project, centerlines, R/W centerline, baselines, and intersections – show in feet to 2 decimal places.

•
Display alignment bearings, and delta angles for curve data in degrees, minutes, and seconds, rounded to the nearest second.
Profiles
Vertical alignment control points, (BVC, PVI, EVC) stations and elevations in feet to 2 decimal places.
Profile Grades display in percent to as few decimal places as possible. Very long grades may need to be to 4 decimal places for the math to work.
Drainage profiles proposed flow lines– display stations and elevations in feet to 2 decimal places.
Manhole tops and grate stations and elevations – display in feet to 1 or 2 decimal places.
Ditch elevations – display in feet to 1 decimal place (to nearest 0.05 when controlled by percent of grade). 400.04(2)
Plan Sheets
Early in the design process, determine the different series of plan sheets that will be required and the information that will need to be displayed on each series.
Using the appropriate levels of the computer-aided drafting and design (CAD) system allows the flexibility to provide additional series of plans easily and quickly if it turns out that more information is required than was originally anticipated. For this reason, it is important that all
CAD work use the prescribed level scheme. (a) Most of the drawings created by CAD users in a design office are 11-inch by 17-inch plan sheets for PS&E. References will pertain to that size unless otherwise noted. In general, the plotting scale for 11-inch by 17-inch plan sheets is 1 inch equals 100 feet (1"=100'), except as indicated below. Set the plotting scale in MicroStation under the WSDOT pull down menu.

Page 4-10
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans
There may be occasions when the scale of a plan sheet needs to be increased to as much as 1"=40' for an 11-inch by 17-inch plan sheet. When this is done, examine the sheet to be sure that required information is easily read. It may be necessary to resize some text or symbols to make them legible. (b) Print plan sheets to PDF unless otherwise directed. (c) Draw Vicinity Maps at a scale appropriate to the size of the project and the detail required to show the appropriate information, as discussed in 400.06(4). (d) Sheets requiring a larger scale to display a great deal of information in a small area should be drawn to an appropriate scale to allow all information to be easily read and understood. (e) Draw strip maps at a scale appropriate to display the information clearly. (f) Use cross-hachuring only for small, isolated areas of work such as pavement repair areas or butt joint planing locations that may get lost if not displayed in this manner. On occasion, with concurrence of the Region Plans Office, color may be used for clarity. Gray-area shading is reserved exclusively for use in an addendum to highlight changes to a plan sheet. (See Appendix 5 for Addendum Preparation.) (g) All screened (half-toned) portions of plan sheets must be dark enough to adequately reproduce in the typical deliverable PDF format. (h) Follow the drafting standards for line weight, lettering height, and symbols for Contract contained in the Electronic Engineering Data Standards Manual. It is important to conform to these standards for consistency and for reproduction. (i) Under most circumstances, place lettering and dimensioning so they may be read from either the bottom of the sheet or the right side of the sheet. Do not place text across roadway centerlines or right of way lines. Text is to be clear of all lines and should normally be placed outside the drawing itself. Draw leader lines so they do not cross one another or text. The two exceptions to the bottom and right reading text are: 1. All Section Corner and Township line numbers are to have their tops to the north, and
Range Line numbers are to have their tops to the west, regardless of the orientation of north to the sheet. 2. All information identifying a centerline, such as line designation, stationing, tick marks, and bearings, are to be placed on top of the line and read left to right, with both the top of the line and left to right being based on the direction of the stationing. (j) When lines are coincidental, use the following order of precedence for placing them on the sheet: 1. Construction Centerline 2. Right of Way Centerline 3. Range/Township Line 4. Section Line 5. Corporate Limit Line 6. County Line
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-11 Contract Plans
Division 4 (k) When Corporate Limit lines coincide with other lines, label the Corporate Limits in an effort to clarify that the line is also the corporate limits. (l) Provide a north arrow and a scale bar on each plan view sheet. The north arrow will normally be oriented towards either the top or right side of the sheet. (m) On all plan view sheets and profile sheets that physically show the Begin Project and End
Project headings, identify these points as follows:
STATE-FUNDED PROJECTS:
Begin Project

End Project
SR XX, MP XX.XX
STA XX+XX.XX
FEDERALLY -FUNDED PROJECTS:
Begin F.A. No.
End F.A. No.
SR XX MP XX.XX (n) If the “Begin and/or End Federal Aid” are different than the “Begin and/or End Project,” display this information similar to the above on a separate leader line drawn to the appropriate location. Use “Begin Construction” and “End Construction” when work is being done on crossroads adjacent to the main line work or at ramp termini. (o) Provide a legend on all plan view sheets (such as site preparation, drainage, paving, and others) showing features applicable to that series. (p) The legend is to contain all items that are shown on any of the individual plan sheets in that series. For example, if your Drainage Plan series consists of 15 plan sheets, and throughout these 15 plan sheets there are 12 items to be identified in the legend, all 15 of the drainage plan sheets in this series will have a legend that will have all 12 items listed and identified. (q) If a sheet in the series is too crowded to include a legend, add a note to the sheet to tell the reader on which sheet the legend may be found. The preferred method is to refer the reader to the legend on the preceding sheet. (r) WSDOT Contract Plans show the slope of a line in several forms, such as ratio, percentage, and decimal. When a slope is shown in ratio form in WSDOT plans, it is shown as run over rise, which is opposite of mathematical standards in which a slope is always given as rise over run in ratio and fraction form. In WSDOT plans, a 4:1 slope means that the slope has a 4-foot horizontal run and a 1-foot vertical rise. Some WSDOT manuals further clarify the meaning of a 4:1 slope by adding a post text, such as 4H:1V, to further clarify that there are four units horizontal (run) and one unit vertical (rise). Do not use this method on WSDOT
Contract Plans.

(b) If the Contract Plans have more than 225 sheets or Contract Provisions have more than 225 pages, they will need to be separated into volumes, with no volume having more than 225 sheets or pages. • The break for volumes is to be made at a logical point in the package, which may not be at 225 sheets or pages. • If a project has 275 plan sheets, and the last 80 are bridge sheets, the logical break would be between the civil sheets and the bridge sheets. • If multiple volumes are required for the Contract Provisions, the logical break would be at the end of a main section. For example, break between HOT MIX ASPHALT
PAVEMENT and the following main section, CULVERTS. • Do not place the break in the middle of a section. (c) Stamping: WSDOT plans and specifications are to be stamped with a seal, signature, and the date signed; the expiration date of the license is optional. WSDOT has established a statewide process for applying professional stamps to plan sets that allows full electronic delivery. Use Appendix 2, Applying Professional Stamps, to follow the WSDOT method and instructions to apply digital professional stamps to contract plans. This also applies to consultants developing projects for WSDOT. Licensees are directed to WSDOT Executive
Order E 1010, RCW 18.43, and WAC 196 (Engineers and Land Surveyors); RCW 18.08 and
WAC 308-12 (Architects); and RCW 18.96 and WAC 308-13 (Landscape Architects). • Place the licensee’s seal on all plan sheets adjacent to the WSDOT logo, except for the
Index to the plans, Vicinity Map, Summary of Quantities, and Quantity Tabulations.
Bar-Lists are not required to be stamped. This space should be reserved during initial plan sheet layout. • The following plan sheets prepared by WSDOT are not required to be stamped: index,
Vicinity Map, Summary of Quantities, Quantity Tabulations, Bar-Lists, TESC sheets, and
Traffic Control Plans. • For WSDOT plans prepared by consultant/developers, the Licensed Engineer’s seal, signature, date signed (expiration date of license is optional), and logo is to be placed on all plan sheets adjacent to the WSDOT logo. The index to the plans, Vicinity Map,

Plan Sequence

400.06(1)
Assembling Plans
The following outline is the sequence to follow when assembling plans for a construction project. It is a list of possible plan sheets and is not intended to represent a project. 400.06(1)(a) 1. Index. 2. Certification Sheet(s). 3. Vicinity Map. 4. Summary of Quantities. 5. Borrow, pit, quarry, stockpile, waste sites, and reclamation plans. 6. Roadway sections: main roadway, ramps, frontage roads, detours, others. 7. Grading sections, if applicable. 8. Stage construction plans, if applicable. 9. Alignment or Alignment/Right of Way. 10. Quantity Tabulation sheets (Q-tabs). These sheets will be placed immediately prior to the plan sheets showing the work being tabulated, such as site preparation items, temporary erosion and sediment control (TESC) items, guardrail items, and traffic items. 11. Site Preparation. Existing topography and removal and demolition work may be shown on
Alignment Plans; however, if extensive details are required and the plan sheet becomes too crowded, it should be on a separate series.

Division 4 12. Existing Utilities. This is an extension of the Site Preparation Plan and is only required if the existing utilities are so extensive that they cannot be clearly shown on the Site Preparation
Plan. 13. Roadway profiles—normally only required when grade is being revised. 14. Environmental Compliance Plans (ECP) – required for various disciplines that meet regulatory triggers. 15. TESC Plans—may not be required if work is minor and can be combined with Drainage Plans or other plan sheets. Refer to Division 7 for information on when a TESC Plan is required. 16. TESC details. 17. Drainage structure notes—will precede plan series showing drainage features. 18. Drainage Plans—may not be required if work is minor and can be combined with another series of plans. 19. Drainage profiles—will follow plan series showing drainage features. 20. Drainage details. 21. Stream Plans. 22. Stream Profiles. 23. Stream Details. 24. Utility Structure Note sheets—only required if there is work to be done by the contractor on existing utilities. 25. Utility Plans—only required if there is work to be done by the contractor on existing utilities. 26. Utility details—only required if there is work to be done by the contractor on existing utilities. 27. Irrigation Structure Note sheets. 28. Irrigation Plans. 29. Irrigation details. 30. Landscape, wetland, rest areas, roadside restoration, and viewpoints. 31. Interchange contours. 32. Paving Plans are required for overlay projects when paving breaks, paving dimensions, intersection paving, taper lengths, dimensions of taper widths, and so on, can’t be shown adequately on the roadway sections. In this case, the Roadway Sections, Paving Plans, and
Paving Detail sheets are to be prepared in conjunction with each other to show all paving work. 33. Paving details. 34. Curb ramp plans. 35. Minor structures such as retaining walls. 36. Illumination Plans—may be shown on Paving Plans if illumination is minor and Paving Plan will not be too crowded.

Contract Plans 37. Illumination details—will follow plan series showing illumination layout. 38. Traffic Signal Plans. 39. Traffic signal details. 40. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Plans. 41. ITS details. 42. Sign Specification sheets—will precede the plan series showing the signing. 43. Signing Plans—may be shown on Paving Plans if signing is minor and Paving Plans will not be too crowded. 44. Signing details—will follow plan series showing signing. 45. Bridges and other structures. 46. Building plans and details. 47. Traffic Control Plans. 48. Detour routes and detour signing. If the detour is simple and straightforward, this information may be shown on the Vicinity Map, if the additional information does not detract from the Vicinity Map. 400.06(2)
Plan Sheets
Determine the actual plan sheets required to best depict the project. Verify the order of plan sheets to determine what is or isn’t required. A basic P1 paver will normally not require as many sheets as a project that has safety, mobility and paving work. When two or more projects are merged into one project, the plan sheet sequence will be followed. Even with logical combinations of plan sheet series, maintain the following basic order of sheets: • Item information: Quantity Tabulation/Structure Note/Sign Specification. • Plan series: The series showing the items of work described on the Quantity
Tabulation/Structure Note/Sign Specification sheets. • Details: For work associated with items shown on the plan sheets. 400.06(3)
Index
See Contract Plan Examples 4-1 and 4-2.
An index is required for all projects with 30 or more plan sheets. For projects with more than one volume of plan sheets provide a complete project index in each volume.
List the plan sheet titles exactly as they appear on the plan sheets. Avoid sheet titles such as “Miscellaneous Details.” If a sheet contains guardrail and drainage details, use “Guardrail and
Drainage Details” as the sheet title and in the index.
On small projects, and as scale permits, the index can be placed on the Vicinity Map plan sheet.
However, DO NOT reduce your Vicinity Map size to allow you to combine the index and Vicinity
Map as one plan sheet.

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-17 Contract Plans
Division 4
Regardless of the size of the project, it is recommended that Plan Reference Nos. be used on all projects in lieu of plan sheet numbers during the design phase.
Plan sheet numbers are not critical during the design phase of the project. Until the design team leader or region plans reviewer has all the plan sheets for all the separate series (such as paving, drainage, and signing) to be included in the project, the total number of plan sheets to be included in the contract is unknown.
There are several advantages to using Plan Reference Nos. to identify plan sheets for individual series during the design phase: • You do not have to know the total number of plan sheets included in the contract. • Once Plan Reference Nos. have been assigned to individual plan sheets included in a series, these numbers should not have to be changed. This makes referencing details on other plan sheets easy to do and should help eliminate the habit of forgetting to do this. Once the statement “FOR DETAIL, SEE SHEET D12” is placed on the plan sheet, this reference will almost always be correct unless plan sheet D12 is deleted from the contract. • Plan sheets can be inserted or deleted within the series with slight modifications to reference number. For example, a plan sheet that needed to be inserted between D6 and
D7, sheets D7 through the end of the series would need to be renumbered. The use of D6A should be only used in an addendum. (See Appendix 5 for additional information.) 400.06(3a) Certification Sheet
See Contract Plan Example 4-2a.
Insert a sheet after the index titled CERTIFICATION SHEET. Label the first sheet CT1. If there are too many signatures to fit on CT1, then insert sheet CT2, and so on. There is a cell in
MicroStation for the Certification Sheet found using the Place WSDOT Items menu.

400.06(4)
Vicinity Map
See Contract Plan Examples 4-2, 4-3, 4-4, 4-5, and 4-6.
Every project will have a Vicinity Map plan sheet that shows and has labeled all construction centerlines, detours, and haul routes.
Projects may be broken into Sections (see Contract Plan Examples 4-4 and 4-5) when it is required or necessary to split the project into different areas.
This is the logical way of showing the work to be performed, listing quantities, and so on, when all the work involved is not conveniently located in one continuous area with no exceptions or gaps.
If the entire project is on one State Route (SR), but has breaks in the areas where work is to be performed between the Begin Project and End Project, label these breaks “exceptions” or “exception areas.” If there are numerous exceptions or exception areas, an alternate method of showing these exceptions is to label them as “Sections” for the areas where work is to be performed.
Page 4-18
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans

If the project is on multiple SRs, where the work is spread out, it is highly recommended that the work be broken into Sections. When multiple SRs are used in a title, the use smallest SR number followed by et al. to shorten the title.
AN IMPORTANT REMINDER
If the project is broken into Sections, make sure all references to a Section are exactly the same throughout all plan sheet series (Summary of Quantities, Roadway Sections, Quantity Tabulation sheets, Structure Note sheets, Profile sheets, and so on) in the plan set for that Section. Show all exception work areas and gaps identically in all locations and references throughout the
Contract Plans and Provisions.
Show the following on the Vicinity Map when applicable: (a) Project limits, referenced to State Route Mileposts (SRMP) based on the State Highway Log. (b) Stationing at the Begin Project and End Project on the main line and the Begin Construction and End Construction for secondary crossroads. (c) The Begin Project and End Project are defined as follows: • For projects with one applicable State Route, the beginning and ending of any permanent work on the main line highway is assigned as Begin Project and End Project. (d) If the project includes multiple SRs, there is still only one Begin Project and End Project location. Projects with multiple SRs may have a Begin Project on one SR but an End Project on a different SR. Assign Begin Project to the beginning of permanent work at the most westerly or southerly portion of the project, and the End Project to the most easterly or northerly portion, determined by the general direction of the project activities. (e) Begin Construction and End Construction are defined as follows: • The limits of permanent work, such as signing, guardrail, striping, drainage, landscaping, and so on, to be performed on city, county, or state roadways not on the project main line, included in the contract. (f) The Begin and End of Federal Funding with referenced by Federal-Aid Number, milepost, and stationing. The federal funding limits will most often be the same as the project limits, but will cover all work. (g) All equations and exceptions on the Vicinity Map. If the scale of the Vicinity Map is such that equations can be shown with headers and leader lines to the approximate point where the equation is located (by stationing), this is the preferred method to identify the equation. If there is insufficient room on the Vicinity Map itself (because of scale) to clearly identify the equation and exception areas, they may be shown in tabular form (data box) on the Vicinity
Map plan sheet. (h) The distance in miles from the beginning of project (Begin Project) to the nearest city or town and in the opposite direction from the other end of the project (End Project) to the nearest city or town. Do not use “local” descriptions such as “10 miles to EZ Corners.” If the nearest city or town is shown on the WSDOT highway map, it should be familiar enough to
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-19 Contract Plans
Division 4 be used for this purpose. Use the destination arrow with a mile value. The city or town is to be one that is shown on the State highway map. (i) The overall layout of the main line, ramps, frontage roads, county roads and city streets if they are important to the project. Do not show county roads and city streets just to “fill up” the sheet. As with all plan series, delete anything that does not add value to the plan sheet or that provides detail or information that the contractor does not need. DO NOT LABEL
LOCAL BUSINESSES ON THE VICINITY MAP. (j) Scale bar. Select a scale large enough to easily identify all construction lines and appropriate local and private streets or roadways. In addition to including the scale bar, the scale of the plan sheet, detail, and so on, will also be shown in text underneath the scale bar. (k) Material sites, waste sites, stockpile sites, and haul routes will be shown. Do not reduce the scale of the Vicinity Map so that these sites can be shown to scale. If they are too far removed from the project to be shown at the scale appropriate for the Vicinity Map, they can be shown in a separate box in a corner of the Vicinity Map sheet at a smaller scale.
Show the haul route from the site to the highway, and the distance in miles from the site to the nearest point on the project will be shown or noted. (l) Named features such as railroads, waterways, and streams, as well as overcrossing and underpassing roadways. Include railroads running parallel to the project and adjacent to the right of way. If the railroad crosses through the project, state whether or not the intersection with the rail line is at grade. (m) Wetland and wetland mitigation sites are to be shown on the Vicinity Map. Enlarge sections of the Vicinity Map, if needed, to make wetland and wetland mitigation sites visible. (n) Identify each bridge found within the Project Limits on Vicinity Map as follows: • For existing bridges, identify the bridge by bridge number and the type of bridge work.
Examples of the most common types of work are: WIDENING, BRIDGE REMOVAL,
BRIDGE WIDENING, RAIL RETROFIT, MILL/FILL, CONCRETE OVERLAY, HMA OVERLAY,
BST (Bituminous Surface Treatment), NEW APPROACH SLAB, SEISMIC RETROFIT,
BRIDGE REPAIR, UTILITY ATTACHMENT, and SIGN BRACKET. • When there is no contract work on an existing bridge and the contract work does not affect a bridge, or the work is beyond the end of the bridge (such as guardrail transitions attached to the bridge barrier), then identify the bridge number and include “NOT INCLUDED IN PROJECT” as the type of work. • For new bridges, a bridge number is not available at the time of PS&E preparation.
Show the project stationing at the beginning of the bridge, and include “NEW BRIDGE” as the type of work. (o) Cadastral (Township, Range, and Section) information: •

Page 4-20
Identify Township and Range Lines if they fall within the limits shown on the Vicinity
Map.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans •
If Township and Range Lines do not fall within the limits shown on the Vicinity Map, show the Township and Range information at the top center of plan. •
Section Lines with associated Section Corners, with Section Numbers. On small projects, or larger scale Vicinity Maps, this may require the use of break lines to bring the corners within the limits shown. If the corners are found, show the ties to centerline. If there are no Section Corners within the limits shown, a quarter or sixteenth Section Line can be shown and the cadastral information (Township, Range, and Section) given to indicate location. (p) Primary control points are displayed in their coordinate location and labeled with the designation ID only (see Example 4-3). 400.06(5)
Summary of Quantities
See Contract Plan Examples 4-7, 4-8, and 4-9.
The Summary of Quantities sheet provides a complete tabulation of all bid items and pay quantities that have been determined to be required for the project. Enter bid items and quantities into the project estimate via EBASE. The Summary of Quantities Plan sheet is generated from the estimate database by requesting a Summary of Quantities report. Utilization of the program BidTabs Pro provides access to current bid prices for use on the estimate.
Divide the Summary of Quantities into groups and columns within the groups. 400.06(5)(a) Groups
A separate group is required whenever there is a change in: • Program item number (PIN). • Program or subprogram (I2, P1, P2, and so on). • Funding: any change in funding participants, their individual participation rates, or their source of funding. Funding participants may be the FHWA, a state agency or other public agencies, a county, a city, or private organizations. • Control section.
A separate state-funded group (one per project) is required for third-party damages. The bid item “Reimbursement for Third Party Damage” is included in this group; it will be a minimum of $5.00 (see the EBASE User’s Guide.) 400.06(5)(b)

Columns
Each group is required to have at least one column associated with it.
Additional columns within a group are required for the following: 1. Each bridge and structural retaining wall—those covered in Section 6-11 of the Standard
Specifications— to identify the quantities of work at each wall or bridge during construction activities. 2. Each state-furnished pit site (mandatory or not).
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-21 Contract Plans
Division 4
Exceptions allowed for item 1 above: For projects with a single wall, a single bridge, or both, the wall and bridge quantities may be entered into a single column or combined with another column. For projects with multiple walls, if the materials quantities required for each wall are clearly tabulated in the plans, these wall quantities may be entered into a single column or combined with another column in the Summary of Quantities.
In addition, when paving across multiple bridges, the paving quantities need not be separated out for each bridge and may be included in main line paving quantities in the Summary of
Quantities.
Use additional columns within groups to show quantity breakouts for individual construction lines. For example, by using separate columns for the main line, a frontage road, and each ramp, it is much easier to track and make quantity revisions during design, and much easier to track quantities for overruns or underruns during construction, than it is if all the quantities are combined in a single column. 400.06(5)(c) Quantities
The quantities for the following types of items will typically appear only in the Summary of
Quantities: • Lump sum items: LS will appear on the Summary of Quantities for these items; the approximate quantity for lump sum items will appear in the Special Provisions. • Force account items. • Water. • Aeration items. • Structure items, such as bridges and structural retaining walls—although separate Quantity
Tabulation sheets are desirable for structural retaining walls when there is more than one wall in a project. • Borrow materials—unless the conditions noted in Division 7 apply. • Surfacing materials. • Paving materials. • Sign covering. • Sequential arrow sign. • Contractor piloted traffic control. • Traffic control labor. • Construction Signs Class A. • Traffic Control Supervisor. • Traffic control vehicle. • Spill Prevention Plan. • ESC Lead.
