ery. The project risk assessment in the Project Delivery Method Selection Guidance provides a starting point for the development of the initial project risk register. Additional project risks are identified, addressed, and added to the risk register throughout the design development process. 2. Assess and Analyze the Risk Allocation of the risks inherent in highway projects will also define ownership and responsibility for each task of the design-build process. Though risk management should be a continuous process through the life of the project, there needs to be an especially strong emphasis during the initial design development and Request for Proposal (RFP) development phase of the project. Risk management should drive much of those processes. Risk is identified, assigned, and then mitigated through the development of both the project design and the RFP Technical Requirements. Because of its importance, WSDOT’s technical experts should be involved early on in the project risk discussions. In design-build, the guiding principle should be one of assigning risk to the party (owner or Design-Builder) that can most economically handle the risk. One key question to be answered in risk allocation is, “How much is WSDOT willing to pay a Design-Builder to assume risk that WSDOT typically owns?” This question may be asked for each individual task to tailor the contracting approach to each specific project. Project risk is the defining issue that permeates all decisions related to developing the contract provisions. High-risk items that will typically remain the responsibility of WSDOT and must be addressed prior to awarding a contract include:
• Environmental studies
• Public endorsement
• Interagency agreements
• Utility Agreements
• Right of Way acquisition Risk mitigation plans may include additional investigations, additional design, and stakeholder coordination activities that the project team performs during the development of the RFP. Assessment of risk should include an examination of both the probability of the risk and the consequences of the occurrence. Exhibit 3-2 depicts a process for risk assessment.

3. Mitigate and Minimize the Risk Design development by WSDOT should be limited to allow the most design flexibility for the Design-Builder, but needs to be advanced to the extent necessary to ensure project risks can be identified and properly managed and allocated. WSDOT’s design must ensure that the project is well defined, is buildable, and facilitates strong proposal designs with manageable risks. To meet these objectives, every discipline of the design needs to be individually assessed, resulting in differing levels of design development. Some elements of the project may only require a low level of design effort, whereas other elements of the design may require much higher levels of development to define the work and minimize risk. 4. Allocate the Risk Once a risk has been identified and analyzed, it should be assigned to either WSDOT or the Design-Builder. Risks can be shared or allocated solely to the Design-Builder or WSDOT, however shared risks can lead to disputes and are recommended to be avoided if possible. In situations where it seems that shared risk may be appropriate, the project team should first consider a more detailed assessment of the sub-factors that drive the risk and try to assign each risk associated with the sub-factors solely to the party who is best able to mitigate it. Exhibit 3-3 provides an example risk allocation matrix displaying how transportation project risks are typically allocated in DBB and in design-build project delivery methods.

Risk Management
Exhibit 3-3
Example Risk Allocation Matrix
During the procurement phase, specified project risks are addressed through the development of the Technical Requirements of the RFP. The Technical Requirements specify the Design-Builder’s responsibilities for managing and resolving the elements of the design and construction of the project and should clearly identify and allocate risk. When there are shared risks between WSDOT and the DesignBuilder, the Technical Requirements should also clearly define the risk sharing and the collaborative processes that are required to jointly address the risk. 5. Monitor and Manage the Risk An important advantage of design-build is the collaborative environment it fosters between WSDOT and Design-Builder during the implementation phase of the project. Successful projects are dependent on collaboration and partnership in risk management. Through strong collaboration, the project risks are effectively managed to the benefit of the Design-Builder, WSDOT, and the project as a whole. To facilitate this process, it is valuable to maintain a risk register through the construction of the project and schedule regular management meetings to review the status of risk resolution.

Risk Register Early in the project, the design team will begin to identify potential risks associated with the project. Assigning responsibility for each risk is not a one-time task. The project team should continually revisit the risk register as more information becomes available about the project. Utilize the risk register throughout development and implementation of the project. This register will not only govern the responsible party for each risk, but it will help the project team determine how far to advance each technical element within the preliminary design during development of the RFP. A collaboratively created risk register is available on WSDOT’s Design-Build SharePoint site. The project team will carefully review all elements that could affect the specific project and tailor the register to fit the project. This risk register is not all-inclusive. The register should be open for review throughout the entire RFP development process. The risk register is a tool used to guide and document the risk management process. The purpose of the risk register is to define and document the risks, identify cost and schedule impacts associated with the risks, and produce mitigation plans. Ideally, the development of the risk register is part the project delivery selection, and it progressively evolves as the project advances through all of its stages to Completion. The outline and WSDOT template for a typical risk register includes the following:
• Risk ID Number
• Project Title
• Risk Name
• Risk Description
• Disposition (Active, Retired, etc.)
• Risk Impacts – Often the description of risk impacts are in terms of schedule and cost, but they can also include stakeholders, product quality, and other elements.
• Likelihood
• Notes and Assumptions
• Risk Response Actions (Mitigation, Avoidance, Acceptance, etc.) – A detailed description of the specific actions to execute to manage the risk. An example risk register is provided in Exhibit 3-4. The example shows a typical risk register process in the early design phases of a project. As the project design becomes more advanced, the risk register becomes more detailed, assigning specific costs and schedule impacts to risks, to both help inform mitigation decisions and to determine contingency pricing needs for the project.

Design Issues In design-build, several design responsibilities shift to the Design-Builder. WSDOT is responsible for establishing the scope, project definition, design criteria, performance measurements, and existing conditions of the site. As the Design Engineer of Record, plan accuracy, design errors, conformance with established standards and contractibility rest with the Design-Builder.

Typical Design-Build Risks on Transportation Projects Though each project has unique risks, the risks that follow are present on most transportation projects.
3-4.1
Site Conditions and Investigations Certain site condition responsibilities can be allocated to the Design-Builder provided they and any associated third-party approval processes are well defined. However, unreasonable allocation of site condition risks result in high contingency pricing by the Design-Builder. At a minimum, site investigations should be performed by WSDOT to minimize overall project risk and provide the necessary base information for Proposers to complete their pursuit designs without redundant investigations being performed by each Proposer. These investigations typically include the following:
• Basic design surveys — as necessary for the Proposers to complete their proposal design
• Contaminated materials and groundwater investigation — at a minimum to characterize the general nature of mitigation requirements
• Geotechnical investigations — as necessary for Proposers to advance the design of structures foundations, retaining walls, and pavements as required for their proposals
• Utilities investigation — physical determination of horizontal and vertical locations at critical locations of potential conflicts
3-4.2
Utilities Utility responsibilities need to be clearly defined in the Technical Requirements and appropriately allocated to the Design-Builder or WSDOT:
• Private Utilities - WSDOT needs to define coordination and schedule risks as they are difficult for the Design-Builder to price. It is preferable to have Utilities Agreements executed with each private utility before the completion of the procurement. The agreements should define the scope of anticipated relocations, relocation responsibilities (both construction and design), and the schedule for relocations.
• Public Utilities - If the work and approval processes are fully defined in the Technical Requirements, design and construction risks can be allocated to the Design-Builder.

3-4.3
Risk Management
Environmental Permitting Typically, environmental permitting can be more effectively managed by WSDOT because WSDOT has stronger working relationships with the permitting agencies and a better understanding of the processes. However, certain environmental approvals and processes that can be well defined can be allocated to the Design-Builder. Agreements or memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with permitting agencies that define approval requirements and processes can significantly reduce risks to the Design-Builder. In situations where permitting can be clearly defined and allocated to the Design-Builder, scheduling benefits can be recognized.
3-4.4
Right of Way In the majority of design-build projects, WSDOT acquires the Right of Way (ROW) necessary to construct the project. When all of the ROW is not acquired by WSDOT prior to the start of construction, a ROW clearance schedule should be provided in the Technical Requirements to define and minimize schedule risk for the Design-Builder. This schedule becomes part of the contract and provides an assurance to the Proposers that the risk is recognized and allocated to WSDOT. ROW acquisition responsibilities and risk can be transferred to the Design-Builder, with potential schedule benefits, but because WSDOT needs to become involved in any condemnation process, ROW acquisition responsibilities then become a shared risk that must be carefully defined in the Technical Requirements. To avoid the shared risk, preferably WSDOT should perform all of the ROW acquisition.
3-4.5
Railroads The railroad companies are a particularly challenging third-party to manage in designbuild projects. They often require very advanced designs as a condition precedent to their formal approval of grade separation structures over their facilities and before executing construction and maintenance agreements. Their processes introduce a high level of risk to Proposers needing to include the costs and schedules for work that interfaces with the railroad in their proposals. Typically, the risks can be best minimized and managed by WSDOT advancing the designs as much as possible prior to the procurement phase.

Chapter 3
Drainage and Water Quality Often project drainage facilities receive flows from outside the project limits and/or release flows to outside the project limits. When the project design is likely to change historic flow patterns or release volumes, it is necessary to negotiate with adjacent owner agencies for the revised conditions. In this situation, WSDOT is usually in a better position to manage the risk. Ideally, MOUs or Intergovernmental Agreements should be developed to define off-site drainage requirements for the Design-Builder. Water quality requirements are continually evolving and are frequently difficult to define and assess. As a result, water quality is often a high-risk item for the Design-Builder. In most cases, WSDOT has ultimate responsibility for any water that is treated from their ROW, therefore, a prescriptive approach to water quality Technical Requirements that the Design-Builder can rely on minimizes contingency pricing. This allows the Design-Builder to propose more maintenance-efficient and effective alternative systems.
3-4.7
Third-Party Involvement In general, WSDOT can most effectively manage third-party involvement. Railroad companies, the Federal Highway Administration, public utilities commissions, adjacent jurisdictions, funding partners, and other third-parties often have established relationships with WSDOT. In particular, third-party agencies that have contributed funding to the project usually participate in WSDOT’s project management organization and decisionmaking process. In cases where WSDOT can clearly define processes and approval requirements, it can be beneficial to allocate some third-party risks to the Design-Builder, who is in a better position to incorporate those well-defined processes into its design and project schedule.
3-4.8
Construction Many of the traditional materials testing and inspection responsibilities transfer to the Design-Builder. Items such as surveying, spill prevention, and maintenance of traffic shift entirely to the Design-Builder. WSDOT project personnel are still responsible for procuring the services of law enforcement and ensuring that Local Agency and other agreements are in place prior to execution of the contract.
3-4.9
Differing Site Conditions Differing site conditions for work situations are covered in the General Provisions. It is the responsibility of the Design-Builder to prove a Differing Site Condition exists, and that the condition could not reasonably have been worked around as to avoid additional cost. The party that discover such conditions will promptly notify the other party in writing of the specific Differing Site Condition before it is disturbed or affected by work.

Completion and General Warranty Ultimately, the final responsibility and ownership of a project will transfer to WSDOT. This final responsibility and ownership may occur at the completion of the project or at the completion of the general warranty. A contract Completion Date is given once all obligations under the contract (with the exception of warranty work) have been performed by the Design-Builder. The general warranty for work commences on the day Physical Completion is given, and it remains in effect for the time-period stated in the contract. If at any time during the general warranty time-period, WSDOT determines that any of the work has not met the standards set forth in the contract, then the Design-Builder is obligated to correct the work even if the performance of such correction extends beyond the stated general warranty period.
3-4.11
Local Agencies Identifying impacts to communities and developing preliminary agreements regarding site access and mitigation requirements are often part of the conceptual design process. If a Design-Builder’s specific solution goes beyond the predicted impacts, the resulting communication and coordination can rest with the Design-Builder. When an improvement project has a direct impact on a Local Agency, establish all mitigation requirements and limitations between WSDOT and the Local Agency prior to sending out the final RFP. It is WSDOT’s responsibility to provide all Local Agency requirements and local standards in the RFP.
3-4.12
Third-Party/Adjacent Property Owners While WSDOT is in a contractual relationship with the Design-Builder, third-parties and adjacent property owners will expect direct communication with WSDOT. If a third-party benefit is requested (local developer, Local Agency), set up the agreement and establish the performance criteria prior to the RFP.

Refer to the Preparation Guide for Request for Qualification (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP), and Instructions to Proposers (ITP) for a detailed process of procurement document preparation. Prior to initiating the development of the RFQ and RFP, novice project team members should consult with an experienced project team whose members can share their expertise. This transfer of knowledge helps ease the learning curve associated with design-build, encourages the application of best practices, and highlights the pitfalls that other projects have overcome so that they may be avoided from the outset. Note: Make sure the paragraph symbol (show/hide) is active in order to see the instruction boxes in the templates. Note: When fill-in information is added in a template, the author should insert the information by removing the dollar signs and number, but leave the asterisks: ***$$2$$*** becomes ***Information*** If an entire subsection has been altered, then the title of the subsection would be bracketed by asterisks (2.5.3.1 ***General***) Header and Footers should be consistent on all Projects. 1. Remove the template version number and date in the headers and footers on all documents prior to publishing. 2.

Chapter 1 General Provisions RFP Chapter 1 contains the contract General Provisions. It replaces Division 1 of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Standard Specifications M 41-10 and provides the general provisions applicable to design-build delivery. RFP Chapter 1 is largely a standardized document applicable to all WSDOT conventional design-build projects. Though it is largely standardized, it is nonetheless very important for the WSDOT project team to be familiar with its terms, both the parts of the chapter that must be tailored to the project-specific conditions and the key parts that drive the contractual relationships between WSDOT and the Design-Builder. Any changes to RFP Chapter 1 that modify policy, content that may materially affect the intent, or content that may affect Federal eligibility or involve Federal Regulations, must be reviewed and approved by the Washington State Attorney General’s Office and the FHWA.

Use of Design-Build Reference Documents Reference documents may be in the form of environmental documents and decisions, old contract plans or As Built plans, reports, condition surveys, agreements, GSPs, other contracts, photographs, old boring logs, correspondence, and meeting minutes. Reference Documents should be used to provide information that may be useful or of interest to the Proposers in preparing their proposals and executing the contract. Reference Documents are provided to the Design-Builder for use at the DesignBuilder’s risk and come without Department warranties except as specifically provided for in the contract documents. Reference Documents are not to be confused with RFP Technical Requirements. Reference Documents that are going to be included need to be reviewed as a project’s RFP is being developed. Items found within Reference Documents that are viewed as mandatory (not to be left to the decision of the Designer of Record) need to have their context included in the contract documents as a Technical Requirement. Reference Documents are not included in the contract documents for many reasons, including the following:
• The intent may be to show a historical aspect and may be outdated or obsolete;
• The information may have been provided or prepared by parities that the Department has no control or with which the Department has no contractual or legal agreement;
• The document itself may be guidance not a requirement;
• The Designer of Record needs to have the ability to use Reference Documents in the same manner as Department staff;
• The volume of Reference Documents being used on the Department’s designbuild projects creates a high potential for conflict;
• The information may be ambiguous regarding its assignment of responsibility for performance of work; and/or
• The information may have been obtained for a different project or at another time and may or may not represent current conditions, such as geotechnical borings for building projects along the roadway corridor. The Department cannot require work to be done in accordance with all of the Reference Documents, essentially using Reference Documents as the Technical Requirements. An RFP’s technical requirements may incorporate portions of the Reference Documents by reference, thereby converting that portion of the Reference Document into a technical requirement. However, it is preferable to avoid this approach because it can lead to confusion regarding the intent.

Section 2.1: General Information Section 2.1, General Information, provides the project scope and description. Section 2.2: Mandatory Standards Section 2.2, Mandatory Standards, describes how Mandatory Standards are to be followed by the Design-Builder. Refer to Section 2.2 for further information. Section 2.3: Vacant Section 2.3 is currently vacant. Section 2.4: Vacant Section 2.4 is currently vacant. Section 2.5: Surveys and Mapping Introduction Surveying and Mapping creates the base map for all projects. Understanding the basic principles of surveying is important to ensure the project features are constructed at the correct location and elevation. The backbone of all surveying is monuments, which makes it critical to preserve as many monuments as possible. Reference Documents ***$$1$$*** This fill-in describes the method/type of survey used to create the base map. WSDOT typically uses two different methods/types of surveying: LIDAR and standard. Lidar uses a scanner and generates a point cloud that creates a 3D image without point coding. Standard surveying is the traditional method with either a total station and prism, or GPS receiver. All points surveyed using standard methods have point coding. There is also a difference in the accuracy of the points, with standard survey being more precise. ***$$2$$*** This fill in describes the Plane Coordinates Zone. It is either North Zone or South Zone. The area now included in the following counties shall constitute the north zone: Chelan, Clallam, Douglas, Ferry, Island, Jefferson, King, Kitsap, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, San Juan, Skagit, Snohomish, Spokane, Stevens, Whatcom, and that part of Grant lying north of parallel 47° 30’ north latitude. The area now included in the following counties shall constitute the south zone: Adams, Asotin, Benton, Clark, Columbia, Cowlitz, Franklin, Garfield, that part of Grant lying south of parallel 47° 30’ north latitude, Grays Harbor, Kittitas, Klickitat, Lewis, Mason, Pacific, Pierce, Skamania, Thurston, Wahkiakum, Walla Walla, Whitman and Yakima.

***$$3$$*** This fill-in defines the horizontal survey datum for the project. All WSDOT projects use the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). There have been several adjustments to the NAD 83, such as NAD 83/91, NAD 83/07, and NAD 83/11. Survey control monuments may have coordinates associated with each of the NAD 83 adjustments. The user of this section needs to know which adjustment was used when the base map survey data was collected. ***$$4$$*** This is the combined factor used to build the base map and typically matches the Record of Survey. Survey Manager Interagency Agreements and Memoranda In 1990, The Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors (Board), and WSDOT developed an interagency agreement regarding surveying. This agreement allows WSDOT employees to practice land surveying under the direct supervision of a licensed Professional Land Surveyor (PLS) or Professional Engineer (PE), provided the PE competent in the principles of land surveying. The provisions of the interagency agreement between the Board and WSDOT do not extend to design-build consultants. Therefore, the design-build survey manager must be a licensed Professional Land Surveyor, if they are directing or supervising nonlicensed staff performing surveying. WSDOT Monumentation It is important to notify the Region Survey Office when a design-build project is awarded. The timelines specified in this section are short and may be difficult to achieve if the Region Survey Office does not receive advance notification. Record of Surveys and Monument Maps should be reviewed at 30 percent, 60 percent, 90 percent, and draft final stages of completion. When highways were originally constructed, the centerline was monumented. These monuments are the basis for determining WSDOT property ownership. As subsequent construction projects occurred on highways monuments were removed without sufficient documentation to their original positions. It is best to take all precautions not to impact the monuments. If construction activities must impact monuments, the monument location must be accurately determined and tied to other monuments that will not be impacted. Monument Submittal The WSDOT Engineer needs to review the DNR monumentation permit and understand how each monument position will be referenced. Once, an original monument is disturbed or removed there may be no way of determining the original position.

Post Construction Record of Survey In order to meet the 7 day review time allotted the Region Survey Office will need to be informed of monuments impacted and control points set for the project as the project progresses. Section 2.6: Geotechnical Introduction Section 2.6, Geotechnical, defines the technical requirements that the Design- Builder must meet when performing geotechnical work. The chapter defines the technical requirements in two ways: 1. The chapter contains specific language against which the Design-Builder’s work will be evaluated and accepted. 2. The chapter refers the Design-Builder to Mandatory Standards that contain specific language against which the Design-Builder’s work will be evaluated and accepted. It may be necessary to augment, or add to, the current template language to provide project specific technical requirements for work not covered in the base template document. Modifications to the template require the involvement of the Geotechnical Office and the Construction Office. Carefully review the requirements for the decommissioning of wells contained in the template and ensure that the requirements are aligned with the requirements in Chapter 3 of the Geotechnical Design Manual. Coordinate all template revisions related to wells with the Geotechnical Office. For Alternate Technical Concepts (ATC) proposed by the Design-Builder, the DesignBuilder must identify any necessary revisions to Section 2.6, provide revisions to the technical requirements, and receive approval from WSDOT before moving forward with the ATC. Usage The Geotechnical Office will work with the Project Office to add project specific requirements into the RFP language if needed. If the template requires fill-ins, instructions on their use will be included in the template. The author should follow the instructions within the template document. The WSDOT Geotechnical Design Manual (GDM) M 46-03 contains additional guidance in Chapter 22 regarding the geotechnical work necessary for RFP development. Specific preparatory work needed for RFP development, such as subsurface drilling, testing, geotechnical characterization, development of the GDR and GBR, etc., should be discussed with the Geotech office well in advance of the Ad Date. Chapter 22 of the GDM should be consulted for additional background on what is required to be accomplished prior to Ad.

In accordance with the GDM, the Geotechnical Office will prepare a Geotechnical Data Report (GDR), Geotechnical Baseline Report (GBR), and compile pertinent reference geotechnical documentation into a package for prospective Proposers for inclusion in the appendices. Section 2.7: Pavement Introduction WSDOT retains the responsibility for pavement designs on design-build projects. The Region Materials Engineer or the HQ Pavement Office provides a Pavement Design Report that includes the pavement sections and other design requirements needed to construct the project. The requirements of the Pavement Design Report are incorporated into the Section 2.7 template that, along with general design and construction requirements, forms the basis of pavement related plans developed by the Design-Builder. Include the Pavement Design Report in the appendices. Pavement design details not provided for in the Pavement Design Report or Section 2.7 are to be provided by the Design-Builder. WSDOT has found that a State-provided pavement design ensures that the resulting pavement is a good investment. There are many different pavement designs that could work for a project and some will result in a lower initial cost than WSDOT’s design. If the pavement design were left to the Design-Builder, the structure of a design-build contract would encourage the design of the lowest initial cost pavement. However, the pavement with the lowest initial cost is usually not the pavement that has the lowest cost over the pavements life. WSDOT’s policy is to design pavement that results in the lowest life-cycle cost taking into account the cost of maintenance and rehabilitation in addition to the initial cost when determining the appropriate design for a project. This does not restrict the Design-Builder from providing alternate pavement designs. Alternative proposals will be considered provided they are structurally equivalent and equal or lower life- cycle cost than WSDOT’s design. By providing the pavement design, WSDOT ensures a long lasting low life-cycle cost pavement while providing a level playing field for the design-build Proposers. General Fill-in: ***$$1$$*** Elements of pavement work Pavement Sections The pavement sections to be used in the project are shown in the approved pavement design report. The pavement sections for each alignment are inserted into this section. Ensure that every alignment that may require pavement work is included. Include any additional requirements for each pavement section. Example: The compacted depth for the I-5 lanes and shoulders shall be as follows:
• 1.05 feet PCCP with corrosion resistant dowel bars, over
• 0.25 feet HMA Class ½-inch PG 64-22 (0.29 Million mix design ESALs), over

Fill-ins: ***$$1$$*** Mainline SR number or alignment (i.e. I-5 mainline or LR Line) ***$$2$$*** Pavement sections from the Pavement Design Report Local Agency Pavement It is WSDOT policy to design and construct Local Agency pavement to the Local Agency’s standards. Most design-build projects will require the Design-Builder to provide a design for Local Agency pavement. Projects with minor pavement construction on Local Agency facilities may include pavement sections for the Local Agency pavement. In this case, this section can be omitted and the pavement sections for the Local Agency pavement included in Section 2.7.3.1.1. Minimum pavement thicknesses are shown for Local Agencies without pavement design standards. These are intended for low volume roadways that may need pavement work as part of the project. A specific pavement design should be required for higher volume roadways or roadways where substantial work required. Miscellaneous Pavement Miscellaneous pavement includes driveways, parking areas, maintenance access roads, and any other pavement outside the travel lanes and shoulders. Design of these pavement sections is left up to the Design-Builder. Incorporation of Existing HMA into Final Pavement Design This section provides criteria under which WSDOT may allow the reuse of existing pavement. There is some risk that the existing pavement has hidden distress or is too thin to provide adequate structural support. To reduce the risk to WSDOT, minimum requirements for investigating the existing pavement are included in this section. The core information (thickness and photos) should be submitted to the Region Materials Engineer and HQ Pavement Office to determine if the pavement is adequate to carry future traffic. More investigation may be needed if there are questions regarding the quality or thickness of the existing pavement.

Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement Rehabilitation The purpose of pavement rehabilitation is to restore the structural capacity of the pavement and provide a smooth riding surface for future traffic. HMA rehabilitation may include crack sealing, pavement repair, prelevel, an HMA overlay or planing the existing pavement followed by an overlay. The specific requirements will be included in the approved pavement design report. It is important that all distress in the existing pavement be properly identified to ensure the rehabilitated pavement performs well. The pavement design report will detail the types and general locations of distress that needs to be repaired. The Design-Builder is required to identify specific locations of the distress to be repaired and prepare a pavement rehabilitation plan. The pavement rehabilitation plan is WSDOT’s chance to ensure that all of the locations requiring rehabilitation work have been properly identified. The project team should carefully review the plan and verify the type and location of repairs correlate with the condition of the existing pavement in the field. Fill-in: ***$$1$$*** HMA pavement rehabilitation requirements from the Pavement Design Report Crack Sealing Prior to an HMA overlay cracks greater than 0.25 inches wide need to be sealed to prevent the intrusion of water and eliminate voids in the surface to be paved. Where planing bituminous pavement is called for prior to the overlay the cracks will need to be sealed after planing. After planing, many of the cracks will be narrower which must be considered when estimating the quantity. Fill-ins: ***$$#$$*** ***$$1$$*** Estimated quantity (LF) of crack sealing Hot Mix Asphalt Pavement Repair Pavement repair is needed to restore sections of HMA where cracks have propagated through the entire thickness of the HMA reducing the pavement’s capability to carry loads. These areas are usually identified by small (6 to 18 inch) block type cracking where the pavement has begun to depress under loads. These areas should not be confused with age related cracks that do not penetrate full depth of the HMA and will be removed by planing bituminous pavement (if required) before the overlay. Additional evidence such as depressed pavement, pumping of fines or coring to verify crack depth should be used to verify that the cracks extend through the entire thickness of the HMA.

Cement Concrete Pavement Rehabilitation Cement concrete pavement rehabilitation preserves the pavement by replacing broken panels, grinding to provide a smooth pavement, repairing spalled pavement, and restoring load transfer between panels by retrofitting with dowel bars. The specific requirements will be included in the approved pavement design report. Not all projects will require that existing cement concrete pavement be rehabilitated. For projects that do require cement concrete pavement rehabilitation, it is important the requirements be clearly described to ensure that the needed rehabilitation is performed. It is important that all distress in the existing pavement be properly identified to ensure the rehabilitated pavement performs well. The pavement design report will detail the types and general locations of distress that needs to be repaired. The Design-Builder is required to identify specific locations of the distress to be repaired and prepare a pavement rehabilitation plan. The pavement rehabilitation plan is WSDOT’s chance to ensure that all of the locations requiring rehabilitation work have been properly identified. The project team should carefully review the plan and verify the type and location of repairs correlate with the condition of the existing pavement in the field. Fill-in: ***$$1$$*** PCCP pavement rehabilitation requirements from the Pavement Design Report Replace Cement Concrete Panel The goal of cement concrete panel replacement is to replace panels that have a high likelihood of failure.

The requirements for measuring smoothness are included in Section 5-01 of the WSDOT Standard Specifications M 41-10 for cement concrete pavement grinding and Section 5-05 of the WSDOT Standard Specifications M 41-10 for new cement concrete pavement. The incentives and disincentives for smoothness are only applicable to new cement concrete pavement. Cement concrete grinding only needs to meet the minimum MRI requirement. Corrective action is required if the cement concrete grinding does not meet the minimum requirements but there is no incentive or disincentive payment. Hot Mix Asphalt Smoothness HMA pavement smoothness data and testing is provided by the HQ Pavements Office. Designers should follow the instructions of GSP 5-04.3(13).OPT1.FR5 to obtain the existing MRI values to include in Appendix J of the RFP.

Temporary Traffic Detours The Design-Builder may propose detouring traffic to construct the project. The design of the detour is left up to the Design-Builder since WSDOT cannot always predict the location and duration that a detour is needed on a design-build project. WSDOT typically constructs shoulders with thinner pavement than the mainline travel lanes. Thin shoulder will not stand up to prolonged mainline traffic and the pavement structure may need to be increased to carry detour traffic. If the Design-Builder proposes to detour traffic onto a shoulder an evaluation of the shoulders ability to carry traffic will be required. The evaluation may include coring or other means to determine the thickness and underlying condition of the shoulder pavement. If the evaluation shows that the shoulder will not support traffic for the duration of the detour, the shoulder pavement will need to be improved or replaced before traffic is detoured onto it. If a detour is unacceptably rough, contact the HQ Pavements Office for IRI testing. For long duration detours, the Region may consider lowing the required IRI limits. Section 2.8: Environmental Introduction Environmental compliance in design-build can pose a considerable risk to both WSDOT and the Design-Builder. The design-build process allows the Design-Builder latitude in developing a design that varies from the conceptual plans, providing the Design-Builder the opportunity to develop the most efficient or innovative design. However, these variations may change environmental impacts, which could affect project approvals, permits, and the schedule. As a result, early and continued involvement from environmental staff is necessary to identify how the design can be flexible and innovative while ensuring the project scope and RFP is consistent with the regulatory approvals and permits being obtained for the project. The environmental requirements included in Section 2.8, Environmental must clearly identify environmental permitting and mitigation responsibilities to be managed by the Design- Builder. If not, it can lead to schedule and cost risks to the Design-Builder and the Project. This section (as do all the DB template documents) includes fill-in locations that allow the project team to incorporate project-specific information. Please note that some entire sections may need modification to accurately describe project requirements. Furthermore, a project team may need to add a subsection(s) to address unique project requirements (e.g., dredging, fish exclusion, underwater noise monitoring, etc.).

A critical step in the development of Section 2.8, Environmental is the preparation of a Commitments List. This list identifies all of the environmental commitments that the Design-Builder is responsible for implementing during design and construction of the project. It is compiled from all the environmental permits and approvals obtained for or applicable to the project. The Commitments List becomes a contract document and gets included in the RFP as Appendix C1. Section 2.8.4 requires the Design-Builder to implement and report on the fulfillment of these commitments. Additional guidance for tracking environmental commitments can be found in Chapter 490 of the WSDOT Environmental Manual M 31-11. Appendix E contains all the environmental documents related to the project. Examples include the NEPA decision document, Endangered Species Act (ESA) documentation and concurrence, Section 106 concurrence, and wetland and stream memos. In addition, any other studies conducted to gain an understanding of the environment resources that exist within the project area should be included in Appendix E the help the Proposers prepare an accurate proposal. Appendix P contains all the permits obtained for the project. It is worth noting that permits will often include requirements that may apply to WSDOT or to the DesignBuilder, so just including a copy will not necessarily make it clear to the Design-Builder what is expected. The Commitments List spells out the requirements that the DesignBuilder is responsible for implementing. An Environmental flowchart and tables are available for download on the DB Program SharePoint Site to facilitate your understanding of environmental processes in designbuild projects. Usage This section explains how to use the template and provides guidance for certain subsections of Section 2.8, Environmental. This includes guidance for fill-ins, GSP selection, and references to helpful examples or resources for the author. Mandatory Standards If your project includes in-water work that involves the need for a Temporary Stream Diversion, please include the General Special Provision (GSP) for Temporary Stream Diversion 7-06.SA1.FR7 or 7-06.SA2.FR7 (whichever is appropriate for your project) within the Special Provisions in Appendix B. Recommend referencing other applicable GSPs in Section 2.8 and including them in Special Provisions Appendix B. Interagency Agreements and Memoranda If there are agreements with regulatory agencies or the tribes that pertain to the Project, keep this subsection and include the appropriate agreements in Appendix E. If there are no applicable agreements, the author may omit this subsection.

Below are examples of existing interagency agreements that may apply to WSDOT design-build projects. Any commitments that exist within these documents (that are to become the responsibly of the Design-Builder) will need to be spelled out in the Commitments List.
• Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) Concerning Implementation of the Fish and Wildlife Hydraulic Code for Transportation Activities between the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and WSDOT.
• Other project-specific agreements. For example, an MOA between WSDOT, FHWA, the tribes and the Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (DAHP) regarding historic or archaeological resources. Environmental Compliance Manager If the Environmental Compliance Manager was described as Key Personnel in the Request for Qualifications, adjust this section to ensure qualification requirements are in alignment or do not contradict. There is an optional fill-in that can be used if the project is not a linear roadway project. For example, if the project involved the construction of a new Ferry Terminal, the author could include the phrase “and aquatic or marine-related” for the fill-in. Environmental Compliance Inspector The Environmental Compliance Inspector (ECI) shall be responsible for producing a Daily Environmental Inspection Reports (DEIR). A DEIR shall be produced for each day of field Work. The RFP should list out what a DEIR shall include at a minimum. The template includes a couple standard requirements and a fill-in for more requirements. The fill-in allows the RFP author to address unique areas of risk associated with the project. Below are examples of DEIR requirements to consider:
• Project name and Contract number
• Inspectors name
• Date, time, weather conditions and precipitation totals
• Inspections performed and the results of the inspections, including specific location in the case of projects with multiple stages or work areas
• A list of special inspections performed (Hold Points) and the results
• A list of BMP maintenance or additions needed
• Documentation of communications with the ESC Lead regarding BMP maintenance or additions needed
• Documentation of required water quality testing performed and the results of these tests
• A copy of any checklist used in performing the inspection

If your Project has a significant amount of earth moving and acres of soils disturbed, consider adding a subsection under Personnel Requirements below the Environmental Compliance Inspector subsection to require the Design-Builder to hire a full-time Erosion and Sediment Control (ESC) Lead. If you add a new subsection, consider using the following language: “Erosion and Sediment Control Lead The ESC Lead shall be assigned to the Project and be available on-site, full-time until Ecology approves the Notice of Termination for the Project’s NPDES permit. A commitment of less than full-time may be approved by the WSDOT Engineer based on Project needs and time of year.” Note, additional ESC Lead requirements are currently listed under the Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Plan subsection. Environmental Meetings Modify this section based on project specific requirements. For example, consider adding an additional subsection after the Kick-Off Meeting if the Project requires an Environmental Preconstruction Meeting. An example of a new subsection follows: “Environmental Preconstruction Meeting The Design-Builder shall organize and lead an environmental preconstruction meeting with WSDOT and any necessary regulatory agencies ***$$1$$*** Calendar Days prior to the start of construction activities. During the environmental preconstruction meeting, the Design-Builder shall discuss the ECP, including its environmental training program, to demonstrate how the DesignBuilder shall meet permit conditions and fulfill environmental commitments. The Design-Builder shall discuss its construction schedule and identify the early construction elements.” If the Project has a significant number of commitments, consider adding a subsection that requires Environmental Commitments Review Meetings. An example of a new subsection follows: “Environmental Commitments Review Meetings The Design-Builder’s ECM shall organize and implement monthly environmental commitment review meetings with WSDOT during design and construction to ensure that the Project meets all Project environmental commitments included in the Environmental Commitments List (Appendix C). The ECM shall review environmental commitments at each meeting and work with WSDOT staff to close out commitments as they are met throughout the life of the Contract.”

Part II: Environmental Plans and Strategies Add subsections for any Project-specific plans that the Design-Builder must prepare, as required. Examples include:
• Soil and Groundwater Management Plan,
• Concrete Containment and Disposal Plan,
• Temporary Stream Diversion Plan,
• Fish and Aquatic Species Exclusion Plan,
• Invasive Plant Species Monitoring and Control Plan
• Worker and Public Health and Safety Plan. Others may be required depending on your Project-specific commitments. If there are expectations or minimum plan requirements, be sure to include those in the appendices of your RFP and reference them. For example, the WSDOT General Special Provision (GSP) regarding Temporary Stream Diversion (either 7-06.SA1.FR7 or 7-06.SA2.FR7, whichever is appropriate for each culvert site). Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan This subsection states that the Design-Builder’s SPCC Plan shall meet the “SPCC Plan Requirements” provided in Appendix E. These requirements were adapted from the existing SPCC requirements listed in Section 1-07.15(1) of the WSDOT Standard Specifications M 41-10 so they would be appropriate for a design-build project. Click here for the most recent copy of the SPCC Plan Requirements for inclusion in Appendix E. Water Quality Monitoring Monitoring Plan for In-Water Work Include this subsection if the project involves in-water work and has the potential to violate State surface water quality standards (WAC 173-201A). In-water work consists of work that occurs below the Ordinary High Water Mark (OHWM) of lakes and streams or work that occurs below the Mean Higher High Water (MHHW) in tidal areas. You must modify this subsection in the template depending on the whether you have an individual 401 Water Quality Certification from Ecology, or if you have a Section 401 Letter of Verification (LOV) or “no further action” from the Army Corps. If left alone, this subsection will lead to confusion since the two pathways have redundant but inconsistent requirements. If the Project requires an individual 401 Water Quality Certification from Ecology, include only the first two paragraphs of this subsection (shown below in quotes), and strike the remaining paragraphs: “The Design-Builder shall prepare a WQMPP as a Type 3 Working Drawing and submit it to the WSDOT Engineer for Review and Comment ***$$1$$*** Calendar Days prior to beginning in-water work so WSDOT can work with Ecology to Page 4-34

get the required approval. The WSDOT Engineer may grant the Design-Builder permission to coordinate directly with Ecology in preparing their submittal. The WQMPP shall address all of the requirements identified within the Section 401 Water Quality Certification (Appendix P) issued to WSDOT. WSDOT has guidance that was developed in collaboration with Ecology for preparing a WQMPP and sampling water quality, which is available on WSDOT’s website under Environmental Commitments and Compliance. All costs, delays, or both that result from not having an Ecology-approved WQMPP shall be the Design-Builder’s responsibility, in accordance with Section 1-04 of the General Provisions. The Design-Builder shall be responsible for updating the WQMPP in accordance with the requirements of the Section 401 Water Quality Certification (Appendix P). If monitoring shows the activity is out of compliance, the Design- Builder shall immediately stop the in-water work that is causing noncompliance with the water quality standard and notify the WSDOT Engineer. The Design-Builder shall provide the sampling results to WSDOT on a weekly basis during in-water construction.” If the project has a Section 404/10 Nationwide Permit that is automatically certified (i.e., no further action from the Army Corps) or receives a Section 401 Letter of Verification (LOV) from Ecology, strike the first two paragraphs of this subsection, and include only the third and subsequent paragraphs (shown below in quotes): “The Design-Builder shall prepare a water quality monitoring plan as a Type 3 Working Drawing, and submit it to the WSDOT Engineer for Review and Comment. The water quality monitoring plan shall identify how the Design-Builder will comply with State water quality standards contained in WAC 173-201A and authorized by U.S.C.

The Design-Builder shall update the water quality monitoring plan during construction of the project to address changes required to meet water quality standards. The Design- Builder shall submit updates to the water quality monitoring plan to the WSDOT Engineer.” National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Construction Stormwater General Permit Sampling Only include this subsection if the project triggers an NPDES Construction Stormwater General Permit (CSWGP). Bird Protection Plan This subsection states that the Design-Builder’s Bird Protection Plan shall be prepared in accordance with the WSDOT Bird Protection Protocols and Standards provided in Appendix E. Click here to get the most recent copy of the Bird Protection Protocols and Standards for inclusion in Appendix E Permits and Approvals Permit Acquisition WSDOT has determined that the Design-Builder shall obtain the NPDES CSWGP because the application (Notice of Intent (NOI)) requires specific information that will be based on the Design-Builder’s approach. If the project team does not want the Design-Builder to obtain the CSWGP, then they must obtain approval from the WSDOT Assistant State Construction Engineer assigned to their region or mode. Some projects will trigger supplemental data submittals to Ecology during the NOI process. For example, projects with:
• New outfalls to surface waters that are impaired (303(d) or TMDL) for turbidity, fine sediment, pH, or phosphorus, and/or;
• Known existing site contamination (soil or groundwater). WSDOT maintains NOI guidance to assist in various aspects of the submittal requirements that can be found on the Erosion Control Policies and Procedures webpage:
• General submittal requirements
• Existing Contamination
• Discharges to Impaired Waters Page 4-36
Design-Build Manual M 3126.05 
Structure and Content of the Procurement
Chapter 4
The Design-Builder may trigger supplemental data submittal(s) during the NOI process, which could result in additional environmental commitments. The cost of compliance during construction will depend on the extent of existing contamination that will be disturbed and the potential to discharge into an impaired waterbody. Additional environmental commitments may include:
• Enhancements to pollution prevention planning documents (e.g., TESC, SPCC, dewatering or concrete handling plans) for impairments or contamination
• Specific performance expectations for contamination
• Monitoring, sampling, and reporting requirements for impairments or contamination (these requirements could be triggered by presence of hazardous materials or Section S8 of the CSWGP)
• Administrative Order for contamination If the Project has complex surface water environmental risks or existing known contamination that will likely be disturbed, WSDOT should clearly describe this in Section 2.8, Environmental including the potential for increased costs associated with compliance. The Design Builder is ultimately responsible for identifying all receiving water outfalls (that may receive a discharge) and known contamination based on readily available data during the NOI process. This responsibility includes all areas disturbed by construction and construction support activity (including off-site areas that meet the CSWGP criteria). Failure to identify all outfalls and contamination during the NOI process may lead to permitting delays, including NOI resubmittal and additional public notice in accordance with General Condition 20 (G20) of the CSWGP. Permit Compliance, Modifications, and Additional Approvals Coordinate with region or mode environmental staff when the Design-Builder proposes an alternative construction method or a design change(s) to determine whether the change is consistent with the initial environmental permit applications and documentation. If the change(s) alter the Project description or the methods and means previously described, then WSDOT may need to contact regulatory agencies or tribes to determine if reevaluation or permit modifications are necessary. Examples of items to review for changes to environmental permits and documentation include:
• Alternative Technical Concept (pre-proposal)
• Change Order
• Notice of Design Change (NDC)
• Field Change Request (FCR)
• Nonconforming Issue (NCI)
• Nonconformance Report (NCR)

Threatened and Endangered Species If the Project utilizes the WSDOT/FHWA Programmatic Biological Assessment (PBA) to ensure compliance with the ESA, reference and include completed Project Notification Forms (PNF) in Appendix E and reference PBA minimization measures included in the Environmental Commitments List (Appendix C). Consider adding (and modifying if necessary) the following language that informs the Design-Builder of risks associated with designs exceeding thresholds for coverage under the PBA: “If the Design-Builder modifies design or construction activities from those described in the *** WSDOT United State Fish and Wildlife Services (USFWS) and WSDOT National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) Project Notification Forms (PNF) ***, ESA consultation may have to be re-initiated. If this occurs, the DesignBuilder shall work through WSDOT to provide the necessary information required to determine if re-initiation of ESA is needed. If reinitiation is needed, then the Design-Builder shall work through WSDOT to provide the necessary information required for re-initiation of ESA consultation. WSDOT will take the lead in coordinating with USFWS and NMFS. If ESA consultation needs to be re-initiated due to changes made by the Design-Builder, all cost and schedule impacts shall be the Design-Builder’s responsibility. The *** WSDOT USFWS and NMFS PNFs *** contains a number of performance standards. Performance standards have been included in the Environmental Commitments List (Appendix C). The Design-Builder shall fulfill and report on the implementation of performance standards and environmental commitments in the Environmental Commitments Close Out Report described in this Section.” Submittals Make sure this subsection is consistent with the general and Project-specific submittals described in the Environmental Plans and Strategies subsection. Review the bullets and sub-bullets in the Submittals subsection, and add or delete plans as necessary (e.g., Soil and Groundwater Management Plan, plans for temporary stream diversion, Worker Health and Safety Plan, Air Quality and Fugitive Dust Control Plan). Section 2.9: Communications Section 2.9, Communications, contains the requirements for handling internal and external communications about the project. It plays a strategic role in obtaining stakeholder and public consensus for the project. WSDOT will lead communications on projects. The extent of the Design-Builder’s support will depend on the WSDOT region communications office’s ability to devote the necessary time and resources to the project. For some projects, WSDOT may want to take the lead on most communications efforts while the Design-Builder will provide support by supplying construction closure info, drafting key messages, noise flyers, etc. In other cases, WSDOT may want the Design-Builder to do most of the work, while WSDOTretains approval rights for any communications written/created by the Design-Builder. The correct approach for the project may also depend on the sensitivity of the public. Page 4-38

The WSDOT project team, which should include personnel from the region communications office, determines the best approach and the requirements for this section. When developing Section 2.9, consideration must be given to the flow of communication. The flow of communication must consider internal employees, the general public, stakeholders, media, and other governmental agencies. Each group has unique requirements and deadlines for receipt or dissemination of information. The WSDOT project team must consider each group’s needs and determine the best method and timelines for handling information. Section 2.9 should also include requirements for public outreach such as a hotline, project signs, and project website. Public outreach may also require meetings with the general public, stakeholders, media, and governmental agencies. Section 2.9 should include information on the following topics:
• Mandatory Standards
• Joint responsibilities, WSDOT responsibilities, and Design-Builder responsibilities
• Project communications plan requirements

Section 2.10: Utilities and Relocation Agreements Introduction WSDOT retains the responsibility to work with public utilities for reimbursement or compensation for relocation of their facilities. It is important to provide utility locations to the Design-Builder. Due to time constraints placed on the Design-Builder, it is likely that the Design-Builder will assume that all existing utilities are in good condition unless noted otherwise, although utility As Builts are a Reference Document and should be relied upon.

Utilities will already have an existing agreement with WSDOT or a Local Agency. During the preliminary site investigation, determine the location and condition of all utilities. In preliminary design, identify any utilities that will be impacted and, whenever possible, relocate them prior to the Design-Builder beginning work. An exception would be for a multi-season project that has the potential for an innovative solution that could change utility impacts. In this case, it may be prudent to delay utility relocation until after award. If relocation must be done in conjunction with the design-build contract, give the Design- Builder responsibility for and control of the relocation itself. Establishing a cost for potential coordination delays can impact the overall price of a contract. If the preliminary agreement with a utility (public or private) requires modification as a result of the Design-Builder’s final design, the risk and responsibility for this delay should rest with the Design-Builder. In urban environments, consider a full subsurface utility investigation if the conditions of the existing facilities could potentially impact the project schedule. Care should be taken to ensure a franchise agreement or permit exists. Expired permits should be addressed prior to ad. Usage Mandatory Standards: Verify the list of Mandatory Standards and their hierarchy listed in the template for accuracy for the project and add any other project-specific Mandatory Standards in the fill-in. Protection in Place List any additional Protect in Place requirements or agreement commitments in the fill-in. Section 2.11: Roadway Introduction Section 2.11, Roadway, outlines the contract requirements for roadway design and grading elements including design criteria that Design-Builder must follow. With the inclusion of practical design in WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01, there is a significant amount of flexibility afforded the designer and the Engineer of Record. The project team needs to verify the appropriate level of flexibility that should be allowed based on context and modal needs in the Basis of Design and include appropriate minimum requirements in the RFP. Where minimum criteria called out in the WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01 are not the desired end result, the project team should identify controlling criteria that meet the needs of the project. These controlling criteria should be identified in the RFP in the Basic Configuration.

Usage Mandatory Standards: Verify the list of Mandatory Standards and their hierarchy listed in the template for accuracy for the project and add any other project-specific Mandatory Standards in the fill-in. Design Criteria Although WSDOT develops Conceptual Plans, the Design-Builder will likely propose revisions to WSDOT’s roadway design within the given constraints in this section. This section needs to outline the roadway design criteria that Design-Builder must meet in order to meet project needs. The project-specific design criteria could be identified in design documents such as Basis of Design, Design Analysis, or environmental and community engagement processes resulting in project commitments or constraints. During the RFP development, the project team needs to evaluate inclusion of project specific design criteria and determine where the WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01 minimums need to be revised to meet project needs such as:
• Design Speed
• Design Vehicle
• Pedestrian and Bike requirements
• Cross-Slope
• Median Cross-Overs
• Superelevation Rate
• Enforcement Areas
• Maximum or Minimum Profile Grade
• Highway Classification and access control
• Cut/Fill slope
• Reference to Pre-Approved Design Analysis
• Clear Zone Roadside Barrier Selection & Impact Attenuators
Include these sections in the RFP if guardrail or concrete barrier may be included in the project or if elements such as guardrail are to be prohibited. The fill-ins may include a barrier type preference such as single slope concrete barrier, minimum exposed height, or any other project specific criteria. The WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01 provides guidance on the types of barrier that could be considered and the project team should review the guidance and may include the acceptable barriers and impact attenuators for site-specific conditions, locations, or corridor consistency. Fencing Include this section if the Design-Builder needs to address existing or new fence on the project. If fencing is included, the project team should develop a Design Document identifying the criteria for constructing, repairing, or replacing fence as part of the conceptual design approval package.

Fall Protection Include this section in projects requiring fall protection for pedestrian facilities or future maintenance of project elements such as culverts, walls, steep reinforced slopes. Side Slopes Include in all projects that include earthwork and side slopes. Maintenance Access Existing maintenance access roads that need to remain should be identified in the Conceptual Plans. The project team should also evaluate future maintenance needs for drainage, illumination, landscaping etc. and include any project specific requirements in the RFP. Break In Limited Access Include this section in all projects with limited access. Necessary breaks in limited access must be pre-approved in accordance with the WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01. Break in limited access on interstate requires FHWA approval. The fill-ins identify the location of limited access breaks and any specific purpose of their intent or if no breaks are allowed in the project. Channelization Design Include this section in projects with proposed channelization revisions. Fill-in #1 is intended to identify project specific locations such as intersections, ramps, and ramp meter storage etc. where the Design-Builder must provide minimum configuration identified in the conceptual channelization plans. Pedestrian Facilities Include in all projects that impact existing pedestrian facilities or to identify project specific pedestrian improvements included in the project. Noise Walls Include this section in projects with noise walls and provide project specific noise wall requirements (height, location etc.) and their configuration in accordance with the environmental commitments. When landscaping is required along noise walls, make sure that Section 2.15 language is consistent with this section. Rumble Strips Include this section in projects with rumble strips. Fill-ins to identify types and location of rumble strips specific to the project.

Design Parameter Worksheet Include this section in all projects. The project team as part of the conceptual design approval package must develop the design parameter table and identify the criteria used for the conceptual design. The project team should thoroughly evaluate the range of dimensions allowed for each element in order to determine an acceptable minimum because the Design-Builder will typically choose allowable minimums for bidding purposes. The Design-Builder updates the design parameter table based on the final design and constructed project. Roadside Barrier Technical Memorandum Include in all projects that may affect existing barrier or require new roadside barrier. Impact Attenuator Technical Memorandum Include in all projects that may affect existing impact attenuator or require new attenuator. Section 2.12: Project Documentation Introduction Section 2.12, Project Documentation, identifies the project documentation requirements for both design and construction on a design-build project. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01, Chapter 300 provides guidance on the design procedures, Design Documentation, and approval requirements necessary to deliver successful highway projects. For design-build projects, WSDOT is responsible for acquiring Conceptual Design Approval including approval of known Design Analyses prior to advertisement of the RFP documents. Involve the ASDE (and FHWA as necessary) early on during Preliminary Engineering. The Design-Builder is responsible for acquiring the Project Development Approval and preparing the Design Documentation package. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01, Chapter 300 provides guidance on approval authorities for various Design Documents dependent on FHWA oversight. Project documentation requirements for construction documents is included in the WSDOT Construction Manual M 41-01 including requirements for temporary and permanent final records. In order to avoid a lengthy close out process, the project team and Design-Builder close out task force should start developing project documentation as early as possible, and it is recommended that documentation be finalized as the project is progressed and various project phases are completed. Usage Mandatory Standards: Verify the list of Mandatory Standards and their hierarchy listed in the template for accuracy for their project and add any other project specific Mandatory Standard in the fill-in such as regional Channelization Plan Checklist, etc. Page 4-46
