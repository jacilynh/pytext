WSDOT Pavement Policy
1. INTRODUCTION 1.1
PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to establish a uniform policy for the selection of pavement types, design of pavement structures, determining rehabilitation methods and selecting pavement materials for use by Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) pavement designers throughout the state. It is not intended as a replacement for engineering judgment. Nor is it a comprehensive manual on pavement design and designers using this document should have a basic understanding of pavement design, pavement construction and paving materials.
1.2
RELATIONSHIP TO WSDOT DESIGN MANUAL
Pavement design information previously contained in the Design Manual is largely replaced by this document. Refer to Division 6 of the Design Manual for any additional pavement related information.
1.3
SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY
This manual is intended for design of highway pavement and other facilities that are part of Washington’s highway system. Facilities owned by WSDOT but not part of the highway system are not required to comply with this document. Pavement and facilities maintained by local agencies should be designed to the standards of the local agency. This manual contains standards for selecting pavement types, designing pavement structures and selecting pavement materials. Specific requirements for pavement materials are covered in other WSDOT manuals including the Standard Specifications and the Materials Manual. This document is maintained by the Multimodal Development and Delivery Construction Division State Pavement Office (State Pavement Office). The State Pavement Office should be contacted with any questions regarding this manual.

WSDOT Pavement Policy
2. BASIS OF WSDOT DESIGN POLICY 2.1
BACKGROUND
WSDOT’s pavement design policy is a product of experience, research findings (state, national and international) and various analyses. The policy is based upon pavement design practices that WSDOT has found to produce serviceable and cost effective pavements for the conditions in Washington State. Generally, these practices follow conventional pavement design procedures. Practices that have shaped WSDOT’s pavement design policy include:
•
Designing pavement structures for long-life (50 years or more),
•
Designing HMA pavement to ensure that cracking occurs from the top down instead of from the bottom up,
•
Reusing the existing pavement structure as much as practical when rehabilitating an existing pavement, and
•
Incorporating pavement preservation at both the capital project level as well as the state forces maintenance level.
These practices are the basis of many of the requirements in this pavement design policy. Background information describing how these practices came about is provided in following sections.
2.2
PCCP
The policy of designing long-life portland cement concrete pavement (PCCP) grew out of the historical performance of PCCP in Washington.
Paving concrete used in Washington has
historically performed well structurally and has not suffered from any significant durability problems.
The limiting failure mechanisms have been those that do not involve the concrete
material itself such as faulting, roughness and studded tire wear. The performance of the paving concrete makes long life PCCP feasible provided the non-concrete material related failure mechanisms are designed to perform over a long design life. The following describes the strategies used by WSDOT for each PCCP design element to design long life PCCP.

WSDOT Pavement Policy 2.2.1
THICKNESS
WSDOT designed the PCCP constructed during the 1960’s and 1970’s as part of the original interstate construction with an 8 or 9 inch thickness. Originally designed for a 20-year life, many are still in service, far exceeding their design lives; although most have required rehabilitation activities such as dowel bar retrofits and grinding. With a moderate increase in thickness to account for increased equivalent single axle loads (ESALs), the structural performance of the earlier pavements show that PCCP in Washington could be constructed to resist structural failure for 50 years or more. Washington allows studded tires from November through March. Rutting (wear) in the wheel paths due to studded tires has been deep enough to require correction on some PCCP sections. Wear due to studded tires will continue to be a problem. WSDOT designs new PCCP with an extra inch of thickness to account for diamond grinding to remove ruts caused by studded tire wear. 2.2.2
DURABILITY
PCCP in Washington have not suffered from significant durability problems that can limit pavement life in other parts of the country. The durability of Washington’s PCCP primarily arises from the availability of high quality aggregates. Supplies of high quality aggregates appear to be available for the foreseeable future allowing the production of concrete that can provide a long pavement life. 2.2.3
JOINTING AND LOAD TRANSFER
A major failure mechanism that affected the performance of WSDOT’s original PCCP sections was load transfer at transverse joints. Originally constructed without dowel bars, PCCP was susceptible to faulting. Many of these PCCP sections required rehabilitation in the form of dowel bar retrofits and grinding. To address faulting, new pavements are doweled to improve joint load transfer. Experience has shown that spacing transverse contraction joints at 15 feet did not result in significant amounts of shrinkage cracking. The 15-foot spacing was retained as the standard spacing for transverse contraction joints.

WSDOT Pavement Policy 2.2.4
DOWEL BAR MATERIALS
A long pavement life necessitates that dowel bars be able to resist corrosion. Inspection of epoxy coated dowel bars removed from in service pavements revealed that they are susceptible to corrosion under Washington conditions. To achieve a long life, WSDOT requires stainless steel or equivalent dowels in all new PCCP (see Appendix 1 for dowel bar materials). Epoxy coated dowel bars are allowed in applications that do not have as long of a life such as dowel bar retrofits and replacing damaged panels in an existing PCCP. 2.2.5
PCCP BASE
In the past, base depths under PCCP were determined primarily by the requirement for support of construction traffic. Currently, it is recognized that the layer directly beneath PCCP slabs is a critical element in the performance of PCCP. WSDOT has previously used asphalt treated base (ATB) to support construction traffic prior to placement of PCCP. Subsequent WSDOT experience has indicated variable performance for ATB material beneath various Interstate PCCP. For this reason, HMA base is required as the supporting layer for PCCP slabs for high traffic roadways.
2.3
HMA PAVEMENT
WSDOT’s bases its long-life HMA design policy on constructing thicker pavements so that cracking will primarily be top down. Cracks in HMA pavements, thicker than approximately 6 inches, tend to start at the top of the pavement and propagate down instead of starting at the bottom and propagating up. By correcting surface distress on a thicker HMA pavement before it propagates into the lower layers, the underlying structure can be preserved allowing the pavement to have a long life. 2.3.1
THICKNESS
Traditional HMA pavement design methods have focused on providing a structure that limits the amount of bottom-up cracking over the pavement’s life. This method can allow the use of thinner HMA thicknesses which reduce costs during the initial construction. In these methods, cracking starts at the bottom of the pavement and progress upwards through the entire pavement structure. At the end of the pavement’s life, bottom-up cracking becomes widespread resulting in the pavement losing its ability to carry loads. Restoring the load carrying capacity requires a costly rehabilitation or reconstruction that usually requires replacement or reprocessing of the existing HMA pavement structure. WSDOT has found that cracking in thicker HMA pavement occurs from 
5
WSDOT Pavement Policy the top down. If timely preservation is performed to correct the top-down cracking, damage to the underlying layers can be prevented thus preserving the pavement structure. It is WSDOT’s policy to use a long design life that results in a relatively thick HMA pavement structure. The thick HMA pavement can then be preserved using thin mill and inlay projects that remove the top-down cracks by milling off the top lift of HMA and inlaying with an equal thickness of new HMA. The thicker pavement costs more for initial construction but this cost is offset by the savings realized by the lower cost to preserve the pavement. 2.3.2
HMA PRESERVATION
The goal of HMA preservation is to protect the underlying structure by replacing top layers before distress that initiates at the top of the pavement damages the underlying structural layers. WSDOT employs two complimentary strategies to preserve HMA pavement. The first is the thin mill and inlay mentioned above. The goal of the mill and inlay is to remove the top layer of HMA which eliminates most of the top-down cracks and the aged, crack-susceptible top layer of HMA and replaces it with new HMA. The second strategy is to use preservation treatments such as crack sealing, surface treatments and patching to extend the time between the thin mill and inlay projects.
2.4
SURFACE TREATMENT PAVEMENTS
Chip seals are a major surface treatment used by WSDOT due to their simplicity, low cost and the ability to withstand studded tire wear. Although they are not often thought of as long-life pavement structures, the underlying pavement structure on a chip seal roadway can have a long life. This requires that additional chip seals be periodically applied to prevent water intrusion and damage to the underlying structure. Despite the frequent reapplication of the chip seal surface, these types of roadway can have a much lower life cycle cost than PCCP or HMA roadways provided the location and traffic levels are appropriate.
2.5
RE-USE OF EXISTING PAVEMENT STRUCTURES
For existing pavement structures that require significant structural enhancements, long-lasting pavements can be achieved by incorporation of the existing pavement. Structural designs that incorporate the existing pavement are similar to new pavement designs but considerations associated with the existing pavement are required.
A reliable procedure is available that
identifies when existing pavements can be used in-place and the methods necessary to 
6
WSDOT Pavement Policy incorporate the original material into the new pavement structure while achieving long life. Recent national research aided by information and support from WSDOT has provided additional understanding and design aids for achieving long-lasting designs which incorporate the existing (or modified) pavement structure. The national research produced “rePave” which is used by WSDOT for selecting rehabilitation strategies.
2.6
PAVEMENT PRESERVATION
WSDOT uses principles associated with pavement preservation to manage the state highway system. The preservation cycle begins immediately after construction since the effects of traffic, climate, and traction devices will deteriorate pavement structures. Preservation starts with how a new or reconstructed pavement structure is designed and constructed and continues through the complete life-cycle.

3. PAVEMENT DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 3.1
DESIGN PERIOD
The design period is the time from original construction to a terminal condition for a pavement structure. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) essentially defines design period, design life and performance period as being the same terms. AASHTO defines an analysis period as the time for which an economic analysis is to be conducted. Further, the analysis period can include provisions for periodic surface renewal or rehabilitation strategies which will extend the overall service life of a pavement structure before complete reconstruction is required. The design period used by WSDOT is chosen so that the design period traffic will result in a pavement structure sufficient to survive through the analysis period.
It is recognized that
intermittent treatments will be needed to preserve the surface quality and ensure that the structure lasts through the analysis period. The required design period for all WSDOT highways is 50 years. The 50-year design period can be reduced for unique, project specific conditions such as temporary pavement sections, HOV lanes, future realignment or grade changes. Doubling the design period equivalent singe axle loads (ESALs) adds about 0.5 to 1.0 inches of HMA or PCCP to the required initial structural thickness of a HMA or PCCP design. As such, modest increases in pavement thickness can accommodate significantly increased traffic as characterized by ESALs.
3.2
TRAFFIC
The volume and character of traffic, expressed in terms of 18,000 lb. ESALs, is a measure of the traffic loading experienced by a pavement. The ESAL loading on a highway strongly influences pavement structural design requirements. Both HMA and PCCP pavement structures can be designed to meet any ESAL requirement; however, this does not imply similar maintenance and rehabilitation requirements.

WSDOT Pavement Policy 3.3
SUBGRADE SOILS
The characteristics of native soils directly affect the pavement structure design.
A careful
evaluation of soil characteristics is a basic requirement for each individual pavement structure design. Subgrade resilient modulus is the primary material input into the AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993).
3.4
FROST ACTION
Greater depths of base or selected free-draining borrow materials are necessary in areas where frost action is severe or the subgrade soil is extremely weak. The total depth of the pavement structure is extremely important in high frost penetration areas. Additional thickness of non-frost susceptible base or subbase materials has been effectively used to combat this problem. An effective measure is to have the pavement structure (total of surface and base courses) equal to at least one-half the maximum expected depth of freeze when the subgrade is classified as a frost susceptible soil. The depth of freeze is based on the design freezing index (30 year temperature record) or measurements made by WSDOT during the severe winter of 1949-1950 (Appendix 2). The winter of 1949-1950 produced the greatest depth of freeze during the past 70 years.
3.5

WSDOT Pavement Policy
4. PAVEMENT TYPE SELECTION There are three primary areas that must to be addressed to select a pavement type: pavement design analysis, life cycle cost analysis, and project specific details. Each of these areas can have a significant impact on the selected pavement type and requires a detailed analysis. The overall process is shown in Figure 4.1. The specific requirements for each step and examples are included in Appendix 3 through 8. Pavement type selection is applicable to all new alignments including ramps, roundabouts, collector-distributors, acceleration-deceleration lanes, and existing pavement reconstruction on interstate, principal arterials, and any other roadway that may benefit from this analysis. Pavement type selection is not necessary for chip seal surfaced roadways.
For mainline
widening, if the selected pavement type is the same pavement type as the existing, then a pavement type selection is not required.
When comparing life cycle costs of the different
alternatives, the comparison must be based on the total costs, which include initial construction, maintenance, rehabilitation, and user costs. Pavement types shall be considered equal if the total cost difference (including all the costs listed above) for the higher cost alternative does not exceed the lower cost alternative by more than 10 percent. Otherwise, the lower cost alternative shall be selected.
4.1
APPLICATION OF PAVEMENT TYPE SELECTION
The following is a list of considerations for new construction or reconstruction of mainline, ramps, collector-distributors, roundabouts, acceleration-deceleration lanes, intersections and shoulders. 
Mainline new and reconstructed: A pavement type selection must be completed on all mainline pavements that are more than 1 lane mile in length or pavement cost more than $1.0 million except those highways designated as having or is planned to have a chip seal surface. For roadway segments shorter in length or lower in cost, Contact the State Pavement Office for further direction on the need to conduct a pavement type selection.

Ramps: Both PCCP and HMA shall be considered for ramps with mature geometrics (where lane configuration or right of way restricts the expansion of the roadway footprint), high traffic and high truck percentages.
13
WSDOT Pavement Policy 
Collector-Distributors: Design collector-distributors similar to ramps above.

Roundabouts: Construct roundabouts with the same pavement type as the intersecting roadway. If the proposed pavement type is different from the mainline pavement type a life cycle cost justification is required.

Acceleration-Deceleration Lanes: Treat the same as collector-distributors.

Intersections: Most intersections will not require an analysis separate from the rest of the highway. Intersections with chronic rutting should be examined in detail to determine the nature and cause of the rutting and whether alternate pavement types should be considered.
Contact the State Pavement Office for further guidance and direction
regarding options for addressing chronic intersection rutting. 
Shoulders: The choice of HMA or PCCP shoulders for new PCCP is dependent upon the future use of the roadway structure. When evaluating the use of PCCP shoulders the initial capitalization costs must be considered in addition to the life-cycle cost. Any increase in initial cost for PCCP shoulders must be approved by the State Pavement Office. Future traffic in this context implies either diverted traffic, construction or the shoulder will become a primary lane of traffic at a future date. o
Shoulders Will Not be used for Future Traffic: Shoulders for this application are designed as HMA pavement.
o
Shoulders will be used for Future Traffic: Shoulders for this application may be designed as HMA or PCCP. Design PCCP shoulders to be used for future traffic the full width of the future lane and for the anticipated ESALs. Construct PCCP shoulders for future traffic with HMA base, tie bars and dowels.
o
Urban Roadways: It is recommended that shoulders be constructed with the same section used for mainline PCCP including HMA base, tie bars and dowels.
4.2
SUBMITTAL PROCESS
The pavement type selection, including all applicable subsections (pavement design analysis, cost estimate and life cycle cost analysis, including the results of the RealCost evaluation including all applicable RealCost input files and project specific details shall be submitted electronically to the Pavement Design Engineer at the State Pavement Office. The pavement type selection analysis shall be reviewed and distributed to the Pavement Type Selection Committee (Appendix 3 through 7) for approval. The report submittal shall include detailed

5. NEW PAVEMENT DESIGN 5.1
DESIGN PROCEDURES
"New pavement design" shall include reconstructed as well as new pavement structures. The primary design procedure for pavement structures is the AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993); however, the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG version 1.0) along with WSDOT pavement historical data and experience was used in the development and validation of the design tables. Minimum layer thicknesses are controlled by requirements contained in Section 8.2.3. Requirements for maximum lift thicknesses are specified within WSDOT's Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction (which also describes other pavement material requirements such as gradation, fracture, cleanliness, etc.).
5.2
DETERMINATION OF FLEXIBLE PAVEMENT LAYER THICKNESSES
5.2.1
INTRODUCTION
Layer thicknesses and total pavement structure over subgrade soils for HMA pavements are based on four criteria: 
Depth to provide a minimum level of serviceability for the design period recognizing that periodic surface renewals may be needed,

Depth to prevent excessive rutting,

Depth to prevent premature fatigue cracking of the HMA layers, and

Depth to provide adequate frost depth protection.
5.2.2
MAINLINE ROADWAY
The structural design of mainline flexible pavements can be broadly divided into those with fewer than 1,000,000 ESALs for the design period and those greater than 1,000,000 ESALs. Those pavements with AADT less than 10,000 shall be considered for a chip seal wearing course over CSBC. For pavements with ESALs less than 1,000,000 and ADT levels greater than 10,000 both chip seal and HMA surfaces shall be considered. Table 5.1 provides typical layer thicknesses for HMA surfaced flexible pavements for ESAL levels up to 200 million. The HMA structural design 
17
WSDOT Pavement Policy thicknesses provided in Table 5.1 assume a subgrade modulus of 10,000 psi which is typical of most WSDOT roadways. Table 5.1 also shows PCCP slab and base thicknesses for convenience (see Section 5.3 for specifics about PCCP design). HMA structural designs other than those shown in Table 5.1 can be used, if justified, by use of job specific input values in the AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993). Table 5.2 provides commentary about the assumptions and input values used to develop Table 5.1. Input values different than those in Table 5.2 must be approved by the State Pavement Office. Table 5.3 provides typical layer thicknesses for flexible pavements with design ESAL levels of 1,000,000 or less. The chip seal surface course is considered the most economical choice for low ESAL pavements. Table 5.1. Layer Thicknesses for New or Reconstructed Pavements Layer Thicknesses, ft.

WSDOT Pavement Policy Table 5.2. Commentary for Pavement Design Assumptions and Inputs for Table 5.1. Design Procedures: Two design procedures were used to develop Table 5.1 along with results from national and international studies. The primary procedure used was the AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993). The secondary procedure was the MEPDG (version 1.0). HMA Pavement Assumptions: The thicknesses shown in Table 5.1 are a combination of results largely from AASHTO 93. The results were modified as needed with additional information from the MEPDG 1.0, WSDOT historical pavement performance data and experience. The assumptions used in AASHTO 93 for HMA pavement design included: ∆PSI = 1.5, So = 0.5, m = 1.0, aHMA = 0.50, aCSBC = 0.13, MR = 10,000 psi, and Ebase = 30,000 psi. Thicker CSBC layers may be required for frost design. PCCP Assumptions: The thicknesses shown in Table 5.1 are a combination of results largely from AASHTO 93. The results were modified as needed with additional information from MEPDG 1.0, WSDOT historical pavement performance data and experience. The assumptions used in AASHTO 93 for PCCP design included: J = 3.2 (dowels), So = 0.4, EC = 4,000,000 psi, Cd = 1.0, ∆PSI = 1.5, SC’ = 700psi, k = 200 pci (if CSBC is the only base layer), k = 400 pci (HMA base paved over CSBC). Base Layers for PCCP: For ESAL levels less than 5,000,000, it is assumed PCCP slabs will be placed on CSBC. For higher ESAL levels, PCCP slabs will be placed on HMA base (0.35 ft. thick) over CSBC base (minimum of 0.35 ft. thick). Thicker CSBC layers may be required for frost design. Subgrade Modulus for HMA Pavements: For HMA pavements, a subgrade resilient modulus of 10,000 psi was used. This is a reasonable assumption based on prior laboratory and field tests statewide. Higher subgrade moduli can be achieved but generally only with granular, low fines materials or some type of subgrade stabilization. It is critical that all WSDOT pavement structures be constructed on well-designed and constructed subgrades. Reliability Levels: A reliability level of 85% was used in AASHTO 93 for ESAL levels of less than 10,000,000. A reliability level of 95% was used for ESAL levels of 10,000,000 and higher. Other Observations:
• ESAL levels: For the ESAL levels in Table 5.1, the difference in HMA and PCCP layer thicknesses are about 1.0 inch for each doubling of ESAL level.
• By constructing or reconstructing HMA pavements on a stiffer subgrade (greater than 10,000 psi), reductions in the total HMA thickness can be made; however, this must be done by use of the approved design method (AASHTO 93).
• Typically, surface renewal techniques for HMA pavements involves: (1) adding HMA thickness, or (2) planing/milling the existing surface course and replacing with an equal thickness of HMA. PCCP surface renewal involves diamond grinding which permanently reduces the PCCP slab thickness.

RAMPS, FRONTAGE ROADS, AND WEIGH STATIONS
Ramps shall be designed for the expected traffic. Frontage roads and weigh stations that are maintained by WSDOT shall be designed in accordance with the AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993). Frontage roads that counties and cities are to accept and maintain but constructed by WSDOT shall be designed to the standards of the accepting agency. The total depth of the pavement section must be at least one-half of the maximum expected depth of freezing when the subgrade is classified as a frost susceptible soil. The depth of expected freeze can be based on calculations by use of the design freezing index or the field data gathered by WSDOT during the winter of 1949-1950 (see Appendix 2). 5.2.4

The mainline full-depth pavement section may be extended 0.5 to 1.0 feet into the shoulder to provide structure to support off-tracking vehicles. Pavement thicknesses different than described above require approval by the State Pavement Office. The total depth of the pavement section must be at least one-half of the maximum expected depth of freezing when the subgrade is classified as a frost susceptible soil.
5.3
DETERMINATION OF RIGID PAVEMENT LAYER THICKNESSES
The principal type of PCCP used by WSDOT in the past, and will be continued for the foreseeable future, is a plain, jointed PCCP with dowel bars. All new construction, reconstruction and lane widening shall be conducted such that the PCCP lane edges and the lane stripe are congruent, except when the outside lane is paved 14 feet in width in which case the lane shall be striped at 12 feet (see 8.3.1). 5.3.1
INTRODUCTION
Based on the past performance of PCCP on the state route system under a variety of traffic conditions (various ESAL levels) and on city streets (such as the City of Seattle), it is advisable to use slab thicknesses of 0.67 feet or greater even if the ESAL levels would suggest that lesser slab thicknesses would be adequate. A slab thickness of 0.67 feet or greater provides some assurance of adequate long-term performance given that other design details are adequately accommodated.

WSDOT Pavement Policy 5.3.2
MAINLINE ROADWAY
Table 5.1 provides layer thicknesses for PCCP for ESAL levels up to 200 million. The PCCP thicknesses included in Table 5.1 are supported on granular or HMA base depending upon the ESAL level. Table 5.2 provides commentary about the assumptions and input values used to develop the PCCP layer thicknesses. PCCP slab thicknesses other than those shown in Table 5.1 can be used if justified by project specific input values used in the AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993). Table 5.2 provides commentary about the assumptions and input values used to develop Table 5.1. Input values different than those in Table 5.2 must be approved by the State Pavement Office. The total depth of the pavement section must be at least one-half of the maximum expected depth of freezing when the subgrade is classified as a frost susceptible soil. 5.3.3
PCCP INTERSECTIONS AND ROUNDABOUTS
The same requirements apply as described in paragraph 5.3.2. Jointing details, PCCP construction limits and specifics concerning roundabout construction requires approval by the State Pavement Office. 5.3.4
RAMPS, FRONTAGE ROADS, AND WEIGH STATIONS
The same requirements apply to PCCP ramps and frontage roads as for HMA pavements as noted in Paragraph 5.2.3. 5.3.5
REST AREAS
The minimum PCCP requirements for rest area roadways and parking areas are: Table 5.6 PCCP Thickness Requirements for Rest Areas

23
WSDOT Pavement Policy Project specific traffic and subgrade soil conditions may require thicker pavement layers. Such designs shall be done in accordance with the AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993). The total depth of the pavement section must be at least one-half of the maximum expected depth of freeze when the subgrade is classified as a frost susceptible soil. 5.3.6
SHOULDERS
When shoulders will not be used for future traffic, the PCCP shoulder pavement section must match the mainline thickness and be placed over granular base. Shoulders that will carry future traffic are designed as full depth HMA or PCCP, built to match the mainline traffic lanes. These shoulders are constructed using the same full depth section as the mainline, with lane widths following the Design Manual requirements.
5.4
PERMEABLE PAVEMENTS
Conventional impermeable pavement does not allow water to penetrate into the ground where it can be naturally filtered and cleaned before entering streams and underground water supplies. Permeable pavements are a method of managing stormwater that eliminates the need of a separate collection, treatment and storage system. Water simply flows through the permeable pavement and directly into the underlying soil. 5.4.1
INTRODUCTION
Permeable pavement suits new construction of very low volume, slow speed locations with infrequent truck traffic. 5.4.2
APPLICATION
Permeable pavements shall be considered and used for the following applications:
•
Sidewalks, bicycle trails, community trail/pedestrian path systems, or any pedestrianaccessible paved areas (such as traffic islands)
•
Light vehicle access areas such as maintenance/enforcement areas on divided highways
•
Public and municipal parking lots, including perimeter and overflow parking areas
•
Driveways

WSDOT Pavement Policy 5.4.3
PAVEMENT STRUCTURE
Permeable pavements include an engineered structure consisting of permeable hot mix asphalt or concrete wearing surface, aggregate storage layer and a subgrade soil with sufficient infiltration capability to drain water from the aggregate storage layer. 5.4.4

PERMEABLE BASE STORAGE LAYER
The permeable base storage layer thicknesses shown above are based on the minimum structural needs of the permeable pavement application. Reference the WSDOT Highway Runoff Manual to determine the thicknesses based on subgrade infiltration and the pavement storage capacity needs. In some cases, additional permeable base thickness may be required for frost design purposes. Permeable base aggregate shall consist of permeable ballast. Alternate gradations require State Pavement Office approval.

6. PAVEMENT REHABILITATION If a pavement section reaches a point where preservation is no longer cost effective, rehabilitation will be required to restore its structural capacity. Employing a rehabilitation strategy that takes advantage of the remaining structure in the existing pavement is usually more economical than reconstruction. Rehabilitation methods detailed below that re-use the remaining structure of the existing pavement should be considered before reconstructing a pavement. A life cycle cost analysis of the viable alternatives is required to determine if one of these methods or reconstruction is the best option. Alternatives other than those listed here may also be considered with the approval of the State Pavement Office.
Use a 50-year design life for design of
rehabilitations. National guidelines have been developed (with help from WSDOT) for designing long-lasting structural enhancements that incorporate existing pavements. These guidelines are available in a final report on SHRP2 Project R23 and through a web-based program called rePave. It is recommended that rePave be used for preliminary project scoping. The final structural design shall be in coordination with and approved by the State Pavement Office. A summary of the applicability of the rehabilitation methods is shown in Table 6.1
6.1
COLD IN-PLACE RECYCLING
Cold in-place recycling (CIR) is a mobile non-heating mechanical process that recycles an existing pavement in place by removing a specified depth of HMA surfacing, pulverizing the bituminous material, mixing in measured amounts of emulsified liquid asphalt and lime slurry, paving and compacting the recycled material back on the roadway. Following the CIR processing the surface is overlaid with an HMA or chip seal wearing surface. CIR is best suited to the lower traffic levels and dryer conditions of rural highways in Eastern Washington. To cure, CIR needs dry conditions making it unsuitable to the wetter climate on west side of the state. The process also requires lengthy work zones using piloted traffic making it less suitable to higher volume roadways or urban environments. CIR can be used to recycle to a depth of 4 inches but the composition of the existing pavement needs to be relatively consistent
27
WSDOT Pavement Policy to avoid difficulties in controlling the emulsion rates.
Because CIR is only able to recycle the
surface layers, it is not able to correct deep failures or subgrade problems. Ideal candidates for CIR are pavements showing distresses from transverse, reflective, or fatigue cracking, oxidation and raveling within the HMA or HMA/Chip Seal composite layer. Table 6.1 Applicability of Rehabilitation Methods Treatment Option
Candidate Pavement
Distresses Corrected
Traffic Limitations
Other Limitations
Cold InPlace Recycling
Chip Seal and HMA less than 0.50 feet combined thickness without extensive base and subgrade problems
Cracking, ravelling, oxidization, rutting
Requires extended lane closure and pilot car operation
Requires dry conditions to cure, up to 4 inches can be recycled
Full Depth Reclamation
Bituminous pavements less than 1.0 foot total thickness with full depth failures
Corrects most distresses except for subgrade problems
Lane/road closures, limited traffic can drive on FDR prior to paving
Requires investigation of existing material, subgrade must be able to support FDR equipment
Crack, Seat and Overlay
Cracked faulted and rough PCCP, panels must be stable and not shattered, base and subgrade must be in good condition
Cracking, faulting, studded tire wear
Traffic may be allowed on cracked PCCP after removing loose material and filling voids
Unstable and shattered panels require repair prior to overlay, increases roadway elevation
Unbonded PCCP Overlay
Distressed PCCP or HMA that does not have extensive full depth failures
All types of distress in the existing HMA or PCCP
Requires extended closures.
Unstable areas must be corrected, increases roadway elevation. Requires HMA bond breaker on existing PCCP.
Structural HMA Overlay
HMA pavements where preservation treatments are no longer cost effective but underlying layers have remaining structure
Surface distresses, top down cracking, rutting, ravelling
Lane closures
Lower lifts must be structurally sound
In CIR design, it is desirable to recycle the full depth of the bituminous layers to ensure that any cracking is eliminated but the base and subgrade must be adequate to support the CIR equipment. If full depth removal is not possible, at least two thirds of the bituminous layers should be recycled to prevent any full depth cracks from reflecting into the CIR. Typically, 1.5 inches of remaining bituminous material is sufficient to support the CIR train. Core the existing pavement to ensure that the existing pavement depth is sufficient. 
28
WSDOT Pavement Policy The new pavement structure can be designed using AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993) using a 0.40 layer coefficient for the CIR. A reduced structural coefficient should also be used for any bituminous layer and base remaining after recycling. The HMA layer placed over CIR typically ranges from 0.15 to 0.25 feet although thicker sections may be necessary for higher truck traffic. At a minimum, a chip seal with two applications of emulsion and aggregate should be placed over the CIR to prevent ravelling.
6.2
FULL DEPTH RECLAMATION
Full Depth Reclamation (FDR) is a rehabilitation method where the full depth of the existing bound pavement layers are pulverized and mixed in with the base and subgrade. Stabilization agents may be added to increase the strength of the reclaimed mixture as well as additional aggregate as needed. FDR is capable of reclaiming the existing pavement structure up to a depth of one foot in a single pass but the total bituminous layer depth needs to be at least one inch less than the total reclaimed depth to allow the reclaimer to operate effectively. Although a limited amount of traffic can be allowed on FDR prior to paving, FDR is most appropriate to roadways where longer closures can be accommodated. Since the full depth of the pavement layer is reclaimed, FDR is appropriate to repair any distress other than subgrade problems. Many different materials have been used as stabilizing agents with asphalt emulsions and portland cement the most common. FDR requires the sampling of materials from the roadway to determine moisture content and test trial mixtures in the lab in order to determine a suitable application rate for the stabilizing agents. In pavement design, a structural coefficient of 0.20 is typically used with the AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993).
6.3
CRACK, SEAT AND OVERLAY
Cracking and seating existing PCCP reduces the effective panel size from WSDOT’s standard 12 feet by 15 feet panel to fully cracked segments of pavement between 2 and 6 feet on a side with the general goal that the segments are approximately square. The smaller effective panel size distributes tensile stresses over more joints reducing the strain and resulting reflection cracking in an HMA overlay. Crack, seat and overlay is applicable to PCCP that has reached the end of its useful life and pavement preservation techniques are no longer cost effective. The crack and seat process requires a subgrade that is in relatively good condition and there should not be a 
29
WSDOT Pavement Policy large number of panels that have settled or are shattered. Settled or shattered panels need to be replaced with HMA prior to overlaying. To insure long pavement life, the minimum overlay thickness should be 0.65 feet of HMA. Thicker overlays may be designed depending on traffic loading, subgrade and site conditions. The overlay can be designed using AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993). A modulus of 75,000 psi is recommended for the crack and seated PCCP (rePave, 2015). Crack, seat and overlay will increase the roadway grade by the thickness of the overlay. Undercrossings with insufficient vertical clearance and mainline bridges will require removal of the existing PCCP and replacement with new full depth HMA pavement sections to maintain the required grade.
6.4
UNBONDED PCCP OVERLAY
An unbonded PCCP overlay consists of a new PCCP placed over an existing HMA or PCCP pavement. By using the remaining structure of the existing HMA or PCCP, the thickness of the new PCCP overlay can be designed thinner than if it was a new pavement section. If the existing pavement is PCCP, a separation layer needs to be placed between the old and new pavement. The separation layer isolates the new PCCP overlay from the existing pavement allowing the unbonded overlay to be placed over existing pavement that is in poor condition. Only unstable areas of the existing pavement need to be repaired prior to the overlay. The thickness of an unbonded overlay may be designed using AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993). Adjustments should be made to the resulting PCCP thicknesses to account for the conservatively thick sections generated by AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993). This can be done by adjusting the resulting thickness generated by AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993) to a thickness that is in proportion to Table 5.1. An unbonded overlay will increase the roadway elevation by the thickness of the overlay and the separation layer. Undercrossings with insufficient vertical clearance and mainline bridges will require removal of the existing pavement and replacement new full depth pavement sections to maintain the required grade.

WSDOT Pavement Policy 6.5
HMA STRUCTURAL OVERLAY
An HMA structural overlay may be considered when pavement preservation treatments are no longer a cost effective alternative to preserve the pavement until the next rehabilitation period. Structural overlays should only be used where past pavement performance has shown that the pavement structure is insufficient. Pavement that is performing adequately should not receive a structural overlay simply because an analysis shows that the structure is not sufficient for the future ESALs. Pavements that have little or no remaining structure are not good candidates for a structural overlay and another treatment should be considered. Thickness design of structural overlays should be performed using AASHTO Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993) by applying a reduced structural value for existing layers that are to remain or by using overlay design procedure in the AASHTO Guide. Prior to constructing the overlay, structural distresses in the existing pavement need to be repaired. This may include milling to remove top down c
