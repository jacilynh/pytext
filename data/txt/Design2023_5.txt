1510.08(2) Accessibility Criteria for Curb Ramps The accessibility criteria for PCPs and PARs described in Section 1510.04 and Section 1510.05 also apply to curb ramps, except where superseded by the following additional accessibility criteria specifically for curb ramps.
1510.08(2)(a) Clear Width The clear width of curb ramps and their landings shall be 4 feet minimum, excluding flares.
1510.08(2)(b) Running Slope The running slope of curb ramps shall not exceed 8.3% maximum. Note: It is recommended that running slopes be designed to be less than the allowed maximum to allow for some tolerance in construction. For example, design for a maximum 7.5% curb ramp running slope (rather than the 8.3% maximum). The running slope of a perpendicular curb ramp shall intersect the gutter grade break at a right angle at the back of curb. If the maximum running slope of 8.3% cannot be achieved due to existing physical constraints, the ramp shall be as flat as possible, but the ramp length is not required to exceed 15 feet.
1510.08(2)(c) Cross Slope The cross slope of curb ramp shall not be greater than 2%, measured perpendicular to the direction of travel. Note: It is recommended that cross slopes be designed to be less than the allowed maximum to allow for some tolerance in construction. For example, design for a maximum 1.5% cross slope (rather than the 2% maximum). Exception: The cross slopes of curb ramps at midblock crossings are permitted to match the street or highway grade.
1510.08(2)(d) Landing A level landing is required either at the top of a perpendicular ramp or the bottom of a parallel curb ramp, as noted in Section 1510.08(1)(a) and Section 1510.08(1)(b) for the type of curb ramp used. Provide a landing that is at least 4 feet minimum length by 4 feet minimum width. The running and cross slopes of a curb ramp landing shall be 2% maximum. Note: It is recommended that cross slopes be designed to be less than the allowed maximum to allow for some tolerance in construction. For example, design for a maximum 1.5% cross slope (rather than 2% maximum). Exception: The running and cross slopes of landings for curb ramps at midblock crossings are permitted to match the street or highway grade.
1510.08(2)(e) Flares Flared sides are to be used only where a PCP crosses the curb ramp from the side. Flared sides are to have a slope of 10% maximum, measured parallel to the back of curb.
1510.08(2)(f) Counter Slope The counter slope of the gutter or street at the foot of a curb ramp or landing shall be 5% maximum.

Pedestrian Facilities
1510.08(2)(g) Detectable Warning Surfaces Detectable warning surfaces are required where curb ramps or landings connect to a roadway. (See the Standard Plans for placement details and other applications.) They are also required where commercial driveways are provided with yield or stop control. Detectable warning surfaces shall contrast visually (either light-on-dark or dark-on-light) with the adjacent walkway surface, gutter, street, or highway. Note: Federal yellow is the color used to achieve visual contrast on WSDOT projects. Within cities, other contrasting colors may be used if requested by the city.
1510.08(2)(h) Surfaces Surfaces of curb ramps shall be firm, stable, and slip resistant. Gratings, access covers, utility objects, and other appurtenances shall not be located on curb ramps, landings, or gutters within the pedestrian access route.
1510.08(2)(i) Grade Breaks Vertical alignment shall be planar within curb ramp runs, landings, and gutter areas within the PAR. Grade breaks at the top and bottom of curb ramps shall be perpendicular to the direction of travel on the ramp run. Surface slopes that meet at grade breaks shall be flush.
1510.08(2)(j) Clear Space Beyond the curb face where the bottom of a curb ramp or landing meets the gutter, a clear space of 4 feet minimum by 4 feet minimum shall be provided in the roadway that is contained within the width of the crosswalk and located wholly outside the parallel vehicle travel lane. Note: Clear space is easily achieved when a separate curb ramp is provided, oriented in each direction of pedestrian travel within the width of the crosswalk it serves.
1510.08(3) Curb Ramp Drainage Surface water runoff from the roadway can flood the lower end of a curb ramp. Provide catch basins or inlets to prevent ponding at the base of curb ramps and landings. Exhibit 1510-21 shows examples of drainage structure locations. Verify that drainage structures will not be located in the PAR.

•
•

•
•
Minimize turning radii to keep speeds low. (See Section 1510.09(5)(a) for mountable truck apron and Chapter 1300 for design vehicle guidance.) Place crosswalks so they are visible and connect to the adjacent pedestrian facilities. Provide sight distance (driver to pedestrian; pedestrian to driver). Use a separate left-turn phase along with a “WALK/DON’T WALK” signal. Restrict or prohibit turns. Shorten crossing distance. Use a raised median/cut-through island for a pedestrian refuge. Use accessible pedestrian signals (APS). Use signing and delineation as determined by the region Traffic Engineer. Place crosswalks as close as practicable to the intersection traveled way. Provide pedestrian-level lighting. Provide crosswalks in the direct path of travel to transit stops. Provide a PAR that meets the accessibility criteria at all pedestrian crossings.

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
1510.09(2) Crosswalks at Intersections Provide a PAR within marked and unmarked pedestrian crossings. (See Section 1510.05 for accessibility criteria for PAR.) Crosswalks are provided on all legs of an intersection, except in rare cases. There are normally three crosswalks at a “T” intersection and four crosswalks at a “four-leg” intersection. For pedestrian route continuity, the minimum number of crosswalks is two at “T” intersections and three at “four-leg” intersections. One example where crosswalks might not be provided on all interaction legs is a diamond interchange with heavy left-turn movements from the off-ramp approach. (See Section 1510.09(2)(c) for Closed Crossings policy.) The Traffic Manual provides recommendations for determining pedestrian markings based on lane configuration, vehicular traffic volume, and speed. However, coordinate with the region Traffic Engineer early on with any existing or proposed crosswalks. The Traffic Engineer makes the final determination on appropriate signing and delineation.
1510.09(2)(a) Unmarked Crossings Legal crosswalks exist at all intersections, whether marked or not, regardless of the number of legs at the intersection of lack of prepared crossing treatments. An unmarked crosswalk (see Exhibit 1510-22) is the portion of the roadway behind a prolongation of the curb or edge of the through traffic lane and a prolongation of the farthest sidewalk connection or, in the event there are no sidewalks, between the edge of the through traffic lane and a line 10 feet from there (RCW 46.04.160).

1510.09(2)(b) Marked Crossings Marked crosswalks are used at intersections or midblock crossing and are provided at all signalized intersections except where pedestrians are prohibited, or the crossing is closed (see Section 1510.09(2)(c)). Marked Crossings should not be used indiscriminately but considered based on a thorough evaluation of site conditions. Maintenance agreements and RCW 47.24.020 provide jurisdictional authority for decisions to mark crosswalks based on a population threshold of 30,000 and should be consulted prior to a decision to mark a crosswalk. Consult region Traffic Office for “best practices” for marking crosswalks. The MUTCD, the AASHTO Guide for the Planning, Design, and Operation of Pedestrian Facilities, and the NACTO Urban Street Design Guide are all good resources to use when evaluating locations for marked crosswalks. Standard marked crosswalks are at least as wide as the walkway leading to the crossing or 10 feet wide, whichever is greater. The preferred type of marked crosswalk is a longitudinal pattern known as a Ladder Bar, which is shown in the Standard Plans and Exhibit 1510-23. Stop and yield line dimensions and placement must conform to the MUTCD and are shown in the Standard Plans. Some decorative crosswalk materials (such as colored pavement or bricks) may cause confusion for visually impaired pedestrians and can create discomfort for wheelchair users. Supplement decorative crosswalks with pavement markings to enhance visibility and delineate the crosswalk. Refer to the MUTCD and the Local Agency Crosswalk Options website: www.wsdot.wa.gov/design/standards/plansheet/pm-2.htm A marked crosswalk may be provided at unsignalized or uncontrolled intersections with public streets or highways, or at private drives with a high volume of vehicle traffic during significant hours of the day. Consult with the region Traffic Office for “best practices” for marking crosswalks. Exhibit 1510-23 Marked Pedestrian Crossing

1510.09(2)(c) Closed Crossings (Rewritten 2023) Choosing to close a crossing is a last resort and must remain infrequent. Formally closed crossings apply to all non-motorized users. The decision to close a crossing requires approval of the WSDOT Region Traffic Engineer with concurrence from the HQ ADA compliance manager and is documented in the DDP using the Pedestrian Crossing Memorandum with a copy sent to the Headquarters’ ADA Data Steward (ADASteward@WSDOT.WA.GOV). WSDOT must also ensure that affected communities are informed of any substantial impact or changes to pedestrian access resulting from a closure. Exhibit 1510-24 Essential Signal Operations at a Location That Does Not Support the Pedestrian Crossing (New Exhibit 2023)
•
•
•
Signalized ramp terminal intersection No land use, origins, destinations, or transit stops that support a pedestrian crossing Marked and signal-controlled crosswalks within approximately 70 ft of the legal crossings
1510.09(3) Midblock Crosswalks On roadways with pedestrian crossing traffic caused by nearby pedestrian generators, a midblock crossing may be appropriate. (See Section 1510.09(2) for crosswalk criteria and the Traffic Manual for marked crosswalk recommendations at unsignalized intersections.) The approval authority is the Traffic Engineer. Engineering judgment of conditions that might increase the value of a midblock crossing includes the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
High pedestrian crossing volume present with long block spacing. Evidence of pedestrian-vehicular midblock conflicts (site observations, law enforcement reporting, and city traffic engineers). Proposed crossing with a realistic opportunity to channel multiple pedestrian crossings to a single location. Sight lines that enable sufficient eye contact between motorists and pedestrians. Community commitment for a successful outcome. Ability to mitigate risks associated with the location using proven countermeasures such as, but not limited to, refuge islands, rectangular rapid flashing beacons, and/or pedestrian hybrid beacons. Modal interchange points where high volumes crossing pedestrians occur (e.g., transit stop to apartment complex).

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
To meet the accessibility criteria, the PAR in the crosswalk may have a cross slope that matches the grade of the roadway. An example of a midblock crossing is shown in Exhibit 1510-25. (See Chapter 530 for further information on pedestrian access and paths on limited access facilities.) Exhibit 1510-25 Midblock Pedestrian Crossing
1510.09(3)(a) Raised Crosswalks (New Section 2023) Raised crosswalks are a specialized traffic calming device and pedestrian crossing. The vertical deflection slows down motorists, increases conspicuity of crossing pedestrians, and allows pedestrians to cross the street at sidewalk level. Typical installations are mid-block crossings, roundabouts, and right-turn slip lanes that lead to a pedestrian island. Raised crosswalk use at intersections is permitted so long as the entrance and exit ramps do not encroach on crossing traffic. Placement should be considered based on the criteria for Marked Crossings (see Section 1510.09(2)(b)) in addition to the following roadway characteristics:
•
•
•
Low traffic volumes (< 9,000 AADT) Speed limits no greater than 30 mph Minimal use by heavy or long wheelbase vehicles (less than 5%)
Raised Crosswalks are not allowed in the following locations:
•
•
•
Streets with more than three lanes Truck or primary emergency vehicle routes without coordination with local emergency services and stakeholders Proximity to bus stops, as the vertical deflection may be unnerving to riders that have just boarded the bus and have yet to find a seat

Design
•
•
•
Existing guidelines for marked crossings, including accessibility criteria, should be followed (see Section 1510.09(2)(b) - Marked Crossings). The width of the tabletop must be a minimum 10 feet with detectable warning surfaces on both ends. The entrance and exit ramp length must be a minimum of 6 feet or 4% to 8.3% slope (whichever is longer) with a parabolic cross section.
Exhibit 1510-26 Raised Crosswalk Cross-Section
•
•
•
For streets with existing curb and sidewalk: o The height should match the sidewalk so pedestrians can cross at a constant grade. o If on-street parking is present, include a curb extension to make waiting pedestrians and the raised crosswalk itself more visible (see Section 1510.09(5) – Curb Extensions). For streets without existing curb and sidewalk: o The height should be 3-4 inches. o Ramps meeting the accessibility criteria must be installed on both ends of the tabletop. o Flexible delineators should be considered to prevent vehicles from swerving into the shoulder to avoid the speed table. Signage and pavement markings should follow Section 1510.09(2)(b) – Marked Crossings and MUTCD guidelines, specifically Section 3b.26 – Speed Hump Markings.
Other Considerations
•
•
•
•
Changes in drainage the raised crosswalk will cause should be accommodated. Additional drainage structures such as inlets or catch basins may be required. Consider heavy snowplow routes and work with local maintenance to determine how to best mitigate the change in grade. No alteration in design for bicycle lanes should be required, as bicyclists can typically navigate raised crosswalks without disruption. Avoid textured or decorative surfaces for the tabletop, as a smooth surface is preferable for ADA compliance.
Raised crosswalks may increase traffic noise.

1510.09(4) Sight Distance at Crosswalks Whenever an intersection crossing (marked or unmarked) or a midblock crossing is improved, provide stopping sight distance for the vehicles for pedestrians. Shrubbery, signs, parked cars, and other roadside elements can block motorists’ and pedestrians’ views of each other. Exhibit 1520-18 illustrates these sight distance concerns. See Section 1260.03(1)(a) for design stopping sight distance. Consider the need for advanced cueing strategies (e.g., flashing beacons) where sight lines are limited.

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
1510.09(5) Curb Extensions Curb extensions are traffic calming measures that may improve sight distance and reduce pedestrian crossing times, which limits pedestrian exposure. Installing a curb extension can help reduce the sight distance problem with parked cars that limit driver/pedestrian visibility. Curb extensions may allow for better curb ramp design as well as provide more space for pedestrians. Note: Curb extensions are not an option on streets with intermediate and high-speed traffic or without on-street parking because drivers would be confronted with sudden changes in roadway width. Extend the curb no farther than the width of the parking lane. (See Chapter 1230, and Chapter 1520 for shoulder/bike lane width guidance.) Design the approach nose to ensure adequate setback of vehicles to provide visibility of pedestrians. At intersections with traffic signals, the curb extensions can be used to reduce pedestrian signal timing. Examples of sidewalk curb extensions are shown in Exhibit 1510-20 and Exhibit 1510-21.

Page 1510-36
Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
Exhibit 1510-29 Curb Extension Examples
The right-turn path of the design vehicle is a critical element in determining the size and shape of the curb extension. Sidewalk curb extensions tend to restrict the width of the roadway and can make right turns difficult for large trucks. Ensure the geometry of the curb extension is compatible with the turn path for the design vehicle selected. Avoid interrupting bicycle traffic with curb extensions. Do not use curb extensions on state highways when:
•
•
•
The design vehicle (see Chapter 1300) encroaches on curbs or opposing lanes, and other solutions will not improve the circumstances. On-street parking is not provided/allowed. The posted speed is above 35 mph.
Site features such as landscaping, cabinets, poles, benches, planters, bollards, newspaper stands, and sandwich boards should be selected and placed so they do not obstruct the vision of pedestrians or drivers within curb extension areas, as shown in Exhibit 1510-21. Take into account motorist and pedestrian visibility and Design Clear Zone guidelines (see Chapter 1600).
1510.09(5)(a) Mountable Truck Apron (New Section 2023) Minimizing curb radius is a design tool for reducing turning vehicle speeds, which provides advantages and improved comfort for bicyclists and pedestrians. However, minimizing the curb return radius may result in the rear wheels of large (accommodated) vehicle tracking over the curb and encroaching on space where pedestrians and bicyclists may be queuing to cross. These encroachments can also damage curb and sidewalk structure. Provide a mountable truck apron that define the edge of the accommodated vehicle wheel path, while continuing to encourage reduced speed for the design vehicle (often a passenger car) (see Exhibit 1510-34. Design bicycle stop bars, detectable warning surfaces, traffic signal equipment, and other intersection features so that they are behind the mountable surface area. Provide a visually distinct surface for the apron as compared to the surface of the adjacent travel lane, sidewalk, and bike facility. Slope the apron from flush to the vehicle lane to 3 inches high at the curb.

1510.10 Raised Medians/Traffic Islands Wide multilane streets are often difficult for pedestrians to cross, particularly when there are insufficient gaps in vehicular traffic because of heavy volumes. Consider raised medians and traffic islands with a pedestrian refuge area (see Exhibit 1510-31) on roadways with the following conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Two-way arterial with speeds of greater than 35 mph, Moderate to high average daily traffic (ADT), High pedestrian volumes. Significant pedestrian crash history. Near a school or other community center. Crossing distance exceeds 30 feet. Complex or irregularly shaped intersections.
A traffic island used for channelized right-turn slip lanes can provide a pedestrian refuge, but the slip lanes may promote faster turning speeds. Where feasible, eliminate slip lanes. If the slip lane cannot be eliminated, minimize the turning radius of the slip lane to keep speeds as low as feasible. Also, to keep speeds low, consider ending the slip lane as a yield condition instead of a merge condition. Always keep the slip lane as narrow as practicable and design a crosswalk alignment that is at a right angle to the face of curb. (See Chapter 1310 for turn lanes, Chapter 1360 for interchange ramps, and Chapter 1320 for pedestrian accommodations in roundabouts.) The PAR through a raised median or traffic island can be either raised with curb ramps or a cut-through type (see Exhibit 1510-31). Curb ramps in medians and islands can add difficulty to the crossing for some users. The curbed edges of cut-throughs can be useful cues to the visually impaired in determining the direction of a crossing, especially on an angled route through a median or island.

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
1510.10(1) Accessibility Criteria for Raised Medians and Traffic Islands There are many design considerations when deciding whether to ramp up to the median or island grade or create a cut-through median or island matching the roadway grade. These considerations may include the profile grade and cross slope of the road, drainage patterns, and the length or width of the median or island. The following accessibility criteria apply:
•
•
Each raised median or traffic island shall contain a PAR connecting to each crosswalk (see Section 1510.05). A passing space shall be provided that is at least 5 feet wide for a distance of at least 5 feet for each PAR in a raised median or on a traffic island (see Exhibit 1510-31).
Note: It is recommended that cut-throughs be designed to have a minimum width of 5 feet to ensure a passing space is provided.
•
•
•
•
Medians and pedestrian refuge islands shall be 6 feet minimum in length in the direction of pedestrian travel. Detectable warning surfaces are to be separated by 2 feet minimum length in the direction of pedestrian travel. Detectable warning surfaces are located at each curb ramp or roadway entrance of a PAR through a raised median or traffic island. The detectable warning surface shall be located at the back of the curb (see Exhibit 1510-31). PARs of shared-use paths that go through raised medians or traffic islands shall be the same width as the shared-use path (see Chapter 1515).

1510.11 Intersection Design (New Section 2023) Provide accommodation for pedestrian movement at and through intersections on facilities where pedestrians are allowed. Design elements to evaluate include pedestrian crossings (Section 1510.09), curb ramps (Section 1510.10), pedestrian signals and pushbuttons (Section 1510.11), curb extensions (Section 1510.09(3)(a)), and raised medians and traffic islands (Section 1510.09). See Section 1310.03 for design examples, additional design elements beyond those listed in this chapter, the appropriate configurations and dimensions of those elements, and criteria for determining suitable designs for a given intersection location.
1510.11(1) Protected Intersections (New Section 2023) Protected intersections are part of Pedestrian Circulation Paths (PCPs) where a set of treatment countermeasures are provided that improve a crossing for pedestrians and bicyclists. These include:
•
•
•
Advance stop bars, Corner protection islands, and Specialized signal phasing.
The combination of features reduces vehicle turning speeds, increases pedestrian conspicuity at the crossings, and decreases pedestrian exposure by reducing the crossing distances. See Section 1310.03(2).
1510.11(2) Roundabouts (New Section 2023) Roundabouts can incorporate designs (such as marked crossings through splitter islands) that are effectively part of the Pedestrian Circulation Path (PCP). The features of a roundabout that reduce vehicle speeds, increase pedestrian conspicuity, and decrease pedestrian exposure can improve Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) for pedestrians. Single-lane roundabouts are preferred when optimizing a crossing for pedestrians as there are fewer conflict points for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Some roundabouts will require additional crossing enhancements such as Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacons (RRFBs) in order to achieve the threshold refined Pedestrian Level of Traffic Stress (PLTS). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1510-40
Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
For roundabouts that do not incorporate a PCP, but where pedestrians may legally use the roadway and crossing, the design must include an obvious pedestrian path, like a break in a painted splitter island. See Chapter 1320 for roundabout design.
1510.11(3) Interchanges (New Section 2023) There are many different configurations of interchanges, but all of them require pedestrians to cross ramp terminal intersections where they meet with cross streets. Using roundabouts for ramp terminal intersections can achieve a low Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) by reducing vehicle speeds, increasing pedestrian conspicuity, and reducing crossing distances. In general, the LTS of a ramp terminal crossing can be improved for pedestrians by considering the following treatments:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Configuration (reduce/remove skews and slip lanes) Turn radius (reduce) Control (use stop control versus signalization) Speed (reduce local/crossroad speed) Lanes (reduce local/crossroad lane number) Volume (reduce local/crossroad volumes) Crossing Features (implement a suite of active transportation crossing features)
Consult with subject matter experts for appropriate application of these treatments.
1510.12 Pedestrian Pushbuttons Pedestrian pushbuttons are an operating control with their own accessibility requirements. All pedestrian pushbuttons, regardless of the type of system they are part of, require a level clear space located so that users of all types can reach the button to actuate the associated system. 1510.12(1) Accessibility Criteria for All Pedestrian Pushbuttons (including APS)
1510.12(1)(a) Location Requirements See Section 1330.04(4) for pushbutton location requirements. These location requirements limit the potential locations for the pedestrian pushbutton clear space.
1510.12(1)(b) Clear Space Requirements
•
•
Grade: 2% maximum running and cross slopes. Clear space dimensions: a. Standard: 48 inches in width by 60 inches in length, with the pushbutton located along one of the long sides of the clear space. b. Minimum: 48 inches minimum width by 48 inches minimum length. Although the ADA minimum required clear space for an operational control is 30 inches by 48 inches, the narrow dimension is increased to 48 inches to allow for maneuvering, similar to a curb ramp landing (see Exhibit 1510-32). If the clear space is constrained on three sides, such that the clear space is set back 15 inches or more from the PAR, then the clear space shall be 48 inches minimum width by 60 inches minimum length, to allow for maneuvering within the constrained space. (See Exhibit 1510-32).

Additional unobstructed or traversable space of 12 inches on either end of the clear space should be provided if possible, to allow for protruding equipment such as foot rests to extend beyond the clear space. This helps mobility assistance device users get their shoulder line closer to the pushbutton (see Exhibit 1510-32). Clear space is allowed to overlap other PAR elements (i.e., sidewalk/curb ramp landing) (Exhibit 1510-33 and Exhibit 1510-34). Clear space must be connected to the crosswalk served by the pedestrian pushbutton with a PAR.

1510.12(1)(c) Reach Range Requirements Pushbuttons are in locations considered unobstructed and follow the allowable unobstructed reach distance requirements of the ADA accessibility requirements. This manual designs clear space for pushbuttons based on a parallel approach, due to difficulties in both accessibility and design when attempting to accommodate a forward reach.
•
•
•
•
•
•
The provided clear space must be within reach range of the pedestrian pushbutton. The reach range is 10 inches maximum, as measured from the edge of the clear space to the center of the physical pushbutton (not just the housing). For new construction, the center of the physical pushbutton shall be no more than 9 inches from the edge of the clear space. It is preferable to locate the pushbutton as close to the edge of the clear space as possible. Different types of pushbuttons (front mount H-frame type versus side mount Accessible Pedestrian Signal type) will have different reach ranges on the same pole. Generally, designing for a side mount pushbutton will result in a front mount pushbutton also being within the required reach range. This is generally not true the other way around. (See Exhibit 1510-35) The center of the physical pushbutton shall be 42 inches above the surface of the clear space. Existing installations may remain if they are within a range of 36 inches minimum to 48 inches maximum above the surface of the clear space. The pushbutton shall be a minimum of 12 inches in from both ends of the clear space and should be at least 24 inches in from both ends of the clear space. Ideally, the pushbutton should be centered along one side of the clear space. If the clear space is rectangular, the pushbutton shall be located along one of the long sides of the clear space.

1510.12(2) Accessible Pedestrian Signals Accessible Pedestrian Signals (APS) are only installed where there is a pedestrian traffic signal display (walking person / hand). APS are not installed as part of crosswalk flashing beacon systems. See Chapter 1330 for additional information on APS equipment.
1510.13 At-Grade Railroad Crossings The design of pedestrian facilities that cross railroad tracks (see Exhibit 1510-36) often presents challenges due to the conflicting needs of pedestrians and trains. In particular, the flangeway gap for trains to traverse a crossing surface may create a significant obstacle for a person who uses a wheelchair, crutches, or walking aids for mobility. Whenever practicable, align pedestrian crossings perpendicular to the tracks in order to minimize potential problems related to flangeway gaps. Crossing surfaces may be constructed of timber planking, rubberized materials, or concrete. Concrete materials generally provide the smoothest and most durable crossing surfaces. When detectable warning surfaces are used at railroad crossings, place them according to the MUTCD stop line placement criteria. Exhibit 1510-36 Pedestrian Railroad Crossings

There are a number of railroad crossing warning devices (see Exhibit 1510-37) intended specifically for pedestrian facilities (see the MUTCD). When selecting warning devices, factors such as train and pedestrian volumes, train speeds, available sight distance, number of tracks, and other site-specific characteristics should be taken into account. Coordinate with the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison early in the design process so that all relevant factors are considered, and an agreement may be reached regarding the design of warning devices and crossing surfaces.

Exhibit 1510-37 Pedestrian Railroad Warning Device
Except for crossings located within the limits of first-class cities*, the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) approves proposals for any new railroad at-grade crossings or changes to warning devices or geometry at existing crossings. Additionally, any project that requires the railroad to perform work such as installation of warning devices or crossing surfaces must obtain a railroad construction and maintenance agreement. Contact the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison to coordinate with both the WUTC and the railroad company. *RCW 35.22.010: A first class city is a city with a population of ten thousand or more at the time of its organization or reorganization that has a charter adopted under Article XI, section 10, of the state Constitution. Note: There are very few first-class cities in the state of Washington. Verify with the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison.
1510.14 Pedestrian Grade Separations (Structures) On the approach to a bridge that has a raised sidewalk, provide a ramp that transitions to the sidewalk from the paved shoulder. A ramp that transitions from a paved shoulder to a sidewalk on a bridge is to have a slope of 5% maximum and be constructed of asphalt or cement concrete. In addition to aiding pedestrian access, the ramp also serves as a roadside safety feature to mitigate the raised blunt end of the concrete sidewalk. If a PCP (such as a raised sidewalk or shared-use path) is located near the bridge, consider eliminating the gap between the bridge sidewalk and the PCP by extending the bridge sidewalk to match into the nearby PCP. At underpasses where pedestrians are allowed, it is desirable to provide sidewalks and to maintain the full shoulder width. When bridge columns are placed on either side of the roadway, it is preferred to place the walkway between the roadway and the columns for pedestrian visibility and security. Provide adequate illumination and drainage for pedestrian safety and comfort. In cases where there is a pedestrian crash history, and the roadway cannot be redesigned to accommodate pedestrians at grade, planners should consider providing a grade-separated pedestrian structure (see Exhibit 1510-38 and Exhibit 1510-39). When considering a grade-separated pedestrian structure, determine whether the conditions that require the crossing are permanent. If there is likelihood that pedestrians will not use a grade separation, consider less-costly solutions. Locate the grade-separated crossing where pedestrians are most likely to cross the roadway. A crossing might not be used if the pedestrian is required to deviate significantly from a more direct route.

Pedestrian Facilities
It is sometimes necessary to install fencing or other physical barriers to channel the pedestrians to the structure and reduce the possibility of undesired at-grade crossings. Note: The HQ Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for the design of pedestrian structures. Consider a grade-separated crossing where:
•
•
•
•
•
There is moderate to high pedestrian demand to cross a freeway or expressway. There are large numbers of young children, particularly on school routes, who regularly cross intermediate and high speed or high-volume roadways. The traffic conflicts that would be encountered by pedestrians are considered unacceptable (such as on wide streets with high pedestrian volumes combined with intermediate or high-speed traffic). There are documented crashes or close calls involving pedestrians and vehicles. One or more of the conditions stated above exists in conjunction with a well-defined pedestrian origin and destination (such as a residential neighborhood across a busy street from a school).
1510.14(1) Pedestrian Bridges Pedestrian grade-separation bridges (see Exhibit 1510-38) are more effective when the roadway is below the natural ground line, as in a cut section. Elevated grade separations in cut sections, where pedestrians climb stairs or use long approach ramps, tend to be underused. Pedestrian bridges need adequate right of way to accommodate accessible ramp approaches leading up to and off of the structure. The bridge structure must comply with ADA requirements and meet the accessibility criteria for either a pedestrian circulation path (if the grade is 5% or less) or an access ramp (if the grade is greater than 5% but less than or equal to 8.3%), and must include a pedestrian access route. (See Section 1510.04 and Section 1510.05 for PCP and PAR accessibility criteria; see Section 1510.15(2) for access ramp accessibility criteria.) For the minimum vertical clearance from the bottom of the pedestrian structure to the roadway beneath, see Chapter 720. The height of the structure can affect the length of the pedestrian ramp approaches to the structure. When access ramps are not feasible, provide both elevators and stairways. Provide railings on pedestrian bridges. Bridge fence is sometimes desirable to deter pedestrians from throwing objects from an overhead pedestrian structure (see Section 720.03(13)). The minimum clear width for pedestrian bridges is 8 feet. Consider a clear width of 14 feet where a pedestrian bridge is enclosed or shared with bicyclists, or equestrians, or if maintenance or emergency vehicles will need to access.

1510.14(2) Pedestrian Tunnels Tunnels are an effective method of providing crossings for roadways located in embankment sections. Welldesigned tunnels can be a desirable crossing for pedestrians. When feasible, design the tunnel with a nearly level profile to provide an unobstructed line of sight from portal to portal (see Exhibit 1510-39). People may be reluctant to enter a tunnel with a depressed profile because they are unable to see whether the tunnel is occupied. Law enforcement also has difficulty patrolling depressed profile tunnels. Provide vandal-resistant daytime and nighttime illumination within the pedestrian tunnel. Installing glossfinished tile walls and ceilings can enhance light levels within the tunnel. The minimum overhead clearance for a pedestrian tunnel is 10 feet. The minimum width for a pedestrian tunnel is 12 feet. Consider a tunnel width between 14 and 18 feet depending on usage and the length of the tunnel. Exhibit 1510-39 Pedestrian Tunnel
Pedestrian tunnels need adequate right of way to accommodate accessible approaches leading to the tunnel structure. The tunnel structure must comply with ADA requirements and meet the accessibility criteria for either a pedestrian circulation path (if the grade is less than or equal to 5%) or an access ramp (if the grade is greater than 5% and less than or equal to 8.3%) and must include a pedestrian access route. (See Section 1510.04 and Section 1510.05 for PCP and PAR accessibility criteria; see Section 1510.15(2) for access ramp accessibility criteria.)
1510.15 Other Pedestrian Facilities 1510.15(1) Transit Stops and School Bus Stops The location of transit stops is an important element in providing appropriate pedestrian facilities. (Coordinate with the local transit provider.) Newly constructed transit stops must conform to ADA requirements. Design newly constructed transit stops so that they are accessible from the sidewalk or paved shoulder. A transit stop on one side of a street usually has a counterpart on the opposite side because transit routes normally function in both directions on the same roadway. Provide adequate crossing facilities for pedestrians. When locating a transit stop (see Traffic Manual 7.9), consider transit ridership and land use demand for the stop. Also, take into account compatibility with the following roadway/traffic characteristics:
•
•
•
•
ADT Traffic speed Crossing distance Crash history
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
•
•
•
Sight distance Connectivity to a pedestrian access route Traffic generator density
Page 1510-50
Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
If any of these suggests an undesirable location for a pedestrian crossing, consider a controlled crossing or another location for the transit stop. (See Chapter 530 for further information on bus stops on limited access facilities.) When analyzing a transit stop location with high pedestrian crash frequency, take into account the presence of nearby transit stops and opportunities for pedestrians to cross the street in a reasonably safe manner. At-grade midblock pedestrian crossings may be effective at transit stop locations on roadways with lower vehicular volumes. Pedestrian grade separations are appropriate at midblock locations when vehicular traffic volumes prohibit pedestrian crossings at grade. (See the Traffic Manual for recommendations for marked crosswalks at unsignalized intersections.) School bus stops are typically adjacent to sidewalks in urban areas and along shoulders in rural areas. Determine the number of children using the stop and provide a waiting area that allows the children to wait for the bus. Coordinate with the local school district. Because of their smaller size, children might be difficult for motorists to see at crossings or stops. Determine whether utility poles, vegetation, and other roadside features interfere with motorists’ ability to see the children. When necessary, remove or relocate the obstructions or move the bus stop. Parked vehicles can also block visibility, and parking prohibitions might be advisable near the bus stop. Coordinate transit and school bus stop locations with the region Traffic Office.
1510.15(2) Access Ramps Serving Transit Stops, Park & Ride Lots, Rest Areas, Buildings, and Other Facilities An access ramp (see Exhibit 1510-40) provides an accessible pedestrian route from a pedestrian circulation path to a facility such as a transit stop, park & ride lot, rest area, pedestrian overcrossing/undercrossing structure, or building. When the running slope is 5% or less, it can be designed as a pedestrian circulation path that includes a pedestrian access route. When the running slope is greater than 5% to a maximum of 8.3%, it must be designed as an access ramp. (See Section 1510.04 and Section 1510.05 for PCP and PAR accessibility criteria; see Section 1510.15(2)(a) for access ramp accessibility criteria.)
1510.15(2)(a) Accessibility Criteria for Access Ramps Access ramps are composed of one or more ramp segments interconnected by level landings. Unless superseded by the following specific accessibility requirements for access ramps, the accessibility requirements for pedestrian access routes also apply:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Ramp segments shall have a maximum running slope of 8.3%. The cross slope of ramp segments shall be 2% maximum. The minimum clear width of ramps is 4 feet; however, it is desirable to match the width of the connecting pedestrian facility. The rise for any ramp segment shall be 30 inches maximum. A level landing (2% maximum running and cross slopes) shall be provided at the top and bottom of each access ramp segment. An access ramp landing’s clear width shall be at least as wide as the widest ramp segment leading to the landing. An access ramp landing’s length shall be 5 feet minimum. Access ramps that change direction between ramp segments at landings shall have a level landing 5 feet minimum width by 5 feet minimum length. All access ramp segments with a rise greater than 6 inches shall have ADA-compliant handrails (see Section 1510.15(3) for handrail accessibility criteria).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
Provide edge protection complying with one of the two following options on each side of access ramp segments:
•
•
The surface of the ramp segment and landing shall extend 12 inches minimum beyond the inside face of the handrail. A curb or barrier shall be provided that does not allow the passage of a 4-inch-diameter sphere, where any portion of the sphere is within 4 inches of the ramp/landing surface.
Exhibit 1510-40 Access Ramp with Accessible Handrails
1510.15(3) Railings and Handrails for Pedestrian Facilities Accessible handrails are required on stairs and also on access ramps that have a rise greater than 6 inches (see Section 1510.15(2)(a) for access ramp accessibility criteria). If the height of a drop-off (typically greater than 30 inches) adjacent to a pedestrian facility necessitates the need to protect pedestrians from falls, then a more robust railing system designed for fall protection should be used. If the drop-off is adjacent to either a stairway or an access ramp with a rise greater than 6 inches, then a combined railing system that meets the requirements for both accessibility and fall protection must be used.
1510.15(3)(a) Fall Protection Railing Railing designed for fall protection alone is typically placed adjacent to pedestrian facilities other than stairs or access ramps to prevent pedestrians or bicyclists from falls. For pedestrian-only facilities, the minimum railing height for fall protection is 42 inches. For facilities where bicycle traffic is anticipated, see Section 1520.05(4).
1510.15(3)(b) Accessible Fall Protection Railing When fall protection is needed adjacent to stairs or an access ramp that has a rise greater than 6 inches, then a combined railing system that meets both the accessibility criteria for handrail outlined in Section 1510.15(3)(d) and the requirements for fall protection must be used. The minimum railing height for pedestrian fall protection is 42 inches.

1510.15(3)(c) Accessible Handrail Accessible handrail meeting the accessibility criteria listed in Section 1510.15(3)(d) that is not designed to provide fall protection is to be used adjacent to stairs or access ramps that have a rise greater than 6 inches at locations where robust fall protection is not needed.
1510.15(3)(d) Accessibility Criteria for Handrail The following accessibility criteria apply to all handrail installations provided at stairs and access ramps that have a rise greater than 6 inches.
i Height
•
•
The top of handrail gripping surfaces shall be 34 inches minimum and 38 inches maximum vertically above walking surfaces, stair nosings, and ramp surfaces. The mounting height of the handrail shall also be at a consistent height.
ii Gripping Surface
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Clearance between handrail gripping surfaces and adjacent surfaces shall be 1½ inches minimum. Handrail gripping surfaces shall be continuous along their length and shall not be obstructed along their tops or sides. The bottoms of handrail gripping surfaces shall not be obstructed for more than 20% of their length. Where provided, horizontal projections shall be located 1½ inches minimum below the bottom of the handrail gripping surface. Handrail gripping surfaces with a circular cross section shall have an outside diameter between 1¼ inches minimum and 2 inches maximum. Handrail gripping surfaces with a noncircular cross section shall have a perimeter dimension between 4 inches minimum and 6¼ inches maximum, and a cross section dimension of 2¼ inches maximum. Handrail gripping surfaces and the surfaces adjacent to them shall be free of sharp or abrasive elements and shall have rounded edges. Handrails shall not rotate in their fittings.
iii Placement and Continuity
•
•
•
Handrails shall be provided on both sides of access ramps and stairs. Handrails shall be continuous within the full length of each access ramp run or stair flight. Inside handrails on switchback or dogleg access ramps and stairs shall be continuous between runs or flights.
iv Extensions
•
•
•
•
Access ramp handrails shall extend horizontally above the landing for 12 inches minimum beyond the top and bottom of ramp runs. At the top of a stair flight, handrails shall extend horizontally above the landing for 12 inches minimum beginning directly above the first riser nosing. At the bottom of a stair flight, handrails shall extend at the slope of the stair flight for a horizontal distance at least equal to one tread depth beyond the last riser nosing. Handrail extensions shall return to a wall, guard, or the landing surface, or shall be continuous to the handrail of an adjacent access ramp run or stair flight.

1510.15(4) Other Pedestrian Facilities, Features, and Elements This chapter covers the accessibility criteria for the most commonly encountered pedestrian design elements in the public right of way. However, there are ADA requirements that apply to any feature or element for pedestrian use, such as doorways, elevators, stairs, call boxes, and drinking fountains. For accessibility criteria for less commonly encountered pedestrian design elements, consult the applicable federal design guidance listed in Section 1510.19(2).
1510.16 Illumination and Signing In Washington State, the highest number of crashes between vehicles and pedestrians tends to occur during November through February, when there is poor visibility and fewer daylight hours. Illumination of pedestrian crossings and other walkways is an important design consideration because lighting has a major impact on a pedestrian’s safety and sense of security. Illumination provided solely for vehicular traffic is not always effective in lighting parallel walkways for pedestrians. Consider pedestrian-level (mounted at a lower level) lighting for PCPs, intersections, and other pedestrian crossing areas with high nighttime pedestrian activity, such as shopping districts, transit stops, schools, community centers, and other major pedestrian generators or areas with a history of pedestrian crashes. (See Chapter 1040 for design guidance on illumination, and Chapter 1020 and the MUTCD for pedestrian-related signing.)
1510.17 Work Zone Pedestrian Accommodation While Title II of the ADA requires that a public entity maintain its pedestrian facilities in operable working condition, including maintenance of their accessibility features, construction and maintenance activities often temporarily disrupt these facilities. When this occurs, provide access and mobility for pedestrians through and around work zones (see Exhibit 1510-41). Address this in the traffic control plans if the project occurs in a location accessible to pedestrians. The designer must determine pedestrian needs in the proposed work zone during the public input process and through field visits. Detailed guidance on work zone pedestrian accommodation can be found in the WSDOT Field Guide for Accessible Public Rights of Way, the MUTCD, and Chapter 1010. Some work zone considerations include:
•
•
•
Separate pedestrians from conflicts with work zone equipment and operations. Separate pedestrians from traffic moving through or around the work zone. Provide pedestrians with alternate routes that have accessible and convenient travel paths that duplicate, as closely as feasible, the characteristics of the existing pedestrian facilities.
Provide walkways that are clearly marked and pedestrian barriers that are continuous, rigid, and detectable to people with reduced vision who navigate with a cane. Also, keep:
•
•
•
•
The pedestrian head space clear. Walkways free from holes, debris, protruding objects, slick surfaces, unstable surfaces, and abrupt changes in grade or terrain. Access along sidewalks clear of obstructions such as construction traffic control signs. A minimum clear width path throughout: 4 feet for pedestrians or 10 feet for pedestrians and bicyclists.

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
Temporary pedestrian facilities within the work zone must meet accessibility criteria to the maximum extent feasible. (See Section 1510.04 and Section 1510.05 for pedestrian circulation path and pedestrian access route accessibility criteria.) Consider the use of flaggers if pedestrian generators such as schools are in the work zone vicinity. Consider spotters who are prepared to help pedestrians through the work zone. Provide for advance public notification of sidewalk closures in the contract special provisions and plans. Where transit stops are affected or relocated because of work activity, provide an accessible route to temporary transit stops. Exhibit 1510-41 Work Zones and Pedestrian Facilities

1515.01 General Shared-use paths are designed for both transportation and recreation purposes and are used by pedestrians, bicyclists, skaters, equestrians, and other users. Some common locations for shared-use paths are along rivers, streams, ocean beachfronts, canals, utility rights of way, and abandoned railroad rights of way; within college campuses; and within and between parks as well as within existing roadway corridors. A common application is to use shared-use paths to close gaps in bicycle networks. There might also be situations where such facilities can be provided as part of planned developments. Where a shared-use path is designed to parallel a roadway, provide a separation between the path and the vehicular traveled way in accordance with this chapter. Shareduse paths may have “trail” in their names, but they are not trails. Trails are intended to provide and support recreational experience(s) and do not provide the necessary ADA accessible infrastructure. Parts of trails might be accessible, but trails don't need to be accessible. Trails do not usually have a firm, stable, or slip resistant surfaces, nor do they usually have accessible cross slopes, or running slopes. The Pacific Crest Trail is a good example of a trail. See Section 1710.05(17) Trails. As with any roadway project, shared-use path projects need to fit into the context of a multimodal community. Exhibits are provided throughout this chapter to illustrate possible design solutions, which should be treated with appropriate flexibility as long as doing so complies with corresponding laws, regulations, standards, and guidance. Engage various discipline experts, including landscape architects, soil and pavement engineers, maintenance staff, traffic control experts, ADA and bicycle coordinators, and others. Additionally, when designing such facilities, consider way-finding. This chapter includes technical provisions for making shared-use paths accessible to persons with disabilities. Design shared-use paths and roadway crossings in consultation with your region’s ADA Coordinator, Bicycle Coordinator, and State Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinator. For additional information on pedestrian and bicycle facilities, see Chapter 1510 and Chapter 1520, respectively.

Shared-Use Paths
Shared-Use Path Design
When designing shared-use paths, the bicyclist may not be the critical design user for every element of design. For example, the crossing speeds of most intersections between roads and pathways should be designed for pedestrians, as they are the slowest users. Accommodate all intended users and minimize conflicts. When designing to serve equestrians, it is desirable to provide a separate bridle trail along the shared-use path to minimize conflicts with horses. Exhibit 1515-1 Shared-Use Path
1515.02(1)
Design Speed
The design speed for a shared-use path is based on bicycle use and is dependent on the terrain and the expected conditions of use. Design the shared-use path to encourage bicyclists to operate at speeds compatible with other users. Higher speeds are discouraged in a mixed-use setting. Design shared-use paths to maintain speeds at or below the speeds shown in Exhibit 1515-2 by designing to the horizontal curve radii shown. Exhibit 1515-2 Bicycle Design Speeds Conditions

When minimum radius curves cannot be obtained because of right of way, topographical, or other constraints, consider installing the following mitigation measures for traffic calming to slow bicyclists when approaching curves:
•
•
•
•
Intermittent curves to slow or maintain desired speeds. Standard curve warning signs and supplemental pavement markings in accordance with the MUTCD. Perpendicular stripes painted on the pathway in decreasing intervals to provide the perception of increased speed. This has been shown to slow drivers when applied to roadways. Changes in pavement texture to encourage reductions in speed at tight curve approaches.
The negative effects of tight radius curves can also be partially offset by widening the pavement through the curves. Steeper vertical grades affect the running speed of bicycles. A shared-use path should be designed not to exceed 5%. Refer to Section 1515.02(3)(a) for further guidance.

Shared-Use Paths
Widths, Cross Slopes, Side Slopes, and Clearances
1515.02(2)(a)
Shared-Use Path Widths
The appropriate paved width for a shared-use path depends on the context, volume, and mix of users. The desirable paved width of a shared-use path, excluding the shoulders on either side, is 12 feet. The minimum paved width, excluding the shoulders on either side, is 10 feet. A paved width of more than 12 feet, excluding the shoulders on either side, may be appropriate when substantial use by both pedestrians and bicyclists is expected or maintenance vehicles are anticipated. Shared-use path shoulders are typically unpaved and 2 feet wide on either side. Exhibit 1515-3 through Exhibit 1515-7 provide additional information and cross-sectional elements. On bridges or tunnels, it is common to pave the entire shared-use path, including shoulders. This usable width can be advantageous for emergency, patrol, and maintenance vehicles and allows for maneuvering around pedestrians and bicyclists who may have stopped. It also keeps the structure uncluttered of any loose gravel shoulder material.
1515.02(2)(b)
Exceptions to Minimum Path Widths
A reduced path width of 8 feet may be designed at locations that present a physical constraint such as an environmental feature or other obstacle. Refer to the MUTCD for signing and pavement markings for such conditions. In very rare circumstances, a reduced width of 8 feet may be used where the following conditions prevail:
•
•
•
•
•
Bicycle traffic is expected to be low, even on peak days or during peak hours. Pedestrian use of the facility is not expected to be more than occasional. Horizontal and vertical alignments provide frequent, well-designed passing and resting opportunities. The shared-use path will not be regularly subjected to maintenance vehicle loading conditions that would cause pavement edge damage. The share-use path is a short distance such as a spur connection to a neighborhood.
1515.02(2)(c)
Existing Shared-Use Paths – Considerations
Some existing shared-use paths were constructed with narrower dimensions, generally providing 8 feet of pavement. Evaluate existing older paths for current needs. Consider widening an existing shared-use path to meet current geometric standards.
1515.02(2)(d)
Cross Slope
The maximum cross slope on a paved shared-use path is to be 2%. The cross slope of the shoulders can be no steeper than 6H:1V. To accommodate drainage, the entire section, including shoulders, should transition through curves. It is desirable to design the pivot point on the outside edge of one side of the shoulder or the other to avoid a pavement crown (see Exhibit 1515-3 through Exhibit 1515-7). It is best practice to design the cross slope to be less steep than the allowed maximum to account for some tolerance in construction. For example, design for a 1.5% cross slope (rather than the 2% maximum). Sloping the pavement surface to one side is desirable and usually simplifies drainage design and surface construction. Generally, surface drainage from the path is dissipated as it flows down the side slope.

1515.02(2)(e)
Shared-Use Paths
Side Slopes and Pedestrian Rail
Side slopes along shared-use paths are an important design feature. Embankment side slopes of 6H:1V or flatter provide a gently sloping path border. For shared-use paths with side slopes steeper than 3H:1V, or where obstacles or waterways may exist, evaluate the potential risk and provide mitigation such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
A minimum 5-foot separation from the edge of the pavement to the embankment edge. This can be accomplished by providing a 5-foot shoulder as shown in Exhibit 1515-7, Example 2. A natural barrier such as dense shrubbery on the side slopes. A physical barrier, such as a pedestrian rail. Where a shared-use path is adjacent to a vertical drop of 2 feet 6 inches or more, a pedestrian rail is needed (see Exhibit 1515-7, Example 5). If the vertical drop is less than 2 feet 6 inches, a pedestrian rail, chain link fence, or 4-inch curb at the edge of the shared-use path may be installed to delineate the edge. Where a shared-use path is constructed on the side of a hill, drainage facilities may need to be considered.
1515.02(2)(f)
Clearances
The minimum horizontal clearance from the edge of pavement to an obstruction (such as bridge piers or guardrail) is 2 feet. For vertical clearances see Section 1515.04 Grade Separation Structures. Exhibit 1515-3 Two-Way Shared-Use Path: Independent Alignment
[1] Consult Region Materials Engineer (RME) for cut back slopes steeper than 2:1. [2] See Section 1515.02(2)(e) for other side slope options and pedestrian railing when needed.

Shared-Use Paths
Exhibit 1515-7 Shared-Use Path Side Slopes and Railing Example 1: Embankment Based on context, flatter slopes are desirable.
Example 2: Shoulder widening to 5 feet or more Used with steeper fill slopes to provide clear space between the hinge point and path. Vegetation can also be used as a buffer on slopes. Consider a natural or physical barrier in lieu of 3 ft additional widening. Example 3: Cut section with ditch Consult with the Region Materials Engineer to determine for appropriate cut slopes.
Example 4: Barriers, railings, fences, or walls that are 5 feet or closer to shared-use paths or bike lanes, need to be a minimum of 42 in. high above the traveling surface. Where a barrier is needed and bicycle speeds are likely to be high (such as on a downgrade), where high winds are typical (such as on bridges), or where a bicyclist could impact the object at a 25-degree angle or greater (such as on a curve), consider a continuous vertical element 54 inches high. See Section 1520.05(4). Example 5: Railing used for fall protection Apply railing or fencing a minimum of 54 inches high when a drop off is present, such as along a retaining wall. Consult with the Region Materials Engineer to determine if the shoulder along the wall should be paved. See Section 1520.05(4).

Running Slopes
Design running slopes (grades) on shared-use paths less than or equal to 5% to accommodate all user types, including pedestrians with disabilities. When the path is within the highway right of way, its running slope can match the general grade established for the adjacent roadway.
1515.02(3)(b)
Landings
Shared-use path landings provide users a level place to rest on extended grades. Exhibit 1515-8 and Exhibit 1515-9 show these features. Design landings to:
•
•
•
•
Permit users to stop periodically and rest. Not exceed maximum running slopes and cross slopes of 2%. Be in line and as wide as the shared-use path. Landings are to be at least 5 feet long. Avoid abrupt grade changes or angle points. Design transitions to landings using vertical curves.

•
•
The maximum running slope and cross slopes are 2%. The minimum size is to be 5 feet by 5 feet. If features such as benches are provided, they must meet ADA requirements; consult with the region ADA Coordinator for guidance.

Pavement Structural Section
Design the pavement structural section of a shared-use path in the same manner as a highway, considering the quality of the subgrade and the anticipated loads on the path. (Design loads are normally maintenance and emergency vehicles.) Provide a firm, stable, slip-resistant pavement surface. Design the pavement structural section as recommended by the Region Materials Engineer. Use crushed rock or other suitable material for shoulder graded areas as recommended by the Region Materials Engineer. On bridges or tunnels, it is common to pave the entire shared-use path, including shoulders across the structure. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

1515.02(5)
Stopping Sight Distance
The distance needed to bring a shared-use path user to a complete stop is a function of the user’s perception and braking reaction time, the initial speed, the coefficient of friction between the wheels and the pavement, the braking ability of the user’s equipment, and the grade. Exhibit 1515-17 and Exhibit 1515-18 provide a graph and an equation to obtain minimum stopping sight distances for various design speeds and grades.
1515.02(5)(a)
Stopping Sight Distance on Crest Vertical Curves
Exhibit 1515-19 provides a chart or equations to obtain the minimum lengths of crest vertical curves for varying stopping sight distances and algebraic differences in grade. The values are based on a 4.5-foot eye height for the bicyclist and a 0-foot height for the object (path surface).
1515.02(5)(b)
Stopping Sight Distance on Horizontal Curves
Exhibit 1515-20 gives the minimum clearances to line-of-sight obstructions for sight distance on horizontal curves. Provide lateral clearance based on the sum of stopping sight distances from Exhibit 1515-17 and Exhibit 1515-18 for bicyclists traveling in both directions and the proposed horizontal curve radius. Where this minimum clearance cannot be obtained, provide curve warning signs and use centerline pavement markings in accordance with the MUTCD. Exhibit 1515-17, Exhibit 1515-18, Exhibit 1515-19, and Exhibit 1515-20 are presented at the end of the chapter.
1515.03
Intersections and Crossings Design
This section covers path/roadway intersections and grade-separated crossings. Detectable warning surfaces are required where shared-use paths connect to the roadway.
1515.03(1)
Intersections with Roadways
Clearly define who has the right of way and provide sight distance for all users at shared-use path and roadway intersections. The common types of shared-use path/roadway at-grade intersection crossings are midblock and adjacent. For roadway intersections with roundabouts, see Chapter 1320. Midblock crossings are located between roadway intersections. When possible, locate the path crossings far enough away from intersections to minimize conflicts between the path users and motor vehicle traffic. It is preferable for midblock path crossings to intersect the roadway at an angle as close to perpendicular as practicable. A minimum 60-degree crossing angle is acceptable to minimize right of way needs. A diagonal midblock crossing can be altered as shown in Exhibit 1515-10. There are other considerations when designing midblock crossings. They include traffic right of way assignments; traffic control devices; sight distances for both bicyclists and motor vehicle operators; refuge island use; access control; and pavement markings.

Shared-Use Paths
Exhibit 1515-10 Typical Redesign of a Diagonal Midblock Crossing
Notes: For path and highway signing and markings, see the MUTCD and the Standard Plans. www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/Standards/english/PDF/m09.60-00_e.pdf For radii approaching roadway intersections, see Exhibit 1515-2. Adjacent path crossings are located at or near public intersection crosswalks and are normally placed with them. These crossings are usually placed with pedestrian crossings, where motorists can be expected to stop. If alternate intersection locations for a shared-use path are available, select the one with the greatest sight distance. Adjacent path crossings occur where a path crosses an existing intersection of two roadways, a T intersection (including driveways), or a four-way intersection, as shown in Exhibit 1515-11. It is desirable to integrate this type of crossing close to an intersection so that motorists and path users recognize one another as intersecting traffic. The path user faces potential conflicts with motor vehicles turning left (A) and right (B) from the parallel roadway and on the crossed roadway (C, D, and E). Consider crossing improvements on a case-by-case basis. Suggested improvements include: move the crossing; evaluate existing or proposed intersection control type; change signalization timing; or provide a refuge island and make a two-step crossing for path users. Important elements that greatly affect the design of these crossings are traffic right of way assignments, traffic control devices, and the separation distance between path and roadway.

Shared-Use Paths
Exhibit 1515-11 Adjacent Shared-Use Path Intersection
Note: For signing and pavement markings, see the MUTCD and the Standard Plans. Additional Roadway/Path Intersection Design Considerations Additional roadway/path intersection design considerations include the following:
Evaluate Intersection Control Determine the need for traffic control devices at path/roadway intersections by using MUTCD warrants and engineering judgment. Bicycles are considered vehicles in Washington State, and bicycle path traffic can be classified as vehicular traffic for MUTCD warrants. Provide traffic signal timing set for pedestrians.
Signal Actuation Mechanisms Place the manually operated accessible pedestrian pushbutton in a location that complies with ADA requirements. For additional information, see Chapter 1330 and Chapter 1510. A detector loop in the path pavement may be provided in addition to the manually operated accessible pedestrian push button.
Signing Provide sign type, size, and location in accordance with the MUTCD. Place path STOP signs as close to the intended stopping point as feasible. Do not place the shared-use path signs where they may confuse motorists or place roadway signs where they may confuse shared-use path users. For additional information on signing, see the MUTCD and Chapter 1020. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1515-12
Chapter 1515
Shared-Use Paths
Approach Treatments Design shared-use path and roadway intersections with level grades, and provide sight distances. Provide advance warning signs and pavement markings that alert and direct path users that there is a crossing (see the MUTCD). Do not use speed bumps or other similar surface obstructions intended to cause bicyclists to slow down. Consider some slowing features such as horizontal curves (see Exhibit 1515-2 and Exhibit 1515-10). Avoid locating a crossing where there is a steep downgrade where bike speeds could be high.
Sight Distance Sight distance is a principal element of roadway and path intersection design. At a minimum, provide stopping sight distance for both the roadway and the path at the crossing. Decision sight distance is desirable for the roadway traffic. Refer to Chapter 1260 for stopping sight distance for the roadway and Section 1515.02(5) for shared-use path stopping sight distance.
Curb Ramp Widths Design curb ramps with a width equal to the shared-use path. Curb ramps and barrier-free passageways are to provide a smooth transition between the shared-use path and the roadway or sidewalk (for pedestrians). Curb ramps at path/ roadway intersections must meet the requirements for curb ramps at a crosswalk. For design requirements, see Chapter 1510, and for curb ramp treatments at roundabouts, see Chapter 1320.
Refuge Islands Consider refuge islands where a shared-use path crosses a roadway when one or more of the following applies:
•
•
•
High motor vehicle traffic volumes and speeds Wide roadways Use by the elderly, children, the disabled, or other slow-moving users
The refuge area may either be designed with the storage aligned perpendicularly across the island or be aligned diagonal (as shown in Exhibit 1515-12). The diagonal storage area has the added benefit of directing attention toward oncoming traffic since it is angled toward the direction from which traffic is approaching.
1515.03(2)
At-Grade Railroad Crossings
Wherever possible, design the crossing at right angles to the rails. For signing and pavement marking for a shared-use path crossing a railroad track, see the MUTCD and the Standard Plans. Also, see Chapter 1510 for design of at-grade pedestrian railroad crossings.

Shared-Use Paths
Grade Separation Structures
Provide the same minimum clear width as the approach paved shared-use path plus the graded clear areas. Carrying full widths across structures has two advantages:
•
•
The clear width provides a minimum lateral clearance from the railing or barrier. It provides needed maneuvering room to avoid pedestrians and other bicyclists.
For undercrossings and tunnels, it is the Designer’s responsibility to determine the correct minimum vertical clearance (shared use path pavement surface to overhead obstruction) of each undercrossing or tunnel based on coordination with maintenance and emergency services. Many types of maintenance and emergency vehicles need more than the 10 feet of vertical clearance needed for bicyclists and/or equestrians. Engage Region Maintenance, Emergency Services, and others that need to cross under or through the facility to determine an appropriate minimum vertical clearance. Account for existing or proposed overhead obstructions (lighting, signals, sign, etc.) that would reduce the available vertical clearance. Consult the region Maintenance Office and the HQ Bridge Preservation Office to verify that the planned path width and vertical clearance meets their needs. If not, widen and/or increase vertical clearance to their specifications. Use expansion joints that accommodate shared-use path users. Expansion joints should be perpendicular to the path and have a maximum gap of ½ inch or be covered with a slip-resistant plate. Installing bridge fence is analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Refer to Section 720.03(13) for guidance. Exhibit 1515-13 Shared-Use Path Bridge and Approach Walls

1515.05
Signing, Pavement Markings, and Illumination
Generally, WSDOT does not provide continuous centerline striping or channelization for user modes on shareduse paths. However, signing and pavement markings can be beneficial to warn shared-use path users of curves, grades, obstructions, and intersections. Refer to the MUTCD for guidance and directions regarding signing (regulatory, warning, and way finding) and pavement markings. The Standard Plans shows shared-use path pavement markings at obstructions in accordance with the MUTCD and also shows placement of detectible warning surfaces. For pavement marking around bollards and other obstructions, see Standard Plan M-9.60: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/standards/english/pdf/m09.60-00_e.pdf The level of illumination on a shared-use path is dependent on the amount of nighttime use expected and the nature of the area surrounding the facility. If illumination is used, provide illumination in accordance with Chapter 1040.

Shared-Use Paths
Fencing
Limited access highways often require fencing or other forms of controlling access. Shared-use paths constructed within these corridors, such as shown in Exhibit 1515-15, likely require fencing. For guidance on fencing, limited access controls, and right of way, refer to Division 5 of the Design Manual. Evaluate the impacts of fencing on sight distances. Exhibit 1515-15 Shared-Use Path in Limited Access Corridor
1515.06(2)
Preventing Motor Vehicle Access (Rewritten 2023)
At locations where shared use paths meet roadways, design and sign shared-use path entries and crossings to clearly indicate that motor vehicle access is prohibited. Use design features to reduce the probability of either intentional or accidental access by motor vehicles. Effective prevention of motor vehicle entry is often possible using signage and pavement markings. Additional treatments include path geometry and splitter islands as discussed below. The primary method of controlling motor vehicle access at path/roadway intersections is the use of pavement markings and signage to indicate that motor vehicle access is prohibited. However, where there is a documented history of unauthorized intrusion at a specific location, use path geometry curvature and/or splitter islands as described below. A common design feature to incorporate into the shared-use path geometry, ahead of the point of crossing, is a reverse curve in the shared-use path. A reverse curve can both slow higher speed shared-use path users and also alert all shared-use path users to the upcoming crossing, as well as dissuade vehicular intrusion into the pathway. Do not use barriers such as z-gates and fences located within the width of a shared-use path. These features, as well as bollards, create fixed objects to path users on new or upgraded path entries. Barriers can also slow access for emergency responders. Determined violators often gain entry despite these barriers and can damage path structures/adjacent vegetation in the process. A Design Analysis is required to use bollards within the width of the shared-use path.

Shared-Use Paths
1515.06(2)(a) Shared-Use Path Splitter Islands (Rewritten 2023) When pavement markings, signage and shared-use path geometry are not sufficient to prevent motor vehicle intrusion, the preferred method of physically restricting entry of motor vehicles is to split the path into two narrower pathways at the roadway intersection, separated by a median island. This method directs path users around an island rather than installing a bollard or other barrier within the usable width of the pathway. Design islands to allow emergency/maintenance vehicle access if alternate access points are not provided. Design features of splitter islands include:
•
•
•
•
Use mountable cement concrete traffic curb (see Standard Plan F-10.12) around the perimeter of the island to reduce the potential for pedal strikes. Paint perimeter curbing yellow to increase visibility of the island. For islands that include plantings, use low-growing, hardy vegetation capable of withstanding the occasional emergency/maintenance vehicle traveling over it. Consult with your region landscape architect for appropriate landscape design. Design path sections around the island to be half the primary path width, but not more than 6 feet wide. Delineate the approach to the island with solid line pavement markings as shown in Exhibit 1515-16.

1520.01 General The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) encourages and relies upon bicycle use on and interconnecting with its facilities. Bicycle facilities or improvements for bicycle transportation are included in WSDOT’s project development and highway programming processes. This chapter is a guide for designing bicycle transportation facilities within state highway right of way or between the curb lines on city streets designated as state highways. When designing facilities outside of state highway right of way or beyond the curb on city streets designated as state highways, use the local agency’s design guidance. Guidance in this chapter applies to typical situations encountered on state highways and includes options for intersection and interchange design. Unique design challenges are resolved using expertise and guidance from the regional Bicycle Coordinator, or if none exists, the WSDOT headquarters Bicycle Coordinator. Additional concepts to resolve unique bicycle facility design situations can be found in guides referenced (Section 1520.07), but may require additional approvals for signing, pavement markings, or bike facility types not presented within this chapter. The Region Traffic Engineer is responsible for determining which sections of state highways are inappropriate for bicycle traffic. The State Traffic Engineer, after consultation with the HQ Design and HQ Active Transportation, prohibits bicycling on sections of state highways through the traffic regulation process.
1520.02 Policy (New Section 2023) WSDOT seeks to provide appropriate bicycle facilities along and across sections of state routes as an integral part of the transportation system. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and WSDOT policy is that bicycle facilities be given full consideration in the planning and design of new construction and reconstruction highway projects, except where bicycle use is prohibited. Use a performance-based approach (see next section) to select and design the appropriate solution to address the need to accommodate bicycle uses, including those uses associated with projects that are providing for a Complete Streets facility.

Roadway Bicycle Facilities
1520.03 Bicycle Facility Selection (Section Rewritten 2023) Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress (BLTS) can inform facility selection because the ranking system is tied to roadway characteristics and facility types that support the Safe System Approach and a user’s willingness to use a given facility. This section provides additional information on facility selection based on the Safe System Approach. Facilities that reduce driver operating speeds, reduce bicyclist exposure to potential crashes with motor vehicles, increase the predictability of motor vehicle and bicycle interactions, and increase the conspicuity of vulnerable road users decrease the likelihood of a serious injury or fatality crash. See Exhibit 1520-5. Reduce operating speeds: Measures to reduce operating speeds of roadways (see Section 1103.05(2)). Bike facilities do not necessarily reduce operating speeds, rather different bike facility types are chosen to mitigate for higher speed conditions. Some bicycle facilities such as protected intersections, and protected roundabouts directly influence vehicle turning speeds. Reduce bicyclist exposure to potential crashes with motor vehicles: Bike facilities generally reduce bicyclist exposure to potential crashes along roadways. Exposure decreases as separation and protective elements increase. Exposure can also be decreased by reducing the number or length of conflict zones or crossing areas with motor vehicle traffic, or by controlling traffic movements at points of conflict (i.e., signalized control of conflicting movements). Protected intersections and protected roundabouts provide significant reductions in bicyclist exposure at intersections. Increase predictability of motor vehicle/bicycle interactions: Bike facilities provide a means for increasing the predictability of interactions between motor vehicle and bicycle traffic by providing an identified and recognizable space for bicycle traffic to travel, especially in locations where most cyclists are traveling at a slower speed than motor vehicle traffic. At intersections separated or marked bike facilities help establish both where differing traffic modes can be expected to travel as well as indicating locations where the paths of differing modes cross one another. Signalized intersections with dedicated signal phases for cyclists can further support predictable traffic movements through intersections. Increase bicyclist conspicuity: Bike facilities do not necessarily make it easier for drivers to see bicyclists. However, bike facilities may increase a driver’s attention to the fact that bicyclists may be present and bike facility enhancements such as green paint can accentuate this effect. Raised bike lanes (i.e., bicycle facilities that are vertically separated from the adjacent travelled lane) may directly increase bicyclist conspicuity. Protected intersections and separated bike lanes through roundabouts can directly address bicyclist conspicuity at intersections. Use the table below to select an appropriate bicycle facility based on the roadway context. See Chapter 1510 for guidance on Pedestrian Level of Traffic Stress (PLTS).
1520.03(1) Speed Considerations (New Section 2023) While Exhibit 1520-2, Exhibit 1520-3,Exhibit 1520-4, and Exhibit 1520-5 provide ranges of roadway speeds in which different types of bike facilities may be appropriate, it is critical to understand that motor vehicle speed plays a significant role in crash severity between motor vehicles and cyclists. When designing multimodal facilities, a target speed selection within the low-speed design control is encouraged. Safety performance increases as motor vehicle speeds are decreased. See Chapter 1103 for further discussion on target speed and speed management treatments.

Roadway Bicycle Facilities
1520.03(2) Roadway Bicycle Facilities (Section Rewritten 2023) There are three general types of dedicated bicycle facilities. See Exhibit 1520-1. Conventional bike lanes (CBLs) have a paint stripe, signing, and pavement markings to provide a clear indication to bicyclists and drivers about the purpose of the facility. See Exhibit 1520-7. Buffered bike lanes (BBLs) are similar to conventional bike lanes, except they also provide a painted buffer to improve rider comfort and provide the benefit of having greater space between cyclists and motor vehicle traffic. See Exhibit 1520-8. Separated bike lane (SBLs) also provide a painted buffer, but also include vertical elements to further improve rider comfort and improve the buffer’s visibility and the driver’s awareness of the buffer. See Exhibit 1520-10. The width of a bicycle lane with a buffer (BBLs and SBLs) does not include the width of the buffer. Shared-use paths (see Chapter 1515) are another option for providing physical separation from traffic. Exhibit 1520-1 Roadway Bicycle Facilities

Chapter 1520
Roadway Bicycle Facilities
1520.03(2)(a) Conventional Bike Lane Conventional bike lanes are at grade and adjacent to motor vehicle traffic lane. They are designated by a single solid wide stripe between the motor vehicle lane and bike lane. Additional bike markings (see the Standard Plans) in the bike lane and signage are also employed. The minimum width for a conventional bike lane is 5 feet (not including the gutter pan, where present); the minimum width is 6 feet, not including gutter pan, when the posted speed is > 30 mph and the bike lane is either adjacent to vehicle parking or a sharp pavement drop off, or there is a higher volume of vehicle traffic (> 6,000 vehicles per day or > 5% heavy trucks). Exhibit 1520-2 Conventional Bike Lane
* 6 feet min. when the posted speed is > 30 mph and the bike lane is either adjacent to vehicle parking or a sharp pavement drop off, or when higher than 6,000 vehicles per day or 5% heavy trucks. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1520
Roadway Bicycle Facilities
1520.03(2)(b) Buffered Bike Lane As the name suggests, a buffered bike lane is a bike lane with a marked buffer between the bike lane and adjacent motor vehicle traffic. The buffer is typically placed between the bike lane and an active traffic lane but can also be placed between a bike lane and a curbside parking lane. The buffer treatment consists entirely of pavement markings (including RPMs in some cases) with no vertical elements. Provide a minimum 2-foot buffer strip, and a 5 foot wide minimum bike lane (not including the gutter pan, if present). Widths in excess of the minimum are normally associated with the need to accommodate bicycle passing due to higher volumes, mix of bicycle traffic (i.e., bicyclists with differing levels of aptitude and/or types of bicycles) or steep uphill grade.

Page 1520-5
Chapter 1520
Roadway Bicycle Facilities
1520.03(2)(c) Separated Buffered Bike Lanes Separated bike lanes include a bike lane and a buffer area that includes a vertical element in addition to the horizontal offset between bike lane and motor vehicle traffic. Bike markings (see the Standard Plans) in the bike lane and signage are also employed. For these designs, provide a minimum 5 foot wide bike lane (not including the gutter pan, where present). Widths in excess of the minimum are normally associated with the need to accommodate bicycle passing due to higher volumes, mix of bicycle traffic (i.e., bicyclists with differing levels of aptitude and/or types of bicycles) or steep uphill grade. Provide a minimum 2 foot wide buffer, or 3 feet wide if the buffer is adjacent to parked cars or includes traffic barrier. By incorporating vertical features into the buffer as described below, BLTS is improved. Install one of the vertical features available for this purpose in the center of the designated buffer area. Acceptable vertical features include tubular markers, precast or cast in place curb, traffic barrier, vehicle parking, or a curbed planter strip. Other physical separation features may be used; consult with your region Bicycle Coordinator or headquarters Active Transportation Division. If a curb or traffic barrier is used, review the recommended lateral clearances to vehicle traffic appropriate for the design speed of the roadway in Section 1239.06. Use bike markings in the bike lane and signage as shown in the Standard Plans). If curb is used with a street level separated bike lane and without any other vertical elements, paint the curb white and provide guideposts to mark the ends. Exhibit 1520-4 Separated Bike Lane (tubular markers shown as vertical feature)
* 2 foot minimum. 3 feet minimum if the separation is adjacent to parked cars or has a traffic barrier. Contact HQ Roadside Safety if considering concrete barrier for additional width requirements. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Roadway Bicycle Facilities
1520.03(2)(d) Bike Boulevard (New Section 2023) Bike boulevards (also known as Neighborhood Greenways, Bicycle Priority Streets, and other names) can be used on low-speed streets with low vehicle volumes. Bike boulevards are designed to give bicyclists and pedestrians priority. Signs, pavement markings, speed humps, chicanes, diverters, and other tools discourage vehicle through travel and encourage low speeds. Bike boulevards may be used on state highways with ASDE approval; however, it is more likely that bike boulevards will interface with state highways through crossing situations. It is important to consider how to configure an intersection or dedicated bicycle crossing location when intersecting with a bicycle boulevard network (see Section 1520.04(5)).
1520.03(2)(e) Shoulder Use by Bikes (New Section 2023) Accommodating bicycle use on the shoulder is common on state highways that are not designated as Complete Streets. Shoulder improvements to facilitate bicycle travel include widening the shoulders to a minimum width of 4 feet, removing surface obstacles, and reviewing existing drain grates for compatibility with bicycles. If shoulder rumble strips are present, provide for at least 4 feet of usable shoulder between the rumble strip and the outside edge of shoulder. When barrier is present, provide for at least 5 feet of shoulder between the edge of traveled way (or rumble strip if present) and the face of the traffic barrier. Note that shoulders wide enough for bicycles are not dedicated bicycle facilities, and bicycle users do not have the same operating privileges as with designated roadway bike facilities. In rural to suburban/urban transition areas consider adding bike facilities, both to encourage speed management of motor vehicle users through the transition and to establish a dedicated special-use lane for cyclists to tie into the local network. Rumble strips are common on rural highways, and properly installed rumble strips (see Section 1600.05(1)) and routine maintenance provide for greater bicyclist comfort and usability.
1520.03(3) Design Performance Metric – Level of Traffic Stress (New Section 2023) The Level of Traffic Stress performance metric applies to Complete Streets projects. When selecting the crosssection layout and dimensions for a Complete Street, first determine the level of traffic stress (LTS) in both the existing and design (final) condition. The design goal is to provide for a LTS of 1 or 2. Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress (BLTS) data ranks highway segments from 1 to 4 based on roadway characteristics, with BLTS 1 being deemed suitable for all ages and abilities. LTS 2 is considered suitable for most bicyclists. BLTS 3 and BLTS 4 represent functional gaps in active transportation networks that present systemic safety issues and likely deter the use of active modes. The data provided in Exhibit 1520-2 - Exhibit 1520-5 provide BLTS (see Section 1520.03(2)(a) i and is not a substitute for detailed investigation of a location when specific investment decisions are being considered. The specific characteristics of locations with the same LTS rankings could vary considerably. It is important to note that an LTS 1 or 2 location might have additional, unmeasured characteristics that reduce its presumed suitability for active travel (see Section 1520.03(2)(a) ii). In addition, provide a buffered bike lane or separated bike lane where the existing or proposed posted speed is greater than 30 mph. Separation can be provided by adding a physical barrier such as tubular markers, curb, traffic barrier, or other (see Section 1520.03) or providing a separate facility for pedestrians such as a shared use path. See Chapter 1510 for guidance on Level of Traffic Stress for pedestrians (PLTS).

These tables can also be used to identify potential changes needed to achieve BLTS 1 or 2 for an alternative – including additional bicycle infrastructure, speed reductions, and/or lane reductions. Note that speed referred to in the tables is target speed. For more information about the definitions of bicycle facilities referenced in these tables see Section 1520.05.

1520.03(3)(b) Refined Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress (New Section 2023) Once the BLTS for a project alternative is determined per the tables above, examine the additional issues shown in Exhibit 1520-9 below to consider the need to provide design treatments in addition to those described in the BLTS solutions. This refinement is required for the project preferred alternative, but optional at the alternative’s formulation and comparison phase, based on an examination of the expectation of the value to the comparison process of the additional detail required to perform the refinement. Most of the issues in the following list do not provide a quantitative basis for examining the existing or proposed (design) condition. Therefore, work with subject matter experts and the project Advisory Team to consider each category listed and determine options for addressing each issue in order to reduce travel stress in the design for bicycles and pedestrians. The refined BLTS is considered complete when a design approach to addressing the travel stress issues listed below have been determined and documented through a collaborative process, with the intention that those approaches will be incorporated into the design. The designer documents that the BLTS has now been upgraded to the Refined (and final) BLTS for the design. Exhibit 1520-9 Refined BLTS Criteria (New Exhibit 2023) Characteristic

1520.04 Intersection Design (New Section 2023) Provide accommodation for bicycle movement at and through intersections on facilities where bicycles are allowed. See Section 1310.03 for design examples, additional design elements beyond those listed in this chapter, and criteria for determining level of traffic stress, and the appropriate and configurations and dimensions of those elements.
1520.04(1) Intersection Design Treatments Design intersections for bicycle mobility and safety performance to provide a visible, distinct, predictable, and clearly designated path leading to and through the intersection while managing potential conflicts between all other users and cyclists. This chapter covers options for intersection design for bicyclists while chapters in the 1300 series provide guidance for intersection control type selection and design. Intersection design in terms of bicycle safety and mobility performance is unique to each location. In every case, provide clear delineation of the bike facility leading up to and through the intersection, as well as segregating or prioritizing movements where appropriate. Although intersection treatments and design methods depicted in this manual are considered state-of-the-practice for WSDOT, certain pavement markings or configurations may not currently appear in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. In these cases, contact the Region Traffic Engineer for more information about documentation requirements.
1520.04(1)(a) Bike Lane Through Intersection The approach to intersections needs to balance the bicycle user’s safety needs with the mobility needs of other users. Eliminate or minimize conflict areas especially at intersections. If conflict areas exist, use dotted lines to identify the conflict area. Colored pavement markings can be used to further enhance and delineate the conflict area. Exhibit 1520-11 shows different applications of the approach through lane most likely to be encountered. There are several different ways to delineate bike lanes through the intersection. Dotted lines are the basic treatment that can be supplemented with green pavement markings (see Section 1520.05(1)) to further enhance the bike facility’s presence and position within an intersection.
1520.04(2) Intersection Bike Boxes (Section Rewritten 2023) An intersection bike box is a designated area on the approach to a signalized intersection, between an advance stop line and the intersection stop line, intended to provide bicycles a space in which to wait in front of stopped motor vehicles during the red signal phase so that they are more visible to motorists at the start of the green signal phase, as shown in Exhibit 1520-10. Bike boxes are used at signalized intersections and increase both mobility and safety performance for the bicycle mode. Intersection Bike Boxes are permitted throughout the state of Washington under FHWA approval number IA-18.35. Additional information regarding the use and application of Intersection Bike Boxes is found in FHWA Interim Approval IA-18. Applying a bike box (see Exhibit 1520-13) assists mobility performance by prioritizing the bicycle movement at an intersection. Positioning bicyclists in the center of the appropriate lane allows them to turn from a location where they are more visible to surrounding traffic, can increase the visibility of stopped bicycle traffic at an intersection, can reduce conflicts between bicycles and motor vehicles, can help mitigate intersection right-turn ("right-hook") conflicts, and can help group bicycles together to clear intersections more quickly. Bike boxes have also been found to prevent cyclist and motor vehicle encroachment into the pedestrian crossing, reducing conflicts with pedestrians at intersections. Bicycle safety performance is improved by increasing the visibility of the cyclist, and by reducing conflicts between motor vehicles making a right turn and the bicycle through movement (also known as “right-hook” conflict).

1520.04(3) Two-Stage Bicycle Boxes The two-stage bicycle turn box is an area set aside for bicyclists to queue to turn at a signalized intersection outside of the traveled path of motor vehicles and other bicycles. When using a two-stage bicycle turn box to make a left turn, a bicyclist would proceed on a green signal indication to the turn box on the right-hand side of the travel lanes, and then turn left within the turn box and wait for the appropriate signal indication on the cross street to proceed. Two-stage bicycle turn boxes can also be used with a left-side bicycle facility to facilitate bicyclists turning right. In addition to mitigating conflicts inherent in merging across traffic to turn, two-stage bicycle turn boxes reduce conflicts between bicycles and pedestrians and separate queued bicyclists waiting to turn from through bicyclists moving on the green signal. Two-Stage Bicycle Turn Boxes are permitted throughout the state of Washington under FHWA approval number IA-20.17. Additional information regarding the use and application of Intersection Bike Boxes is found in FHWA Interim Approval IA-20. Exhibit 1520-13 shows an example of a two-stage left-turn design for bicycle users (two-stage right-turns are available). This design utilizes a rectangular bike box to enable cyclist queueing at the crossroad signal phase. The bicyclist passes partway through the intersection to access the bike box, and then waits for the crossroad next signal phase to eliminate the bicyclist left turn movement. This treatment’s best application is at intersections with significant volumes of motor vehicle traffic or large volumes of left-turn cyclists, or when separated or buffered roadway bicycle facilities are used on the segment. This treatment can increase safety performance by reducing conflicts between cyclists and other users, segregating motor vehicle and bicycle users, and separating turning cyclists from through cyclists. The position of the queue box is a critical aspect of this intersection design. Depending on the size and configuration of the intersection, it may present a modal performance trade-off between bicycle mobility and safety versus motor vehicle mobility performance. Use turn simulation software to verify the queue box is outside the crossroad left-turn path, or restrict left turns at the crossroad to accommodate the queue box. The two-stage turn box should be positioned out of the path of travel of conflicting through traffic proceeding through the intersection on a green light, including other bicycle traffic passing through the intersection on the same signal phase as the bicycle traffic that will be using the turn box. Use turn simulation software to verify the turn box is outside the crossroad left-turn path, or restrict left turns at the crossroad to accommodate the turn box. Similarly, right turns from the crossing road may need to be restricted on red lights if the path of the right turn passes over the turn box. Avoid placing the turn box in a position where it lies between lanes of the crossing street, unless accompanied by a traffic island (e.g., where a right turn lane on the crossing street passes to the right of a traffic island on the approach to the intersection).

1520.04(4) Traffic Signals Considerations Consider bicycle needs and intersection geometry when timing the traffic signal cycle and when selecting the method of detecting the presence of cyclists. Contact the regional Active Transportation Coordinator and region Traffic Engineer for assistance in determining the timing criteria. At a minimum consider safety performance needs, projected bicycle volume, motor vehicle volume, traffic delay, roadway grade and the types of bicyclists using the intersection that may require more time to clear the intersection. Consider the installation of effective loop detectors or other methods of detecting a bicycle within the bike lane (in advance of the intersection) and turn lanes. Select detectors sensitive enough to detect bicycles and use a bike detector symbol to identify detector presence. Push button actuators may also be used to facilitate movement of bicyclists through a signalized intersection. However, requiring bicyclists to go out of their way to use push button actuators may create motor vehicle driver confusion of the bicyclists intended path through the intersection, as well as inconveniencing the bicyclist. If pushbutton actuators are used, consider their position relative to the bike facility. Pushbutton actuators are more effective when the bike facility is adjacent to the curb (curb extensions at intersections can create this environment). Consider an additional push button actuator for the exclusive use of cyclists when positioning of the actuator is in conflict with ADA design requirements (see Chapter 1510). For additional guidance on signal design, see Chapter 1330.
1520.04(4)(a) Bike Signals Intersections with separated bike lanes, other complex multimodal intersection treatments or those with a specific baseline need to increase bicycle user safety performance may incorporate a dedicated bike signal head with detection or actuation systems. Bike signal heads further separate modal user movements at intersections, while also allowing for priority to cyclists at intersections. Contact the region Traffic Engineer for approval for application of this treatment. At the time of this publication, bike signal faces are subject to requirements of FHWA Interim Approval IA-16.
1520.04(5) Median Diverter A median diverter prohibits drivers at side street approaches from traveling straight or left at an intersection and drivers on the mainline from turning left while still allowing pedestrian and bicyclists to cross. Median diverters can also provide refuge for pedestrians and bicyclists at a multi-stage crossing. The channelization reduces cut through traffic to create lower vehicular volume facilities and improve pedestrian and bicyclist comfort while also allowing pedestrians and bicyclists to cross one direction of vehicle traffic at a time. Consider a median diverter when one or more of the following occurs:
•
•
•
•
Bike facilities cross a roadway with median restricted left turns. Neighborhood greenways Used on the cross street. There is a performance need to restrict motor vehicle through traffic on a bike route.
Exhibit 1520-13 shows an example of a median diverter designed to accommodate bicyclist through traffic. Design refuge areas between 4 and 5 feet wide (longitudinally with respect to the median), additional width may be needed if high volumes of cyclists exist or are anticipated at the crossing. It is best to provide separate cutthroughs in the median for each direction of bicycle traffic in order to preserve the diverter function of the median.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1520-17
Chapter 1520
Roadway Bicycle Facilities
However, if the bi-directional bicycle movement is accommodated by a single median cut-through, a tubular marker or other treatment may be needed in the center of the cut-through in order to enforce the diverter function of the median. Consider the types of cyclists and destinations when determining the median refuge length (lateral dimension with respect to the median) to adequately store the bicycle. Consider what locations may need to accommodate the length of a bicycle and trailer. The refuge area is to be in alignment with the approach and receiving lanes of the crossroad. In other situations, the median refuge island may be designed for both pedestrians and bicycle users. When this is the case, design the median refuge predominately for the pedestrian as with midblock crossings (See Chapter 1510), note that additional lateral and longitudinal dimensions will be necessary.
1520.05 Additional Bicycle Design Requirements and Considerations 1520.05(1) Signing and Pavement Markings Use the MUTCD and the Standard Plans for signing and pavement marking criteria. (See Chapter 1020 for additional information on signing and Chapter 1030 for information on pavement markings). Pavement marking and signing options for bicycle facilities are rapidly changing. Situations may exist where unique project concerns may necessitate innovative pavement markings or signage. Consult, as appropriate, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) MUTCD website for bicycle facilities for a listing of the current status of bicycle-related pavement markings and treatments: www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bicycle_pedestrian/guidance/mutcd/index.cfm HQ Traffic Office approval is necessary for traffic control devices not currently approved for use through the MUTCD.
1520.05(1)(a) Green Pavement Marking – Criteria for Consideration Green-colored pavement markings are a traffic control device that’s used as a supplemental treatment for standard striping configurations for bicycle facilities. Green colored pavement markings are used to help mitigate the effects of conflicts between cyclists and other design users, areas where other design users are intended to yield to cyclists, provide corridor or network continuity, and help prevent non-bicycle uses (such as vehicle parking). The use of green colored pavement for bike lanes is permitted throughout the state of Washington under FHWA approval number IA-14.20. Additional information regarding the use and application of green colored pavement for bike lanes is found in FHWA Interim Approval IA-14. The below criteria are provided when evaluating the need to apply green colored pavement markings. 1. Existing Bike Facilities – retrofitting an existing facility with green pavement may be considered when two or more of the following apply: a. It is the engineering judgment of the Region Traffic Engineer b. There is an existing traffic conflict area, such as bike lane crossing a motor vehicle turn lane, and there are one or more observed motor vehicle and bicyclist crashes in the last 5 years. c. The bike mode is a modal priority (see Chapter 1103), and there is a baseline or contextual need identified associated with increasing safety performance of the mode. d. When a bike route intersects a multilane highway, and the crossing is neither signalized nor a roundabout.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1520-18
Chapter 1520
Roadway Bicycle Facilities
2. Changing of Bike Facility Type –consider green pavement markings when one or more of the following apply: a. It is the engineering judgment of the Region Traffic Engineer. b. A transition from a separated facility through a functional intersection or interchange area necessitates additional delineation to create a clear, visible, predictable and distinct travel path for bike users, and a bike signal or actuation device is not used. c. The facility type change does not substantively alter the configuration of an existing conflict area, and there are one or more observed motor vehicle and bicyclist crashes in the last 5 years at that conflict area. 3. New Bike Facility – Generally, the immediate application of green colored pavement on a new bike facility is discouraged until the need for increased safety performance is demonstrated. This said, consider green colored pavement when two or more of the following conditions exist: a. It is the engineering judgment of the Region Traffic Engineer b. The bike mode is a modal priority (see Chapter 1103), and there is a baseline or contextual need in which the application of green colored pavement markings is needed to meet the stated modal safety performance target (see Chapter 1101). c. The bike facility nodes and/or crossings are within 1 mile of activity centers, such as schools, libraries, colleges, etc. d. The bike facility crosses a motor vehicle free right turn to or from an interchange ramp. e. The bike facility is a bike route or bike boulevard (for definition, see NACTO’s Urban Bikeway Design Guide). f. The state route is also a city street, and the city policy or municipal code requires green colored pavement markings as their standard. g. The bike facility is raised and curb separated, and the city engineer requests green colored pavement markings at either crossings or conflict areas.
1520.05(1)(b) Green Pavement Marking – Configuration Use green pavement markings to supplement the conventional white bike lane striping as required by the MUTCD and FHWA IA-14. Apply green colored pavement markings in conflict areas where bike lanes cross driveways and intersections. If closely spaced conflict areas exist, it may be appropriate to carry solid green into the next conflict area as determined by the Region Traffic Engineer. Additional configurations or styles exist for the application of green colored pavement and can be used with the approval of HQ Traffic Office. Consider specifically when bike route continuity with a local agency’s bike facilities is a concern.
1520.05(2) Drainage Grates and Manhole Covers Locate drainage inlet grates and manhole covers to avoid bike lanes. When drainage grates or manhole covers are located in a bike lane, minimize the effect on bicyclists. Consider providing 3 feet of lateral clearance between the edge of a drainage inlet grate and the bike lane stripe, when practicable. Install and maintain grates and manhole covers level with the surface of the bike lane. Provide drainage inlet grates on bicycle facilities that have openings narrow enough and short enough that bicycle tires will not drop into the grates. Replace existing grates that are not designed for bicycles: a WSDOT vanned grate, herringbone grate, or other grate with an opening 4 inches or less center to center and perpendicular to the direction of travel.

1520.05(3) At-Grade Railroad Crossings Whenever a bike lane crosses railroad tracks, continue the crossing at least as wide as the bike lane. Use special construction and materials to keep the flangeway depth and width to a minimum. Wherever possible, design the crossing at right angles to the rails. Where a skew is unavoidable, widen the shoulder or bike lane, to permit bicyclists to cross at right angles. Exhibit 1520-14 shows options and details to consider for at-grade railroad crossings. Exhibit 1520-14 At-Grade Railroad Crossings
Notes:
•
•
Provide additional width at railroad crossings to allow bicyclists to choose their own crossing routes. When pedestrians are provided for, design as a shared-use path (see Chapter 1510 and Chapter 1515).

1520.05(4) Barrier, Railing, Fence, or Wall When the edge of the bike lane is within 5 feet of a vertical object like a barrier, railing, fence, or wall, provide a minimum object height a of 42 inches or more to reduce the potential for bicyclists to fall over the object. Where bicycle speeds are likely to be high (such as on a downgrade), where high winds are typical (such as on bridges), or where a bicyclist could impact a barrier, railing, fence, or wall at a 25-degree or greater angle (such as on a curve or an angle point in the alignment), a higher 48 in. to 54 in. continuous vertical element may be considered to account for the higher center of gravity of a bicycle rider. If the object is needed for bicycle fall protection because of a vertical drop of 30 inches or greater, or on a bridge the minimum height of the vertical object is 54”. If the object is concrete barrier, consider using or converting to single slope barrier to alleviate conflicts with the barrier and bicycle pedal movement that can occur with other barrier designs. On existing structures, the bridge railing type and height are part of the structure design. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for additional information. (See Section 1610.07 for further considerations.)
1520.05(5) Transit Considerations Transit and bicycle facilities can generate unique conflicts because of their typical position within the geometric cross section of the traveled way zone. Where public transport and cycling facilities meet, an integrated design that does not inconvenience either mode is desirable to meet the performance needs of these modes. Consider the following:
•
•
•
Route the bike lane behind the transit stop location using a raised bike lane or outer separation for that spot location. Ensure the resulting outer separation provided for the transit stop meets the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements (see Chapter 1510). Ensure signing and pavement markings are used to alert cyclists and pedestrians of the conflict area created with this design. Provide additional delineation in the bike lane to highlight the pedestrian and cyclist conflict, when separated buffered bike lanes and in-lane transit stops are used. Bus loading and other conflict areas will need to meet ADA requirements (see Chapter 1510) and those of the transit agency. Where bus operating speeds are low, consider a bus-bicycle shared lane with the transit agency.
Consider providing bicycle parking facilities near public transportation stops to improve accessibility performance needs.
1520.05(6) Interchange Considerations Crossing bicycle facilities through an interchange functional area has a greater potential for conflict because of higher travel speeds and lane configurations. Interchange crossings designed in a manner similar to intersection crossings are more compatible to bicyclists. Exhibit 1520-15 through Exhibit 1520-18 illustrate design options for bike facilities design through an interchange functional area. Interchanges can be special environments to evaluate the safety and mobility needs of the bike mode. The specific challenge is often the inclusion of motor vehicle free right turns to or from interchange ramps. The preferred configuration for bicycle safety performance at an interchange will not provide the motor vehicle free right turn and will realign ramps to intersect perpendicular with the crossroad (see off ramp terminal in Exhibit 1520-16). In some cases, it is possible to align the bike facility to cross an off ramp with a more direct path for the bike crossing (see Exhibit 1520-18). Breaking up the workload for the motor vehicle driver is one advantage of this configuration, similar to pedestrian treatments common in roundabout design. Shortening the crossing distance required for the bicyclist is another advantage with this configuration. Consider the inclusion of Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFB) or a refuge island when there are multiple travel lanes. This configuration may also require additional speed management (see Section 1103.05(2), signing or striping treatments on the ramp. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

1520.05(7) Sight Triangles at Intersections and Conflict Areas The visibility of all users is to be evaluated at intersections. Identifying sight triangles can help determine the optimal configuration of bicycle and pedestrian crossings. See Chapter 1310 for determining sight distance at an intersection, and Chapter 1340 for sight distance at road approaches near midblock crossings. Visibility is impacted by both speed and the configuration of the intersection. There are multiple benefits in multimodal intersection configurations to proactively manage motorized vehicle speeds (see Chapter 1103 for speed reducing traffic calming treatments) at intersection locations, rather than widening the intersection and/or removing elements from the roadside or streetside zone to obtain the needed sight distance. The primary objective at intersections and interchanges is to create a clear, distinct, and predictable travel path for all users through the intersection.
1520.05(8) Maintenance Considerations Consult with all maintenance jurisdictions for partnering opportunities and clearly understand which jurisdiction will be responsible for specific elements of the bike facility maintenance. Some maintenance jurisdictions may be better equipped to maintain the bike facility than others. Certain bike facilities, like the raised and curb separated, clearly fall within the jurisdictional authority of an incorporated city (see Chapter 1103 and Chapter 1600 for more information). For other facility types it may be more advantageous to discuss the capabilities of each maintenance jurisdiction and develop a maintenance agreement (see Chapter 301). It is important to obtain information from maintenance regarding the facility type and dimensioning and discuss methods for maintaining the facility. The Maintenance Owner’s Manual (See Chapter 301) is suggested to contain frequency, equipment needs and material types necessary for the continual maintenance of facility features, including but not limited to:

1600.01 General Roadside safety addresses the area outside the roadway and is an important component of total highway design. There are numerous reasons why a vehicle leaves the roadway, including driver error and behaviors. Regardless of the reason, a roadside design can reduce the severity and subsequent consequences of a roadside encroachment. From a crash reduction and severity perspective, the ideal highway has roadsides and median areas that are relatively flat and unobstructed by objects. It is also recognized that different facilities have different needs and considerations, and these issues are considered in any final design. It is not possible to provide a clear zone free of objects at all locations and under all circumstances. The engineer faces many tradeoffs in design decision-making such as balancing needs of the environment, right of way, and various modes of transportation. The fact that recommended design values related to the installation of barrier and other mitigation countermeasures are presented in this chapter, does not mean that WSDOT is required to modify or upgrade existing locations to meet current criteria. Roadside safety may be addressed by projects identified through priority programming, during certain preservation project activities (See Chapter 1120), or may be considered by projects as part of a safety analysis (See Chapter 321). Elements such as sideslopes, fixed objects, and water are all features that a vehicle might encounter when it leaves the roadway and become part of such an analysis. Roadside safety devices, such as traffic barriers, bridge barriers, transitions, impact attenuators, and breakaway devices, are features that may be installed to mitigate a specific roadside condition. On projects where the need to mitigate objects is determined based on location related to Design Clear Zone, consider the following mitigation measures in this order: (See Section 1600.02 Clear Zone) 1. Remove 2. Relocate 3. Redesign a fixed object by using breakaway features or making the fixed object traversable (See Section 1600.03) 4. Shield with a traffic barrier 5. Delineate (To only delineate requires a Design Analysis. If this seems to be your only option, consult your Region traffic barrier expert or your Region’s ASDE.) Factors for selecting a mitigation measure include, but may not be limited to:
•
•
•
Crash severity potential Maintenance needs Cost (initial and life cycle costs)
Rumble strips can be employed to reduce the potential for lane departure or roadside encroachment in certain contexts (see Section 1600.05(1)). Use traffic barriers when other measures cannot reasonably be accomplished, and conditions are appropriate based on an engineering analysis (See Chapter 1610). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

1600.02 Clear Zone A clear roadside border area beginning at the edge of the traveled way is a primary consideration with existing or new roadside and median features (see Section 1600.03). The intent is to provide a clear, traversable area for a vehicle driver or bicyclist to recover when their path is altered due to environmental, human, or vehicle or bicycle factors. The Design Clear Zone indicates the target value for the clear roadside area (clear zone) and the level of documentation associated with roadside design. When a project will be addressing clear zone (see Exhibit 1105-1), compile an inventory of roadside and median features when they are located entirely or partially inside the Design Clear Zone, whether they are existing or proposed by the project. Document each inventoried feature location, the corrective actions considered, estimated cost to correct, and if the correction is planned or not using the Design Clear Zone Inventory Form. In cases where no action is taken, provide the reason(s) on the back of the form. In situations where the Design Clear Zone is beyond WSDOT right of way, evaluate options on a case-by-case basis. Consider the nature of the objects within the Design Clear Zone, the roadway geometry, traffic volume, and crash history. Coordinate with adjacent property owners when proposed options include any work beyond WSDOT right of way. At a minimum, provide clear zone to the limits of the WSDOT right of way. Clear zone is measured from the edge of the through traveled way, representing the intended lane of travel by any and all vehicles using the facility, and in both directions of travel on two-way facilities (see Exhibit 1600-1). All projects that alter the relationship between the through lane and the roadside by widening or realignment have altered the existing clear zone and require an evaluation of objects in the clear zone. Design Clear Zone principles apply to an auxiliary lane that operates as a through lane (such as a passing lane, truck climbing lane, etc.) while excluding turn lanes for at-grade intersections from applying Design Clear Zone principles.

1600.02(1) Design Clear Zone along Limited Access State Highways and Other State Highways Outside Incorporated Cities and Towns Use the Design Clear Zone Inventory form to identify features to be mitigated and propose actions taken to address those features. Guidance for establishing the Design Clear Zone for highways outside incorporated cities is provided in Exhibit 1600-3. This guidance also applies to limited access facilities within the city limits. Providing a clear recovery area that is consistent with this guidance does not require any additional documentation. However, there might be situations where it is not practicable to provide these recommended distances. In these situations, document the decision as a Design Analysis as discussed in Chapter 300. There is flexibility in establishing the Design Clear Zone in urbanized or urbanizing areas where operating speeds are 35 mph or less. To achieve this flexibility, use a Design Analysis to establish the Design Clear Zone that presents the tradeoffs associated with the decision. Provide information on the benefits and effects of the Design Clear Zone selected in the Design Analysis, including safety, aesthetics, the environment, economics, modal needs, and access control. Although not a WSDOT policy document on clear zone, Chapter 10 of the AASHTO Roadside Design Guide provides information to consider when performing a Design Analysis in urbanized areas. In curbed sections, and where applicable (e.g., parking), provide an 18-inch operational offset beyond the face of curb for lateral clearance to accommodate opening car doors or large side mirrors.
1600.02(2) Design Clear Zone Inside Incorporated Cities and Towns For managed access state highways within an urban area, it might not be practicable or appropriate to provide the Design Clear Zone distances shown in Exhibit 1600-3. Roadways within an urban area generally have curbs and sidewalks and might have objects such as trees, poles, benches, trash cans, landscaping, and transit shelters along the roadside. For projects on city streets as state highways that include work in those areas that are the city’s responsibility and jurisdiction (see Exhibit 1600-2), design the project using the city’s development/design standards. The standards adopted by the city must meet the requirements set by the City Design Standards Committee for all arterial projects, bike projects, and federal-aid projects. See the Local Agency Guidelines, Chapter 42, for more information on this Committee. Exhibit 1600-2 City and State Responsibilities and Jurisdictions

1600.02(2)(a) Roadside and Median For managed access state highways inside incorporated cities, it is the city’s responsibility to establish an appropriate Design Clear Zone in accordance with guidance contained in the City and County Design Standards (Local Agency Guidelines, Chapter 42.) Exhibit 1600-2 shows an example of state and city responsibilities and jurisdictions. Document the Design Clear Zone established by the city in the Design Documentation Package. Have the responsible transportation official from the city (e.g., City Engineer) document the Design Clear Zone, and their acknowledgement and acceptance of the design and maintenance responsibilities for project roadsides and medians, in a letter addressed to WSDOT, and file this letter as part of the local agency coordination in the Design Documentation Package. Respond to the sender acknowledging receipt.
1600.02(3) Design Clear Zone and Calculations Use Exhibit 1600-3 to determine the Design Clear Zone based on posted speed, sideslopes, and traffic volume at any given location. Note that there are no Design Clear Zone distances in the table for 3H:1V fill slopes. Fill slopes steeper than 4H:1V, but not steeper than 3H:1V are considered traversable if free of fixed objects. However, these slopes are also defined as nonrecoverable slopes. On nonrecoverable slopes, a vehicle might be able to begin recovery on the shoulder but will be unable to further recover control until it reaches a flatter area (4H:1V or flatter fill slope/3H:1V or flatter cut slope) beyond the toe of the nonrecoverable slope. Under these conditions, the Design Clear Zone distance is called a recovery area. The method used to calculate the recovery area and an example are shown in Exhibit 1600-4. For ditch sections, the following criteria determine the Design Clear Zone: a) For ditch sections with foreslopes 4H:1V or flatter (see Exhibit 1600-5, Case 1, for an example), the Design Clear Zone distance is the greater of the following: o The Design Clear Zone distance for a 10H:1V cut section based on speed and the average daily traffic (ADT); or o A horizontal distance of 5 feet beyond the beginning of the backslope. b) For ditch sections with foreslopes steeper than 4H:1V and backslopes steeper than 3H:1V, the Design Clear Zone distance is 10 feet horizontal beyond the beginning of the backslope (see Exhibit 1600-5, Case 2, for an example). c) For ditch sections with foreslopes steeper than 4H:1V and backslopes 3H:1V or flatter, the Design Clear Zone distance is the distance established using the recovery area formula (see Exhibit 1600-4; also see Exhibit 1600-5, Case 3, for an example).

*When the fill section slope is steeper than 4H:1V, but not steeper than 3H:1V, the Design Clear Zone distance is modified by the recovery area formula (see Exhibit 1600-4) and is referred to as the recovery area. The basic philosophy behind the recovery area formula is that the vehicle can traverse these slopes but cannot recover (control steering); therefore, the horizontal distance of these slopes is added to the Design Clear Zone distance to form the recovery area. Provide a minimum of 10 feet at the toe of all traversable, non‐recoverable fill slopes. Notes: For Roadside and Median areas on managed access state highways within incorporated cities, see Section 1600.02 for guidance. Curb is not considered adequate to redirect an errant vehicle. Design Clear Zone distances are given in feet, measured from the edge of traveled way.

* When the fill section slope is steeper than 4H:1V, but not steeper than 3H:1V, the Design Clear Zone distance is modified by the recovery area formula (see Exhibit 1600-4) and is referred to as the recovery area. The recovery area formula can be used in certain situations with foreslopes steeper than 3H:1V (see Section 1600.03(1)(a) and Exhibit 1600-5: Case 3 for more information). The basic philosophy behind the recovery area formula is that the vehicle can traverse these slopes but cannot recover and return to the roadway (control steering); therefore, the horizontal distance of these slopes is added to the Design Clear Zone distance to form the recovery area.

1600.03 Mitigation Guidance There are three general categories of features to be mitigated: sideslopes, fixed objects, and water. This section provides guidance for determining when these objects are to be mitigated. For each case, the following conditions need consideration:
•
•
•
•
•
Locations with an expected elevated crash frequency. Locations with pedestrian and bicyclist usage (See Chapter 1510, Pedestrian Facilities, Chapter 1515, Shared-Use Paths, and Chapter 1520, Roadway Bicycle Facilities). Locations where speed management measures are present or contemplated (See Chapter 1103). Locations with playgrounds, monuments, and other locations with high social value. Locations where redirectional landforms, also referred to as earth berms, were installed to mitigate objects located in depressed medians and at roadsides. They were constructed of materials that provided support for a traversing vehicle. With slopes in the range of 2H:1V to 3H:1V, they were intended to redirect errant vehicles. The use of redirectional landforms has been discontinued as a means for mitigating fixed objects. Where redirectional landforms currently exist as mitigation for a fixed object, provide designs where the landforms, and the feature(s) they were intended to mitigate, are removed, relocated, made crashworthy, or shielded with barrier.
The use of a traffic barrier for mitigation of features other than those described in the section below requires justification.
1600.03(1) Side Slopes 1600.03(1)(a) Fill Slopes Fill slopes can increase the crash potential for an errant vehicle with the degree of severity dependent upon the slope and height of the fill. Providing fill slopes that are 4H:1V or flatter can mitigate this condition. If flattening the slope is not feasible or cost-effective, the installation of a barrier might be appropriate. Exhibit 1600-6 represents a selection procedure used to determine whether a fill sideslope constitutes a condition for which a barrier is a cost-effective mitigation. The curves shown on Exhibit 1600-6 are based on the severity indexes and represent the points where total costs associated with a traffic barrier are equal to the predicted cost of crashes over the service life for selected slope heights without traffic barrier. Using Exhibit 1600-6, if the ADT and height of fill intersect below the “Slope Mitigation Required” side of the given embankment slope curve, then flatten the slope. Otherwise, provide a barrier if flattening the slope is not feasible. In new construction or reconstruction, a design analysis is required when not flattening slopes nor installing barrier in instances where Exhibit 1600-6 indicates that mitigation is required, or when installing barrier in instances where Exhibit 1600-6 indicates mitigation is not required. Do not use Exhibit 1600-6 for fill slope design. First, design slopes following guidance in Chapter 1239 by evaluating side slope designs with clear, traversable slopes before pursuing a barrier option. Then, use Exhibit 1600-6 to verify whether slope flattening or barrier is required for the slope.

Chapter 1600
Roadside Safety
1600.03(1)(b) Cut Slopes A traversable cut slope reduces crash potential. The exception is a rock cut with a rough face that might cause vehicle snagging rather than providing relatively smooth redirection. Analyze the location and evaluate the roadside characteristics, crash potential, and other benefits of treatment of rough rock cuts located within the Design Clear Zone. Conduct an individual investigation for each rock cut or group of rock cuts. A cost-effectiveness analysis that considers the consequences of doing nothing, removal, smoothing of the cut slope, grading at the base of the rock cut to provide a smooth surface, and other viable options to reduce the severity of the condition can be used to determine the appropriate treatment. Some potential mitigative options are roadside barrier and rumble strips.
1600.03(2) Fixed Objects Use engineering judgment when considering the following objects for mitigation:
•
•
•
•
•
Wooden poles or posts with cross-sectional areas greater than 16 square inches that do not have breakaway features. Signs, illumination, cameras, weather stations, and other items mounted on non-breakaway poles, cantilevers, or bridges. Trees with a diameter of 4 inches or more, measured at 6 inches above the ground surface. Fixed objects extending above the ground surface by more than 4 inches; for example, boulders, concrete bridge rails, signal/electrical/ITS cabinets, piers, and retaining walls. Drainage elements, such as culvert and pipe ends.
1600.03(2)(a) Trees When evaluating new plantings or existing trees in the Design Clear Zone, consider the maximum allowable diameter of 4 inches, measured at 6 inches above the ground when the tree has matured. When removing trees within the Design Clear Zone, complete removal of stumps is preferred. However, to avoid significant disturbance of the roadside vegetation, larger stumps may be mitigated by grinding or cutting them flush to the ground and grading around them. Removal of trees may reduce the severity of impacts of roadway departure. It is recognized that different facilities have different needs and considerations, and these issues are considered in any design. For instance, removal of trees within the Design Clear Zone may not be desirable in suburban, urban, or urban core areas, or in other land use contexts that provide for non-motorized uses, such as a forest, park, or within a scenic and recreational highway. In these situations, analyze crash reports’ contributing factors to determine whether roadside vegetation is contributing to the severity of crashes. If large vegetation is removed, consult guidance contained in established vegetation management plans, corridor plans, or the WSDOT Roadside Manual. Additional guidance for maintenance of roadside vegetation can be found for some routes in the Memorandum of Understanding between the US Forest Service and WSDOT, Highways Over National Forest Lands, dated . In incorporated cities, refer to guidance in Section 1600.02(2).

1600.03(2)(b) Mailboxes For mailboxes located within the Design Clear Zone, provide supports and connections as shown in the Standard Plans. The height from the ground to the bottom of the mailbox may vary from 3 feet 5 inches to 3 feet 9 inches.) Coordinate with homeowners when upgrading mailboxes. Where sidewalks are present, contact the postal service to determine the most appropriate mailbox location. Locate mailboxes on limited access highways in accordance with Chapter 530, Limited Access. A turnout, as shown in Exhibit 1600-7, is not needed on limited access highways with shoulders of 6 feet or more where only one mailbox is to be installed. On managed access highways, mailboxes are to be on the right-hand side of the road in the postal carrier’s direction of travel. Avoid placing mailboxes along high-speed, high-volume highways. Locate Neighborhood Delivery and Collection Box Units outside the Design Clear Zone. Exhibit 1600-7 Mailbox Location and Turnout Design

Roadside Safety
1600.03(2)(c) Culvert Ends Provide a traversable end treatment when the culvert end section or opening is within the Design Clear Zone. No part of the culvert or end treatment should protrude more than 4" above the ground line. Traversable end treatments include:
•
•
Culverts perpendicular to direction of travel: o Culverts 36” and smaller as measured parallel to the direction of travel (Consider treating these culvert ends even outside Design Clear Zone) ▪ For roadway side slopes 4:1 or steeper, see Standard Plan B-70.20 ▪ For slopes flatter than 4:1 (see Standard Plan B-70.20 and note “treatment for slopes flatter than 4:1”) o Culverts larger than 36 inches, as measured parallel to the direction of travel, require Type 1 safety bars. (See Standard Plan B-75.50) Culverts parallel to direction of travel require safety bars: o Type 2 safety bars are used for circular culverts up to 36 inches. (See Standard Plan B-75.60) o Type 3 safety bars are used for metal end sections of circular culverts between 36 inches and 60 inches and for metal end sections of arched culverts between 30 inches and 72 inches. (See Standard Plan B-80.20) o Type 4 safety bars are used for metal end sections of circular culverts between 15 inches and 60 inches and for metal end sections of arched culverts between 18 inches and 72 inches. (See Standard Plan B-80.40)
Bars are permitted where they will not significantly affect the stream hydraulics and where debris drift is minor. Consult the Region Maintenance Office and Region Hydraulics to verify these conditions. If debris drift is a concern, consult Region Hydraulics for options to reduce the amount of debris that can enter the pipe.
1600.03(2)(d) Signposts Whenever possible, locate signs behind the standard run, but not the end terminals, of existing or planned traffic barrier installations to eliminate the need for breakaway posts, and place them such that the sign face is behind the barrier. (See Chapter 1020 for additional information regarding the placement of signs.) Use the MUTCD to guide placement of the warning sign. Signposts with cross-sectional areas greater than 16 square inches that are within the Design Clear Zone and not located behind a barrier are to have breakaway features as shown in the Standard Plans. Sign bridges and cantilever sign supports are designed for placement outside the Design Clear Zone or must be shielded by barrier.
1600.03(2)(e) Traffic Signal Standards/Posts/Supports A design analysis is not required to install signal poles at intersections inside the Design Clear Zone because it is a common practice and practicable mitigation options for locating signal poles at these locations are limited. Although locating a signal pole outside the Design Clear Zone is desirable, this mitigation option is not feasible in many cases. Other possible mitigation options for overhead signals including breakaway supports or placing barrier to shield a signal pole are generally not feasible or desirable. Using barrier is typically not feasible due to geometric constraints and the need to accommodate pedestrians and bicyclists. Supports for overhead ramp meter signals are generally not breakaway, but traffic barrier is an available mitigation option in most cases.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1600-13
Chapter 1600
Roadside Safety
Shorter vertical signal supports are available with breakaway features. Vertical poles greater than 10-feet in height require additional grading for the breakaway features to function properly. This additional grading is the same as that required for breakaway light standards (See Section 1600.03(2)(h)).
1600.03(2)(f) Fire Hydrants Fire hydrants are typically allowed on WSDOT right of way by franchise or permit. Fire hydrants that are made of cast iron can be expected to fracture on impact and can therefore be considered a breakaway device. Any portion of the hydrant that will not be breakaway must not extend more than 4 inches above the ground. In addition, the hydrant must have a stem that will shut off water flow in the event of an impact. Provide mitigation to address potential vehicle impact with hydrant types not expected to fracture on impact.
1600.03(2)(g) Utility Objects Because utilities often share the highway right of way, utility objects such as poles, guy wires, and pedestals are often located along the roadside. These features are installed in the right of way under a variety of occupancy rights; including franchises, permits, or easements. The responsibilities and liabilities associated with the presence of these objects is directly related to the documentation authorizing their installation. Importantly, the rights contained within these authorizing documents include cost responsibility for relocation. Contact the region Utility Engineer to determine if action is needed regarding utility objects located within the project limits, and the occupancy rights in effect for the objects. For policy and guidance on locating new, and mitigating existing, utility objects along state highways, see Chapter 9 of the Utilities Manual. Coordinate with the region Utilities Office to obtain guidance on utility object design or to determine mitigation requirements for existing utility objects.
1600.03(2)(h) Light Standards Provide breakaway light standards unless fixed light standards can be justified, even if outside of the Design Clear Zone. Fixed light standards may be justified if one of the following criteria are met:
•
•
•
•
•
Posted speed is below 35 MPH (See Section 1600.02(1) for Design Clear Zone in urbanized and urbanizing areas, and Section 1600.02(2) in cities). Mounted on barrier (top or elbow mount). Behind traffic barrier, beyond the barrier’s deflection design value (see Chapter 1610). Within a parking lot. Along isolated walkways and shared-use paths that are outside of Design Clear Zone.
Breakaway light standards require additional embankment widening to ensure proper operation, as shown in the Standard Plans and shall be provided in the contract plans (see WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual Section 700.08(3)). For cut sections, a culvert may be required in front-of or behind the foundation to maintain a ditch line. If this additional embankment widening cannot be constructed, such as in cases where the toe of slope will extend beyond right of way or into a water body or other sensitive area, fixed bases and traffic barrier may be considered. Document the decision to use fixed bases in the Design Documentation Package. Breakaway poles outside of the Design Clear Zone do not require additional embankment widening if the grade is constant within a 15-foot radius of the pole.

1600.03(2)(i) Horizontal Chain-link Fence Rails (New Section 2023) When an existing chain link fence with one or more horizontal rails is located within the Design Clear Zone, replace or modify the chain link fence to omit horizontal rails. When installing new chain link fencing within the Design Clear Zone, provide chain link fencing with no horizontal rails. See Standard Plan L-20.10.
1600.03(3) Water Water with a depth of 2 feet or more and located with a likelihood of encroachment by an errant vehicle is to be evaluated for mitigation. Perform a benefit-cost analysis that considers the consequences of doing nothing versus installing a longitudinal barrier to determine the appropriate treatment (see Chapter 321 for more information). For fencing considerations along water features see Chapter 560.
1600.04 Medians Median barriers are normally used on limited access, multilane, high-volume highways. These highways generally have posted speeds of 45 mph or higher. Median barrier is normally placed on limited access state highways. Where median barrier is used on managed access highways where bicyclists, pedestrians, and transit users are present, consider providing accessible barrier openings at crossing locations. Install end treatments where median barrier openings are provided. Provide median barrier on full access control multilane highways with median widths of 50 feet or less and posted speeds of 45 mph or higher. Consider median barrier on highways with wider medians or lower posted speeds when there is a history of cross-median crashes. Contact the HQ Design Office for more information. In diverging diamond interchanges that involve a single bridge structure, or in which travel directions share a continuous surface, provide a barrier in order to separate travel directions or to separate vehicles from a pedestrian facility in the median regardless of the posted speed or median width. Barrier type and design may be either project specific or selected from standard plans. Contact the HQ Design Office for more information. Provide a left-side shoulder when installing median barrier using width criteria given in Chapter 1230. Consider a wider shoulder area where the barrier might cast a shadow on the roadway and hinder the melting of ice. (See Chapter 1239 for additional criteria for placement of median barrier, Chapter 1610 for information on the types of barriers that can be used, and Chapter 1260 for lateral clearance on the inside of a curve to provide the needed stopping sight distance.) Consider the need to accommodate drainage as a result of the addition of median barrier treatments. When median barrier is being placed in an existing median, identify the existing crossovers and enforcement observation points. Provide the needed median crossovers in accordance with Chapter 1370, considering enforcement needs. Chapter 1410 provides guidance on HOV enforcement.
1600.05 Other Roadside Safety Features 1600.05(1) Rumble Strips and Rumble Stripes Rumble strips are milled grooves or rows of raised pavement markers placed perpendicular to the direction of travel, or a continuous sinusoidal pattern milled longitudinal to the direction of travel, intended to alert inattentive drivers to a potential lane departure. A sinusoidal pattern can be used when a low noise design is desired.

Roadside Safety
The pavement receiving rumble strips needs to be in good condition and thick enough to support the rumble strips. Certain pavement types, such as open graded pavements, are not suitable for rumble strip installation. Grinding rumble strips into inadequate pavement will lead to premature deterioration of the surrounding pavement. Areas where the pavement is inadequate for rumble strip installation require removal and replacement of the existing pavement at and adjacent to the location of the rumble strip. Consult with the Region Materials Engineer to determine whether the existing pavement is adequate for rumble strip installation. The Region Materials Engineer will provide a pavement design for removing and replacing the existing pavement near the rumble strip if needed. When installing both rumble strips and recessed lane markers, follow the Standard Plan to avoid overlapping the grindings. Contact HQ Bridge to confirm if rumble strips are appropriate to be installed on bridges included in the project. Installing rumble strips in bituminous surface treatment (or BST) or other thin surface treatments can expose pavement structure and lead to delamination. In new rumble strip locations where a BST will be applied on top of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavement, install the rumble strips in the HMA pavement before placing the BST. Increase the milling depth of the rumble strips in order to maintain the plan rumble depth by accounting for the BST thickness (see WSDOT Standard Plans). See guidance in Section 1120.02(11) for any type of project that applies a BST (chip seal) on top of an existing rumble strip. Provide an offset to the longitudinal paving joint so that rumble strips are not ground into the joint where practicable. For additional guidance on surface preparation and pavement stability, refer to the WSDOT Pavement Policy. The noise created when vehicle tires contact a rumble strip may adversely impact nearby residences and other land uses. Left-turning or passing vehicles, frequent passing maneuvers on two lane highways, and off-tracking of vehicles or trailers in tight radius curves, are examples of situations where incidental contact can happen. Noise impacts may be anticipated, and a low noise rumble strip design may be appropriate for use at these locations when installing rumble strips in urban growth areas, and/or within 600 feet of a residence, school, church, or campground. In situations where a low noise rumble strip is desired but is not feasible, measures can still be taken to reduce incidental contact, including discontinuing the rumble strip through frequently used road approaches, through passing zones, and in tight radius curves. Contact HQ Design for more information about low noise rumble strip designs, noise mitigation strategies, and the criteria for employing them. There are three types of rumble strip functions: transverse, shoulder, and centerline, and each are described in the following sections.
1600.05(1)(a) Transverse Rumble Strips Transverse rumble strips are placed transversely in the traveled way to alert drivers who are approaching a change of roadway condition or object that requires substantial speed reduction or other maneuvering. Transverse rumble strips may be placed in advance of locations such as:
•
•
•
•
Stop-controlled intersections Port of entry/customs stations Lane reductions where crash history shows a pattern of driver inattention, and Horizontal alignment changes where crash history shows a pattern of driver inattention.
Transverse rumble strips may also be placed at locations where the character of the roadway changes, such as at the end of a freeway. Contact the HQ Design Office for additional guidance on the design and placement of transverse rumble strips. Document decisions to use transverse rumble strips in the Design Documentation Package.

Roadside Safety
1600.05(1)(b) Shoulder Rumble Strips and Rumble Stripes Shoulder rumble strips (SRS) are placed parallel to the traveled way just beyond the edge line to warn drivers they are entering a part of the roadway not intended for routine traffic use. Shoulder rumble stripes are rumble strips placed immediately under the shoulder delineation paint, with any excess width milled or placed outward towards the shoulder. Shoulder rumble stripes are only installed where there is insufficient space to install shoulder rumble strips per one of the standard configurations (see Section 1600.05(1)(b)ii Undivided Highways). When shoulder rumble strips and shoulder rumble stripes are used, discontinue them where no edge stripe is present, such as at intersections and where curb and gutter are present. Discontinue shoulder rumble strips and rumble stripes where shoulder driving is allowed. Shoulder rumble strip and rumble stripe patterns vary depending on whether bicyclists are expected to use the highway shoulder, and whether they are placed on divided or undivided highways. Rumble strip patterns for undivided highways are shallower and may be narrower than patterns used on divided highways. Rumble strips and rumble stripes installed on undivided highways also provide gaps in the pattern, providing opportunities for bicycles to move across the pattern without having to ride across the grooves. There are four shoulder rumble strip and four shoulder rumble stripe patterns. Consult the Standard Plans (rumble strips) or Plan Sheet Library (rumble stripes) for patterns and construction details.
i Divided Highways Install shoulder rumble strips on both the right and left shoulders of rural Interstate highways. Consider them on both shoulders of rural divided highways. Use the Shoulder Rumble Strip or rumble stripe Type 1 pattern on divided highways. Omit shoulder rumble strips or rumble stripes along highway segments where any of the following conditions occur:
•
•
•
•
When another project scheduled within two years of the proposed project will overlay or reconstruct the shoulders or will use the shoulders for detours. At locations where the overall shoulder width is: o Less than 4-feet wide on the left (median) side of the roadway. o Less than 6-feet wide on the right side of the roadway (5-feet wide where rumble stripes are used). At locations where it’s been determined that noise is an issue, and a low noise design is not appropriate (see Section 1600.05(1)). As per Standard plan M-60.10.
ii Undivided Highways Shoulder rumble strips or rumble stripes are typically considered on undivided highways during centerline rumble strip installation or pavement rehabilitation. A list of prospective locations are provided to regions by HQ Design as a starting point in their development of a final list. The final list is compiled based on a field review of the prospective locations. Omit shoulder rumble strips or rumble stripes along highway segments where any of the following conditions occur:
•
•
Where usable shoulder for bicycles will be reduced to less than 4-feet (5-feet where barrier is present). Field-verify these dimensions. Where downhill grades exceed 4% for more than 500 feet in length along routes where bicyclists are frequently present.

Roadside Safety
At locations where it’s been determined that noise is an issue, and a low noise design is not appropriate (see Section 1600.05(1)). As per Standard plan M-60.10.
Document decisions to omit prospective rumble strip or rumble stripe locations in the final list of locations. When selecting a rumble strip or rumble stripe design, consult the Standard Plans and Plan Sheet Library for the patterns and construction details, and apply the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
Consider using a low noise pattern, or employ measures to reduce incidental contact, in areas where noise impacts are anticipated (apply criteria in Section 1600.05(1)). Consider using a rumble stripe in narrower sections where they can help provide the required 4-feet of usable shoulder (5-feet where guardrail is present). Use Shoulder Rumble Strip Type 2 or Type 3 pattern on highways with minimal bicycle traffic. Use the Shoulder Rumble Strip Type 4 pattern where the bicycle traffic level on the shoulder is determined to be high. Consult the region and Headquarters Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinators to determine the bicycle traffic level and engage them in decision-making processes related to the use of rumble strips or rumble stripes on bike touring routes, and/or on other routes where bicycle events are regularly held.
1600.05(1)(c) Centerline Rumble Strips Centerline rumble strips are installed on the centerline of undivided highways to alert drivers that they are entering the opposing lane. Centerline rumble strips are installed with no differentiation between passing permitted and no passing areas. See WSDOT Standard Plan M-65.10 that shows when to continue or discontinue centerline rumble strip installation at certain roadway locations (i.e., intersections, bridges, road approaches, etc.). Refresh pavement markings when removed by centerline rumble strips. When installing both centerline rumble strips and recessed lane markers, follow Standard Plan M-65.10 to avoid overlapping the grindings. Centerline rumble strips are typically installed on rural highways where the posted speed is 45 mph or higher. They may also be installed on urban routes with posted speeds as low as 35 mph. A list of prospective centerline rumble strip installation locations is provided to regions by HQ Design as a starting point in their development of a final list. The final list is compiled based on a detailed review of the prospective locations using the following criteria.
•
•
•
•
•
Field verify lane and shoulder widths. See Chapter 1230 for guidance on lane and shoulder widths. Centerline rumble strips are only installed where the combined lane and shoulder width in either direction is greater than 12 feet. In locations where the combined lane and shoulder width in either direction is 14 feet or less, consider the level of bicyclist and pedestrian use along the route before installing centerline rumble strips. When drivers shift their lane position away from centerline to avoid the rumble strips, they are moving closer to pedestrians and bicyclists on the shoulder. Consider using a low noise rumble strip design in locations where noise is an issue or employ measures for reducing incidental contact where a low noise design is not feasible (apply criteria in Section 1600.05(1)). In urban areas, do not consider installing rumble strips where the need to interrupt the rumble strip pattern to accommodate left-turning vehicles is very frequent, or where the posted speed is 35 mph and below. Do not use centerline rumble strips where two way left-turn lanes exist.

Document the decision to omit centerline rumble strips in a Design Analysis, when that decision is outside of the policy provided in this section (see Chapter 300.)
1600.05(2) Headlight Glare Considerations Headlight glare from opposing traffic is most common between opposing main line traffic. Glare screens can be used to mitigate this condition. Other conditions for which glare screen might be appropriate are:
•
•
•
Between a highway and an adjacent frontage road, shared-use path, or parallel highway, especially where opposing headlights might seem to be on the wrong side of the driver. At an interchange where an on-ramp merges with a collector-distributor and the ramp traffic might be unable to distinguish between collector and main line traffic. Where headlight glare is a distraction to adjacent property owners. Playgrounds, ball fields, and parks with frequent nighttime activities might benefit from screening if headlight glare interferes with these activities.
Glare screening is normally not justifiable where the median width exceeds 20 feet, and the ADT is less than 20,000 vehicles per day. Document the decision to use glare screening using the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Higher frequency of night crashes compared to similar locations or based on statewide experience. Higher than normal ratio of night-to-day crashes. Unusual distribution or concentration of nighttime crashes. Over-representation of older drivers in night crashes. Combination of horizontal and vertical alignment, particularly where the roadway on the inside of a curve is higher than the roadway on the outside of the curve. Direct observation of glare. Public complaints concerning glare.
There are currently three basic types of glare screening available: chain link (see the Standard Plans), vertical blades, and concrete barrier (see Exhibit 1600-8). When the glare is temporary (due to construction activity), consider traffic volumes, alignment, duration, presence of illumination, and type of construction activity. Glare screening may be used to reduce rubbernecking associated with construction activity, but less expensive methods, such as plywood that seals off the view of the construction area, might be more appropriate.

Chapter Organization: Sections 1610.01 Introduction and 1610.02 Barrier Impacts present information to consider when deciding whether or not to install a barrier. Section 1610.03 General Barrier Design contains guidance common to ALL barrier types; such as deflection distance, minimum/maximum system lengths, length of need, and sight distance. The remaining sections, 1610.04 through 1610.08, present design information organized by specific barrier type (beam guardrail, cable barrier, concrete barrier, bridge traffic barrier, and other barriers). Refer to the Glossary of Terms for many of the terms used in this chapter. Refer to Chapter 300 and Section 1610.01(1) for design documentation requirements.
1610.01 Introduction WSDOT uses traffic barriers to reduce the overall severity of crashes. Consideration is given as to whether a barrier is preferable to the recovery area it may replace. In some cases, installation of a traffic barrier may result in more crashes as it’s an object that can be struck. Barriers are designed so that such encounters might be less severe and not lead to secondary or tertiary crashes. However, traffic barriers are not guaranteed to redirect an impacting vehicle without resulting injury to its occupants or triggering additional crashes. Barrier performance is affected by the characteristics of the vehicles that collide with them. Different vehicles will react differently given the characteristics and dynamics of the crash. Therefore, vehicles will be decelerated and redirected differently given the size, weight and direction of force imparted from the vehicle to the barrier. Barriers are not placed with the assumption that the system will restrain or redirect all vehicles in all conditions. It is recognized that the designer cannot design a system that will address every potential crash situation. Instead, barriers are placed with the assumption that, under typical crash conditions, they might decrease the potential for excessive vehicular deceleration or excessive vehicle redirection when compared to the location without the barrier. Traffic barriers do not prevent crashes or injuries from occurring. They often lower the potential severity for crash outcomes. Consequently, barriers should not be used unless a reduced crash severity potential is likely. No matter how well a barrier system is designed, optimal performance is dependent on drivers’ proper maintenance and operation of their vehicles and the proper use of passenger restraint systems. Site constraints play a major role in decisions regarding barrier selection and placement.

Page 1610-1
Chapter 1610
Traffic Barriers
Depending on the location, these constraints may include environmental considerations, topographic challenges, restricted right-of-way, geologic concerns, or conflicts with other infrastructure. Barrier systems and vehicle fleets continue to evolve. The choice of a barrier is based on the characteristics of today’s vehicle fleet and testing criteria, not on speculative assumptions of future vehicle designs. This continuum of change does not allow engineers to predict the future with any degree of certainty. Consequently, engineering decisions need to be made based on the most reliable and current information. Engineers are constantly striving to develop more effective design features to improve highway safety. However, economics, asset management and maintenance needs, and feasibility do not permit the deployment of new designs as soon as they become available on the market or are invented by a manufacturer. Further, most new designs only make marginal changes to systems and do not imply that old designs are unsafe or need modification. Solutions may consider crash frequency and severity. As discussed previously, performance of the system relies on the interaction of the vehicle, driver, and system design at any given location. Additionally, the ability to safely access, maintain and operate over time is incorporated into the final barrier decision. When barriers are crash-tested, it is impossible to replicate the innumerable variations in highway conditions under which the barrier applications occur. Therefore, barriers are crash-tested under standardized conditions. These standard conditions were previously documented in National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Reports 230 and 350. These guidelines have been updated and are now presented in the AASHTO publication, Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH). Roadside safety hardware (barriers, devices, etc.) are accepted for use by WSDOT following a review of its performance with respect to a crash testing standard. Documented evidence of performance includes, but is not limited to, crash testing results, a comparison to similar crash tested designs, or an engineering analysis of the system and/or its components. Following a successful review, the device is then considered “compliant” with the applicable standard (e.g., MASH-compliant). The latest roadside safety hardware standard (MASH) is being implemented by WSDOT product category. Implementation takes place as designs and products are reviewed by WSDOT, determined to be MASHcompliant, and accepted for use. Following acceptance, implementation is documented through modifications to the corresponding standard specification(s), standard plan(s), and/or are accepted to the Qualified Products List (in the case of proprietary hardware). The policy on work zone devices is described in Chapter 1010. To learn more about MASH implementation at WSDOT see the following website: Roadside safety | WSDOT (wa.gov)
1610.01(1) Documentation Document barrier location decisions, including any site constraints encountered that influenced those decisions. A decision to install barrier using criteria outside the guidance provided in this chapter requires a Design Analysis, unless otherwise directed by the ASDE.
1610.02 Barrier Impacts Engineering judgment is required in determining the appropriate placement of barrier systems, therefore consider the location of the system and the possible impacts the barrier may have to other highway objectives.

Traffic Barriers
1610.02(1) Assessing Impacts to Stormwater and Wetlands The presence of stormwater facilities or wetlands influence the choice and use of barrier systems. For example, the placement of concrete barrier may increase the amount of impervious surface, which could then result in retrofit or reconstruction of the existing retention/detention systems and environmental impact requirements and studies. Assess whether concrete barrier or beam guardrail placement will cause the need for an evaluation by the HQ Environmental Services Office. Conduct this evaluation early in the project’s development process to allow adequate time for discussion of options.
1610.02(2) Assessing Impacts to Wildlife The placement of concrete barriers in locations where wildlife frequently crosses the highway can influence wildlife-vehicle crash potential. When wildlife encounters physical barriers that are difficult to see beyond or cross, such as concrete barriers, they often stop or move parallel to those barriers, increasing their time on the highway and their exposure. Traffic-related wildlife mortality may play a role in the decline of some species listed under the Endangered Species Act. To address wildlife concerns, see Exhibit 1610-1 to assess whether barrier placement needs to have an evaluation by the HQ Environmental Services Office to determine its effect on wildlife. Conduct this evaluation early in the project development process to allow adequate time for discussion of options. Exhibit 1610-1 Concrete Barrier Placement Guidance: Assessing Impacts to Wildlife

1610.03 General Barrier Design Apply the policy and guidance in this chapter when directed to do so in Exhibit 1105-1, and following an examination of the potential alternative mitigation measures described in Section 1600.01. Chapter 1120 identifies those elements and features to be evaluated and potentially addressed during the course of many Preservation projects (see Exhibit 1105-1). Once the use of a barrier has been selected as the mitigation measure for a condition, select a particular barrier type by considering the barrier system’s deflection characteristics, cost, maintainability and impacts to traffic flow during repair. Barriers are categorized as flexible, semi-rigid, or rigid depending on their deflection characteristics (see Exhibit 1610-3). Barrier types include:
•
•
•
•
•
Beam Guardrail Cable Barrier Concrete Barrier Bridge Traffic Barrier Other Barriers
1610.03(1) New Roadside Safety Hardware Since non-rigid systems typically sustain more damage during an impact, consider the amount of traffic exposure maintenance crews might incur with the more frequent need for repairs. The costs for procuring and maintaining the barrier system are important factors when considering what system to install. Considerations may include:
•
•
•
•
•
Consultation with the Area Maintenance Superintendent to identify needs or recommendations. Drainage, alignment, and drifting snow or sand are considerations that can influence the selection of barrier type. Beam guardrail and concrete barrier can contribute to snow drifts. Consider long-term maintenance costs associated with snow removal at locations prone to snow drifting. Cable barrier is not an obstruction to drifting snow. Analysis of potential reduction of sight distance due to barrier selection and placement. Additional widening and earthwork requirements. With some systems, such as concrete barrier and beam guardrail, the need for additional shoulder widening or slope flattening is common. Selection of these types of barriers may require substantial environmental permitting or roadway reconstruction. Permits issued under the SEPA and NEPA processes may lead to the use of a barrier design, such as cable barrier, which has fewer potential environmental impacts and costs. For concrete barrier systems: o Lower maintenance costs than for other barrier types. o Deterioration due to weather and vehicle impacts is less than most other barrier systems. o Unanchored precast concrete barrier can usually be realigned or repaired after a vehicle impact. However, heavy equipment may be necessary to reposition or replace barrier segments. Therefore, in medians, consider the shoulder width and the traffic volume when determining the acceptability of unanchored precast concrete barrier versus rigid concrete barrier. See Exhibit 1610-3 for deflection area requirements.

1610.03(2) Existing Roadside Safety Hardware When directed in Exhibit 1105-1 to apply the policy and guidance in this chapter, evaluate the need to upgrade existing roadside safety hardware to a MASH-compliant product or design. Consider the standard to which the existing barrier or device was originally designed and tested: MASH, NCHRP 350, and pre-NCHRP 350. The decision to replace existing hardware that is not MASH-compliant is based on the project type as follows:
•
•
•
All projects directed to use this chapter in Exhibit 1105-1 are required to replace pre-NCHRP 350 hardware, except for breakaway cable (guardrail) terminals, which have their own independent replacement program. In addition, all improvement and preservation projects directed to use this chapter in Exhibit 1105-1 may leave in place existing NCHRP 350 compliant hardware that is still in serviceable condition, or alternatively may relocate it within the project limits. Note that NHCRP 350 hardware found to be in serviceable condition that is temporarily moved as part of work zone activity may also be reinstalled in its original location without the need to upgrade. See Section 1620.03(2)(a thru c) to determine if existing roadside safety hardware is in serviceable condition. See Section 1610.04(5) for additional evaluation instructions for beam guardrail terminals.
See Chapter 1120 for additional policy on addressing existing roadside safety hardware in Preservation projects. When leaving existing barrier in place per the direction above, confirm that the configuration and layout (height, length, offset, etc.) are according to the original standard, and correct if necessary. Consult with your ASDE for more information and for the latest guidance on documenting the decision to replace or not replace NCHRP 350 hardware on a project.
1610.03(2)(a) Guardrail and Guardrail Terminal Condition (New Section 2023) Examine guardrail condition using the procedure and metrics in the WSDOT publication “Field Guide for Guardrail Condition Assessment,” which is found on the Roadside Safety webpage. Establish and record the specific locations that match damage classes Medium and High as described in the guide and provide a replacement or repair of the hardware at those locations as part of the project. For replacement of sections in Type 1 guardrail runs involving six or more (75-feet or more) adjacent rail panels or posts and hardware associated with the adjacent panels, replace the damaged length with Type 31 guardrail components including adaptor sections to the rest of the run (see Std Plans C-20.10 and C-25.80). When the rail damage is within 100 feet of the end of a run, replace the end of the run and upgrade the terminal if it is not MASH compliant per Section 1610.04(5).
1610.03(2)(b) Concrete Barrier Condition (New Section 2023) Examine the condition of the concrete barrier with respect to the following criteria.

1610.03(2)(c) Other Roadside Safety Device Condition (New Section 2023) Replace other types of roadside safety devices not discussed in 1610.03(2)(a or b) which the responsible maintenance superintendent has identified as “unable to be serviced or repaired” (e.g., impact attenuators, inertial sand barrels, etc.). It is permissible not to replace roadside safety devices if they are functional and are: (1) being addressed in an upcoming funded or programmed project, or (2) already being addressed by maintenance activities. Consult with your ASDE when not replacing a roadside safety device for any other reason.
1610.03(3) Barrier Placement Proper installation of a barrier system is required for the system to perform similar to the crash tests that resulted in its acceptance for use on our highways. Maximize the distance between the barrier and the travelled way. See Chapter 1239 for minimum lateral clearance requirements.
1610.03(3)(a) Placement on a Slope Slopes may affect barrier placement. Considerations for barrier placement on a slope include:
•
•
For slopes that are 10:1 or flatter, concrete barrier, beam guardrail or cable barrier can be installed anywhere beyond the edge of shoulder. See Exhibit 1610-2. For additional placement guidance see Section 1610.05(1) for cable barrier, see Section 1610.04(2) for beam guardrail, and see Section 1610.06 for concrete barrier.

Select the appropriate barrier type using the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Contact HQ Design when retrofitting non-freeways with median barrier (regardless of median width). Address the design deflection characteristics of the barrier to avoid placement of barrier where the design deflection extends into oncoming traffic. Barrier may be provided under certain conditions as separation between a freeway mainline and collector-distributor road (see Chapter 1360). When W-beam barrier is placed in a median as a countermeasure for cross-median crashes, design the barrier to be struck from either direction of travel. For example, the installation of beam guardrail might be double-sided (Type 31-DS). Narrow medians provide little space for any maintenance activities, including repair or repositioning of the barrier. Installing barriers in medians that provide less than 8 feet from the edge of the traveled way to the face of the barrier will likely require temporarily closing the adjacent lane during maintenance activities. This will impact the travelling public and impact maintenance staff, and maintenance staff should be consulted. See Chapter 301 Design and Maintenance Coordination. Use single slope high performance concrete barrier (HP barrier) on freeways with medians 22-feet wide and less. Any barrier type listed above may be used on freeways with medians greater than 22-feet wide. In general, cable barrier is recommended with medians that are 30 feet or wider. However, cable barrier may be appropriate for narrower medians if adequate deflection distance exists. In wider medians, the selection and placement of barrier might depend on the slopes in the median. At locations where the median slopes are relatively flat (10H:1V or flatter), unrestrained precast concrete barrier, beam guardrail, and cable barrier can be used depending on the available deflection distance. At these locations, position the barrier as close to the center of the median as possible so that the recovery distance can be maximized for both directions. There may be a need to offset the barrier from the flow line to avoid impacts to the drainage flow. At locations where the roadways are on independent alignments and there is a difference in elevation between the roadways, the slope from the upper roadway might be steeper than 6H:1V. In these locations, position the median barrier along the upper roadway and provide deflection and offset distance as discussed previously. Barrier is generally not needed along the lower roadway except where there are fixed features in the median.
For additional placement guidance see Section 1610.05(1) for cable barrier, see Section 1610.04(2) for beam guardrail, and see Section 1610.06 for concrete barrier.
1610.03(3)(c) Placing Barrier Next to Dissimilar-Height Barrier, Walls, Columns, or Other Structures (New Section 2023) (This section will refer to the group of “barriers, walls, columns, or other structures” collectively as a “structure”.) At times, project conditions may require placing barrier next to a structure with a different height (See Photos A & B). This difference in height could cause an errant vehicle to lean over the shorter barrier and strike the exposed edges of the taller structure (See Photo C). A height difference of 2-inches or less is allowable between a barrier placed adjacent to a structure. Provide mitigation for barriers placed adjacent to a structure with a height difference over 2-inches that are in the Design Clear Zone and addressing any exposed edges for:

Heights up to 6’-5” (77”) measured from the roadway surface and extending out for the given deflection distance behind the face of rail of beam guardrail (i.e., Type 31 Guardrail, Thrie Beam Guardrail, etc.) Heights up to 15’-1” (181”) measured from the roadway surface and extending out to 5’-3” (63”) behind the top front edge of high-performance concrete barrier (i.e., High Performance Single Slope Barrier (42” min. height), etc.). Contact HQ Bridge for locations requiring Test Level 5 barrier (Note: TL-5 barriers are specialty types of barrier not commonly used by WSDOT that may be used in front of bridge piers or other spot locations).
Possible mitigation strategies include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
•
Placing the shorter barrier run in front of the taller structure with the top front edge or face of rail of the shorter barrier meeting or exceeding the offset requirements from the taller structure as described above. Providing a height transition (e.g., height transition barrier, sloped wall segment, other) with a top slope of 6:1 or flatter connecting the barrier run to the dissimilar-height structure (See Photo D).

1610.03(4) Sight Distance When selecting and placing a barrier system, consider the possible impact the barrier type and height may have on sight distance. In some cases, barriers may restrict the sight distances of road users entering the roadway, such as from road approaches, intersections, and other locations. In these cases, the barrier may need to be adjusted to meet the sight distance requirements at these locations.

Traffic Barriers
1610.03(5) Barrier Deflections Expect all barriers, except for certain types of rigid barriers (such as concrete bridge rails, barrier integral to retaining walls, or embedded cast-in-place barriers), to deflect when hit by an errant vehicle. The amount of deflection is primarily dependent on the stiffness of the system. However, vehicle speed, angle of impact, and weight of the vehicle also affect the amount of barrier deflection. For roadside or wide median installations of flexible and semi-rigid roadside barriers (high tension cable barrier and beam guardrail), the deflection distance is designed to prevent the impacting vehicle from striking the object being shielded. For unrestrained rigid systems (unanchored precast concrete barrier), the deflection distance is designed to help prevent the barrier from being knocked over the side of a drop-off or steep fill slope (2H:1V or steeper). For narrower median installations, design systems so that the anticipated deflection will not enter the lane of opposing traffic. When evaluating new barrier installations, consider whether impacts would require significant traffic closures to accomplish maintenance. Rigid embedded barrier systems are used when no barrier deflection is necessary or desired (areas such as narrow medians, at the edge of bridge decks, or other vertical drop-off areas). Runs of rigid embedded concrete barrier can be precast, cast in place, or extruded with appropriate footings. In locations where deflection distance is limited, precast concrete barrier can be anchored. Some movement can be expected for rigid anchored barrier systems and repairs may be more expensive (anchoring pins may damage the asphalt or concrete surface that the barrier is placed upon during a vehicle collision). Use of an anchored precast concrete barrier and other deflecting barrier systems placed on top of a retaining wall at less than the deflection distances provided in Exhibit 1610-3 requires approval from the HQ Design Office. See Section 1610.06 for more information on concrete barrier. Exhibit 1610-3 provides barrier deflection design values when selecting standard runs of longitudinal barrier. This exhibit does not provide deflection values for specialty barrier systems or installations (for example long span guardrail systems (Std. Plan C-20.40), box culvert guardrail systems(Std. Plan C-20.41 or C-20.43), Type 31 guardrail installed on a flare, the ends of Type 31 guardrail runs when terminated with an anchor (Std. Plan C20.14 or C-20.18), etc.). Refer to related Standard Plans showing specialty barrier systems or installation placement cases for additional details about deflections and dimensions that are useful in design or contact HQ Design for specialty barrier systems or installations deflections. The deflection values for cable and beam guardrail are minimum distances measured between the face of the barrier to the fixed feature. The deflection values for concrete barrier are minimum distances measured from the back edge of the barrier to the fixed feature, drop-off, or slope break.

Notes: This exhibit provides deflection values for standard runs of barrier. It does not provide deflection values for specialty barrier systems or installations (e.g. long span guardrail systems(Std. Plan C-20.40), box culvert guardrail systems (Std. Plan C-20.41 or C-20.43), Type 31 barrier installed on a flare, the ends of Type 31 guardrail runs when terminated with an anchor (Std. Plan C-20.14 or C-20.18), etc.). Refer to related Standard Plans of specialty barrier systems or installation placement cases showing additional details about deflections and dimensions that are useful in design. [1] See Section 1610.05(2) [2] When used as temporary bridge rail, anchor all barrier when the back of barrier is located within 3 feet of a drop-off. [3] Place any new objects a minimum of 5 feet from the face of existing beam guardrail type 1. [4] Steel barrier is also available for temporary applications. See Chapter 1010 for more information. [5] When anchoring temporary precast concrete barrier on bridges or other drop-offs, see applicable Standard Plans for anchorage details, lateral offsets, and deflection distances. [6] When placed in front of a fill slope or on top of an MSE wall, provide a minimum distance of 2-feet of widening with a 10:1 or flatter slope from the back of barrier to the slope break point or inner face of wall. Contact HQ Bridge when placing embedded single slope barrier on an MSE wall to ensure proper wall/parapet design. [7] See Exhibit 1239-3, Exhibit 1239-4, and Section 1610.06(1)(a) for shoulder widening and paving behind barrier requirements.

1610.03(6) Minimum/Maximum Barrier System Lengths At times, the barrier Length of Need (LON) formulas may calculate barrier run lengths that are quite short in order to shield an object or feature. Regardless of the calculated barrier Length of Need, barrier runs require a minimum installed length in order to retain their ability to contain and redirect an impacting vehicle. In addition, a maximum allowable run length is required for longer runs of high-tension cable barrier. Longer runs of high-tension cable barrier can be more difficult to maintain. Exhibit 1610-4 gives the required minimum and maximum lengths for standard runs of barriers currently used by WSDOT: Exhibit 1610-4 Barrier Standard Run Minimum/Maximum Lengths Barrier Type

Contact HQ Bridge for required minimum lengths of these types of barriers.
1610.03(7) Flare Rate A roadside barrier is considered flared when it is not parallel to the edge of the traveled way. Flare the ends of longitudinal barriers where site constraints allow (see Section 1610.01). The four functions of a flare are to:
•
•
•
•
Maximize the distance between the barrier (and its terminal) and the travelled way. Reduce the length of need. Redirect an errant vehicle. Minimize a driver’s reaction to the introduction of an object near the traveled way.
Keeping flare rates as flat as site constraints allow preserves the barrier’s redirectional performance and minimizes the angle of impact. It has also been shown that an object (or barrier) close to the traveled way might cause a driver to shift laterally, slow down, or both. The flare reduces this reaction by gradually introducing the barrier so the driver does not perceive the barrier as an object to be avoided. The flare rates in Exhibit 1610-5 are intended to satisfy the four functions listed above. Flares that are more gradual may be used. Flare rates are offset parallel to the edge of the traveled way. Transition sections are not flared.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1610
Traffic Barriers
Situations exist where hardware installations may have barrier flare rates different than shown in Exhibit 1610-5. If a Standard Plan for a barrier installation shows a different flare rate than is shown in Exhibit 1610-5, use the flare rate shown on the Standard Plan (see Std. plan C-2c and C-4f for bullnose terminals, and Std. Plan C-22.16 for buried terminals). Exhibit 1610-5 Longitudinal Barrier Flare Rates Posted Speed (mph)

1610.03(8) Length of Need Length of need refers to the total length of longitudinal barrier needed to shield a fixed feature. See length of need calculation spreadsheet. In many cases, there may be a portion of the traffic barrier installation that is not redirective in capability. For instance:
•
•
if a run of concrete barrier is terminated with an impact attenuator, there will likely be a section of the impact attenuator that is not redirective (see Chapter 1620 for more information). If a run of guardrail is terminated with a non-flared terminal or anchor, there will likely be a section of the non-flared terminal or anchor that is not redirective (see Standard Plans C-22.40, C-22.45, or C23.70).
Therefore, in most cases, the Length of Need does not equal (i.e., it is shorter than) the actual physical length of the traffic barrier installation required to achieve that length of need. Length of need is dependent on the location and geometrics of the object, direction(s) of traffic, posted speed, motor vehicle traffic volume, and type and location of traffic barrier. When designing a barrier for a fill slope (see Chapter 1600), the length of need begins at the point where the need for barrier is recommended. For fixed objects and water, Exhibit 1610-6 shows design parameters for determining the needed length of a barrier for both adjacent and opposing traffic on relatively straight sections of highway. When barrier is to be installed on the outside of a horizontal curve, the length of need can be determined graphically as shown in Exhibit 1610-8. For installations on the inside of a curve, determine the length of need as though it were straight. Also, consider the flare rate, barrier deflection, and barrier end treatment to be used. When beam guardrail is placed in a median, consider the potential for impact from opposing traffic when conducting a length of need analysis. When guardrail is placed on either side of objects in the median, consider whether the trailing end of each run of guardrail will shield the leading end of the opposing guardrail.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1610-12
Chapter 1610
Traffic Barriers
Shield the leading end when it is within the Design Clear Zone of opposing traffic (see Exhibit 1610-9). This is also a consideration when objects are placed in the outer separations between the main line and collectordistributors. Before the actual length of need is determined, establish the lateral distance between the proposed barrier installation and the object shielded. Provide a distance that is greater than or equal to the anticipated deflection of the longitudinal barrier. (See Exhibit 1610-3 for barrier deflections.) Place the barrier as far from the edge of the traveled way as possible while maintaining the deflection distance. If the end of the length of need is within 300 feet of another barrier run (either existing or proposed), it is recommended that the barriers be connected to form a continuous run except where the gap involves a buried terminal and cut slope. In these cases and where practicable, extend barrier runs beyond the length of need to a backslope and provide a buried terminal (see Section 1610.06(3) for concrete barrier buried terminal, and Section 1610.04(5) and Standard Plan C-22.16 for beam guardrail buried terminal). Where access is needed behind a barrier (e.g., maintenance access, utility objects, road approaches, etc.) and an alternative approach to providing access is not practicable, provide a gap in the barrier that meets the access need using a configuration where the termination of the downstream run is situated behind the upstream run, or is otherwise outside the Design Clear Zone. Where this overlapping configuration is not practicable, provide a minimum size gap in the guardrail run to meet the access need and evaluate the need for barrier terminals on the upstream and downstream runs.

L1 = Length of barrier parallel to roadway from adjacent-side fixed feature to beginning of barrier flare. This is used if a portion of the barrier cannot be flared (such as a bridge rail and the transition). L2 = Distance from adjacent edge of traveled way to portion of barrier parallel to roadway. L4 = Length of barrier parallel to roadway from opposite-side fixed feature to beginning of barrier flare. L5 = Distance from centerline of roadway to portion of barrier parallel to roadway. Note: If the fixed feature is outside the Design Clear Zone when measured from the centerline, it may only be necessary to provide a crashtested terminal for the barrier (see Section 1610.04(7)(a) Beam Guardrail Placement Cases). LH1 = Distance from outside edge of traveled way to back side of adjacent-side fixed feature. Note: If a fixed feature extends past the Design Clear Zone, the Design Clear Zone can be used as LH1. LH2 = Distance from centerline of roadway to back side of opposite-side fixed feature. Note: If a fixed feature extends past the Design Clear Zone, the Design Clear Zone can be used as LH2. LR = Runout length, measured parallel to roadway. X1 = Length of need for barrier to shield an adjacent-side fixed feature. X2 = Length of need for barrier to shield an opposite-side fixed feature. F = Flare rate value. Y = Offset distance needed at the beginning of the length of need. Different end treatments need different offsets:
•

1610.04 Beam Guardrail Strong post W-beam guardrail and thrie beam guardrail are semi-rigid barriers used predominantly on roadsides. They have limited application as median barrier. A strong-post W-beam (commonly referred to as WBeam) guardrail system is the most common type of guardrail system used. The design uses wood or steel posts, rail, and blockouts to support the rail away from the post. The system resists a vehicle impact through a combination of the tensile and flexural stiffness of the rail and the bending or shearing resistance of the post. Installed incorrectly, strong post W-beam guardrail can cause vehicle snagging or spearing. This can be avoided by lapping the rail splices in the direction of traffic (as shown in the Standard Plans), by using crash-tested end treatments, and by blocking the rail away from the posts. Beam guardrail systems are shown in the Standard Plans.
1610.04(1) Beam Guardrail Systems 1610.04(1)(a) Type 31 Beam Guardrail Use Type 31 guardrail for new installations. The Type 31 system uses many of the same components as the old WSDOT Type 1 system. The main differences are that the blockouts extend 12 inches from the posts, the rail height is 31 inches from the ground to the top of the rail, the deflection requirements are 2 feet greater, and the rail elements are spliced between posts. Type 31 guardrail offers tolerance for future HMA overlays. The system allows a 3-inch tolerance from 31 inches to 28 inches without adjustment of the rail element. Type 31 guardrail is available double-sided, which can be used in medians.
1610.04(1)(b) (Old) Type 1 Beam Guardrail Previous WSDOT standard practice was to install W-beam guardrail at a rail height of 27 to 28 inches and is referred to as “Type 1” guardrail. WSDOT is phasing out the use of Type 1 guardrail. Do not use Type 1 guardrail for new installations, except when the Type 1 guardrail weak post system is the best choice at an intersection due to site constraints (see Section 1610.04(7)(a)). Place new objects a minimum of 5 feet behind the face of existing beam guardrail type 1. For more information on (Old) Beam Guardrail Type 1, see: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/roadside-safety. Existing runs of Type 1 guardrail are acceptable to leave in place. If an existing run of Type 1 guardrail requires extending, use the Beam Guardrail Type 31 to Beam Guardrail Type 1 Adaptor shown in the Standard Plans, and complete the guardrail extension using Type 31 guardrail.
1610.04(1)(c) Other Guardrail Types W-beam guardrail Type 2 and Type 3 have a height of 30 inches and utilize a rubrail. A rubrail is a structural steel channel added below the W-beam rail and is used in these specific designs to reduce vehicle snagging on the post. Existing runs of Type 2 or Type 3 guardrail are acceptable to leave in place. If the existing run of Type 2 or 3 requires extending contact WSDOT Design Office to identify appropriate extension methods. Type 4 guardrail is a double-sided version of the Type 1 guardrail system. For new installation, use the Type 31 double-sided w-beam guardrail instead of Type 4 guardrail. Existing runs of Type 4 guardrail are acceptable to leave in place. If the existing run of Type 4 requires extending contact WSDOT Design Office to identify appropriate extension methods to transition to the Type 31 double-sided system.

Type 10 and Type 11 are thrie-beam guardrail systems. Existing runs of Type 10 or 11 guardrail are acceptable to leave in place. If an existing run of Type 10 or Type 11 guardrail requires extending, contact the WSDOT Design Office to discuss options. Weak post W-beam guardrail (Type 20) and thrie beam guardrail (Type 21) are flexible barrier systems primarily used in conjunction with a Service Level 1 bridge rail system for bridges with timber decks. These systems use weak steel posts. For information on Type 20 and Type 21 guardrail see: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineeringstandards/design-topics/roadside-safety
1610.04(2) Beam Guardrail Placement There are a number of considerations regarding guardrail placement. These include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
During the project development processes, consult with maintenance staff to help identify guardrail runs that may need to be modified. When existing Type 1 guardrail is replaced by Type 31 guardrail along existing shoulders with a width greater than 4 feet (5 feet for bicycles), the shoulder width may be reduced by 4 inches to accommodate the 12-inch blockout. A Design Analysis is not required for the reduced shoulder width. If the remaining shoulder width is 4 feet or less, see Chapter 1030 for barrier delineation guidance. Keep the slope of the area between the edge of the shoulder and the face of the guardrail 10H:1V or flatter. Type 31 or Type 1 beam guardrail can be placed anywhere outside of the shoulder on fill slopes 10:1 or flatter. Type 1 beam guardrail can be placed on fill slopes between 6H:1V and 10H:1V at the slope break point of the shoulder or at least 12 feet from the slope breakpoint. This placement case does not apply to Type 31 beam guardrail. Do not place Type 31 or Type 1 beam guardrail with standard length posts on a fill slope steeper than 6H:1V. See Exhibit 1610-10 for allowable placement exceptions on fill slopes steeper than 6H:1V using long post beam guardrail. On the high side of superelevated sections, place beam guardrail at the edge of shoulder prior to the slope breakpoint. For W-beam guardrail installed at or near the shoulder, 2 feet of widening behind the barrier is generally provided from the back of the post to the slope breakpoint of a fill slope (see Exhibit 1610-10, Case 2). If the slope is 2H:1V or flatter, this distance can be 2.5 feet measured from the face of the guardrail rather than the back of the post (see Exhibit 1610-10, Case 1). On projects where no roadway widening is proposed and site constraints prevent providing the 2-foot shoulder widening behind the barrier, long post installations are available as shown in Exhibit 1610-10, Cases 3, 4, 5, and 6. When installing guardrail where the roadway is to be widened or along new alignments, the use of Cases 5 and 6 requires a Design Analysis.

•
•
Use Cases 1 and 3 when 2.5-foot or greater shoulder widening exists or will be constructed from face of guardrail to the slope breakpoint. The use of Case 3 is not allowed on slopes steeper than 1H:1V. Use Case 2 when 4.0-foot or greater shoulder widening exists or will be constructed from face of the guardrail to the slope breakpoint. Use Cases 4, 5, and 6 when less than a 2.5-foot shoulder widening exists or will be constructed from face of guardrail to the slope breakpoint (see Section 1610.04(2)). The use of Case 4 is not allowed on slopes flatter than 2H:1V. The use of Case 6 is not allowed on slopes steeper than 1H:1V. Cases shown do not apply to terminals, transition sections, or anchors. Install terminals, transition sections, and anchors per applicable Design Manual requirements and Standard Plans. Cases shown only apply to standard guardrail run installations that are placed parallel to the roadway. Apply Case 2 when installing guardrail on a flare (see Section 1610.03(7)) or on a radius (see Section 1610.04(7)(a)). See Exhibit 1239-4 for shoulder widening/grading details associated with guardrail. See Exhibit 730-12 for beam guardrail placement in front of retaining walls.

1610.04(3) W-Beam Barrier Height See Chapter 1120 when evaluating guardrail system height on Preservation (P1, P2, P3) projects. For other projects requiring evaluation of guardrail (see Section 1105.02(1)), evaluate the guardrail system height as follows:
•
•
For existing Type 1 guardrail with heights falling outside the range from 26.5 inches to 31 inches, adjust or replace the rail to a minimum height of 28 inches up to a maximum height of 30 inches, or replace the run with 31-inch-high Type 31 beam guardrail. For existing Type 31 guardrail runs with heights falling outside the range of 28 to 32 inches, adjust or replace the rail to a height of 31 inches, or replace the run with a new run of 31-inch-high Type 31 beam guardrail.
For Type 1 and Type 31 standard run W-beam guardrail, the blockout and rail element may be raised up to 4 inches by field drilling a new hole in the guardrail post. Verify that the condition of the posts and blockouts are suitable for raising in this manner. If not, the post or block will need to be replaced. See the Standard Plans. If Type 1 Alternative W-beam guardrail is present, the blockout and rail element may be raised after each overlay by using the pre-drilled holes in the guardrail posts. See Section 1610.04(5) for information on adjusting the height of guardrail terminals.
1610.04(4) Additional Guidance Additional guidance related to w-beam guardrail:
•
•
•
Crossroad and driveway locations cause gaps in the guardrail creating situations requiring special consideration. The preferred solutions are either to eliminate the need for the barrier or realign the crossroad or driveway to accommodate the necessary guardrail run length. Alternatively, an intersection design guardrail system can be installed at the intersection. See Section 1610.04(7)(a) for more information. At these locations, a barrier flare might be needed to provide sight distance. Snowload post and rail washers are not used in new guardrail installations or guardrail terminal installations. Snowload post and rail washers installed on existing guardrail installations may remain in place except when the rail element is removed from post for any reason. If this occurs, remove and discard the snowload post and rail washers before reassembling the guardrail components. The use of curb in conjunction with beam guardrail is a special application. When a curb is needed place the curb as follows: o For Type 1 W-beam guardrail, a 3-inch-high curb is preferred, and the front face of the curb is placed flush with the face of rail or placed behind the face of the rail. The 3-inch-high curb can be used at any posted speed. If necessary, a 4-inch-high extruded curb with the front face of the curb placed flush with the face of rail or placed behind the face of the rail can be used at any posted speed. Finally, a 6-inch-high extruded curb with the front face of the curb placed flush with the face of rail or placed behind the face of the rail can be used where the posted speed is 50 mph or below. When replacing extruded curb at locations where the posted speed is above 50 mph, use 3-inch-high or 4-inch-high curb. (See Standard Plan F-10.42 for extruded curb designs and Standard Plan F-10.40 for extruded curb placement under guardrail.) o For Type 31 W-beam guardrail, a 3-inch, 4-inch, or 6-inch curb can be placed at any posted speed with the front face of the curb placed flush with the face of rail or placed behind the face of the rail. Use the shortest height curb feasible. An acceptable option is to install a 3-

Traffic Barriers
inch, 4-inch, or 6-inch-high extruded curb with the front face of the curb placed at a maximum 6-inch offset in front of the rail face at any posted speed. It is acceptable to place Type 31 W-beam guardrail behind curb and sidewalk when utilizing a proper offset behind the curb and sidewalk. Type 31 W-beam guardrail shall be placed 4- to 12-feet behind the front face of a 3-inch, 4-inch, or 6-inch curb and sidewalk for posted speeds of 45 mph or below. Use the shortest height curb possible. Do not place Type 31 guardrail behind curb and sidewalk in locations with posted speeds greater than 45 mph. Guardrail posts should be able to rotate when the rail is impacted. When installing strong post W-beam guardrail posts in a rigid surface such as asphalt or concrete pavement, use leave-outs. Leave-outs are areas around the post that has no rigid material, which allows the post to rotate. Contact the WSDOT Design Office for more information. For (Old) Guardrail Types 1, 2, 3, and 4, it is acceptable to use blockouts that extend the rail element from the post for a distance not to exceed 16 inches. Where it is not feasible to install a post on a Type 31 system (i.e. utility or drainage conflict), one post may be omitted every 56.25 feet (9th post), except that an omitted post must be a minimum of 75 feet from an anchorage post, a minimum of 35 feet from the beginning of a thrie beam transition, and a minimum of 35 feet from the point where a terminal system joins the standard run. o Do not omit posts in guardrail runs with posts placed less than 2 feet from the slope break point. Guardrail runs with omitted posts must have at least 2 feet of 10:1 or flatter embankment behind them as shown in DM Exhibit 1610-11 Case 2. o Do not omit posts where curb is in front of the guardrail. o Consult HQ Design for acceptable conditions to omit single posts in guardrail runs with 12’ – 6”, 18’ – 9”, or 25’ – 0” span systems (see Std. Plan C‐20.40) placed within the run. o List all the locations of omitted posts in the project plans to ensure that posts are omitted following the conditions described in this section. In locations where shallow fill depth prevents the installation of standard-length guardrail posts (i.e., box culverts, drainage), guardrail can be spanned over the location or be attached to the top of the structure (see standard plans). When a barrier design requires the guardrail posts to be attached to the top of a structure, either: (1) Notify the structure designer from HQ Bridge about the guardrail post attachment requirement, or (2) Follow the design requirements for a structure with attached guardrail posts provided in Chapter 8 of the Bridge Design Manual. Other shallow fill designs are available. Contact HQ Design for more information about these alternative designs.
1610.04(5) Terminals and Anchors A guardrail anchor is required at the end of a run of guardrail to develop tensile strength throughout its length. In addition, when the end of the guardrail is within the Design Clear Zone and subject to head-on impacts, a crash-tested guardrail terminal is required (see the Standard Plans). See Chapter 1120 for guidance regarding the evaluation of terminals on Preservation projects (P1, P2, and P3). For projects that require the evaluation of terminals (see Section 1105.02(1)), evaluate the terminals as follows:
•
Replace guardrail terminals that do not have a crash-tested design with MASH compliant crash-tested guardrail terminals. Common features of systems that do not meet current crash-tested designs include: o No cable anchor. o A cable anchored into concrete in front of the first post. o Second post not breakaway (CRT).

Traffic Barriers
o
•
Design A end section (see Beam Guardrail End Sections plan sheet in the Traffic Barrier (TB) section of the Plan Sheet Library). o Design C end sections may be left in place if the terminal is otherwise a crash-tested design —see the Standard Plan C-7 for end section details. o Buried guardrail terminals that slope down such that the guardrail height is reduced to less than 28 inches (measured in relation to a 10H:1V line extended from the breakpoint at edge of shoulder). When the height of a terminal or anchor, as measured from the ground to the top of the rail element, will be affected by the project, adjust the terminal or anchor based upon the following criteria: o If the height of the terminal or anchor adjoining Types 1, 2, 3, or 4 guardrail will be reduced by the project to be less than 26.5 inches or increased to greater than 30 inches, adjust the height of the terminal to a minimum of 28 inches and a maximum of 30 inches. A terminal height of 30 inches is desirable to accommodate future overlays. o If the height of the terminal or anchor adjoining Type 31 guardrail will be reduced by the project to be less than 28 inches or increased to greater than 32 inches, adjust the height to 31 inches. o When adjusting terminals that are equipped with CRT posts, the top-drilled holes in the posts need to remain at the surface of the ground. o When adjusting the height of a terminal or anchor, adjust it by raising the posts of the terminal or anchor and tamping the ground around the posts to prevent settlement of the raised posts. Note: do not raise the blockouts or rail of the terminal or anchor by drilling new holes in the terminal posts.
One terminal that was used extensively on Washington’s highways was the Breakaway Cable Terminal (BCT). This system used a parabolic flare similar to the Slotted Rail Terminal (SRT) and a Type 1 anchor (Type 1 anchor posts are wood set in a steel tube or a concrete foundation). For guidance regarding BCT’s and other terminals on Preservation projects see Chapter 1120. For non-Preservation projects, replace BCTs with a currently approved terminal using the following guidance:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Verify length of need, and adjust the terminal location as required. Replace adjacent transition sections that are not compliant with Section 1610.04(6). Transition from Type 1 to Type 31 using the adaptor (Standard Plan C‐25.80) where required. Raise or replace the entire run if engineering judgement indicates that it is prudent for that situation. Use the grading criteria shown on the terminal standard plans (C‐22.40 or C‐22.45). When using existing grading, check to see that it complies with the grading criteria shown on the current terminal standard plans. Remove curbs from in front of terminals if hydraulically acceptable.

Chapter 1610
Traffic Barriers
1610.04(5)(a) Buried Terminal for Type 31 Beam Guardrail A Buried Terminal (BT) is designed to terminate the guardrail by burying the end in a backslope. The BT is the preferred terminal because it eliminates the exposed end of the guardrail. For new BT installations, use the Buried Terminal Type 2. Previously, another BT option (the Buried Terminal Type 1) was an available choice. For existing installations, it is acceptable to leave this option in service as long as height requirements and other design criteria is met. See Beam Guardrail Type 1 – Buried Terminal Type 2 plan sheet in the Traffic Barrier (TB) section of the WSDOT Plan Sheet Library. The BT uses a Type 2 anchor to develop the tensile strength in the guardrail. The backslope needed to install a BT is to be 3H:1V or steeper and at least 4 feet in height above the roadway. The entire BT can be used within the length of need for backslopes of 1H:1V or steeper if the barrier remains at full height in relation to the roadway shoulder to the point where the barrier enters the backslope. For backslopes between 1H:1V and 3H:1V, design the length of need beginning at the point where the W-beam remains at full height in relation to the roadway shoulder—usually beginning at the point where the barrier crosses the ditch line. If the backslope is flatter than 1H:1V, provide a minimum 20-foot-wide by 75-foot-long clear area that is free of fixed features behind the barrier and between the beginning length of need point at the terminal end to the mitigated object to be protected. Flare the guardrail to the foreslope/backslope intersection using a flare rate that meets the criteria in Section 1610.03(7). Provide a 4H:1V or flatter foreslope into the face of the guardrail and maintain the full guardrail height to the foreslope/backslope intersection in relation to a 10H:1V line extending from edge of shoulder breakpoint. (See the Standard Plans for details.)
1610.04(5)(b) Non-flared Terminals for Type 31 Beam Guardrail Install a non-flared terminal when a buried terminal cannot be installed as described in Section 1610.04(5)(a). WSDOT does not use flared terminals on Type 31 guardrail systems. Non-flared terminals typically use w-beam guardrail, proprietary hardware, and an impact head mounted at the leading end. These systems also include an anchor to provide tensile strength for the guardrail. Non-flared terminals absorb energy during head-on impacts by processing the rail through the impact head in varying ways depending on the manufacturer’s own proprietary approach. Although these terminal systems are called non-flared, all manufacturers allow for an offset to move the impact head away from traffic. For non-flared terminal installations, the following apply:
•
•
•
Select non-flared terminals based on the posted speed as follows: o Non-flared terminals restricted to locations 45 mph or below (TL-2, Standard Plan C-22.45); o or non-flared terminals that can be installed at any posted speed (TL-3, Standard Plan C22.40). Where practicable, provide an offset of up to one-foot over the length of the non-flared terminal (TL-2, Standard Plan C-22.45) or up to two feet over the length of the non-flared terminal (TL-3, Standard Plan C-22.40) in reference to the roadway alignment. Non-flared terminal offsets can be provided to increase the clearance between the impact head and traffic to reduce the potential of incidental hits. It is acceptable to install non-flared terminals following the alignment of flared standard runs of guardrail with flare rates of 25:1 or flatter in reference to the roadway alignment. For standard runs of guardrail with flare rates steeper than 25:1, the non-flared terminal cannot follow the standard run flared alignment and can only be offset up to 1-foot (TL-2, Standard Plan C-22.45) or 2-feet (TL-3, Standard Plan C-22.40) in reference to the roadway alignment.

Include or confirm that embankment widening is provided as part of the non-flared terminal design and installation (see Standard Plan C-22.40 or C-22.45). Where practicable, install non-flared terminals on tangent sections of roadway. It is acceptable to extend the length of a guardrail run beyond its required Length of Need distance so that a non-flared terminal can be installed outside the limits of a horizontal curve. For non-flared terminals whose manufacturer allows installation on horizontal curves: o It is acceptable to install non-flared terminals with up to a full offset on horizontal curves with radii of 750-feet or greater (radius as measured along the shoulder). o Contact HQ Design when installing non-flared terminals on horizontal curves with radii between 500-feet and 750-feet (radius as measured along the shoulder). o Do not install non-flared terminals on horizontal curves with radii steeper than 500-feet (radius as measured along the shoulder). Do not install snowload rail or post washers within the limits of the non-flared terminals. Do not install non-flared terminals behind or coincident with curbs. Do not place curbs in advance of non-flared terminals within the limits of widened embankment (see Standard Plans C-22.40 or C-22.45 for widened embankment dimensions). Refer to Standard Plans C-22.40 or C-22.45 for additional details about non-flared terminal layout and dimensions that are useful in design including: o Terminal lengths and pay limits o Embankment widening dimensions o Location of the Length of Need point on the terminal as it varies by manufacturer
The roadside safety website provides information on availability or acceptance of different terminal systems including approved shop drawings. (See https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/roadsidesafety)
1610.04(5)(c) Terminal Evolution Considerations Some currently approved terminals have been in service for a number of years. During this time, there have been minor design changes. However, these minor changes have not changed the devices’ approval status. Previous designs for these terminals may remain in place. Note: If questions arise concerning the current approval status of a device, contact the HQ Design Office for clarification when replacement is being considered.
1610.04(5)(d) Anchors A guardrail anchor is needed at the end of a run of guardrail to develop tensile strength throughout its length.
•
•
Use the Type 11 anchor to develop the tensile strength of the guardrail on the end of Type 31 guardrail runs where a crash-tested terminal is not needed. A Type 2 anchor is used with the buried terminal.
For information on anchor types used in runs of (Old) Beam Guardrail Type 1, see: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/roadside-safety.

1610.04(6) Transitions and Connections When there is an abrupt change from one barrier type to a more rigid barrier type, a vehicle hitting the more flexible barrier may be caught in the deflected barrier pocket and directed into the more rigid barrier. This is commonly referred to as “pocketing.” A transition stiffens the more flexible barrier by decreasing the post spacing, increasing the post size, and using stiffer beam elements to reduce the possibility of pocketing. When connecting beam guardrail to a more rigid barrier or a structure use the transitions and connections that are shown in Exhibit 1610-11 and Exhibit 1610-12 and detailed in the Standard Plans. Verify the length of need (see Section 1610.03(8)) when designing transitions, particularly transitions between beam guardrail or end terminals to bridge structures. Type 21 transitions can be used on highways with all posted speeds to connect w-beam guardrail to single slope, safety shape or vertical concrete barriers. Type 22 and Type 23 transitions are used to connect w-beam guardrail to thrie beam on bridges. Type 24 transitions can be used on highways with a posted speed of 45 mph or less to connect w-beam guardrail to single slope, safety shape or vertical concrete barriers. When connecting a Type 21 or Type 24 Transition to an existing vertical faced bridge rail with a low parapet, a special connection plate may be required. Coordinate with the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office (BSO). The transition pay item includes the connection. Install transitions on 10:1 or flatter slopes with the 10:1 or flatter slope extending a minimum of 2 feet behind the guardrail transition post similar to what is shown in DM Exhibit 1610-10 Placement Case 2.

1610.04(7) Guardrail Placement Cases The Standard Plans and Plan Sheet Library contain placement cases that show beam guardrail elements needed for typical situations.

1610.04(7)(a) Beam Guardrail Placement Cases
•

•
•

Case 1-31 is used where there is one-way traffic. It uses a crash-tested terminal on the approach end and a Type 11 anchor on the trailing end. Case 2-31 is used where there is two-way traffic. A crash-tested terminal is used on both ends. Case 3-31 is used at railroad signal supports on one-way or two-way roadways. A terminal is used on the approach end, but usually cannot be used on the trailing end because of its proximity to the railroad tracks. If there is a history of crossover collisions, consider additional protection such as an impact attenuator. Case 4-31 is used where guardrail on the approach to a bridge is to be shifted laterally to connect with the bridge rail. A terminal is used on the approach end and a transition is needed at the bridge end. Curves (bends) are shown in the guardrail to shift it to the bridge rail. However, the length of the curves are not critical. The criterion is to provide smooth curves that are not more abrupt than the allowable flare rate (see Exhibit 1610-5). Case 5-31 is a typical bridge approach where a terminal and a transition are needed. Case 10 (A-31, B-31, and C-31) is used at roadside fixed features (such as bridge piers) when 5 or more feet are available from the face of the guardrail to the feature. The approach end is the same for oneway or two-way traffic. Case 10A-31 is used with two-way traffic; therefore, a terminal is needed on the trailing end. Case 10B-31 is used for one-way traffic when there is no need to extend guardrail past the fixed feature and a Type 11 anchor is used to end the guardrail. Case 10C-31 is used for one-way traffic when the guardrail will extend for a distance past the fixed object. The Beam Guardrail Type 31 Placement 12'-6", 18'-9", or 25'-0” Span design is used when it is necessary to omit one, two, or three posts. This application is typically used when guardrail is installed over a shallow buried obstruction, such as drainage structures. This design may be used in other situations where there are no above ground objects located behind the guardrail and within the lateral deflection distance. Three CRT posts are provided on each end of the omitted post(s). Type 31 guardrail (including terminals and anchors) must extend at least 62.5 feet (10 posts) upstream and downstream from the ends of the outer CRT posts (furthest from obstruction) in order for the guardrail system to function as designed during a vehicle crash. Also, this guardrail design has specific grading requirements, see applicable standard plan. Note: This guardrail design may require fall protection. See Section Chapter 1060 for worker fall protection requirements. See Section 1510.15(3) for pedestrian fall protection requirements. When a fall protection system is located within the deflection zone of the barrier system, contact HQ Design for options.

Traffic Barriers
Guardrail Placement at intersections – Two solutions are currently available for use where bridge ends or similar conditions exist in close proximity to a roadway intersection or driveway. These designs are used at crossroads or road approaches where a barrier is needed and where the length of need cannot be achieved using standard components such as standard longitudinal barrier runs, transitions, and terminals. The “Strong Post Intersection Design” uses Type 31 guardrail and is available for use in new installations. A “Weak Post Intersection Design,” which uses Type 1 guardrail, is available and may also be used in new installations (see Section 1610.04(1)(b)).
1610.05 High-Tension Cable Barrier Cable barrier is a flexible barrier system that can be used on a roadside or as a median barrier. Early cable barrier designs centered around low-tension cable systems. With research and crash analysis of these systems, the designs evolved into high-tension cable systems. These high-tension cable systems are primarily used in medians and are preferred for many installations due in part to high benefit-to-cost ratios. There are a number of manufacturers of high-tension cable barrier systems. These systems have been designed using either three or four-cables fixed to metal posts placed at a fixed spacing. Each cable system has specially designed anchors placed at both ends of the barrier run to provide the proper tensioning in the cables. Currently, both three and four-cable high-tension cable barrier systems are installed along WSDOT state routes. Use four-cable high-tension cable barrier systems for all new installations.
1610.05(1) High-Tension Cable Barrier Placement High-tension cable barrier can be placed in a median or along the roadside. Note: For non-typical installations, such as double runs of cable barrier or median ditch cross sections that differ significantly from those shown, contact the HQ Design Office for guidance.

1610.05(1)(a) Median Applications For typical cable barrier installations in a median, the following apply (see Exhibit 1610-13):
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Install the cable barrier as far from the edge of traveled way as site constraints allow. Consider a minimum placement distance of 8 feet from the edge of traveled way to allow vehicles to use this area for refuge. Install cable barrier on slopes 6H:1V or flatter. There are approved high-tension cable barrier systems that can be placed on slopes as steep as 4H:1V. The use of these systems requires special placement considerations, contact the HQ Design Office for guidance. Provide an obstruction free zone within the cable barrier system’s lateral deflection distance (see Section 1610.05(2)). On tangent sections of a roadway where no ditch is present, consider installing the cable barrier in the middle of the median. See Exhibit 1610-13. Along horizontal curves, consider installing the cable barrier along the inside of the curve. Reduce the post spacing per manufacturer’s recommendations. In medians with ditches, install the cable barrier as follows (See Exhibit 1610-13): o The preferred location is to install the cable barrier at an 8-foot or greater offset from the ditch centerline. o Alternatively, the cable barrier can be installed at the centerline of the ditch out to a 1-foot offset either side of the ditch centerline. While permissible, this is not the preferred area to install cable barrier due to the potential of post scour, possible interference with drainage structures, and maintenance concerns. o Do not install cable barrier in the area between 1-foot to 8-foot offset from the ditch centerline to avoid “under-riding” of vehicles crossing the ditch. In some situations, it may be advantageous to terminate a run of cable barrier on one side of the median (to provide maintenance access to a feature, for example) and then begin an adjacent cable barrier run on the opposite side of the median. In this application, it is important to provide adequate cable barrier overlap distance between the two runs. For placement guidance, see Exhibit 1610-15. Narrow medians provide little space for maintenance crews to repair or reposition the barrier. Wherever site conditions permit, provide at least 14 feet of clearance from the adjacent lane edge to the face of the cable barrier.

Cable barrier may be installed at an 8-foot or greater offset from centerline (preferred placement), or it may be installed in the center of the ditch out to a 1-foot offset from the ditch centerline (left or right).
2
Avoid installing cable barrier in the area between 1-foot to 8-foot offset from the ditch centerline (left or right).

1610.05(1)(b) Roadside Applications For typical non-median roadside applications, the following apply:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Install the cable barrier as far from the edge of traveled way as site constraints allow. Consider a minimum placement distance of 8 feet from the edge of traveled way to allow vehicles to use this area for refuge. Install cable barrier on slopes 6H:1V or flatter. There are approved high-tension cable barrier systems that can be placed on slopes as steep as 4H:1V. The use of these systems requires special placement considerations, contact the HQ Design Office for guidance. Along horizontal curves, consider installing along the inside of the curve. Reduce post spacing per manufacturer’s recommendations. Provide an obstruction free zone within the cable barrier system’s lateral deflection distance, see Section 1610.05(2).
Exhibit 1610-14 Roadside Cable Barrier Placement
Notes: 1
Provide an obstruction free zone within the cable barrier’s lateral deflection distance, see Section 1610.05(2).
1610.05(2) High-Tension Cable Barrier Lateral Deflection Distances Depending on the high-tension cable barrier system, lateral deflection distances for each barrier system vary based upon the length of the barrier run, the spacing of the end anchors, and post spacing. Provide an obstruction free zone within the system’s lateral deflection distance for the following situations: 1. In the direction of travel (located in the median or along roadside), locate the cable barrier system so that there are no fixed objects within the limits of the cable barrier lateral deflection distance. 2. For opposing traffic (where present), locate the cable barrier to provide lateral deflection distance to prevent a vehicle’s encroachment into the opposite lane of travel. 3. Low–tension cable barrier systems require 12 feet of lateral deflection. Use high-tension cable barrier systems in new cable barrier installations. 4. High-tension barrier systems have lateral deflection distances between 6 to 10 feet. Specify the maximum allowable lateral deflection distance in the contract documents in order for the contractor to select a cable barrier manufacturer that meets the lateral deflection requirements.

Chapter 1610
Traffic Barriers
Note: There are new high-tension cable barrier systems under development that may change selection and placement criteria. For example, newer systems may allow placement on steeper slopes or have reduced deflection distances. Contact the HQ Design Office for guidance.
1610.05(3) High-Tension Cable Barrier Termination Manufacturers of high-tension four-cable barrier systems provide designed anchors for the ends of cable barrier runs. Whenever practicable, locate high-tension cable barrier terminals in areas where they are least likely to be hit by errant vehicles (e.g., located outside clear zone, located behind another barrier system). Often, high-tension cable barrier systems will overlap/interface with a stiffer barrier system (typically beam guardrail but can be concrete barrier). When terminating a cable barrier run to begin a beam guardrail run, there are essentially four choices for the overlap/interface of the two barrier systems (contact HQ Design when terminating a cable barrier run to begin a concrete barrier run). The four choices are: Connect Cable Barrier to Beam Guardrail: This placement connects the cable barrier directly onto the beam guardrail runs (such as cable barrier connected to beam guardrail transitions coming off bridge rails) or to a different cable barrier anchorage system. When connecting cable barrier onto beam guardrail, the guardrail must continue at least 75 feet downstream from the point where the cable barrier attaches to the beam guardrail, or the beam guardrail needs to be connected to a stiffer system (i.e., bridge rail, concrete barrier) to reduce the chance of beam guardrail posts pulling out of the ground from the tension in the cable barrier system. When terminating cable barrier in this manner; review field conditions, check local maintenance personnel needs, and specify the required connection option in the contract documents. When cable barrier is connected directly to a more rigid barrier, a transition section is typically needed. Contact the HQ Design Office for further details. Install Cable Barrier Behind Beam Guardrail: This placement terminates the cable barrier behind the beam guardrail system. Ensure the lateral distance between the two barrier systems exceeds the deflection distance of the beam guardrail system placed in front of the cable barrier system. This will reduce the chances of having the two barrier systems interfering with each other during a vehicle impact, or having an errant vehicle rebound off the cable barrier into the back of the beam guardrail during a vehicle impact. Exhibit 1610-16 shows an example of terminating cable barrier behind a beam guardrail system. Install Cable Barrier in Front of Beam Guardrail: This placement terminates the cable barrier in front of the beam guardrail system. Ensure that the standard run of cable barrier extends to, or past, the Length of Need post of the beam guardrail terminal and provide a minimum lateral distance of 4-feet between the two barrier systems. This will reduce the chances of having the two barrier systems interfere with each other during a vehicle impact. Exhibit 1610-16 shows an example of terminating cable barrier in front of a beam guardrail system.

Traffic Barriers
Terminate Cable Barrier in Advance of Beam Guardrail: This placement terminates the cable barrier in advance of the beam guardrail system. This placement leaves a gap in guardrail coverage and can be a maintenance concern if both terminals are hit by an errant vehicle. However, this placement can be used when side slope grades become an issue (i.e., slope is too steep to place cable barrier or beam guardrail, slope widening requires large amounts of fill to accommodate barrier systems). Exhibit 1610-16 shows an example of terminating cable barrier in advance of a beam guardrail system. Exhibit 1610-15 Cable Barrier Placement: Overlap on Divided Highways

1610.05(4) High-Tension Cable Barrier Curb Placement Avoid the placement of curb in conjunction with high-tension cable barrier systems. Currently, there are no known acceptable cable barrier systems that have been successfully crash tested with this feature present.
1610.06 Concrete Barrier Concrete barriers are identified as either rigid, rigid anchored, or unrestrained rigid systems. They are commonly used in medians and as shoulder barriers. These systems are stiffer than beam guardrail or cable barrier and impacts with these barriers tend to be more severe. Consider the following when installing concrete barriers:
•
•
•
•
For slopes 10H:1V or flatter, concrete barrier can be used anywhere outside of the shoulder. Do not use concrete barrier at locations where the foreslope into the face of the barrier is steeper than 10H:1V. Light standards mounted on top of precast concrete median barrier must not have breakaway features. (See the concrete barrier light standard section in the Standard Plans.) When considering concrete barrier use in areas where drainage and environmental issues (such as stormwater, wildlife, or endangered species) might be adversely impacted, contact the HQ Hydraulics Office and/or the appropriate environmental offices for guidance. Also, refer to Section 1610.02.
1610.06(1) Concrete Barrier Shapes Concrete barriers use a single-slope or safety shape (New Jersey or F-Shape) to redirect vehicles while minimizing vehicle vaulting, rolling, and snagging. A comparison of these barrier shapes is shown in Exhibit 1610-17. The single-slope barrier face is the recommended option for embedded rigid concrete barrier applications. Exhibit 1610-17 Concrete Barrier Shapes
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1610-35
Chapter 1610
Traffic Barriers
The New Jersey shape and F-shape barriers are commonly referred to as “safety shapes.” The New Jersey shape and F-shape have an initial overall height of 32 inches. As part of the implementation of MASH-compliant hardware, WSDOT has transitioned from using New Jersey shape barrier (Type 2 barrier) for precast concrete barrier to using F-shape concrete barrier (Type F barrier) instead. F-Shape (Type F) barrier is used in permanent or temporary installations. New Jersey shape (Type 2) barrier is only allowed to be used in temporary installations. Existing runs of Type 2 barrier permanently installed are allowed to remain in place (see Section 1610.03(2) for more information). Use Type F when replacing existing concrete barrier. If an existing run of Type 2 barrier requires extending, use Standard Plan C-60.30 Concrete Barrier Transition Type F to (32”) Type 2 (Precast), and complete the barrier extension using Type F barrier. When removing and resetting Type 2 barrier, contact HQ Design for more details.
1610.06(1)(a) Safety Shape Barrier Concrete Barrier Type F (see the Standard Plans) is a freestanding precast barrier that has the F-shape on both sides. The F-Shape barrier is used in permanent or temporary installations. It can be used for both median and shoulder installations. Unanchored units are connected with steel pins through metal loops. For permanent unanchored Type F barrier installations, this barrier is placed on a 10:1 or flatter paved surface with 3-feet minimum of 10:1 or flatter paved surface provided beyond the back of the barrier for deflection. For temporary unanchored Type F barrier installations, this barrier is placed on a 10:1 or flatter paved or compacted unpaved surface with a minimum of 3-feet of the 10:1 or flatter respective surface provided beyond the barrier for deflection. Do not anchor Type F barrier on a compacted unpaved surface. See Exhibit 1610-3 for deflection requirements. Concrete Barrier Type 2 (see the Standard Plans) is a freestanding precast barrier that has the New Jersey shape on both sides. The Type 2 barrier is only used in temporary installations. It can be used for both median and shoulder installations. Unanchored units are connected with steel pins through wire rope loops. For temporary unanchored Type 2 barrier installations, this barrier can be placed on a 10:1 or flatter paved surface or compacted unpaved surface with a minimum of 3-feet of the 10:1 or flatter respective surface provided beyond the barrier for deflection. Do not anchor Type 2 barrier on a compacted unpaved surface. See Exhibit 1610-3 for deflection requirements. The cost of precast safety shape barrier is significantly less than the cost of the cast-in-place barriers. Therefore, consider the length of the barrier run and the deflection needs to determine whether transitioning to precast barrier is desirable. If precast safety shape barrier is used for the majority of a project, use the single slope barrier for small sections that need cast-in-place barrier (such as for a light standard section). See standard plans for precast concrete barrier transitions between different shapes of concrete barrier. Type F narrow base is a precast, single-faced F-Shape barrier. These units are not freestanding and are to be placed against a rigid structure (or anchored to the pavement in temporary installations). If Type F narrow base barriers are used back-to-back, fill any gap between them to prevent tipping. Type F barrier can be anchored where a more rigid barrier is needed. The barrier can be anchored in permanent or temporary installations on asphalt pavement, concrete pavement, or bridge decks (Anchoring methods and the required distances of 10:1 or flatter pavement beyond the back of barrier are shown in the Standard Plans). Consult with the WSDOT BSO when anchoring permanent precast concrete barrier to a rigid (Portland cement concrete) pavement or bridge deck.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1610-36
Chapter 1610
Traffic Barriers
Type 2 barrier can be anchored where a more rigid barrier is needed. The barrier can be anchored in temporary installations using Type 1 and Type 2 anchors for rigid concrete pavement, and Type 3 anchors for asphalt pavement (Anchoring methods and the required distances of 10:1 or flatter pavement beyond the back of barrier are shown in the Standard Plans). Consult with the WSDOT BSO when anchoring precast concrete barrier to a bridge deck. Precast barrier used on the approach to bridge rail is to be connected to the bridge rail by installing loops or a loop bar embedded into the bridge rail with epoxy resin and as detailed in the Standard Plans. Place unrestrained (unanchored) precast concrete barrier on slopes of 5% (20H:1V) or flatter where possible. The maximum slope for placement of concrete barrier is 10% (10H:1V).
1610.06(1)(b) Single-Slope Barrier Single-slope barrier is available in various heights as shown in the Standard Plans. Single-slope concrete barrier can be cast-in-place or precast. Single-slope barrier is considered a rigid system regardless of the construction method used provided that:
•
•
•
•
precast barrier is embedded a minimum of 3-inches in the roadway wearing surface (asphalt or concrete) on both sides; precast barrier is embedded a minimum of 10-inches in compacted base material (e.g., CSBC, select borrow, gravel borrow, native soil, etc.) on both sides; precast barrier is embedded a minimum of 10-inches when embedded in roadway wearing surface (asphalt or concrete) on one side and compacted base material (e.g., CSBC, select borrow, gravel borrow, native soil, etc.) on the other side; and, cast-in-place barrier is embedded a minimum of 3-inches in the roadway wearing surface (asphalt or concrete) or compacted base material (e.g., CSBC, select borrow, gravel borrow, native soil, etc.) on both sides.
For new installations in asphalt, concrete, or compacted base material; the minimum height of the single-slope barrier above the roadway is 2 feet 10 inches which allows a 2-inch tolerance for future overlays. The minimum total height of the barrier section is 3-feet-6 inches (including embedment). The single-slope barrier can be installed with grade separation between roadways as follows:
•
•
•
For cast-in-place barrier with a minimum 3-inch embedment, or pre-cast barrier installed in asphalt or concrete with a minimum 3-inch embedment; a grade separation of up to 4-inches is allowed when using a 3-foot-6-inch tall barrier section, a grade separation of up to 7-inches is allowed when using a 4foot tall barrier section, and a grade separation of up to 10-inches is allowed when using a 4-foot-6-inch tall barrier section as shown in the Standard Plans. For pre-cast barrier installed in compacted base material with a minimum 10-inch embedment; a grade separation of up to 4-inches is allowed when using a 4-foot-tall barrier section, and a grade separation of up to 10-inches is allowed when using a 4-foot-6 inch tall barrier section as shown in the Standard Plans. The barrier is to have a depth of embedment equal to or greater than the grade separation as shown in the Standard Plans. Contact the WSDOT BSO for grade separations greater than 10-inches.

Traffic Barriers
1610.06(1)(c) High-Performance Concrete Barrier High-Performance Concrete Barrier (HP Barrier) is a rigid barrier with a minimum height of 3-foot-6-inch above the roadway surface. This barrier is designed to function more effectively during heavy-vehicle crashes. This taller barrier may also offer the added benefits of reducing headlight glare and reducing noise in surrounding environments. WSDOT HP Barrier utilizes the single-slope shape. (See the Standard Plans for barrier details.) Use HP Barrier in freeway medians of 22 feet or less. Also, use HP Barrier on Interstate or freeway routes where crash history suggests a need or where roadway geometrics increase the possibility of larger trucks hitting the barrier at a high angle (for example, on-ramps for freeway-to-freeway connections with sharp curvature in the alignment). Consider the use of HP Barrier at other locations such as highways with narrow medians, near highly sensitive environmental areas, near densely populated areas, over or near mass transit facilities, or on vertically divided highways.
1610.06(1)(d) Low-Profile Barrier Low-profile barrier designs are available for median applications where the posted speed is 45 mph or below. These barriers are normally used in urban areas. They are typically 18 to 20 inches high and offer sight distance benefits. For barrier designs, terminals, and further details, contact the HQ Design Office.
1610.06(1)(e) Concrete Barrier Transitions At times, runs of concrete barrier will require a shape and/or stiffness transition to another type of concrete barrier/bridge rail. The following list provides a brief description of the most common types of concrete barrier transitions: Bridge Transitions: When single-slope or F-Shape faced bridge barrier is used on bridges or structures and precast barrier is selected for use on the approaches to the bridge or structure; a transition section is needed to provide gradual stiffening from the less rigid precast barrier system to the more rigid bridge rail/bridge barrier system. In addition, a transition is needed to ensure that no vertical edges of barrier are exposed to oncoming traffic due to the difference in shapes and height between the two different barrier systems. Note: See Standard Plans for concrete barrier bridge transitions. See the Bridge Design Manual for details on bridge rails/bridge barrier. Roadside and Median Shape Transitions: Use a transition section when it is necessary to change the shape of the barrier within a single run (i.e., Type F to Single Slope, Type 2 to Type F) of barrier. Transition designs will differ when used on roadside/wide median applications (barrier subject to vehicle impacts on one side only), or narrow median applications (barrier subject to vehicle impacts on both sides). Note: See Standard Plans for concrete barrier transitions between different shapes of concrete barrier. Stiffness Transitions: Use an anchoring transition section when changing the stiffness of the barrier system within a single run of barrier but not the barrier shape (i.e., Type F anchored to Type F unanchored). This type of transition requires a change in anchoring pin configuration when moving from an unanchored barrier system to an anchored barrier system. There is no other change to the barrier other than the anchoring pin configuration. Note: See Standard Plans for barrier stiffness transitions. For aesthetic reasons, avoid changes in the shape of the barrier face within a project or corridor whenever possible.

Traffic Barriers
1610.06(2) Concrete Barrier Height Pavement overlays are allowed to be placed in front of concrete barriers per the following allowable minimum height guidance for each type of barrier:
•
•
•
Allow no less than 32-inches from the new pavement surface to the top of standard height (not high performance) single-slope barrier. Allow no less than 36-inches from the new pavement surface to the top of high performance singleslope barrier. Overlays are not allowed in front of safety shape barriers. Safety shape barriers must be adjusted to maintain their 32-inch height, or they must be replaced when an overlay is being placed in locations with these types of barrier.
Note: When placing overlays in front of single slope concrete barriers, ensure that the overlay does not cause the barrier grade separation height to exceed the depth of barrier embedment (see Section 1610.06(1)(b) and Standard Plan C-70.10 or C-80.10 for more information).
1610.06(3) Concrete Barrier Terminals Whenever possible, bury the blunt end of a concrete barrier run into the backslope of the roadway. If the end of a concrete barrier run cannot be buried in a backslope or terminated as described below, terminate the barrier using a guardrail terminal and transition or an impact attenuator (see Chapter 1620). To bury the blunt end of the barrier into a backslope, the following conditions must be met:
•
•
•
•
The backslope is 3H:1V or steeper The backslope extends minimum of 4 feet in height above the edge of shoulder Flare the concrete barrier into the backslope using a flare rate that meets the criteria in Section 1610.03(7) Provide a 10H:1V or flatter foreslope into the face of the barrier and maintain the full barrier height until the barrier intersects with the backslope. This might create the need to fill ditches and install culverts in front of the barrier face.
The 7-foot-long Type F barrier terminal (precast) and the 10- to 12-foot single-slope barrier terminal (precast or cast-in-place) may be used in the following conditions:
•
•
•
•
Outside the Design Clear Zone. On the trailing end of the barrier when it is outside the Design Clear Zone for opposing traffic. On the trailing end of one-way traffic. Where the posted speed is 25 mph or below.
See the Standard Plans for barrier terminal details.
1610.06(4) Concrete Barrier Placement in Front of Bridge Piers Existing barrier in front of bridge piers may remain in place in preservation (P1, P2, P3) projects. For all other projects, contact the HQ Bridge traffic barrier specialist when an existing or proposed bridge pier is in the Design Clear Zone, regardless of whether a barrier currently exists.

Traffic Barriers
1610.07 Bridge Traffic Barriers Bridge traffic barriers redirect errant vehicles and help to keep them from going over the side of the structure. See the Bridge Design Manual for information regarding bridge barrier on new bridges and replacement bridge barrier on existing bridges. When considering work on a bridge traffic barrier consult the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office (BSO). The standard bridge traffic barrier is a 3 foot 6 inch single slope or F Shape traffic barrier. For corridor continuity, a 2 foot 10 inch single slope or 2 foot 8 inch F Shape traffic barrier may be used with a pedestrian railing attached to the top for a total height of 3 foot 6 inch height inches. This also meets requirements for worker fall protection. Approach barriers, transitions, and connections are usually needed on all four corners of bridges carrying twoway traffic and on both corners of the approach end for one-way traffic. See Section 1610.04(6) for guidance on beam guardrail transitions. See standard plans for concrete barrier bridge transitions. Bridge railing attaches to the top of the bridge barrier. When bridge barrier is included in a project, the bridge rails, including crossroad bridge rail, are to be addressed. Consult the WSDOT BSO regarding bridge rail selection and for design of the connection to an existing bridge.
Consider the following:
•
•
•
•
Use an approved, NCHRP 350 or MASH crash-tested bridge traffic barrier on new bridges or bridges to be widened. The Bridge Design Manual provides examples of typical bridge rails. The BSO’s minimum crash test level for all state and interstate bridges is a TL-4. An existing bridge rail on a roadway with a posted speed of 30 mph or below may remain in place if it is not located on a bridge over a National Highway System (NHS) highway. When Type 7 bridge rail is present on a bridge over an NHS highway with a posted speed of 30 mph or below, it may remain in place regardless of the type of metal rail installed. Other bridge rails are to be evaluated for strength and geometrics. (See Section 1610.07(1) for guidance on retrofit techniques.) The Type 7 bridge rail is common. Type 7 bridge rails have a curb, a vertical-face parapet, and an aluminum top rail. The curb width and the type of aluminum top rail are factors in determining the adequacy of the Type 7 bridge rail, as shown in Exhibit 1610-18. Consult the WSDOT BSO for assistance in evaluating other bridge rails. When considering an overlay on a bridge, consult the WSDOT BSO to verify the overlay depth can be placed on the bridge deck based on the type of traffic barrier. There may be instances where the height of the bridge barrier will not allow for the planned overlay depth without removal of existing pavement.

1610.07(1) Bridge Barrier Retrofit If the bridge barrier system does not meet the criteria for strength and geometrics, modifications to improve its redirectional characteristics and its strength may be needed. Consult the WSDOT BSO to determine which retrofit method described below can be completed.
1610.07(1)(a) Concrete Safety Shape Consult the WSDOT BSO to determine whether the existing bridge deck and other superstructure elements are of sufficient strength to accommodate this bridge barrier system and provide design details for the retrofit. Retrofitting with a new concrete bridge barrier is costly and requires authorization from Program Management when no widening is proposed.
1610.07(1)(b) Thrie Beam Retrofit Retrofitting the bridge barrier with thrie beam is an economical way to improve the strength and redirectional performance of a bridge barrier. The thrie beam can be mounted to steel posts or the existing bridge barrier, depending on the structural adequacy of the bridge deck, the existing bridge barrier type, the width of curb (if any), and the curb-to-curb roadway width carried across the structure. Exhibit 1610-19 shows typical retrofit criteria. Note that Bridges designated as historical landmarks may not be candidates for thrie beam retrofitting. Contact the Environmental Services Office regarding bridge historical landmark status.

1610.08 Other Barriers 1610.08(1) Redirectional Landform Redirectional landforms, also referred to as earth berms, were formerly installed to help mitigate crashes with fixed objects located in depressed medians and at roadsides. They were constructed of materials that provided support for a traversing vehicle. With slopes in the range of 2H:1V to 3H:1V, they were intended to redirect errant vehicles. The use of redirectional landforms has been discontinued. Where redirectional landforms currently exist as mitigation for a fixed object, provide alternative means of mitigating the fixed object, such as removing, relocating, changing the fixed object to a crash-tested breakaway system, or shielding with barrier.
1610.08(2) Aesthetic Barrier Treatment An aesthetic barrier may be desired on a project, or it may be required by a memorandum of understanding, a Scenic Byway designation, an easement or corridor management plan, or as a result of stakeholder engagement. Contact the region or HQ Landscape Architect Office to confirm this requirement, and to verify any specific conditions with respect to the barrier’s appearance in the applicable plan or corridor document. Reactive coloring agents and powder coating are approved treatment options for w-beam guardrail and may be applicable to other barrier types. Check with the manufacturer and/or the product documentation when specifying aesthetic treatment for proprietary devices, such as guardrail terminals. One alternative to the use of aesthetic treatments are barriers designed to be aesthetic, such as steel-backed timber guardrail and stone guard walls. These alternative barriers will likely necessitate a partnering effort because of their higher costs, although grants may be available for this purpose if the need is identified early in the project definition phase.
1610.08(3) Steel-Backed Timber Guardrail Steel-backed timber guardrails consist of a timber rail with a steel plate attached to the back to increase its tensile strength. There are several variations of this system that have passed crash tests. The nonproprietary systems use a beam with a rectangular cross section that is supported by either wood or steel posts. A proprietary (patented) system, called the Ironwood Guardrail, is also available. This system uses a beam with a round cross section and is supported by steel posts with a wood covering to give the appearance of an all-wood system from the roadway. The incorporation of the Ironwood Guardrail will need to be documented. Consult with the Assistant State Design Engineer to determine what justification (proprietary or a public interest finding) will be required. The most desirable method of terminating the steel-backed timber guardrail is to bury the end in a backslope, as described in Section 1610.04(5). When this type of terminal is not possible, use of the barrier is limited to highways with a posted speed of 45 mph or below. On these lower-speed highways, the barriers can be flared away from the traveled way as described in Section 1610.03(7) and terminated in a berm outside the Design Clear Zone. For details on these systems, contact the HQ Design Office.

Traffic Barriers
1610.08(4) Stone Guardwalls Stone guardwalls function like rigid concrete barriers but have the appearance of natural stone. These walls can be constructed of stone masonry over a reinforced concrete core wall or of simulated stone concrete. These types of barriers are designed to have a limited textured projection of the stones to help aid in the redirectional characteristics of the barrier. The most desirable method of terminating this barrier is to bury the end in a backslope, as described in Section 1610.06(3). When this type of terminal is not possible, use of the barrier is limited to highways with a posted speed of 45 mph or below. On these lower-speed highways, the barrier can be flared away from the traveled way and terminated in a berm outside the Design Clear Zone. For details on these systems, contact the HQ Design Office.
1610.08(5) Dragnet The Dragnet Vehicle Arresting Barrier consists of chain link or fiber net that is attached to energy absorbing units. When a vehicle hits the system, the Dragnet brings the vehicle to a controlled stop with limited damage. Possible uses for this device include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Reversible lane entrances and exits Railroad crossings Truck escape ramps (instead of arrester beds—see Chapter 1270) T-intersections Work zones Swing span bridges

Impact Attenuator Systems Exhibit 1620-1 Impact Attenuator Distance Beyond Length of Need
1620.01 General Impact attenuator systems are protective systems that help aid an errant vehicle from impacting an object by either gradually decelerating the vehicle to a stop when hit head-on or by redirecting it away from the feature when struck on the side. These systems are used for rigid objects or other features that cannot be removed, relocated, or made breakaway. Install impact attenuator systems that have been determined to be MASH compliant and accepted for use by WSDOT (see Section 1610.01 for more information on MASH product acceptance and implementation). In general, existing impact attenuators that are fully functional may remain in service and be repaired as needed; however, when roadside safety hardware is included in the project per Chapter 1105, replace any impact attenuators falling under the existing roadside safety hardware replacement criteria shown in Section 1610.03(2).
1620.02 Design Criteria The following design criteria apply to new, existing, or reset permanent and temporary impact attenuators. Impact attenuators are placed so that they do not present a feature that requires mitigating in relation to opposing traffic. For median and reversible lane locations, the backup structure or attenuator-to-object connection is designed to help in aiding opposing traffic from being snagged. Avoid placement of curbs between attenuators and traffic. Refer to the specific attenuator manufacturer’s instructions if considering placement of curbing between an attenuator and the travelled way. It is desirable that existing curbing be removed, and the surface smoothed with asphalt or cement concrete pavement before an impact attenuator is installed. However, mountable curbs 4 inches or less in height may be retained depending on the feasibility of removal and as long as the manufacturer’s installation requirements are met. In general, attenuators are aligned parallel to the roadway. Consult with the Area Maintenance Superintendent who will be maintaining the system prior to selecting the attenuator systems to include in a construction contract.
1620.03 Selection Considerations WSDOT classifies impact attenuators as permanent (for final installations that will remain in place) or temporary (for systems that will be in place during work zone traffic control operations and then removed). Some impact attenuator systems can be used in both a temporary capacity and then in a final/permanent installation. For approved systems to choose from, see the WSDOT Impact Attenuator Design page at www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/design/ProductFolder/PENDING_Impact_Attenuator_Design.docx Consider that each application is unique when selecting impact attenuators for use in particular applications. This applies to both permanent and temporary installations.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Impact Attenuator Systems
To select an appropriate impact attenuator system, the following factors must be assessed:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Posted speed Operating speed Average daily traffic (ADT) Repair crew exposure Proximity to the roadway Anticipated number of yearly impacts Available space (length and width) Lifecycle Maintenance costs Initial cost Duration (permanent or temporary use) Portion of the impact attenuator that is redirective/gating (see Exhibit 1620-1) Width of object to be shielded
Entries on the WSDOT Impact Attenuator Design page indicate whether the system is National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 350 or MASH-compliant. If it’s determined that a MASH-compliant system is not available for the specific configuration required, document the selection of an NCHRP 350 system as described in Section 1620.03(2). When selecting the appropriate impact attenuator system, consider the portion that is designed to redirect vehicles during a side impact of the unit, such that fixed objects, either permanent or temporary (such as construction equipment), are not located behind the gating portion of these devices (see Exhibit 1620-1). Exhibit 1620-1 Impact Attenuator Distance Beyond Length of Need

Chapter 1620
Impact Attenuator Systems
Select the system and configuration appropriate for the posted speed. In the interest of a cost-effective design, selecting a system applicable for the posted speed is recommended (although using a system tested for a higher speed is acceptable). Note that attenuators used on highways with posted speeds of 70 mph have additional considerations discussed below. Where there is evidence that the average operating speed of the facility is higher than the posted speed, consider selecting an attenuator system rated at the facility’s operating speed. Manufacturer’s product information may indicate that a different system is required for speeds of 70 mph or greater. These models are generally referred to as “high speed” or “70 mph” systems. Use of these systems on facilities with 70 mph posted speeds is not required, and selection of a system rated for at least 60 mph will typically be appropriate for most sites on these facilities. For permanent installations where unusual conditions warrant consideration of a high-speed device, these systems are available and may be used with justification. Contact the HQ Design Office for guidance when considering one of these systems. For information regarding spatial requirements and initial cost information related to impact attenuator systems, see the Attenuator Selection Template. When considering maintenance costs, anticipate the average annual impact rate. If few impacts are anticipated, lower-cost devices might meet the need. (See Chapter 301 for examples of how to determine lifecycle costs for proposed hardware). Attenuators with the lowest initial cost and initial site preparation will have high maintenance costs after each impact. Labor and equipment are needed to clean up the debris and install a new attenuator, as the lowest cost attenuators are typically destroyed after a single impact. Attenuators with higher initial installation cost typically have lower maintenance costs. In selecting a system, one consideration is the anticipated exposure to traffic that the workers making the repairs may encounter. In areas with high traffic exposure, a low-maintenance system that can be repaired quickly is most desirable. Some systems need nearly total replacement or replacement of critical components (such as cartridges or braking mechanisms) after a head-on impact, while others simply need to be reset. When a transition to connect with a concrete barrier, fixed object, or beam guardrail is needed, the transition type and connection may need to be specified (see the impact attenuator descriptions accessible through the Attenuator Selection Template). In most cases, the transition type and connection required will be a custom design per the manufacturer (these transitions are included in the cost of the impact attenuator). In a few cases, the transition type and connection to use will be as described in Chapter 1610 and the Standard Plans (these transition sections are not included in the cost of the impact attenuator and must be included as a separate bid item in the construction contract). Consult with the Area Maintenance Superintendent who will be maintaining the systems before finalizing the list of attenuators to be included in the contract.
1620.03(1) Low-Maintenance Category Low maintenance devices have a higher initial cost, requiring substantial site preparation, including a backup or anchor wall in some cases, and cable anchorage at the front of the installation. However, repair costs are very low, with labor typically being the main expense. Maintenance might not be needed after minor side impacts with these systems. Installation of a low-maintenance device is desirable at locations that meet at least one of the following criteria:
•
•
•
Sites with an ADT of 25,000 or greater Sites with a history/anticipation of more than one impact per year Sites with unusually challenging conditions, such as limitations on repair time, a likelihood of frequent night repairs, or narrow gore locations
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1620-3
Chapter 1620
Impact Attenuator Systems
Document the decision in the DDP to use any device other than a low-maintenance device at locations meeting at least one of the criteria above. The HQ Design Office conducts a periodic review of maintenance records to consider which devices should be included in the Low-Maintenance category. For a description of requirements that need to be met in order to be included in the Low-Maintenance category, see: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/design/roadsidesafety/low_maint.pdf
1620.03(2) Documenting Attenuator Selection As the factors discussed previously are analyzed, identify inappropriate systems and eliminate them from further consideration. List the systems that are not eliminated in the contract. When the site conditions vary, it might be necessary to have more than one list of acceptable systems within a contract. Acceptable systems cannot be eliminated without documented justification as to why they should not be used. Also, wording such as “or equivalent” is not to be used when specifying these systems. If it’s determined that a MASH-compliant attenuator system is not available for a specific configuration and that an NCHRP 350-compliant attenuator system must be used, then document the design decision using a Design Analysis unless otherwise directed by the ASDE. Document attenuator selection using the Attenuator Selection Template.
1620.04 Transportable Attenuators (Truck-Mounted and Trailer-Mounted) Truck Mounted Attenuators and Trailer-Mounted Attenuators are portable systems mounted on trucks or trailers. They are intended for use in work zones and for temporary applications.
1620.05 Older Systems Many older systems are in use on Washington State highways and may be left in place or reset with concurrence of the WSDOT Area Maintenance Superintendent who maintains the system. New installations of these systems are not allowed. For a list of older systems see: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/design/ProductFolder/PENDING_Impact_Attenuator_Design.docx.
1620.06 Inertial Barrier Systems (Sand Barrels) Inertial barrel systems (sand barrels) commonly provide advantages in temporary installations where the locations change and there is sufficient space available or in permanent locations where there is a lower risk of collisions and where the debris, from the initial barrier when hit, will have a minimal impact to traffic. Refer to the manufacturer for system dimensions and specifications.

1710.01 General The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has developed a statewide system of traveler stopping opportunities along Interstate highways and state routes. This system includes safety rest areas (see Exhibit 1710-1), roadside parks, and viewpoints. These services provide universal access for rest, traveler information, and restroom facilities. Benefits include improved safety by reducing driver fatigue and the number of vehicles parked on the shoulders of state routes, refuge from adverse driving conditions, and increased tourism promotion. Safety rest areas are planned and designed by a multidisciplinary team lead through the Facilities Administrator in the Capital Facilities Office, a branch of Maintenance Operations. (See Section 1710.04 for an expanded discussion on team roles and membership.) Exhibit 1710-1 WSDOT Safety Rest Area

1710.03 Definitions Ancillary Services: Those secondary services, also considered amenities, provided at safety rest areas that include, but are not limited to, vending machines, picnic areas, interpretive signing, telephones, recreational vehicle (RV) sanitary disposal facilities, trails, scenic viewpoints, commercial and public information displays, and visitor information centers. Recreational Vehicle Account: In 1980 the RV account was established for use by the department of transportation for the construction, maintenance, and operation of recreational vehicle sanitary disposal systems at safety rest areas (RCW 46.68.170). A recreational vehicle sanitary disposal fee is required for registration of a recreational vehicle (RCW 46.17.375). Adjustments to the recreational vehicle fee by the department of transportation may be implemented after consultation with the citizens’ representatives of the recreational vehicle user community (RCW 47.01.460). Roadside Park: A roadside user facility for safe vehicular parking off the traveled way and separated from the highway by some form of buffer. These sites might be equipped with features or elements such as points of interest, picnic tables, and/or vault toilet buildings. Unlike a safety rest area, a roadside park does not always provide a permanent restroom building. Safety Rest Area (SRA): A roadside facility equipped with permanent restroom building(s), a parking area, picnic tables, refuse receptacles, illumination, and other ancillary services. SRAs typically include potable water and might include traveler information and telephones. Safety Rest Area Strategic Plan: Developed in 2008 under a stakeholder-coordinated effort of executive and advisory team members, this plan provides guidance for current and future management of the SRA program. Traveler Information: Commercial and noncommercial information that informs and orients the traveling public. This includes access information for food, gas, lodging, local attractions, regional tourist attractions, roadway conditions, and construction schedules. Universal Access: Access for all persons regardless of ability or stature. Viewpoint: A roadside stopping opportunity with a view of some point of interest or area scenery. This area is not typically separated from the traveled way by some form of highway buffer. Visitor Information Center (VIC): A staffed or nonstaffed booth or separate building that displays and dispenses free tourist travel maps and brochures. These are typically located at border-entry SRAs to provide travel information to highway users as they enter the state.
1710.04 Safety Rest Area Project Team The Capital Facilities Office has primary responsibility for program oversight and communication and is the primary point of contact for questions concerning SRAs. Duties include planning and programming for capital WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Preservation and Improvement projects, maintenance operations oversight and policy development, and project delivery. Exhibit 1710-2 and Exhibit 1710-3 outline the many disciplines involved with SRA planning, design, construction, and maintenance. The exhibits outline roles during the different phases of SRA management. Services are provided by internal WSDOT staff, other government agencies, and private consultants.
1710.05 Location, Access, and Site Design 1710.05(1) Conformance with the Safety Rest Area Strategic Plan Regional planners, in coordination with the Capital Facilities Office, will use the Safety Rest Area Strategic Plan as a guide to determine which areas in the state are potential areas of need for a new facility. Verify current locations of SRAs, roadside parks, viewpoints, and undeveloped SRA properties that could be utilized for development of a new SRA. Coordinate all SRA planning and design efforts with the SRA Program located in the Capital Facilities Office.
1710.05(2) Highway Spacing Guidelines It is preferred to space SRAs and roadside parks approximately every 60 miles on the National Highway System and Scenic Byways. Consider the location of other available public facilities when deciding where to locate an SRA. Other public or private facilities may offer stopping opportunities that could mitigate the need for construction of a new SRA. Reference the SRA Strategic Plan for potential areas of need for new stopping opportunities.

Note: Recreational Vehicle Citizens Advisory Committee: The department utilizes a volunteer citizen-based group of recreational vehicle users to help define the RV needs at SRAs. This group provides guidance on the expenditure of funds from the RV account and fee adjustments. The fee adjustments must be preceded by an evaluation per RCW 47.01.460.
1710.05(3) Adjacent Land Use Consult local planning offices for information about zoning and expected development in the area of a proposed site to ensure compatibility with a new safety rest area or roadside park. Acquire a buffer area or scenic easement on adjacent lands, if possible, to protect scenic views and existing vegetation. Incorporate any cultural, historical, or scenic points of interest into the site design to enhance visitor experience and area education. For Interstate safety rest areas, vehicular ingress and egress will be from the main line only.
1710.05(4) Availability of Utilities Determine the proximity and availability of water, power, and sewer systems prior to site acquisition. Prepare required legal documents such as well agreements, easements, water rights, and acquisition documents. The Capital Facilities Office uses annual traffic data in the area to estimate the number of rest area users and determine the adequacy of potable water supply, power capacity, parking space needs, and sewage disposal system options. New construction should meet the 20-year projected growth rate based on potential traffic increases.

1710.05(5) Level of Development Roadside facilities have different levels of development and require varying site size and amenity levels. Exhibit 1710-4 shows recommended site sizing and amenities for SRAs, roadside parks, and viewpoints.
1710.05(6) Site Conditions SRAs need large parcels of land to provide adequate space for parking passenger vehicles and trucks, on-site sewage treatment, and on-site water systems if provided. Any selected site should consider the terrain to allow for safe ingress and egress from the highway. Other considerations are:
•
•
•
•
•
Grades and slopes to accommodate parking, sewage treatment, and the building site. High water level, particularly if the site is in a floodplain. Soil conditions and soil type for structural designs and the on-site sewage treatment system. Vegetation and natural features to understand potential mitigation costs from impacts to existing wetlands or stormwater drainage, etc. Prevailing wind direction and typical wind velocities that can affect building siting/design and visitor experience.
1710.05(7) Site Security Design the facility to maximize line of sight for rest area users. Design vegetation for visibility to avoid hiding places on-site. If electrical power is available on-site, provide lighting around all parking areas, buildings, and other site amenities that are made available to the public.
1710.05(8) Site Sustainability During site development, adhere to the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards where practicable. Strive for energy efficiency, water conservation, and low operational costs in building designs. Ensure landscaping features will be durable and easy to maintain. Contact the Capital Facilities Office for minimum requirements and standard details.
1710.05(9) Stormwater Management For stormwater management, particularly in areas covered by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, make an effort to minimize the use of storm drainage devices such as catch basins, oilwater separators, and retention vaults. Design the site to accommodate sheet flow off paved surfaces to vegetative areas for on-site infiltration and management of stormwater where practicable. (See the Highway Runoff Manual for stormwater design information.)
1710.05(10) Traffic Ingress and Egress Design connections to the main line highway in accordance with Design Manual chapters in Division 13. Consult with the HQ Access and Hearings Section for establishing new or modifying existing highway access points.

Safety Rest Areas
1710.05(11) ADAAG Compliance You must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) for all site components that are made available to the public. Provide at least one accessible route of travel, defined in ADAAG, from the parking area to each on-site amenity or ancillary service.
1710.05(12) Parking Area Design Consider the parking area layout when generating a site master plan. Include stages of construction if applicable. Provide separate parking areas for trucks/RVs/buses and passenger cars. For new designs, locate large-vehicle parking on the far side of the site away from the highway for improved highway visibility and site security purposes. Provide shade for vehicles where practicable. Exhibit 1710-5 shows an example of a truck parking area layout. AASHTO’s Guide for Development of Rest Areas on Major Arterials and Freeways provides parking area design considerations. Consider areas for snow storage needs. Refer to the Hydraulics Manual for drainage design. Preserve existing landscape features to the greatest extent possible. Design vehicular and pedestrian routes to be safe, simple, direct, and obvious. Meet local building codes and ADAAG requirements for public parking.
1710.05(13) Recreational Vehicle Sanitary Disposal Facilities Construct RV sanitary disposal facilities (dump stations) only at sites served by municipal sewage disposal systems, or at sites served by sewage lagoons with adequate capacity. On-site septic systems with drainfields are not an option for RV dump stations because of sewage volume, technical/maintenance requirements, and costs. Contact the Capital Facilities Office for details on RV dump station design and operation.
1710.05(14) Walkways Design walkways for direct pedestrian movement to all facilities and comply with ADAAG requirements. Provide sidewalk width a minimum of 48 inches, which exceeds ADAAG requirements.
1710.05(15) Vegetation Vegetation enhances the physical environment by providing shade, shelter from wind, visual screening, wildlife habitat, and other benefits. Landscape Architects engaged in the project employ designs that emphasize lowmaintenance practices and obstacle-free lawns, and minimize water usage for irrigation and impacts to existing native vegetation where practicable.
1710.05(16) Picnic Tables Provide one picnic table for every ten passenger car parking stalls, with a minimum of four tables per SRA where practicable. Provide shelters for 50% of the picnic tables on-site. Provide windscreens for picnic tables exposed to frequent high winds. Each SRA is required to provide a minimum of one picnic table that complies with ADAAG requirements. Place picnic tables near walkways but also provide privacy from restroom users.

1710.05(18) Pet Areas Provide ADAAG-compliant, well-lit areas for visitors to walk their pets away from kiosks, plaza areas, and moving vehicles. Provide trash receptacles and pet waste bags near pet areas.
1710.05(19) Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are provided at select sites. One ADAAG-compliant parking stall with an accessible route is required when EV charging stations are installed. Because EV charging is not the primary purpose of SRAs, locate the EV parking stalls at the ends of the passenger vehicle parking area.
1710.05(20) Bicycle Facilities Provide bicycle racks where this type of active transportation mode is accessible to an SRA. (See Chapter 1520 for more information about roadway bicycle facilities.)
1710.06 Buildings 1710.06(1) Codes Comply with current versions of the International Building Code, International Plumbing Code, National Electric Code, Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines, and all applicable state and local code requirements.
1710.06(2) Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines You must comply with accessibility guidelines specified in ADAAG for all building components that are available to the public. Design restrooms, ancillary service buildings, picnic benches, and information kiosks to ADAAG standards.
1710.06(3) Restroom Capacity Provide a male/female restroom stall ratio of 40:60, and one unisex restroom that can be opened to allow for daily cleaning operations where practicable. If the unisex restroom is the only ADAAG-compliant toilet stall onsite, it must remain open at all times. Contact the Capital Facilities Office for restroom standards and to verify the number of stalls that should be provided at each site.
1710.06(4) Building Security Design rest area buildings to provide a safe, comfortable experience for the traveling public. Avoid building designs with potential hiding places, and ensure adequate building lighting is provided around the perimeter.
1710.06(5) Building Sustainability Buildings and systems are to adhere to the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards where practicable. Design facilities for energy efficiency, water conservation, and low operational costs. Ensure materials are durable and easy to maintain. Contact the Capital Facilities Office for minimum requirements and standard details.

1710.06(7) Plaza Areas Provide paved/concrete plaza areas at all new SRAs, where practicable, to enhance safety, reduce wear and maintenance on heavy-travel areas, and provide unobstructed pedestrian movement. Consider pedestrian movement when designing exterior fixtures such as benches, kiosks, telephones, and vending machines in plaza areas. Avoid creating potential hiding places and ensure appropriate lines of sight for safety.
1710.06(8) Building Signage Ensure building signage meets current standards for rest area signage. Contact the Capital Facilities Office for details.
1710.06(9) Kiosks Install travel information kiosks at all Interstate rest areas and at non-Interstate rest areas as needed. A kiosk is usually equipped with backlit information displays.
1710.06(10) Volunteer Refreshment and Coffee Services Construct volunteer services buildings at all Interstate rest areas and at non-Interstate rest areas as needed. They can usually be incorporated with the travel information kiosks. Wire, plumb, and heat these buildings to meet building codes as an occupied space. Locate these buildings to give volunteers an unobstructed view of restroom entrances and parking areas if feasible. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

1710.06(11) Rehabilitation and Expansion Minor renovation projects to address specific building and system deficiencies such as roofs, interior fixtures and partitions, wall and floor surfaces, HVAC, electrical, water, and sewer will extend the usefulness of the building and minimize maintenance and operations costs. When major renovations are needed, consider restroom capacity increases to meet current standards based on expected user volumes. Other facility components that will eventually need rehabilitation are kiosks, irrigation systems, sidewalks, picnic tables, parking areas, and RV dump stations. All projects must meet current ADAAG building and site requirements. Consider efficiency improvements that can be made to reduce operational costs. Coordinate with the Capital Facilities Office for all renovation or expansion projects.
1710.07 Utilities Contact the region Utilities Office for acquisition of Utility Service Agreements for any utility needs. Coordinate with the Capital Facilities Office for long-term planning considerations. Telephones are provided at most SRAs and must meet ADAAG requirements. Because of the availability of cellular phones, and due to vandalism and other reasons, public telephone service may be cancelled after coordination between the Capital Facilities Office and region Maintenance.
1710.07(1) Power Capacity A new or upgraded electrical service provided on-site will meet the projected needs of the facility over the next 20 years where practicable. Provide three-phase service where available. Consider building capacity increases, site lighting improvements, electric vehicle charging stations, truck parking electrification, and other potential needs. Contact the Capital Facilities Office for site-specific details or master plans.
1710.07(2) Water & Sewer Systems Refer to the Hydraulics Manual for information on water and sewage disposal systems, including reservoirs, long-distance pressure sewers, septic tanks, drainfields, and sewage lagoons. Install separate water meters to quantify irrigation, building, RV dump stations, and source water where practicable. Consider maintenance needs for water and sewer system designs. Coordinate with the Capital Facilities Office for all issues related to water and sewer systems at SRAs.
1710.07(3) Stormwater Systems Stormwater management and treatment systems are to meet the guidelines and requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). Ensure runoff from impervious surfaces at SRAs is managed onsite using typical best management practices. Contact the Hydraulics Office for specific design recommendations, and the Maintenance Operations Office for specific site requirements noted in the statewide NPDES permit.
1710.07(4) Future Utilities Provide sleeves and conduits for future utilities in accordance with the site master plan for water, sewer, power, and telephone. Address site-specific agreements by coordinating with region Maintenance, utility companies, the Capital Facilities Office, and others during site design.

1720.01 General Truck weighing facilities are needed to protect state highways from overweight vehicles, to provide for vehicle safety inspection, and to provide a source of data for planning and research. The development, construction, and maintenance of these facilities is a cooperative effort between the WSDOT and the Washington State Patrol (WSP).
1720.02
Definitions
Note: For definitions of roadway, traveled way, lane, median, outer separation, shoulder, decision sight distance, sight distance, and stopping sight distance, see the Glossary of Terms. Commercial Vehicle Information Systems and Networks (CVISN) A network that links intelligent transportation systems (ITS) to share information on commercial vehicles. When in operation at a weigh site, it can enable commercial vehicles to clear the facility without stopping. Frontage road: An auxiliary road that is a local road or street located beside a highway for service to abutting property and adjacent areas and for control of access. Static scale: A scale that requires a vehicle to stop for weighing. Usable shoulder: The width of the shoulder that can be used by a vehicle for stopping. Weigh in motion (WIM): A scale facility capable of weighing a vehicle without the vehicle stopping.
1720.03
Planning, Development, and Responsibilities
The WSP works with WSDOT Strategic Planning and Programming to develop a prioritized list of weigh facility needs for each biennium. The list includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
New permanent facilities. New portable facilities. New shoulder sites. WIM equipment. Vehicle inspection facilities. Scale approach slab reconstruction.
The WSP provides the Program Management Office of Strategic Planning and Programming a Project Definition, which includes:
•
•
A statement of need, the purpose of the project, and the type of work. The general location of the project.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1720
Weigh Sites
Program Management sends this information to the region for preparation of a Project Summary. The region works with the WSP to identify the specific location of the facility. The region then prepares a design decision estimate and submits it to Program Management. The region negotiates and the Regional Administrator executes any formal agreements with the WSP required for the design, construction, or maintenance of vehicle weighing and inspection facilities. The Memorandum of Understanding Related to Vehicle Weighing and Equipment: Inspection Facilities on State Highways, Exhibit 1720-8, contains details about the various responsibilities of WSDOT and the WSP.
1720.04
Permanent Facilities
Permanent truck weighing facilities have permanent scales and may have buildings. When these facilities are in operation, trucks are required stop. However, when Weigh In Motion (WIM) and Commercial Vehicle Information Systems and Networks (CVISN) capabilities have been installed, the driver may be notified to continue without stopping. The notification to continue may be through the use of signs or transponders.
1720.04(1)
Site Locations
The exact location of a truck weighing facility is generally controlled by topography, highway alignment, and geometrics. It is also desirable to select a site where adequate right of way is already available. Select the most economical site to minimize site preparation, expense, and impact on the environment. Water, electricity availability, and sewage treatment and disposal are other considerations for site selection. Additionally, use the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
Locate the facility such that its operation will not hinder the operation of the highway or other related features such as intersections and interchanges. To the extent feasible, eliminate options for truck traffic to bypass the weigh site. Base the site selection on the type and volume of trucks using the route. Evaluate the operational and safety performance of proposed weigh sites on freeways. The operational and safety evaluation is submitted to HQ Design for concurrence and for FHWA concurrence when on the interstate.
1720.04(2)
Design Features
On multilane highways, provide off- and on-connections as shown in Chapter 1360. Exhibit 1710-1 is the minimal design of a weigh site on multilane highways. Design weigh facilities on two-lane highways to best fit the existing conditions, with particular consideration given to the matter of access to and from the site. Off- and on-connections, as shown in Chapter 1360, are preferred. However, with justification, on-connections may be designed as intersections (see Chapter 1310). Exhibit 1710-2 is a guide for the design of weigh sites on two-lane highways.

Weigh Sites
The following special design features apply to weigh sites:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Level cement concrete approach slabs are required at both ends of the scales. Hot mix asphalt (HMA) approach slabs will be allowed only when adequate soil conditions exist, projected truck volume is light, and benefit/cost analysis justifies the HMA based on the small percentage of time the scales will be in operation. The approach slabs must be level and in the same plane as the scale. Provide adequate parking and storage to ensure trucks do not impede the main line through traffic. The WSDOT Regional Administrator and the WSP agree on the area to be provided. On multilane divided highways, install illuminated electronically controlled “open” and “closed” message signs that can be operated from the scalehouse or the control cabinet. Provide permanent signing for the facility, as requested by the WSP. The need for a vehicle safety inspection facility at any site is identified by the WSP. Exhibit 1710-3 is a guide for a site plan for a single-bay vehicle inspection facility. Additional bays and site adaptation will be on a site-by-site basis. The WSDOT Regional Administrator and the WSP agree on the area to be provided. The need for some form of approach protective treatment for the scale house or a protective fence between the scale and roadway is identified by the WSP and agreed upon by the WSDOT Regional Administrator and the WSP. The need for the device is to protect the scale house from errant vehicles. (See Chapter 1600 for additional clear zone considerations.) The need for WIM or CVISN capabilities is identified by the WSP. Design the in-place facilities to provide the ability to notify drivers whether to continue on or to stop for further investigation before they reach the exit for the static scale. The design is agreed upon by the WSDOT Regional Administrator and the WSP. When WIM and CVISN are not included in the project, provide conduit for their future installation. With justification, at locations where space is limited, the depressed outer separation between the weigh facility and the through lanes may be replaced with concrete traffic barrier. (See the CollectorDistributor: Outer Separations exhibit in Chapter 1360.) Provide a clear view of the entire weigh site for the facility’s operator and the driver of an approaching vehicle. Hot mix asphalt is acceptable for use on the ramp and storage areas. Design the depth in accordance with the surfacing report. To optimize scale efficiency, make the storage area flat; however, to facilitate drainage, the slope may be up to 2%. Provide illumination when requested by the WSP. Illumination is required if the facility is to be operated during the hours of darkness and may be desirable at other locations to deter unauthorized use of the facility. (See Chapter 1040 for additional information on illumination.)
1720.05
Portable Facilities
Portable truck weighing facilities have no permanent scales or buildings. When these facilities are in operation, they operate in the same manner as permanent facilities.

Weigh Sites
1720.05(1)
Site Locations
Design portable truck weighing facilities located on two-lane and multilane roadways to best fit the existing conditions. Minor portable scale sites, as shown in Exhibit 1710-4, are used with two-way traffic and on multilane highways with low traffic volumes. Major portable scale sites (see Exhibit 1710-5) are for use on expressways, freeways, and where traffic volumes are high. Locate the weighing facility such that its operation will not hinder the operation of the highway or other related features such as intersections. An ARR is required for weigh sites on multilane divided highways with access control (see Chapter 550).
1720.05(2)
Design Features
The following special design features apply to portable facilities:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Off- and on-connections, as shown in Exhibit 1710-4 and Exhibit 1710-5, are preferred; however, with justification on highways with no access control, on-connections may be designed as intersections (see Chapter 1310). With justification, at locations where space is limited, the depressed outer separation between the weigh facility and the through lanes may be replaced with concrete traffic barrier. (See the CollectorDistributor: Outer Separation exhibit in Chapter 1360.) Provide adequate parking and storage to ensure trucks do not impede the main line through traffic. The WSDOT Regional Administrator and the WSP agree on the area to be provided. Hot mix asphalt is acceptable for use on the ramp and storage areas. Design the depth in accordance with the surfacing report. To optimize portable scale efficiency, make the storage area flat; however, to facilitate drainage, the slope may be up to 2%. Provide permanent signing for the facility, as requested by the WSP. Provide illumination when requested by the WSP. Illumination is required if the facility is to be operated during the hours of darkness and may be desirable at other locations to deter unauthorized use of the facility. (See Chapter 1040 for additional information on illumination.)
1720.06
Shoulder Sites
Shoulder sites are used by the WSP to pull a truck over for inspection and weighing with portable scales.
1720.06(1)
Site Locations
Design shoulder sites to best fit the existing conditions. Small shoulder sites (see Exhibit 1720-6) are for use on lower-volume roadways (ADT 5000 or less) with two-way traffic. Large shoulder sites (see Exhibit 1720-7) are to be used with higher-volume two-way roadways and multilane highways. Locate the weighing facility so that its operation will not hinder the operation of the highway or other related features such as intersections.
1720.06(2)
Design Features
Shoulder sites are designed in coordination with the WSP. Input from the local WSP Commercial Vehicle Enforcement personnel will ensure the proposed site will meet their needs without over-building the facility. Obtain written concurrence from the WSP for the length, width, and taper rates before the design is finalized.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1720-4
Chapter 1720
Weigh Sites
When the ADT is 1,500 or less, and with the written approval of the WSP, the tapers at small shoulder sites may be eliminated. The shoulders on either side of the site may be used as acceleration and deceleration lanes, whether or not they were designed for this use. Therefore, provide adequate strength to support truck traffic. Hot mix asphalt is acceptable for use on all shoulder sites. Design the depth in accordance with the surfacing report. Design the shoulder pavement at this depth for a length not less than the deceleration lane length before, and the acceleration lane length after, the site (see Chapter 1360). When the shoulders are designed to be used for deceleration and acceleration lanes, the minimum width is 12 feet with full pavement depth for the deceleration/ acceleration lane lengths (see Chapter 1360). Use a maximum 2% slope in order to optimize portable scale efficiency and facilitate drainage.
1720.07
Federal Participation
Federal funds appropriate to the system being improved may be used for the acquisition of right of way and the construction of truck weighing facilities and vehicle inspection facilities. This includes, but is not limited to, onand off-ramps, deceleration/acceleration lanes, passing lanes, driveways, parking areas, scale approach slabs, vehicle inspection facilities, roadway illumination, and signing.
1720.08
Procedures
Prepare site plans for all truck weighing facilities that include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Class of highway and design speed for main line (see Chapter 1103). Curve data on main line and weigh site. Number of lanes and width of lanes and shoulders on main line and weigh site. Superelevation diagrams for the main line and weigh site. Stationing of ramp connections and channelization. Illumination. Signing. Water supply and sewage treatment. Roadside development.
Get WSP approval of the site plans before the final plan approval.

1730.01 General This chapter provides general siting and design information for transit facilities. It is intended for Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) engineering and planning staff, local transit providers, developers, and local agencies engaged in the collaborative development of transit facilities on or adjacent to state highways. The main points covered in this chapter are:
•
•
•
•
•
Bus Stop Policy: WSDOT’s policy for developing bus stops on state highways is presented. The policy calls for WSDOT and the transit provider to work together to locate stops on state highways. Bus stop placement considerations are also provided. Park and Ride Lots: Basic guidelines for development of park and ride lots are presented. Transit/Transfer Centers: Guidance on these centers is provided. Guidance in the Park and Ride section may apply as well. Universal Access: The requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) apply to bus stops and shelters, park and ride lots, and transit centers. This information is presented in various sections of the chapter, with additional references provided. Tools and Resources: Additional guidance and criteria are recommended and referenced, such as: other chapters in the Design Manual for designing intersections and road approaches; the Roadside Manual for parking lot design; the local transit authority’s own standards; and AASHTO.
The design and planning information that follows supports the development of public transit infrastructure and services on state highways. Design Manual topics and chapters commonly used in conjunction with this chapter include:
•
•
•
•
Right of way and access control: Chapter 510 through Chapter 560. Intersections and road approaches: Chapter 1300 through Chapter 1370. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and sidewalk design: Chapter 1510. High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities: Chapter 1410 and Chapter 1420.
1730.02 Bus Stops and Pullouts WSDOT’s Modal Integration Goal seeks to optimize existing system capacity through better interconnectivity of all transportation modes. In support of this goal, WSDOT promotes safe and efficient public transportation services on state highways, including transit routes and stops. On limited access facilities, bus stops are only allowed at designated locations, such as flyer stops. (See Chapter 520, Chapter 530, and Chapter 540 for access control policy and guidance.)
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1730
Transit Facilities
Bus stops may be approved on non-limited access facilities at the transit agency’s request and upon formal review by WSDOT for sight distance and universal access requirements at the proposed location. At a transit agency’s option, a bus stop on these highways may be located either within the travel lane, or outside the travel lane in a pullout. Contact the State Traffic Engineer for information on how to process a transit agency proposal for either an in-lane or pullout bus stop and for more information about the approval process. Refer to WAC 468-46, Transit Vehicle Stop Zones, for additional details. The bus stop is the point of contact between the passenger and the transit services. The simplest bus stop is a location by the side of the road. The highest quality bus stop is an area that provides passenger amenities and protection from the weather. Bus stops are typically maintained by the transit agency. The bus boarding and alighting pad, the path to the shelter, and the area within the shelter must meet the requirements for universal access. Coordinate with the local transit agency regarding the location and what type of bus stop to use. For additional information on bus stop treatments, see Understanding Flexibility in Transportation Design – Washington and the transit agency’s standards for treatment.
1730.02(1) Bus Stop Placement Guidelines The information in this section is offered as an example of good practice, and is not intended to be binding by either the transit agency or WSDOT. Placement of bus stops addresses the needs and convenience of transit providers, riders, and highway or street operations. Basic considerations include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The need for safe, secure, and convenient service for patrons Access for people with disabilities Convenient passenger transfers to other intersecting bus routes or transfer points Connection to nearby pedestrian circulation systems Presence and width of sidewalks, crosswalks, and curb ramps Pedestrian activity through intersections Ability of the stop to accommodate transit dwell time and the loading/unloading of wheel chairs and bicycles Adequate curb space for the number of buses expected at the stop at one time Ease of reentering traffic stream (if a pullout) Design characteristics and operational considerations of the highway or street Presence of on-street automobile parking and truck delivery zones Traffic control devices near the bus stop, such as signals or stop signs Volumes and turning movements of other traffic, including bicycles Proximity and traffic volumes of nearby driveways Street grade Proximity to rail crossings Accommodating transit priority equipment at signalized intersections Transit queue bypass at signalized intersections Often stops are paired on each side of a highway or street Proximity to intersections

Where blocks are exceptionally long or where bus patrons are concentrated well away from intersections, midblock bus stops and midblock crosswalks may be beneficial. Contact the Region Traffic Engineer when a midblock bus stop is being considered on a multilane roadway to determine crossing design details and treatments that may be required. (See Chapter 1510 and the Traffic Manual for more information on midblock crossings.) It is common to clearly mark the bus stop as a NO PARKING zone or as a BUS ONLY zone with signs and/or curb painting. The remainder of this section discusses three types of bus stops:
•
•
•
Far-side, with a stop located just past an intersection Near-side, with a stop located just prior to an intersection Midblock, with a stop located away from an intersection
Exhibit 1730-1 illustrates these three types of stops and provides some general dimensions. Consult the AASHTO Guide for Geometric Design of Transit Facilities on Highways and Streets for additional guidelines on bus stop spacing, including information on these types of stops. Examine each case separately and determine the most suitable location, giving consideration to service and safety of patrons, efficiency of transit operations, and traffic operation in general.
1730.02(1)(a) Far-Side Bus Stops Sight distance conditions generally favor far-side bus stops, especially at unsignalized intersections. A driver approaching a cross street on the through lanes can see any vehicles approaching from the right. With near-side stops, the view to the right may be blocked by a stopped bus. Where the intersection is signalized, the bus may block the view of one of the signal heads. Advantages:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Right turns can be accommodated with less conflict. Minimum interference is caused at locations where traffic is heavier on the approach side of the intersection. Stopped buses do not obstruct sight distance for vehicles entering or crossing from a side street. At a signalized intersection, buses can often find a gap to enter the traffic stream, except where there are heavy turning movements onto the street with the bus route. Waiting passengers assemble at less-crowded sections of the sidewalk away from the intersection corners. Buses in the bus stop do not obscure traffic control devices or pedestrian movements at the intersection.
Disadvantages:
•
•
Intersections may be blocked if other vehicles park illegally in the bus stop or if more buses than the stop can accommodate arrive at the same time. If signal priority is not used, the bus stops at the red light and again at the far-side stop, interfering with traffic and efficient bus operations.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1730-3
Chapter 1730
Transit Facilities
1730.02(1)(b) Near-Side Bus Stops Advantages:
•
•
•
•
•
May be considered in cases where a far-side bus stop location does not provide a secure, convenient, or feasible boarding location for passengers. Minimum interference is caused where traffic is heavier on the departure side than on the approach side of the intersection. Less interference is caused where the cross street is a one-way street from right to left. Passengers generally exit the bus close to the crosswalk. There is less interference with traffic turning onto the bus route street from a side street.
Disadvantages:
•
•
•
•
Can cause conflicts with right-turning traffic. Buses often obscure sight distance to stop signs, traffic signals, or other control devices, as well as to pedestrians crossing in front of the bus. Where the bus stop is too short to accommodate buses arriving at the same time, the overflow may obstruct the traffic lane. If a queue bypass or bus lane is not used at a signalized intersection, then vehicles waiting at a red signal may block buses from accessing the bus stop, which will require the bus to wait through multiple signal cycles to enter and then depart the bus stop.
1730.02(1)(c) Midblock Bus Stops Midblock stop areas are desirable under the following conditions: where traffic or physical street characteristics prohibit a near- or far-side stop adjacent to an intersection, or where large factories, commercial establishments, or other large bus passenger generators exist. Locate a midblock stop at the far side of a pedestrian crosswalk (if one exists), so that standing buses do not block an approaching motorist’s view of pedestrians in the crosswalk. Advantages:
•
•
•
Buses cause a minimum of interference with the sight distance of both vehicles and pedestrians. Stops can be located adjacent to major bus passenger generators and attractors. Allows riders to board buses closest to the crosswalk.
Disadvantages:
•
•
•
Increases walking distance for passengers crossing at intersections. Buses may or may not have difficulty reentering the flow of traffic. Driveway access may or may not be negatively impacted.

Important elements of a bus stop include:
• ADA Standards
• Protection from passing traffic
• Lighting
• Security
Transit Facilities
•
•
•
•
Paved surface Protection from the environment Seating or other street furniture (if the wait may be long) Information about routes serving the stop
Providing protection from passing traffic involves locating stops where there is enough space, so passengers can wait away from the edge of the traveled roadway. The buffering distance from the roadway increases with traffic speed and traffic volume. Where vehicle speeds are 30 mph or below, 5 feet is a satisfactory distance. In a heavy-volume arterial with speeds up to 45 mph, a distance of 10 feet provides passenger comfort. Passengers arriving at bus stops, especially infrequent riders, want information and reassurance. Provide information that includes the numbers or names of routes serving the stop. Other important information may include a system route map, the hours and days of service, schedules, and a phone number for information. Information technology systems are evolving and some transit agencies now provide information about wait time until the next bus and kiosks to purchase the fare before boarding. Where shelters are not provided, a bus stop sign and passenger bench are desirable, depending on weather conditions. The sign indicates to passengers where to wait and can provide some basic route information. The information provided and format used is typically the responsibility of the local transit agency.
1730.03(2) Passenger Shelters Passenger shelters provide protection for waiting transit users and create driver awareness of intermodal connections involving vulnerable users. Locate the shelter conveniently for users, without blocking the sidewalk or the drivers’ line of sight. Providing shelters (and footing for shelters) is normally the responsibility of the local transit agency; it provides for shelter design and footing needs. State motor vehicle funds cannot be used for design or construction of shelters, except for the concrete pad. Lighting can enhance passenger safety and security. Lighting makes the shelter visible to passing traffic and allows waiting passengers to read the information provided. General street lighting is usually sufficient. Where streetlights are not in place, consider streetlights or transit shelter lights. For information on illumination, see Chapter 1040. A properly drained paved surface is needed so passengers do not traverse puddles and mud in wet weather. Protection from the environment is typically provided by a shelter, which offers shade from the sun, protection from rain and snow, and a wind break. Shelters can range from simple to elaborate. The latter type may serve as an entrance landmark for a residential development or business complex and be designed to carry through the architectural theme of the complex. If a non-public transportation entity shelter is provided, its design and siting must be approved by the local transit agency. The reasons for this approval include safety, barrier-free design, intermodal connections, and long-term maintenance concerns. Consider shelters at bus stops in new commercial and office developments and in places where large numbers of elderly and disabled persons wait, such as at hospitals and senior centers. In residential areas, shelters are placed at the highest-volume stops.

Transit Facilities
In order to use buses that are accessible, bus stops must also be accessible. The nature and condition of streets, sidewalks, passenger loading pads, curb ramps, and other bus stop facilities can constitute major obstacles to mobility and accessibility. State, local, public, and private agencies need to work closely with public transportation officials to provide universal access. Involve the local transit agency in the bus stop pad design and location so that lifts can actually be deployed at the site. In order to access a bus stop, it is important that the path to the stop also be accessible. This can be accomplished by the use of sidewalks with curb ramps. For sidewalk design and curb ramp information, see Chapter 1510 and the Standard Plans. Exhibit 1730-5 depicts ADA standards for bus stop locations. Exhibit 1730-5 Bus Stop Accessibility Features

1730.04 Park and Ride Lots Park and ride lots provide parking for people who wish to transfer from private vehicles, bicycles, and other modes to public transit or carpools/vanpools. Most park and ride lots located within urban areas are served by transit agencies. Leased lots, such as at churches or shopping centers, or park and rides in rural locations, may have no bus service and only serve carpools and vanpools.
Park and ride lot
HOV facilities are often considered and included in larger park and ride lots, to improve access for transit and carpools (see Chapter 1410). Park and ride needs and locations are determined through planning processes typically conducted by transit agencies, WSDOT, and/or RTPOs/MPOs. Once the need is identified, then the project lead should be identified. Early and continual coordination between the project lead and other stakeholders, authorities, and agencies is critical. A Cooperative Agreement is written by Headquarters (HQ) Real Estate Services for the purpose of assigning maintenance and/or operational responsibilities for a WSDOT park and ride lot to a transit agency or local governmental agency. See the Agreements Manual and the HQ Real Estate Services Cooperative Agreement form (Consultants: Please contact your WSDOT Project Manager for access to the Agreements Manual). When a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or other formal agreement exists that outlines the design, funding, maintenance, and operation of park and ride lots, it must be reviewed for requirements pertaining to new lots. If the requirements in the MOU or other formal agreement cannot be met, the MOU must be renegotiated.
1730.04(1) Site Selection In determining the location of a park and ride lot, public input is a valuable tool. Estimated parking demand and other factors determine the size of the lot. Traveler convenience is an important siting factor. Locations that minimize overall trip travel time are most attractive to commuters. Park and rides near freeway access tend to be heavily used because they minimize overall trip travel time for the most people. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1730-11
Chapter 1730
Transit Facilities
Freeway proximity makes it easier for transit authorities to provide frequent route service. Other factors that may affect the initial size of the park and ride lot may include available land, the state of the economy, energy availability and cost, perceived congestion, transit service frequency, and environmental controls. Consider sizing the facility to allow for a conservative first-stage construction with expansion possibilities. As a rule of thumb, 1 acre can accommodate approximately 90 vehicles in a park and ride lot. This allows approximately 40% of the area for borders, landscaping, passenger amenities, bus facilities for larger lots, and future expansion. (See the AASHTO Guide for Geometric Design of Transit Facilities on Highways and Streets, Appendix E, for complementary information.) The local transit authority can give critical input on the need for and design of the park and ride lot. The comprehensive transit plan may already specify a location, and coordination with the transit agency will ensure the site works well for transit vehicle access. Good coordination with the transit agencies through the entire design process is necessary to ensure a well-planned facility that meets the needs of all modal users. Develop a list of potential sites to identify properties that can be most readily developed for parking and that have suitable access. Sources for selecting sites can include State Route Corridor Sketches and useful tools such as GIS or existing aerial photos, detailed land use maps, or property maps. Factors influencing site selection and design of a park and ride facility include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Local transit authority master plan Regional transportation plan Local agency codes Ability to use existing underutilized paved parking areas within proximity of the desired location Local public input Proximity to demand Local traffic operations, characteristics, parking availability, and roadway geometry Local government zoning Social and environmental impacts Local land use compatibility with current or future development patterns Cost and benefit/cost Access by all modes of travel Security and lighting impacts Maintenance Stormwater treatment and outfall Available utilities Existing right of way or sundry site Potential for future expansion
Purchasing or leasing property increases costs. Therefore, the first choice is state- or transit-owned right of way, assuming the other selection criteria are favorable. Also, give prime consideration to the use of city- or countyowned right of way. Select a site that complements the current and future land use and highway needs. Investigate each potential site in the field. The field survey serves to confirm or revise impressions gained from the office review. When conducting the investigation, consider the following:
•
•
•
Physical characteristics of the site Current use and zoning of the area Land use surrounding the property (such as residential or commercial use)

Transit Facilities
Street network and condition of the roadways Visibility from adjacent streets to enhance security Potential for additional expansion Ability to meet ADA requirements and accessibility for motorists and other modes of travel, including transit Proximity of any existing parking facilities (such as church or shopping center parking lots) that are underutilized during the day Potential for joint use of facilities with businesses (such as day care centers or dry cleaners) or land uses compatible with park and ride patrons Congestion and other design considerations Avoiding locations that encourage noncommuter use (such as proximity to a high school)
The desirable location for park and ride lot along one-way couplets is between the two one-way streets, with access from both streets. When this is not achievable, provide additional signing to guide users to and from the facility. Establish potential sites, with transit agency input, and complete public meetings and environmental procedures prior to finalizing the design. Follow the procedures outlined in Chapter 210.
1730.04(2) Design Guidance The remainder of this section covers basic design principles and guidance for park and ride lots. Design features are to be in compliance with local requirements. In some cases, variances to local design requirements may be needed to provide for the safety and security of facility users. Common design components with park and ride lots include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Chapter 1730
Transit Facilities
The degree to which the desirable attributes of any component are sacrificed to obtain the benefits of another component can only be determined on a site-specific basis. However, these guidelines present the optimum design elements of each factor. Large park and ride lots are intended to be transfer points from private automobiles and other modes to transit buses. The same basic principles are used in designing all park and ride lots. Park and Ride lots that serve a large number of buses and/or routes may also serve as Transfer/Transit Centers; in these cases section Section 1730.05 would also apply.
1730.04(2)(a) Access Provide for all modes of transport used to arrive at and depart from transit facilities. The six basic modes are pedestrian, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile, vanpool, and bus. Coordinate with the local jurisdiction and transit authorities to develop the park and ride lot’s ingress and egress locations for transit and for other vehicles. Design the access route, circulation patterns, and return routes to minimize travel time. Exclusive direct connections for buses, vanpools, and carpools may reduce transit costs and save time for riders. Design transit facility access points on intersecting collector or local streets where possible. Locate the access to avoid the queues from nearby intersections. Provide vehicle storage lanes for entering and exiting vehicles to ensure ease of access and encourage use of the facility. To avoid increasing congestion on the highway or the community that the facility serves, locate entrances and exits where a traffic signal, or other intersection control type (see Chapter 1300), can be reasonably installed at a later time, if needed. Entrances and exits to park and rides range in scale from full public intersections to driveways, depending on contextual factors such as traffic volumes and remoteness. Design access points using criteria in the 1300 chapter series (Division 13) or other published design guidelines used by the local agency. When locating access points on a state highway, see chapters in the 500 series (Division 5) for information about access control types (managed or limited access) and standard access spacing and other requirements. When designing the entrance/exit locations used by buses, start the design using a 15-foot lane width, and then adjust as needed using the bus design vehicle and turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify the design.
1730.04(2)(b) Internal Circulation Provide walkways to minimize pedestrian use of a circulation road or an aisle to minimize pedestrian conflict points with other modes. Make the pedestrian circulation path from any parking stall to the loading zone as direct as possible. Where pedestrian movement originates from an outlying part of a large parking lot, consider a walkway that extends toward the loading zone in a straight line. For additional criteria for pedestrian movement, see Design Manual Chapter 1510 and Chapter 630 of the Roadside Manual.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1730-14
Chapter 1730
Transit Facilities
Pedestrian Access Route
Locate major vehicular circulation routes within a park and ride lot at the periphery of the parking area to minimize vehicle-pedestrian conflicts. Take care that an internal intersection is not placed too close to a street intersection. Consider a separate loading area with priority parking for vanpools. Wherever possible, do not mix buses and auto circulation. Close coordination with the local transit authority is critical in the design of internal circulation for buses and vanpools. Design bus circulation routes to provide for easy movement, with efficient terminal operations and convenient passenger transfers. Design bus routes within the internal layout, including entrance and exit driveways, to the turning radius of the design bus vehicle. Additional considerations for internal circulation are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Base the general design for the individual user modes on the priority sequence of: pedestrians, bicycles, feeder buses, and park and ride area. Design the different traffic flows (auto, pedestrian, bicycle, and bus) circulating within the lot to be understandable to all users, and to minimize conflicting movements between modes. Disperse vehicular movements within the parking area by the strategic location of entrances, exits, and aisles. Do not confront drivers with more than one decision at a time. Provide clear signing for all modes. Make the pedestrian circulation routes ADA-compliant (see Chapter 1510). Parking stall and access aisle surfaces shall be even and smooth, with surface slopes not exceeding 2%. Consider future expansion. Align parking aisles to facilitate convenient pedestrian movement toward the bus loading zone. Locate the passenger loading zone either in a central location, to minimize the pedestrian walking distance from the parking area to the loading zone, or near the end of the facility, to minimize the transit travel time. In large lots, you may need to provide more than one waiting area for multiple buses.
1730.04(2)(c) Parking Area Design Refer to the Roadside Manual for detailed guidance on parking area design. Some general guidelines follow. Normally, internal circulation is two way with 90° parking. However, one-way aisles with angled parking may be advantageous in a smaller lot due to the limited available space or to promote a specific circulation pattern. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1730-15
Chapter 1730
Transit Facilities
Provide parking for bicycles, motorcycles, and private automobiles, as well as carpools, vanpools, and buses. Locate accessible parking stalls close to the transit loading and unloading area. Two accessible parking stalls may share a common access aisle. For information on the number and design of accessible stalls, see the Roadside Manual and the parking space layouts in the Standard Plans. Sign accessible parking stalls in accordance with the requirements of RCW 46.61.581. Parking stalls and access aisle surfaces shall be even and smooth, with surface slopes not exceeding 2%. Locate the bicycle-parking area relatively close to the transit passenger loading area, separated from motor vehicles by curbing or other physical barriers, without landscaping that hides the bike area from view, and with a direct route from the street.
•
•
Design the bike-parking area to discourage pedestrians from inadvertently walking into the area and tripping. Provide lots that are served by public transit, with lockers or with a rack that will support the bicycle frame and allow at least one wheel to be locked. Consider providing shelters for bicycle racks. For bicycles, the layout normally consists of stalls 2.5 feet x 6 feet, at 90° to aisles, with a minimum aisle width of 4 feet. Coordinate decisions to provide bicycle lockers, racks, and shelters with the local transit authority and the region subject matter experts.
For more information, see Understanding Flexibility in Transportation Design – Washington. It is complementary to the content in this chapter, and provides more insights to modal designs, environment and aesthetics, community engagement, jurisdictional coordination.
1730.04(2)(d) Drainage Provide sufficient slope for surface drainage, as ponding of water in a lot is undesirable for both vehicles and pedestrians. This is particularly true in cold climates where freezing may create icy spots. The maximum grade is 2%. Install curb, gutter, and surface drains and grates where needed. Coordinate designs for drainage and pedestrian access routes to avoid conflicts. Coordinate drainage design with the local agency to make sure appropriate codes are followed. For additional drainage information, see Design Manual Chapter 800 and the Roadside Manual.
1730.04(2)(e) Pavement Design Design pavement to conform to design specifications for each of the different uses and loadings that a particular portion of a lot or roadway is expected to handle. Bus lanes are typically Portland cement concrete pavement. Within the parking area, HMA-type pavements are typically used. Coordinate the pavement designs with the local transit agency and local jurisdiction. Consult with the Region Materials Engineer on pavement section requirements. There may be benefits to permeable pavement if space for stormwater facilities is limited.
1730.04(2)(f) Driver Guidance Provide a well thought out design for traffic movements within the lot using the proper pavement markings and signage for safe and efficient use by all users of the lot. Typically, reflectorized markings for centerlines, lane lines, channelizing lines, and lane arrows are needed to guide or separate patron and transit traffic. Install park and ride identification signs. For signing and pavement markings, see Chapter 1020 and Chapter 1030 and the MUTCD.

1730.04(2)(g) Shelters Coordinate with the transit agency on the need, location, design, and installation of pedestrian shelters. To satisfy local needs, shelters may be individually designed, provided by the transit agency, or selected from a variety of commercially available designs. These designs must meet ADA accessibility requirements. Consider the following features in shelter design:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Select open locations with good visibility for user safety. Situate enclosed shelters away from edges of driveways and roadways to keep users dry. Select materials and locations where the bus driver can see waiting passengers. Avoid using doors, for ease of maintenance and to limit vandalism opportunities. Allow for a small air space along the bottom of the enclosure panels, to permit air circulation and reduce debris collection. Optional features you may provide are: lighting; heat; telephone; static or electronic travel information (schedules); electronic fare collection equipment; commercial advertisements for revenue generation; and trash receptacles.
For additional information on passenger amenities, see Section 1730.03.
1730.04(2)(h) Illumination, Safety, and Security Lighting is important from a safety standpoint and as a deterrent to criminal activity in both the parking area and the shelters. For guidance, see Design Manual Chapter 1040, Chapter 630 of the Roadside Manual, local agency criteria, and AASHTO. The Guide for Geometric Design of Transit Facilities on Highways and Streets, AASHTO, 2014, states: “Security at stations and major stops—both manned and unmanned—should be achieved by closed circuit television monitoring, provision of call boxes, good visibility and lighting, police surveillance, and effective designs. Both the actual security and the passengers’ perceptions of security are important for a viable service or operation.” (See the Guide for more information.)
1730.04(2)(i) Planting Areas Selectively preserve existing vegetation and provide new plantings to afford a balanced environment for the park and ride lot user. For guidance and policy, see the Roadside Manual and the Roadside Policy Manual, respectively.
1730.04(2)(j) Fencing For fencing guidelines, see Chapter 560 and discuss with the partnering transit agency.
1730.04(2)(k) Maintenance Maintenance of park and ride lots outside state right of way is the responsibility of the local transit authority. Negotiate maintenance agreements with local transit authorities or other appropriate parties during the design phase, to identify the requirements and responsibilities for the maintenance. A Cooperative Agreement is written by HQ Real Estate Services for the purpose of assigning maintenance and/or operational responsibilities for a WSDOT park and ride lot to a transit agency or local governmental agency. See the Agreements Manual and the HQ Real Estate Services Cooperative Agreement form (Consultants: Please contact your WSDOT Project Manager for access to the Agreements Manual).

1730.05 Transfer/Transit Centers Transfer/transit centers are large multimodal bus stops where buses on a number of routes converge to allow riders the opportunity to change buses or transfer to other modes. Transit centers are frequently major activity centers and serve as destination points. Many factors dictate the particular needs of each transit center. Design of a transit center considers such features as passenger volume; number of buses on the site at one time; local auto and pedestrian traffic levels; and universal access. Transit agencies generally lead in the development of transfer/transit centers, and their standards apply. Consult the AASHTO Guide for Geometric Design of Transit Facilities on Highways and Streets for more comprehensive overviews and design guidelines for these facilities.
1730.05(1) Bus Platforms At a transit center where several transit routes converge and where buses congregate (lay over), multiple bus berths or spaces are typically needed, along with areas where passengers boarding or alighting the bus can take refuge. Typically, there are several design styles for multi-berth bus platforms (see AASHTO). Parallel and sawtooth types are described below. An important aspect in multiple bus berthing is proper signing and marking for the bus bays for both operators and passengers. Clearly delineate the route served by each bay. Consider pavement marking to indicate stopping positions. Separate layover bays may be needed for terminating bus routes, or the layover function can be provided at the passenger platform if the platform only serves a single route. Consider future service plans and maximize flexibility in the design of transit center bays and circulation. Portland cement concrete pavement is desirable for pedestrian walkways on the platform, for ease of cleaning. Where buses are equipped with a bicycle rack, provide for the loading and unloading of bicycles. Exhibit 1430-6 shows typical parallel and sawtooth designs for parking 40-foot buses for passengers boarding and alighting at a platform. The sawtooth design does not require buses to arrive or depart in any order.

Transit Facilities
Exhibit 1730-7 is an example of a platform design that has a combination of parallel and sawtooth bus berths at a platform. The sawtooth design provides more space-efficient berthing, as the parallel design shown may require that buses arrive and/or depart in order. Coordinate the bus berth style and platform design with the local transit authority throughout the design process, and obtain its concurrence for the final design. In the design of parallel bus berths, additional roadway width is needed for swing-out maneuvers if shorter bus loading platforms are utilized. The roadway width and the amount of lineal space required at the bus platform are directly related where designs allow departing buses to pull out from the platform around a standing bus. The shorter the berth length allowed, the wider the roadway. Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify the design. Considerable length is needed in a parallel design to permit a bus to pass and pull into a platform in front of a parked bus. Design the bus aisle so that a bus can by-pass another bus stopped at the platform. The decision to provide a parallel design to accommodate a by-pass maneuver may depend on how many routes service the location, and the frequency of service.
1730.05(2) Flow/Movement Alternatives Two primary alternatives for vehicle and passenger movement are possible for transfer centers, regardless of the type of bus berths used, as shown in Exhibit 1730-6. Buses may line up along one side of the transfer center. This type of arrangement is generally suitable for a limited number of buses due to the walking distances for transferring passengers. For a larger number of buses, an arrangement similar to Exhibit 1730-7 can minimize transfer time by consolidating the buses in a smaller area. Consult the AASHTO Guide for Geometric Design of Transit Facilities on Highways and Streets for more comprehensive overviews and design guidelines.

1730.06(1) Pavement Coordinate the pavement design (type and thickness) of a transit project, whether initiated by a public transportation agency or a private entity, with WSDOT or the local agency public works department, depending on highway, street, or road jurisdiction. These agencies play a major role in determining the paving section for the particular project. Consult with the Region Materials Engineer on pavement section requirements.

1730.06(2) Grades Roadway grades refer to the maximum desirable slope or grade, or the maximum slope based on the minimum design speed that a 40-foot bus can negotiate efficiently. For roadway grade guidance, see Chapter 1220 or the Local Agency Guidelines. Bus speed on grades is directly related to the weight/horsepower ratio. Select grades that permit uniform operation at an affordable cost. In cases where the roadway is steep, a climbing lane for buses and trucks may be needed. For climbing lane guidance, see Chapter 1270. Avoid abrupt changes in grade due to bus overhangs and ground clearance.
1730.06(3) Lane Widths Guidance on roadway and lane widths is given in Chapter 1230 or the Local Agency Guidelines, based on the context, modal users, needs of the highway or road, and jurisdiction.
1730.06(4) Design Vehicle Characteristics Most transit agencies operate several types of buses within their systems. Vehicle sizes range from articulated buses to passenger vans operated for specialized transportation purposes and vanpooling. Several bus types are listed below. (See Chapter 1103, Design Controls, and Chapter 1300 for design vehicle guidance.)
1730.06(4)(a) City Buses (CITY-BUS) These traditional urban transit vehicles are typically 40 feet long and have a wheelbase of approximately 25 feet. Many of these vehicles are equipped with either front or rear door wheelchair lifts or a front “kneeling” feature that reduces the step height for mobility-impaired patrons. Installing higher curb can reduce the time it takes to kneel a bus and thus increase reliability.
1730.06(4)(b) Articulated Buses Because articulated buses (A-BUS) are hinged between two sections, these vehicles can turn within a relatively short radius. Articulated buses are typically 60 feet in length, with a wheelbase of 22 feet from the front axle to the mid axle and 19 feet from the mid axle to the rear axle. If articulated buses are the common bus using a stop, adjust the length of the pullout accordingly to avoid conflicts.
1730.06(4)(c) Small Buses Some transit agencies operate small buses, which are designed for use in low-volume situations or for driving on lower-class roads. Small buses are also used for transportation of elderly and disabled persons and for shuttle services. Passenger vans are a type of small bus used for specialized transportation and vanpooling. Since the vehicle specifications vary so widely within this category, consult the local transit authority for the specifications of the particular vehicle in question.

Transit Facilities
1730.06(5) Intersection Radii A fundamental characteristic of transit-accessible development is convenient access and circulation for transit vehicles. It is important that radii at intersections be designed to accommodate turning buses. Radii that accommodate turning buses reduce conflicts between automobiles and buses, reduce bus travel time, and provide maximum comfort for the passengers. Refer to Chapter 1300 and Chapter 1310 for intersection design guidance, and take the following factors into consideration in designing intersection radii:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Right of way availability Angle of intersection Width and number of lanes on the intersecting streets Feasibility of channelization adjustments such as set-back stop bar or adjusted center line Design vehicle turning radius On-street parking and/or curb extensions (see Chapter 1510) Allowable bus encroachment Operating speed and speed reductions Adequate intersection sight distance Needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and other design users (see chapters in the 1100 series (Division 11) for contextual discussions and Chapter 1230 for roadway types.)
Because of space limitations and generally lower operating speeds in urban areas, curve radii for turning movements are typically smaller than those used in rural areas.

Conceptual Design Approval Documented approval of the Conceptual Design Approval for design-build projects locks in design policy for three years. Conceptual Design Approval becomes part of the Design Documentation Package (see Chapter 300). conflict point A point where road user paths cross, merge, or diverge. consider To think carefully about, especially in order to make a decision. The decision to document a consideration is left to the discretion of the engineer (See Section 300.03(2)). construction impact zone The area in which an alteration to an existing facility takes place (also known as the project footprint). If a crosswalk (marked or unmarked) will be reconstructed, paved (overlay or inlay), or otherwise altered as part of a project, then the curb ramps that serve that crosswalk are within the construction impact zone. (ADA term) context Refers to the environmental, economic, and social features that influence livability and travel characteristics. Context characteristics provide insight into the activities, functions, and performance that can be influenced by the roadway design. Context also informs roadway design, including the selection of design controls, such as target speed and modal priority, and other design decisions. See Chapter 1102. context categories The naming convention used to describe either a land use or transportation context (see Chapter 1102). context characteristic A distinguishing trait within a context, either land use or transportation. Chapter 1102 lists several common characteristics that help distinguish between one type of context versus another. There may be additional traits not covered in the chapter. contextual performance metric A restatement of a contextual performance need in terms that can be measured or assessed in both the existing and proposed (future) state.

Examples include lane width, shoulder width, alignment, and clear zone (see Chapter 1105.) design vehicle The largest vehicle that commonly uses the highway, ramp, or intersection movement. designer This term applies to WSDOT design personnel. Wherever “designer” appears in this manual, designbuild personnel shall deem it to mean: Engineer of Record, Design Quality Assurance Manager, design-builder, or any other term used in the design-build contract to indicate design-build personnel responsible for the design elements of a design-build project, depending on the context of information being conveyed. design hourly volume (DHV) Computed by taking the annual average daily traffic times the K-factor. It can only be accurately determined in locations where there is a permanent traffic recording device active 365 days of the year. It correlates to the peak hour (see peak hour), but it is not equivalent. In some circumstances, it is necessary to use the peak hour data instead of DHV because peak hour can be collected using portable traffic recorders. design speed A design control; the speed used to determine the various geometric design features of the roadway. design up An approach to developing project alternatives utilizing the smallest dimensions that meet the need by providing the desired performance. design users A broad term intended to capture all modal users that currently utilize or are legally permitted on a roadway segment or node. design variance Same as Design Analysis. design vehicle See intersection design vehicle. design year The forecast year used for design as described in Chapter 1103.

freeway A divided highway that has a minimum of two lanes in each direction for the exclusive use of traffic and with full control of access. frontage road An auxiliary road that is a local road or street located beside a highway for service to abutting property and adjacent areas and for control of access. functional classification The grouping of streets and highways according to the character of the service they are intended to provide. G geocomposites Prefabricated edge drains, wall drains, and sheet drains that typically consist of a cuspated or dimpled polyethylene drainage core wrapped in a geotextile. The geotextile wrap keeps the core clean so that water can freely flow through the drainage core, which acts as a conduit. Prefabricated edge drains are used in place of shallow geotextile-wrapped trench drains at the edges of the roadway to provide subgrade and base drainage. Wall drains and sheet drains are typically placed between the back of the wall and the soil to drain the soil retained by the wall. Geographic Information System (GIS) A computerized geographic information system used to store, analyze, and map data. Data may be used with GIS if the data includes the Accumulated Route Mile (ARM) or State Route Milepost (SRMP) programs. Global Positioning System (GPS) technology provides a means of collecting data and is an alternative to ARM and SRMP. WSDOT’s primary desktop tool to view and analyze GIS data is ArcGIS software. geogrids A polymer grid mat constructed either of coated yarns or a punched and stretched polymer sheet. Geogrids usually have high strength and stiffness and are used primarily for soil reinforcement. geomembranes Impervious polymer sheets that are typically used to line ponds or landfills. In some cases, geomembranes are placed over moisture-sensitive swelling clays to control moisture. geonets Similar to geogrids, but typically lighter weight and weaker, with smaller mesh openings. Geonets are used in light reinforcement applications or are combined with drainage geotextiles to form a drainage structure. geosynthetic erosion control The minimizing of surficial soil particle movement due to the flow of water over the surface of bare soil or due to the disturbance of soil caused by construction activities under or near bodies of water. This is the primary function of geotextiles used as silt fences or placed beneath riprap or other stones on soil slopes. Silt fences keep eroded soil particles on the construction site, whereas geotextiles placed beneath riprap or other stones on soil slopes prevent erosion from taking place at all. In general, the permanent erosion control methods described in Chapter 630 are only used where more natural means (like the use of biodegradable vegetation mats to establish vegetation to prevent erosion) are not feasible. These functions control some of the geosynthetic properties, such as apparent opening size (AOS) and permittivity, and in some cases load-strain characteristics. The application will also affect the geosynthetic installation conditions. These installation conditions influence the remaining geosynthetic properties needed, based on the survivability level required. geosynthetic filtration The passage of water through the geosynthetic relatively unimpeded (permeability or permittivity) without allowing passage of soil through the geosynthetic (retention). This is the primary function of geotextiles in underground drainage applications. geosynthetic survivability The ability of the geosynthetic to resist installation conditions without significant damage, such that the geosynthetic can function as intended. Survivability affects the strength properties of the geosynthetic required.

Glossary
geotextiles (nonwoven) A sheet of continuous or staple fibers entangled randomly into a felt for needlepunched nonwovens and pressed and melted together at the fiber contact points for heat-bonded nonwovens. Nonwoven geotextiles tend to have low-to-medium strength and stiffness with high elongation at failure and relatively good drainage characteristics. The high elongation characteristic gives them superior ability to deform around stones and sticks. geotextiles (woven) Slit polymer tapes, monofilament fibers, fibrillated yarns, or multifilament yarns simply woven into a mat. Woven geotextiles generally have relatively high strength and stiffness and, except for the monofilament wovens, relatively poor drainage characteristics. gore The area downstream from the intersection of the shoulders of the main line and exit ramp. Although generally referring to the area between a main line and an exit ramp, the term may also be used to refer to the area between a main line and an entrance ramp. gore nose At an exit ramp, the point at the end of the gore area where the paved shoulders of the main line and the ramp separate (see Chapter 1360) or the beginning of traffic barrier, not including any impact attenuator. Also, the similar point at an entrance ramp. grade break The intersection of two adjacent surface planes of different grade. (ADA term)

The HSP is the starting point for the state highway element of the CIPP and the state Highway Construction Program. It is periodically updated to reflect completed work and changing transportation needs, policies, and revenues. It compares highway needs to revenues, describes the “constrained” costs of the highway programs, and provides details of conceptual solutions and performance in the improvement program. Highways of Statewide Significance (HSS) Include interstate highways and other principal arterials that are needed to connect major communities in the state.

This signal is most commonly used on two-way two-lane highways where one lane has been closed for roadwork. This signal is most commonly operated in pairs, with one signal at each end of the work zone. This eliminates the need for 24-hour flagger control. The traffic signal provides alternating right of way assignments for conflicting traffic movements. The signal has an adjustable vertical support with two three-section signal displays and is mounted on a mobile trailer with its own power source. positive illumination Lighting the surface of the object as the driver views it. posted speed The maximum legal speed as posted on a section of highway using regulatory signs. Practical Design/Practical Solutions An approach to making project decisions that focuses on the specific problem the project is intended to address. This performance-based approach looks for lower cost solutions that meet outcomes that WSDOT, partnering agencies, communities and stakeholders have identified. Practical design is a fundamental component to the vision, mission, values, goals, and reforms identified in Results WSDOT- WSDOT’s Strategic Plan. With practical solutions, decision-making focuses on maximum benefit to the system, rather than maximum benefit to the project. Focusing on the specific project need minimizes the scope of work for each project so that system-wide needs can be optimized. prehearing packet A concise, organized collection of all necessary prehearing data, prepared by the region and approved by the HQ Access and Hearings Section Manager prior to the hearing (see Chapter 210). preliminary engineering (PE) A term used to describe the Project Delivery process from project scoping through PS&E review. principal arterial system A connected network of rural arterial routes with appropriate extensions into and through urban areas, including routes designated as part of the Interstate System, that serves corridor movements with travel characteristics indicative of substantial statewide and interstate travel (RCW 47.05.021).

T tangent runout The length of highway needed to change the cross slope from normal crown to a section with adverse crown removed (level). target speed A proactive approach to establishing a speed consistent with the context characteristics. Target speed is the design operating speed, which aligns design, posted and operating speed as the same value. temporary traffic signal A conventional traffic signal used during construction to control traffic at an intersection while a permanent signal system is being constructed. A temporary traffic signal is typically an inexpensive span-wire installation using timber strain poles. tradeoffs analysis An analysis method for balancing factors, performance or outcomes, which are not attainable at the same time. traffic barrier A longitudinal barrier, including bridge rail or an impact attenuator, used to redirect vehicles from fixed features located within an established Design Clear Zone, help mitigate median crossovers, reduce the potential for errant vehicles to travel over the side of a bridge structure, or (occasionally) protect workers, pedestrians, or bicyclists from vehicular traffic. traffic barrier/longitudinal barrier A device oriented parallel or nearly parallel to the roadway whose primary function is to contain or safely redirect errant vehicles away from fixed features or to (occasionally) protect workers, pedestrians, or bicyclists from vehicular traffic. Beam guardrail, cable barrier, bridge rail, concrete barrier, and impact attenuators are barriers, and they are categorized as rigid, rigid anchored, unrestrained rigid, semirigid, and flexible. They can be installed as roadside or median barriers. traffic calming Design techniques that have been shown to reduce traffic speeds and unsafe maneuvers. These techniques can be stand-alone or used in combination, and they include lane narrowing, curb extensions, surface variations, and visual clues in the vertical plane. (ADA term) traffic calming treatments Treatments along the roadway that can be used to reduce speeds through a section of roadway (see Chapter 1103). Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) (sometimes called Traffic Impact Study (TIS)) If a traffic analysis is not an ARR it is a TIA. TIAs are used for environmental reviews and developer projects (see Chapter 320). trails Trails are intended to provide and support recreational experience(s) and do not provide necessary infrastructure for ADA accessibility and may not provide connectivity for the transportation network. Although trails may be used by multiple user types (such as pedestrians, bicyclists or equestrian activities), they are not designed based on ADA guidance like shared-use paths and sidewalks are. The Pacific Crest Trail is a good example of a trail. Parts of trails might be accessible, but trails don't need to be accessible. Trails do not usually have a firm, stable, or slip resistant surfaces, nor do they usually have accessible cross slopes, or running slopes. transit A general term applied to passenger rail and bus service used by the public. transit facility A capital facility that improves the efficiency of public transportation or encourages the use of public transportation. transit flyer stop A multimodal connection located within the boundaries of a limited access facility. transition A section of barrier used to produce the gradual stiffening of a flexible or semirigid barrier as it connects to a more rigid barrier or fixed object.

transitional segments Segments of a pedestrian circulation path that blend between existing undisturbed pedestrian facilities and newly altered pedestrian facilities. Use of transitional segments may permit the work of the alteration to more nearly meet the new construction standards. At a later time, when other segments of the pedestrian circulation path are altered, the noncomplying transitional segments can be removed and replaced with pedestrian facilities that meet the accessibility criteria. (ADA term) transit lane A lane for the exclusive use of transit vehicles. transit stop A facility for loading and unloading passengers that is set aside for the use of transit vehicles only. transit vehicle A bus or other motor vehicle that provides public transportation (usually operated by a public agency).

Transportation Management Area (TMA) Urbanized areas with populations of 200,000 or greater are federally designated as Transportation Management Areas. transportation management plan (TMP) A set of traffic control plans, transportation operations plans, and public information strategies for managing the work zone impacts of a project. A TMP is required for all projects to address work zone safety and mobility impacts. Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) TSMO is applying cost-effective solutions that are multimodal, cross jurisdictional, and applicable across the transportation system. TSMO strategies are flexible solutions that can be applied as standalone solutions, combined with other solutions, and/or mitigation for performance tradeoffs prior to future expansion. See https://tsmowa.org/ for more information. travel demand The demand travelers will make on the system based on the number and types of trips they will take and the mode and routes they will use. Local travel demand represents short trips that should be made on the local transportation system, such as intracity roads and streets. Regional travel demand represents long trips that are made on the regional transportation system, such as Interstate, regional, and/or intercity/interregional roads, streets, or highways. traveled way The portion of the roadway intended for the movement of vehicles, exclusive of shoulders, auxiliary lanes, turning lanes, parking, and gutter pans colored differently than the lane. traveler information Commercial and noncommercial information that informs and orients the traveling public.

V validation A process to confirm the reasonableness, accuracy and completeness of estimated costs and quantities. Value Engineering (VE) Analysis A systematic approach to identifying and removing unnecessary costs which do not contribute to a desired result by analyzing cost versus function. Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP) A construction contract change proposal submitted by the construction contractor based on a VECP provision in the contract. The intent of these types of proposals is to (1) improve the project's performance, value, and/or quality, (2) lower construction costs, or (3) shorten the delivery time, while considering their impacts on the project's overall life-cycle cost and other applicable factors. Value Engineering (VE) Job Plan A systematic and structured action plan (see Chapter 310) for conducting and documenting the results of the VE analysis. While each VE analysis shall address each phase in the VE Job Plan, the level of analysis conducted and effort expended for each phase should be scaled to meet the needs of each individual project. The WSDOT VE analysis uses the Seven-Phase Job Plan shown in Exhibit 310-1. veiling luminance The stray light produced within the eye by light sources produces a veiling luminance that is superimposed on the retinal image of the objects being observed. This stray light alters the apparent brightness of an object within the visual field and the background against which it is viewed, thereby impairing the ability of the driver to perform visual tasks. Conceptually, veiling luminance is the light that travels directly from the luminaire to the observer’s eye. viewpoint A roadside stopping opportunity with a view of some point of interest or area scenery. This area is not typically separated from the traveled way by some form of highway buffer. violation rate The total number of violators divided by the total number of vehicles on an HOV facility. visioning exercises a process of determining the goals for a facility or place. Visitor Information Center (VIC) A staffed or nonstaffed booth or separate building that displays and dispenses free tourist travel maps and brochures.
