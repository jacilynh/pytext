Foundation Seals A concrete seal within the confines of a cofferdam permits construction of a pier footing and column in the dry. This type of underwater construction is practical to a water depth of approximately 50 feet. Seal concrete is placed underwater with the use of a tremie. A tremie is a long pipe that extends to the bottom of the excavation and permits a head to be maintained on the concrete during placement. After the concrete has been placed and has obtained sufficient strength, the water within the cofferdam is removed. In Figure 7.1.6-1, some of the factors that must be considered in designing a seal are illustrated. Figure 7.1.6-1

General Seal Criteria
An expected normal high water surface elevation is defined as the highest water surface elevation that may normally be expected to occur during construction of the structure. This will be the elevation of the seal vent, and is provided in coordination with the Hydraulics Office, on the hydraulics data sheet. 7.1.6.A.1
Seal Vent Elevation
The Hydraulics Office recommends a seal vent elevation in accordance with the following criteria. 1.
Construction Time Period Not Known If the time period of the footing construction is not known, the vent elevation reflects the normal high water elevation that might occur at any time during the year.
2.
Construction Time Period Known If the time period of the footing construction can be anticipated, the vent elevation reflects the normal high water elevation that might occur during this time period. (If the anticipated time period of construction is later changed, the Hydraulics Office shall be notified and appropriate changes made in the design.)

Scour
Since adding a seal can affect the amount of scour, the seal information shall be provided to the Hydraulics Office for their scour analysis. 7.1.6.B
Spread Footing Seals
The Geotechnical Office will generally recommend whether a foundation seal may or may not be required for construction. Bearing loads are the column moments applied at the base of the footing and vertical load applied at the bottom of the seal. The seal is sized for the soil bearing capacity. Overturning stability need only be checked at the base of the pier footing. 7.1.6.B.1
When a Seal is Required During Construction
At a minimum, the top of footing shall be below the total scour depth at the check flood. See Section 7.1.7. Spread footing final design shall include the dead load weight of the seal. 7.1.6.B.2
When a Seal May Not Be Required for Construction
Both methods of construction are detailed in the plans when it is not clear if a seal is required for construction. The plans must detail a footing with a seal and an alternate without a seal. The plan quantities are based on the footing designed with a seal. If the alternate footing elevation is different from the footing with seal, it is also necessary to note on the plans the required changes in rebar such as length of column bars, increased number of ties, etc. Note that this requires the use of either General Special Provision (GSP) 6-02.3(6)B.OPT1.GB6 or 6-02.3(6)B.OPT2.GB6. 7.1.6.C
Deep Foundation Seals
The top of footing, or pedestal, is set by the footing cover requirements or by total scour at the scour check flood determined by the Hydraulics Office. See Section 7.1.7. A preliminary analysis is made using the estimated footing and seal weight, and the column moments and vertical load at the base of the footing to determine the number of piles and spacing. The seal size shall be 1′-0″ larger than the footing all around. In general seal design requires determining a thickness such that the seal weight plus any additional resistance provided by the bond stress between the seal concrete and any piling is greater than the buoyant force (determined by the head of water above the seal). If the bond stress between the seal concrete and the piling is used to determine the seal thickness, the uplift capacity of the piles must be checked against the loads applied to them as a result of the bond stress. The bond between seal concrete and piles is typically assumed to be 10 psi. The minimum seal thickness is 1′-6″.

Scour Requirements Scour can affect the bridge structure, adjacent wall structures, and the bridge embankment. The bridge structure shall be designed for total scour. Total scour for the bridge structure does not take into account any added scour countermeasures as explained in the sections below. If scour countermeasures are designed and constructed following guidance from the most recent version of HEC 23, then walls and embankments benefit as explained in the sections below. All bridge foundations shall be designed for total scour regardless of bridge type, location, and usage. Bridge foundations shall be designed by the bridge designers for total scour considering the following two conditions: 1.
At Service and Strength Limit States: For the scour design flood, the streambed material above the total scour line shall be assumed to have been removed for design conditions. The scour design flood is the worst-case scour for all floods up to and including Q100. The Hydraulics Office provides the total scour elevation corresponding to the scour design flood.
2.
At Extreme Limit States (Earthquake and Scour): Two separate extreme cases shall be evaluated when verifying the stability of the bridge foundation. The check flood is the worst-case scour for all floods up to and including Q500.
• Extreme Case I – 50% of the total scour design flood depth plus seismic
• Extreme Case II – 100% of the scour check flood depth
Unless otherwise specified, the top of footing locations for bridges shall be based on total scour at the scour check flood, and design shall be based on the total scour at the scour design flood or scour check flood depending on the controlling load case. If there is lateral migration, then the determination of total scour during both the scour design flood and the scour check flood shall account for the migrated state. Total scour is determined by the Hydraulics Office. Figure 7-6 in the Hydraulics Manual shows the various contributions on total scour along with lateral migration. Figure 7.1.7-1 as well as the following subsections provide guidance on top of footing or cap elevations.

Shallow Foundations
Shallow foundations supporting interior piers and abutments on soil or erodible rock shall be located so that the top of footing is below the total scour at the scour check flood. The presence of scour countermeasures does not change the location of the shallow foundations. If a bridge abutment footing is relient on a retaining wall, the wall shall be designed for the total scour depth, regardless of the presence of a scour countermeasure. The retaining wall shall have continuous structural concrete or continuous fascia that extends 2 feet below the total scour at the scour check flood. The length of such a wall shall be determined by performing an assessment to ensure the stability of the wall and structure element through the range of anticipated scour and lateral migration. Shallow foundations on scour-resistant bedrock shall be designed and constructed to maintain the integrity of the supporting rock and shall be located such that the bottom of footing is at or below the top of the scour resistant material. 7.1.7.B
Deep Foundations
At bridge abutments without scour countermeasures designed and constructed per the most recent HEC 23 guidelines, deep foundations such as drilled shafts or driven piles, with pile or shaft caps, shall be located such that the top of pile or shaft cap is located below the total scour at the scour check flood. Scour countermeasures shall not be placed at interior piers. For interior piers, or at bridge abutments with scour countermeasures designed and constructed per the most recent HEC23 guidelines, the top of foundation may be located above the total scour at the scour check flood elevation. There may be select structures where the pile or shaft cap may be located above the total scour at the scour check flood at abutments without scour countermeasures if there is concurrence with the State Hydraulic Engineer, the State Geotechnical Engineer, the State Bridge Design Engineer, and the Region Manager, as well as the structure not being located on a T1 freight route or a lifeline route. When the top of shaft or pile cap is located above the total scour elevation, the hydraulic and geotechnical recommendations shall account for the exposed foundation geometry. The foundation shall be designed assuming that the soil above the total scour elevation has been removed; or half the depth above the total scour at the scour design flood in Extreme Event Case I. Soil arching conditions behind the shafts shall be assumed to the total scour elevation at the scour design flood, requiring the full-depth earth pressures to be applied from behind the shafts and shaft cap as shown in Figure 7.1.7-2.

Foundation Modeling for Seismic Loads
7.2.1
General Bridge modeling for seismic events shall be in accordance with requirements of the AASHTO Seismic Section 5, “Analytical Models and Procedures.” The following guidance is for elastic dynamic analysis. Refer to AASHTO Seismic Section 5.4 for other dynamic analysis procedures.
7.2.2
Substructure Elastic Dynamic Analysis Procedure The following is a general description of the iterative process used in an elastic dynamic analysis. Note: An elastic dynamic analysis is needed to determine the displacement demand, ∆D. The substructure elements are first designed using Strength, Service or Extreme II limit state load cases prior to performing the dynamic analysis. 1.
Build a Finite Element Model (FEM) to determine initial structure response (EQ+DC). Assume that foundation springs are located at the bottom of the column. A good initial assumption for fixity conditions of deep foundations (shafts or piles) is to add 10′ to the column length in stiff soils and 15′ to the column in soft soils. Use multi-mode response spectrum analysis to generate initial displacements.
2.
Determine foundation springs using results from the seismic analysis in the longitudinal and transverse directions. Note: The load combinations specified in AASHTO Seismic Section 4.4 shall NOT be used in this analysis.
3.
For spread footing foundations, the FEM will include foundation springs calculated based on the footing size as calculated in Section 7.2.7. No iteration is required unless the footing size changes. Note: For Site Classes A and B the AASHTO Seismic allows spread footings to be modeled as rigid or fixed.
4.
For deep foundation analysis, the FEM and the soil response program must agree or converge on soil/structure lateral response. In other words, the moment, shear, deflection, and rotation of the two programs should be within 10 percent. More iteration will provide convergence much less than 1 percent. The iteration process to converge is as follows: A. Apply the initial FEM loads (moment and shear) to a p-y type soil response program such as LPILE (including LPILE, LPILE-SHAFT and LPILE-GROUP). B.
Calculate foundation spring values for the FEM. Note: The load combinations specified in AASHTO Seismic Section 4.4 shall not be used to determine foundation springs.
C.
Re-run the seismic analysis using the foundation springs calculated from the soil response program. The structural response will change. Check to insure the FEM results (M, V, Δ, θ, and spring values) in the transverse and longitudinal direction are within 10 percent of the previous run. This check verifies the linear spring, or soil response (calculated by the FEM) is close to the predicted nonlinear soil behavior (calculated by the soil response program). If the results of the FEM and the soil response program differ by more than 10 percent, recalculate springs and repeat steps (a) thru (c) until the two programs converge to within 10 percent.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 7-13
Chapter 7
Substructure Design
Special note for single column/single shaft configuration: The seismic design philosophy requires a plastic hinge in the substructure elements above ground (preferably in the columns). Designers should note the magnitude of shear and moment at the top of the shaft, if the column “zero” moment is close to a shaft head foundation spring, the FEM and soil response program will not converge and plastic hinging might be below grade. Throughout the iteration process it is important to note that any set of springs developed are only applicable to the loading that was used to develop them (due to the inelastic behavior of the soil in the foundation program). This can be a problem when the forces used to develop the springs are from a seismic analysis that combines modal forces using a method such as the Complete Quadratic Combination (CQC) or other method. The forces that result from this combination are typically dominated by a single mode (in each direction as shown by mass participation). This results in the development of springs and forces that are relatively accurate for that structure. If the force combination (CQC or otherwise) is not dominated by one mode shape (in the same direction), the springs and forces that are developed during the above iteration process may not be accurate. LPILE may be used for a pile group supported footing. Pile or shaft foundation group effects for lateral loading shall be taken as recommended in the project geotechnical report.

Bridge Model Verification   
7 .8 .2-1     As with any FEM, the designershould review the foundation behavior to ensure the foundation springs correctly imitate the known boundary conditions and soil properties.           7 .9 .2-1  Watch out for mismatch of units.   
 All finite element models 7-B-1 .1 must  have dead load static reactions verified and boundary  conditions checked for errors. The static dead loads must be compared with hand  results. For example, span member end moment  at calculations 7-B-1 .2 or another program’s      1     3     the supports can be released at the piers to determine simple span reactions. Then hand  calculated simple span dead load or PGsuper dead load and live load is used to verify       1      the model. 7-B-1 .3       
Crossbeam behavior must be checked to ensure the superstructure dead load is    correctly distributing substructure 7-B-1 .4 to    elements. A 3D bridge line model concentrates    the superstructure mass and stresses to a point in the crossbeam. Generally, interior  columns will have a much higher loading than the exterior columns. To improve the  7-B-1 .5A 11  ∆  model, crossbeam Ig should be increased to provide the statically correct column dead load reactions. This may require increasing Ig by about 1000 times. Many times this is not   7-B-1 .5B 33  visible graphically and should be by checking numerical output. Note that most ∆verified

Chapter 7
Substructure Design
finite element programs have the capability of assigning constraints to the crossbeam and superstructure to eliminate the need for increasing the Ig of the crossbeam. Seismic analysis may also be verified by hand calculations. Hand calculated fundamental mode shape reactions will be approximate; but will ensure design forces are of the same magnitude. Designers should note that additional mass might have to be added to the bridge FEM for seismic analysis. For example, traffic barrier mass and crossbeam mass beyond the last column at piers may contribute significant weight to a two-lane or ramp structure.
7.2.5
Deep Foundation Modeling Methods A designer must assume a foundation support condition that best represents the foundation behavior. Deep foundation elements attempt to imitate the non-linear lateral behavior of several soil layers interacting with the deep foundation. The bridge FEM then uses the stiffness of the element to predict the seismic structural response. Models using linear elements that are not based on non-linear soil-structure interaction are generally considered inaccurate for soil response/element stress and are not acceptable. There are three methods used to model deep foundations (FHWA Report No. 1P-87-6). Of these three methods the Bridge and Structures Office prefers Method II for the majority of bridges. 7.2.5.A
Method I – Equivalent Cantilever Column
This method assumes a point of fixity some depth below the bottom of the column to model the stiffness of the foundation element. This shall only be used for a preliminary model of the substructure response in SDC C and D. 7.2.5.B
Method II – Equivalent Base Springs
This method models deep foundations by using a {6x6} matrix. There are two techniques used to generate the stiffness coefficients for the foundation matrix. The equivalent stiffness coefficients assessed are valid only at the given level of loading. Any changes of the shaft-head loads or conditions will require a new run for the program to determine the new values of the equivalent stiffness coefficients. These equivalent stiffness coefficients account for the nonlinear response of shaft materials and soil resistance. Technique I – The matrix is generated, using superposition, to reproduce the non-linear behavior of the soil and foundation at the maximum loading. With Technique I, 10 terms are produced, 4 of these terms are “cross couples.” Soil response programs analyze the non‑linear soil response. The results are then used to determine the equivalent base springs. See Appendix 7-B1 for more information. Technique II – The equivalent stiffness matrix generated using this technique uses only the diagonal elements (no cross coupling stiffnesses). This technique is recommended to construct the foundation stiffness matrix (equivalent base springs). In Technique II the “cross couple” effects are internally accounted for as each stiffness element and displacement is a function of the given Lateral load (P) and Moment (M). Technique II uses the total response (Dt(P,M) qt(P,M)) to determine displacement and equivalent soil stiffness, maintaining a nonlinear analysis. Technique I requires superposition by adding the individual responses due to the lateral load and moment to determine displacement and soil stiffness. Using superposition to combine two nonlinear responses results in errors in displacement and stiffness for the total response as seen in Page 7-16

Substructure Design
Chapter 7
the Figure 7.2.5-1. As illustrated, the total response due to lateral load (P) and moment (M) does not necessarily equal the sum of the individual responses. 7.2.5.C
Method III – Non-Linear Soil Springs
This method attaches non-linear springs along the length of deep foundation members in a FEM model. See Appendix 7-B2 for more information. This method has the advantage of solving the superstructure and substructure seismic response simultaneously. The soil springs must be nonlinear PY curves and represent the soil/structure interaction. This cannot be done during response spectrum analysis with some FEM programs. 7.2.5.D
Spring Location (Method II)
The preferred location for a foundation spring is at the bottom of the column. This includes the column mass in the seismic analysis. For design, the column forces are provided by the FEM and the soil response program provides the foundation forces. Springs may be located at the top of the column. However, the seismic analysis will not include the mass of the columns. The advantage of this location is the soil/structure analysis includes both the column and foundation design forces. Figure 7.2.5-1
Limitations on the Technique I (Superposition Technique)
Designers should be careful to match the geometry of the FEM and soil response program. If the location of the foundation springs (or node) in the FEM does not match the location input to the soil response program, the two programs will not converge correctly.

Chapter 7
Substructure Design
7.2.5.E
Boundary Conditions (Method II)
To calculate spring coefficients, the designer must first identify the predicted shape, or direction of loading, of the foundation member where the spring is located in the bridge model. This will determine if one or a combination of two boundary conditions apply for the transverse and longitudinal directions of a support. A fixed head boundary condition occurs when the foundation element is in double curvature where translation without rotation is the dominant behavior. Stated in other terms, the shear causes deflection in the opposite direction of applied moment. This is a common assumption applied to both directions of a rectangular pile group in a pile supported footing. A free head boundary condition is when the foundation element is in single curvature where translation and rotation is the dominant behavior. Stated in other terms, the shear causes deflection in the same direction as the applied moment. Most large diameter shaft designs will have a single curvature below ground line and require a free head assumption. The classic example of single curvature is a single column on a single shaft. In the transverse direction, this will act like a flagpole in the wind, or free head. What is not so obvious is the same shaft will also have single curvature in the longitudinal direction (below the ground line), even though the column exhibits some double curvature behavior. Likewise, in the transverse direction of multi-column piers, the columns will have double curvature (frame action). The shafts will generally have single curvature below grade and the free head boundary condition applies. The boundary condition for large shafts with springs placed at the ground line will be free head in most cases. The key to determine the correct boundary condition is to resolve the correct sign of the moment and shear at the top of the shaft (or point of interest for the spring location). Since multi-mode results are always positive (CQC), this can be worked out by observing the seismic moment and shear diagrams for the structure. If the sign convention is still unclear, apply a unit load in a separate static FEM run to establish sign convention at the point of interest. The correct boundary condition is critical to the seismic response analysis. For any type of soil and a given foundation loading, a fixed boundary condition will generally provide soil springs four to five times stiffer than a free head boundary condition. 7.2.5.F
Spring Calculation (Method II)
The first step to calculate a foundation spring is to determine the shear and moment in the structural member where the spring is to be applied in the FEM. Foundation spring coefficients should be based on the maximum shear and moment from the applied longitudinal or transverse seismic loading. The combined load case (1.0L and 0.3T) shall be assumed for the design of structural members, and NOT applied to determine foundation response. For the simple case of a bridge with no skew, the longitudinal shear and moment are the result of the seismic longitudinal load, and the transverse components are ignored. This is somewhat unclear for highly skewed piers or curved structures with rotated springs, but the principle remains the same.

Matrix Coordinate Systems (Method II)
The Global coordinate systems used to demonstrate matrix theory are usually similar to the system defined for substructure loads in Section 7.1.3, and is shown in Figure 7.2.5-2. This is also the default Global coordinate system of GT STRUDL. This coordinate system applies to this Section to establish the sign convention for matrix terms. Note vertical axial load is labeled as P, and horizontal shear load is labeled as V. Also note the default Global coordinate system in CSI BRIDGE uses Z as the vertical axis (gravity axis). When imputing spring values in CSI BRIDGE the coefficients in the stiffness matrix will need to be adjusted accordingly. CSI BRIDGE allows you to assign spring stiffness values to support joints. By default, only the diagonal terms of the stiffness matrix can be assigned, but when selecting the advanced option, terms to a symmetrical {6x6} matrix can be assigned. Figure 7.2.5-2

Matrix Coefficient Definitions (Method II)
The stiffness matrix containing the spring values and using the standard coordinate system is shown in Figure 7.2.5-3. (Note that cross-couple terms generated using Technique I are omitted). For a description of the matrix generated using Technique I see Appendix 7-B1. The coefficients in the stiffness matrix are generally referred to using several different terms. Coefficients, spring or spring value are equivalent terms. Lateral springs are springs that resist lateral forces. Vertical springs resist vertical forces.

Where the linear spring constants or K values are defined as follows, using the Global Coordinates: K11 = Longitudinal Lateral Stiffness (kip/in) K22 = Vertical or Axial Stiffness (kip/in) K33 = Transverse Lateral Stiffness (kip/in) K44 = Transverse Bending or Moment Stiffness (kip-in/rad) K55 = Torsional Stiffness (kip-in/rad) K66 = Longitudinal Bending or Moment Stiffness (kip-in/rad) The linear lateral spring constants along the diagonal represent a point on a non-linear soil/structure response curve. The springs are only accurate for the applied loading and less accurate for other loadings. This is considered acceptable for Strength and Extreme Event design. For calculation of spring constants for Technique I see Appendix 7-B1. 7.2.5.I
Group Effects When a foundation analysis uses LPILE or an analysis using PY relationships, group effects will require the geotechnical properties to be reduced before the spring values are calculated. The geotechnical report will provide transverse and longitudinal multipliers that are applied to the PY curves. This will reduce the pile resistance in a linear fashion. The reduction factors for lateral resistance due to the interaction of deep foundation members is provided in the Geotechnical Design Manual Section 8.12.2.3.
7.2.5.J
Shaft Caps and Pile Footings
Where pile supported footings or shaft caps are entirely below grade, their passive resistance should be utilized. In areas prone to scour or lateral spreading, their passive resistance should be neglected.

Lateral Analysis of Piles and Shafts 7.2.6.A
Determination of Tip Elevations
Lateral analysis of piles and shafts involves determination of a shaft or pile tip location sufficient to resist lateral loads in both orthogonal directions. In many cases, the shaft or pile tip depth required to resist lateral loads may be deeper than that required for bearing or uplift. However, a good starting point for a tip elevation is the depth required for bearing or uplift. Another good “rule-of-thumb” starting point for shaft tips is an embedment depth of 6 diameters (6D) to 8 diameters (8D). Refer also to the geotechnical report minimum tip elevations provided by the Geotechnical Engineer. A parametric study or analysis should be performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the depth of the shaft or pile to the displacement of the structure (i.e. the displacement of the shaft or pile head) in order to determine the depth required for stable, proportionate lateral response of the structure. Determination of shaft or pile tip location requires engineering judgment, and consideration should be given to the type of soil, the confidence in the soil data (proximity of soil borings) and the potential variability in the soil profile. Arbitrarily deepening shaft or pile tips may be conservative but can also have significant impact on constructability and cost.

The following is a suggested approach for determining appropriate shaft or pile tip elevations that are located in soils. Other considerations will need to be considered when shaft or pile tips are located in rock, such as the strength of the rock. This approach is based on the displacement demand seismic design procedures specified in the AASHTO Seismic Specifications. 1.
Size columns and determine column reinforcement requirements for Strength and Service load cases.
2.
Determine the column plastic over-strength moment and shear at the base of the column using the axial dead load and expected column material properties. A program such as XTRACT or CSI BRIDGE may be used to help compute these capacities. The plastic moments and shears are good initial loads to apply to a soil response program. In some cases, Strength or other Extreme event loads may be a more appropriate load to apply in the lateral analysis. For example, in eastern Washington seismic demands are relatively low and elastic seismic or Strength demands may control.
3.
Perform lateral analysis using the appropriate soil data from the Geotechnical report for the given shaft or pile location. If final soil data is not yet available, consult with the Geotechnical Engineer for preliminary values to use for the site. Note: Early in the lateral analysis it is wise to obtain moment and shear demands in the shaft or pile and check that reasonable reinforcing ratios can be used to resist the demands. If not, consider resizing the foundation elements and restart the lateral analysis.
4.
Develop a plot of embedment depth of shaft or pile versus lateral deflection of the top of shaft or pile. The minimum depth, or starting point, shall be the depth required for bearing or uplift or as specified by the geotechnical report. An example plot of an 8′ diameter shaft is shown in Figure 7.2.6-1 and illustrates the sensitivity of the lateral deflections versus embedment depth. Notice that at tip depths of approximately 50′ (roughly 6D) the shaft head deflections begin to increase substantially with small reductions in embedment depth. The plot also clearly illustrates that tip embedment below 70′ has no impact on the shaft head lateral deflection.

From the plot of embedment depth versus lateral deflection, choose the appropriate tip elevation. In the example plot in Figure 7.2.6-1, the engineer should consider a tip elevation to the left of the dashed vertical line drawn in the Figure. The final tip elevation would depend on the confidence in the soil data and the tolerance of the structural design displacement. For example, if the site is prone to variability in soil layers, the engineer should consider deepening the tip; say 1 to 3 diameters, to ensure that embedment into the desired soil layer is achieved. The tip elevation would also depend on the acceptable lateral displacement of the structure. To assess the potential variability in the soil layers, the Geotechnical Engineer assigned to the project should be consulted. Figure 7.2.6-1

With the selected tip elevation, review the deflected shape of the shaft or pile, which can be plotted in LPILE. Examples are shown in Figure 7.2.6-2. Depending on the size and stiffness of the shaft or pile and the soil properties, a variety of deflected shapes are possible, ranging from a rigid body (fence post) type shape to a long slender deflected shape with 2 or more inflection points. Review the tip deflections to ensure they are reasonable, particularly with rigid body type deflected shapes. Any of the shapes in the Figure may be acceptable, but again it will depend on the lateral deflection the structure can tolerate.

The engineer will also need to consider whether liquefiable soils are present and/ or if the shaft or pile is within a zone where significant scour can occur. In this case the analysis needs to be bracketed to envelope various scenarios. It is likely that a liquefiable or scour condition case may control deflection. When scour is considered with the Extreme Event I limit state, the soil resistance of the upper 50 percent of the scour depth for the design flood scour shall be deducted from the lateral analysis of the pile or shaft. In all cases where scour conditions are anticipated at the bridge site or specific pier locations, the Geotechnical Engineer and the Hydraulics Office shall be consulted. If liquefaction can occur, the bridge shall be analyzed using both the static and liquefied soil conditions. The analysis using the liquefied soils would typically yield the maximum bridge deflections and will likely control the required tip elevation, whereas the static soil conditions may control for strength design of the shaft or pile. Lateral spreading is a special case of liquefied soils, in which lateral movement of the soil occurs adjacent to a shaft or pile located on or near a slope. Refer to the Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03 for discussion on lateral spreading. Lateral loads will need to be applied to the shaft or pile to account for lateral movement of the soil. There is much debate as to the timing of the lateral movement of the soil and whether horizontal loads from lateral spread should be combined with maximum seismic inertia loads from the structure. Most coupled analyses are 2D, and do not take credit for lateral flow around shafts, which can be quite conservative. The AASHTO Seismic Specifications permits these loads to be uncoupled; however, the Geotechnical Engineer shall be consulted for recommendations on the magnitude and combination of loads. See Geotechnical Design Manual Sections 6.4.2.7 and 6.5.4 for additional guidance on combining loads when lateral spreading can occur. 7.2.6.B
Pile and Shaft Design for Lateral Loads
The previous section provides guidelines for establishing tip elevations for shafts and piles. Sensitivity analysis that incorporate both foundation and superstructure kinematics are often required to identify the soil conditions and loadings that will control the tip, especially if liquefied or scoured soil conditions are present. Several conditions will also need to be analyzed when designing the reinforcement for shafts and piles to ensure the controlling case is identified. All applicable strength, service and extreme load cases shall be applied to each condition. A list of these conditions includes, but is not limited to the following: 1.
Static soil properties with both stiff and soft shaft or pile properties. Refer to Sections 7.2.3(B) and 7.2.3(C) for guidelines on computing stiff and soft shaft or pile properties.
2.
Dynamic or degraded soil properties with both stiff and soft shaft or pile properties.
3.
Liquefied soil properties with both stiff and soft shaft or pile properties. A. When lateral spreading is possible, an additional loading condition will need to be analyzed. The Geotechnical Engineer shall be consulted for guidance on the magnitude of seismic load to be applied in conjunction with lateral spreading loads. See Geotechnical Design Manual Sections 6.4.2.7 and 6.5.4 for additional guidance on combining loads when lateral spreading can occur.

Scour condition with stiff and soft shaft or pile properties. If scour is considered with the Extreme Event I limit state, the analysis should be conducted assuming that the soil in the upper 50 percent of the total scour for design flood has been removed to determine the available soil resistance for the analysis of the pile or shaft. Note: Often, the highest acceleration the bridge sees is in the first cycles of the earthquake, and degradation and/or liquefaction of the soil tends to occur toward the middle or end of the earthquake. Therefore, early in the earthquake, loads are high, soil-structure stiffness is high, and deflections are low. Later in the earthquake, the soil-structure stiffness is lower and deflections higher. This phenomenon is normally addressed by bracketing the analyses as discussed above. However, in some cases a site specific procedure may be required to develop a site specific design response spectrum. A site specific procedure may result in a reduced design response spectrum when compared to the general method specified in the AASHTO Seismic 3.4. Section 3.4 requires the use of spectral response parameters determined using USGS/AASHTO Seismic Hazard Maps. The AASHTO Seismic Specifications limits the reduced site specific response spectrum to two-thirds of what is produced using the general method. Refer to the Geotechnical Design Manual Chapter 6 for further discussion and consult the Geotechnical Engineer for guidance.
Refer to Section 7.8 Shafts and Chapter 4 for additional guidance/requirements on design and detailing of shafts and Section 7.9 Piles and Piling and Chapter 4 for additional guidance/requirements on design and detailing of piles.

Spread Footing Modeling For a first trial footing configuration, Strength column moments or column plastic hinging moments may be applied to generate footing dimensions. Soil spring constants are developed using the footing plan area, thickness, embedment depth, Poisson’s ratio ν, and shear modulus G. The Geotechnical Branch will provide the appropriate Poisson’s ratio and shear modulus. Spring constants for shallow rectangular footings are obtained using the following equations developed for rectangular footings.

Column Design
7.3.1
General Design Considerations The preliminary plan stage determines the initial column size, column spacing, and bridge span length based on a preliminary analysis. Columns are spaced to give maximum structural benefit except where aesthetic considerations dictate otherwise. Piers normally are spaced to meet the geometric and aesthetic requirements of the site and to give maximum economy for the total structure. Good preliminary engineering judgment results in maximum economy for the total structure. The designer may make changes after the preliminary plan stage. The Design Unit Manager will need to review all changes, and if the changes are more than minor dimension adjustments, the Bridge Project Support Engineer and the State Bridge and Structures Architect will also need to be involved in the review. Tall piers spaced farther apart aesthetically justify longer spans. Difficult and expensive foundation conditions will also justify longer spans. Span lengths may change in the design stage if substantial structural improvement and/or cost savings can be realized. The designer should discuss the possibilities of span lengths or skew with the Design Unit Manager as soon as possible. Changes in pier spacing at this stage can have significant negative impacts to the geotechnical investigation. Column spacing should minimize column dead load moments. Multiple columns are better suited for handling lateral loads due to wind and/or earthquake. The designer may alter column size or spacing for structural reasons or change from a single-column pier to a multicolumn pier. Columns should be designed so that construction is as simple and repetitive as possible. The diameter of circular columns should be a multiple of one foot; however increments of 6 inches may be appropriate in some cases. Rectangular sections shall have lengths and widths that are multiples of 3 inches. Long rectangular columns are often tapered to reduce the amount of column reinforcement required for strength. Tapers should be linear for ease of construction. For long columns, it may be advantageous to reduce the amount of reinforcement as the applied loads decrease along the column. In these cases, load combinations need to be generated at the locations where the reinforcement is reduced. Bridge plans shall show column construction joints at the top of footing or pedestal and at the bottom of crossbeam. Optional construction joints with roughened surfaces should be provided at approximately 30-foot vertical spacing.
7.3.2
Slenderness Effects This section supplements and clarifies AASHTO LRFD. The goal of a slenderness analysis is to estimate the additional bending moments in the columns that are developed due to axial loads acting upon a deflected structure. Two primary analysis methods exist: the moment magnifier method and the second-order analysis. The designer must decide which method to use based upon the slenderness ratio (kLu/r) of the column(s). Figure 7.3.2-1 below illustrates the basic steps in the column design process for evaluating the effects of slenderness on columns and methods for computing magnification of moments on columns.

Moment Magnification Method
The moment magnification method is described in AASHTO LRFD Section 4.5.3.2.2. In general, if magnification factors computed using the AASHTO LRFD are found to exceed Column Design Flowchart for Non-Seismic Design about 1.4, then a second-order analysisFigure may yield substantial benefits. 7.3.3-1 In a member with loads applied at the joints, any significant lateral deflection indicated the member is unbraced. The usual practice is to consider the pier columns as unbraced in the transverse direction. The superstructure engages girder stops at the abutment and resists lateral sidesway due to axial loads. However, pier lateral deflections are significant and are considered unbraced. Short spanned bridges may be an exception. Most bridge designs provide longitudinal expansion bearings at the end piers. Intermediate columns are considered unbraced because they must resist the longitudinal loading. The only time a column is braced in the longitudinal direction is when a framed bracing member does not let the column displace more than L/1500. L is the total column length. In this case, the bracing member must be designed to take all of the horizontal forces.

Second-Order Analysis
A second-order analysis that includes the influence of loads acting on the deflected structure is required under certain circumstances, and may be advisable in others. It can lead to substantial economy in the final design of many structures. Computations of effective length factors, k, and buckling loads, Pc, are not required for a second-order analysis, though they may be helpful in establishing the need for such an analysis. The designer should discuss the situation with the Design Unit Manager before proceeding with the analysis. The ACI Building Code (ACI 318-08), should be consulted when carrying out a second-order analysis. 7.3.2.B.1
Design Methods for a Second-Order Analysis
For columns framed together, the entire frame should be analyzed as a unit. Analyzing individual columns result in overly conservative designs for some columns and nonconservative results for others. The preferred method for performing a second-order analysis of an entire frame or isolated single columns is to use a nonlinear finite element program with appropriate stiffness and restraint assumptions. The factored group loads are applied to the frame, including the self-weight of the columns. The model is then analyzed using the nonlinear option. The final design moments are obtained directly from the analysis. PD moments are added to the applied moments using an iterative process until stability is reached. The deflections should converge within 5 percent of the total deflection. Analysis must include the effect of the column weight; therefore, the axial dead load must 7 .2 .3-1          1  be adjusted as follows: 7 .3 .6-1

Column Reinforcement 7.3.5.A
Reinforcing Bar Material
Steel reinforcing bars for all bridge substructure elements (precast and cast-in-place) shall be in accordance with Section 5.1.2. 7.3.5.B
Longitudinal Reinforcement
The reinforcement ratio is the steel area divided by the gross area of the section (As/ Ag). The maximum reinforcement ratio shall be 0.04 in SDCs A, B, C and D. The minimum reinforcement ratio shall be 0.007 for SDC A, B, and C and shall be 0.01 for SDC D. For bridges in SDC A, if oversized columns are used for architectural reasons, the minimum reinforcement ratio of the gross section may be reduced to 0.005, provided all loads can be carried on a reduced section with similar shape and the reinforcement ratio of the reduced section is equal to or greater than 0.01 and 0.133ƒ′c/ƒy. The column dimensions are to be reduced by the same ratio to obtain the similar shape. The reinforcement shall be evenly distributed and symmetric within the column. 7.3.5.C
Longitudinal Splices
In general, no splices are allowed when the required length of longitudinal reinforcement is less than the conventional mill length (typically 60-feet). Splicing of longitudinal reinforcement shall be outside the plastic hinge regions. But in SDC A, splices need only be located a minimum of 1.5 times the column diameter from the top and bottom of the column. The bridge plans shall clearly identify the limits of the permissible splice zone. Figure 7.3.5-1 shows standard column reinforcement details. For bridges in SDC’s A and B, no lap splices shall be used for #14 or #18 bars. Either lap or mechanical splices may be used for #11 bars and smaller. Lap splices shall be detailed as Class B splices. The smaller bars in the splice determine the length of lap splice required. When space is limited, #11 bars and smaller can use welded splices, an approved mechanical butt splice, or the upper bars can be bent inward (deformed by double bending) to lie inside and parallel to the lower bars. The spacing of the transverse reinforcement over the length of a lap splice shall not exceed 4-inches or one-quarter of the minimum member dimension. For bridge in SDC’s C and D, bars shall be spliced using mechanical splices meeting the requirements of Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(24)F. Splices shall be staggered. The distance between splices of adjacent bars shall be greater than the maximum of 20 bar diameters or 24-inches.

Crossbeams
Development of longitudinal reinforcement shall be in accordance with AASHTO Seismic, Sections 8.8.4 and 8.8.8 and AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.8.2.1. Column longitudinal reinforcement shall be extended into crossbeams as close as practically possible to the opposite face of the crossbeam (below the bridge deck reinforcement). For precast prestressed concrete girder bridges in SDC A and B with fixed diaphragms at intermediate piers, column longitudinal reinforcement may be terminated at top of lower crossbeam, provided that adequate transfer of column forces is provided. For precast prestressed concrete girder bridges in SDC C and D with two-stage fixed diaphragms at intermediate piers, all column longitudinal reinforcement should extend to the top of the cast-in-place concrete diaphragm (upper crossbeam) above the lower crossbeam. Careful attention should be given that column reinforcement does not interfere with extended strands projecting from the end of the prestressed concrete girders. In case of interference, column longitudinal reinforcement obstructing the Page 7-34

extended strands may be terminated at top of the lower crossbeam, and shall be replaced with equivalent full-height stirrups extending from the lower to upper crossbeam within the effective width as shown in Figure 7.3.5-2. All stirrups within the effective zone, based on an approximate strut-and-tie model, may be used for this purpose. The effective zone shall be taken as column diameter plus depth of lower crossbeam provided that straight column bars are adequately developed into the lower crossbeam. The effective zone may be increased to the column diameter plus two times depth of lower crossbeam if headed bars are used for column longitudinal reinforcement. If the depth of lower crossbeam is less than 1.25 times the tension development length required for column reinforcement, headed bars shall be used. Heads on column bars terminated in the lower crossbeam are preferable from a structural perspective. However, extra care in detailing during design and extra care in placement of the column reinforcement during construction is required. Typically the heads on the column bars will be placed below the lower crossbeam top mat of reinforcement. Headed reinforcement shall conform to the requirements of ASTM 970 Class HA. Transverse column reinforcement only needs to extend to the top of the lower crossbeam just below the top longitudinal steel. However, when the joint shear principal tension is less than 0.11√f’c, minimum cross tie reinforcement shall be placed acting across the upper cross beam in accordance with the AASHTO Seismic, Sections 8.13.3. The minimum cross tie reinforcement shall provide at least as much confining pressure at yield as the column spiral can provide at yield. This pressure may be calculated assuming hydrostatic conditions. If the joint shear principal tension exceeds 0.11√f’c, then additional joint reinforcement as outlined by AASHTO Seismic, Sections 8.13.3 shall be provided. With the exception of J-bars, the additional reinforcement shall be placed in the upper and lower crossbeam. The cross tie reinforcement may be placed with a lap splice in the center of the joint. Large columns or columns with high longitudinal reinforcement ratios may result in closely spaced stirrups with little clear space left for proper concrete consolidation outside the reinforcement. In such cases, either hanger reinforcement comprised of larger bars with headed anchors may be used in the effective zone shown in Figure 7.3.5-2 or supplemental stirrups may be placed beyond the effective zone. Hanger reinforcement in the effective zone is preferred. The designer is encouraged to include interference detail/plan views of the crossbeam reinforcement in relation to the column steel in the contract drawings. Suggested plans include the views at the lower stage crossbeam top reinforcement and the upper crossbeam top reinforcement.

Footings
Longitudinal reinforcement at the bottom of a column should extend into the footing and rest on the bottom mat of footing reinforcement with standard 90° hooks. In addition, development of longitudinal reinforcement shall be in accordance with AASHTO Seismic, Section 8.8.4 and AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.8.2.1. Headed bars may be used for longitudinal reinforcement at the bottom of columns. The head shall be placed at least 3-inches below the footing bottom mat reinforcement. This may require the footing to be locally thickened in the region of the column to provide cover for the bottom of the headed bars. The head of the rebar placed below the footing bottom reinforcement mat shall not contribute to the compressive capacity of the rebar. Figure 7.3.5-2

Shafts
Column longitudinal reinforcement in shafts is typically straight. Embedment shall be a minimum length equal to lns = ls + s (per TRAC Report WA- RD 417.1 titled “Noncontact Lap Splices in Bridge Column-Shaft Connections”). Where: ls = the larger of 1.7 × lac or 1.7 × ld lac = development length from the AASHTO Seismic 8.8.4 for the column longitudinal reinforcement. ld = tension development length from AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.8.2.1 for the column longitudinal reinforcement. s = distance between the shaft and column longitudinal reinforcement
The requirements of the AASHTO Seismic, Section 8.8.10 for development length of column bars extended into oversized pile shafts for SDC C and D shall not be used. The factor of 1.7 used in determining ls represents a Class C lap splice modification factor from previous versions of AASHTO LRFD. Although the concept of a Class C splice is no longer applicable, the factor is still necessary to match the recommendations of TRAC Report WA-RD 417.1. The modification factor in Section 5.10.8.2.1 that allows ld to be decreased by the ratio of (As required)/(As provided), shall not be used. Using this modification factor would imply that the reinforcement does not need to yield to carry the ultimate design load. This may be true in other areas. However, our shaft/column connections are designed to form a plastic hinge, and therefore the reinforcement shall have adequate development length to allow the bars to yield. See Figure 7.3.5-3 for an example of longitudinal development into shafts. Longitudinal Development Into Shafts

Transverse Reinforcement
All transverse reinforcement in columns shall be deformed. Although allowed in the AASHTO LRFD, plain bars or plain wire may not be used for transverse reinforcement. Columns in SDC A may use spirals, circular hoops, or rectangular hoops and crossties. Spirals are the preferred confinement reinforcement and shall be used whenever a #6 spiral is sufficient to satisfy demands. When demands require reinforcement bars greater than #6, circular hoops of #7 through #9 may be used. Bundled spirals shall not be used for columns or shafts. Also, mixing of spirals and hoops within the same column is not permitted by the AASHTO Seismic Specifications. Figure 7.3.5-4 and 7.3.5-5 show transverse reinforcement details for rectangular columns in high and low seismic zones, respectively. Columns in SDCs C and D shall use hoop reinforcement. Hoop reinforcement shall be circular where possible, although rectangular hoops with ties may be used when large, odd shaped column sections are required. Where the column diameter is 3-feet or less, the WSDOT Steel Specialist shall be contacted regarding the constructability of smaller diameter welded hoops. When rectangular hoops with ties are used, consideration shall be given to column constructability. Such considerations can include, but are not limited to a minimum of 2′6″ by 3′-0″ open rectangle to allow access for the tremie tube and construction workers for concrete placement, in-form access hatches, and/or external vibrating. A larger gap between transverse reinforcement should be provided at the top of columns to allow space for the crossbeam longitudinal reinforcement to pass. In SDC’s C & D, the gap shall not exceed the maximum spacing for lateral reinforcement in plastic hinge regions specified in AASHTO Seismic, Section 8.8.9. This can be of particular concern in bridge decks with large superelevation cross slopes.

Spiral Splices and Hoops
Welded laps shall be used for splicing and terminating spirals and shall conform to the details shown in Figure 7.3.5-6. Only single sided welds shall be used, which is the preferred method in construction. Spirals or butt- welded hoops are required for plastic hinge zones of columns. Lap spliced hoops are not permitted in columns in any region. Although hooked lap splices are structurally acceptable, and permissible by AASHTO LRFD for spirals or circular hoops, they shall not be allowed due to construction challenges. While placing concrete, tremies get caught in the protruding hooks, making accessibility to all areas and its withdrawal cumbersome. It is also extremely difficult to bend the hooks through the column cage into the core of the column. When welded hoops are used, the plans shall show a staggered pattern around the perimeter of the column so that no two adjacent welded splices are located at the same location. Also, where interlocking hoops are used in rectangular or non- circular columns, the splices shall be located in the column interior. Circular hoops for columns shall be shop fabricated using a manual direct butt weld or resistance butt weld. Currently, a Bridge Special Provision has been developed to cover the fabrication requirements of hoops for columns and shafts, which may eventually be included in the Standard Specifications. Manual direct butt welded hoops require radiographic nondestructive examination (RT), which may result in this option being cost prohibitive at large quantities. Columns with circular hoop reinforcement shall have a minimum 2” concrete cover to the hoops to accommodate resistance butt weld “weld flash” that can extend up to ½” from the bar surface. Field welded lap splices and termination welds of spirals of any size bar are not permitted in the plastic hinge region including a zone extending 2’-0” into the connected member and should be clearly designated on the contract plans. If spirals are welded while in place around longitudinal steel reinforcement, there is a chance that an arc can occur between the spiral and longitudinal bar. The arc can create a notch that can act as a stress riser and may cause premature failure of the longitudinal bar when stressed beyond yield. Because high strains in the longitudinal reinforcement can penetrate into the connected member, welding is restricted in the first 2’-0” of the connected member as well. It would acceptable to field weld lap splices of spirals off to the side of the column and then slide into place over the longitudinal reinforcement.

Reduced Column Section Reduced column sections decrease overstrength plastic demands into the foundation. Traditional column designs are preferred over this detail, but this may be used if it is determined that traditional details will not satisfy the design code requirements due to architectural, balanced stiffness, or other project specific requirements. The reduction at the base of the column shall be designed as described below and detailed as shown in Figure 7.3.7-1. The concept is shown in Figure 7.3.7-1 for a spread footing foundation, but could be used for shaft and pile supported foundations also. Similar checks are required if the reduced section is placed at the crossbeam, along with any additional checks required for those sections. One such additional check is joint shear in the crossbeam based on the overstrength plastic capacity of the reduced column section. The design and detail at the top of columns, for architectural flares, is similar.

Gap in Concrete at Reduced Column Section
The gap shall be minimized, but shall not be less than 2″. It shall also be designed to accommodate the larger of 1.5 times the calculated service, strength or extreme event elastic rotation demand or the plastic rotation capacity, as determined from an inelastic pushover analysis. In no loading condition shall the edge of the larger column section contact the footing. The gap shall be constructed with a material sufficiently strong to support the wet concrete condition. The material in the gap must keep soil or debris out of the gap for the life of the structure. This is especially important if the gap is to be buried and inspection access is difficult. If a filler material is used in this gap which can transfer compressive forces, then the gap shall be increased to account for this compressive force. If a filler material can meet construction and service requirements, it can be left in place after construction. Otherwise the gap shall be cleared and covered, or the gap shall be filled with a material that meets the service requirements. See Figure 7.3.7-2.

Crossbeams
7.4.1
General Design The following is the recommended procedure for strength design and load rating of a two-stage, integral, non-prestressed crossbeam at multicolumn intermediate piers supporting precast superstructures. The procedure is based on beam theory for a tensioncontrolled element, which is an acceptable method for design and load rating. The strut and tie method is also an acceptable procedure. 7.4.1.A 1.
Stage I Design Obtain load effects on the lower stage I crossbeam. The dead loads on the crossbeam typically include the self-weight of the lower crossbeam, girders, diaphragms, bridge deck, and the dead load from the upper stage II portion of the crossbeam. Additionally:
• A construction load equal to 15 psf over the entire deck area shall be included in the Strength I and III load combinations. This construction load is intended to account for formwork, work decks, miscellaneous materials and equipment, and any construction related live loads (Bidwell finishing machine, etc.). The load factor for the construction load shall be in accordance with Section 3.6.
• Strength IV, which is the load combination relating to very high dead load to live load force effects, need not be considered for this condition as clarified in the 7th Edition of the AASTHO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications.
• Torsion due to unbalanced loading on the stage I crossbeam shall be considered. The unbalanced cases shall include at a minimum, the case where all girders are set on one side of the pier and the case where all girders are in place on both sides but the deck is only placed on one side of the pier.

Design the transverse reinforcement in the lower crossbeam considering the controlling strength shear demands, including the construction load previously described. Only the transverse reinforcement that is fully enclosed and anchored within the stage I crossbeam shall be considered to be effective.

This is a simplified procedure assuming the entire full depth crossbeam is cast monolithic, and it may imply some load redistribution.

A special case of two stage integral crossbeam is the single column “hammer head” type crossbeams. A similar methodology can be employed for these crossbeams. The top flexural reinforcement in the stage I section is designed for the applicable stage I loads. In the stage II analysis, the stage I and stage II loads are applied to the full depth section and the top reinforcement in the full depth composite section shall be designed for the total stage I and II demands. The stage I top reinforcement can be considered in the stage II analysis, although it may not be very effective. The section can be considered rectangular or as a “T” section by including deck steel reinforcement within the effective width. Although not discussed here, capacity protection of integral crossbeams will likely control the final design. The analysis should treat the full depth crossbeam as if it was cast monolithic. Various analytical methods can be utilized to obtain the demands in the crossbeam from the column plastic moment and shear, and they shall be determined by the designer. The analysis and design for prestressed girder expansion pier crossbeams and most crossbeams for steel plate and box girder bridges is straightforward and consists of only one stage. All dead and live loads are applied directly to the crossbeam. The designer should consider conditions where torsion may be induced by unbalanced loading during the construction and/or permanent phases. The 15 psf construction load shall not be included with any vehicle live load combinations. Load rating of the integral 2-stage crossbeams shall follow the methods described for the Stage II analysis using the applicable load rating live loads. Page 7-50

Abutment Design and Details
7.5.1
General Bridge abutments support the superstructure and roadway embankment enhancing serviceability of the superstructure, and can potentially enhance seismic response of the bridge. Design of the abutments needs to consider layout and geometry of the abutment, superstructure loads and movements, drainage, approach slab, and seismic effects. Water flow and possible scour need also be considered for bridges crossing waterways. 7.5.1.A
Abutment Types
There are five abutment types described in the following section that have been used by the Bridge and Structures Office. Conventional stub and cantilever abutments on spread footings, piles, or shafts are the preferred abutment type for WSDOT bridges. The representative types are intended for guidance only and may be varied to suit the requirements of the bridge being designed. Significant measures may be required to accommodate bridge security and deter inappropriate access to the bridge abutment areas. Designs may include steel security fences or concrete curtain walls. Configuring the land form at the abutment or increasing the stem wall height to deter access may also be considered. Where required, coordinate with the State Bridge and Structures Architect during final design. 7.5.1.A.1
Stub Abutments
Stub abutments are short abutments where the distance from the girder seat to top of footing is less than approximately 4 feet, see Figure 7.5.1-1. The footing and wall can be considered as a continuous inverted T-beam. The analysis of this type abutment shall include investigation into both bending and shear stresses parallel to centerline of bearing. If the superstructure is relatively deep, earth pressure combined with longitudinal forces from the superstructure may become significant. Figure 7.5.1-1

7.5.1.A.2
Cantilever Abutments
If the height of the wall from the bearing seat down to the bottom of the footing exceeds the clear distance between the girder bearings, the assumed 45° lines of influence from the girder reactions will overlap, and the dead load and live load from the superstructure can be assumed equally distributed over the abutment width. The design may then be carried out on a per-foot basis. The primary structural action takes place normal to the abutment, and the bending moment effect parallel to the abutment may be neglected in most cases. The wall is assumed to be a cantilever member fixed at the top of the footing and subjected to axial, shear, and bending loads see Figure 7.5.1-2. Figure 7.5.1-2

Rigid Frame Abutments
Abutments that are part of a rigid frame are generically shown in Figure 7.5.1-3. At-Rest earth pressures (EH) will apply to these structures. The abutment design should include the live load impact factor from the superstructure. However, impact shall not be included in the footing design. The rigid frame itself should be considered restrained against sidesway for live load only. AASHTO LRFD Chapter 12 addresses loading and analysis of rigid frames that are buried (box Figure culverts). 7.5.1-2 Figure 7.5.1-3

Chapter 7
Bent-Type Abutments
An abutment that includes a bent cap supported on columns or extended piles or shafts is shown in Figure 7.5.1-4. For structural reasons it may be required to construct a complete wall behind a bridge abutment prior to bridge construction. Bent-type abutments may be used where the abutment requires protection from lateral and vertical loads and settlement. This configuration shall only be used with the approval of the WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer for abutments 30 ft or greater in height. It shall not be used where initial construction cost is the only determining incentive. The approach embankment wall shall have a concrete fascia. A bridge approach slab shall span a maximum of 6′-0″ between the back of pavement seat and the face of the approach embankment wall. The approach slab shall be designed as a beam pinned at the back of pavement seat. The approach slab shall support traffic live loads and traffic barrier reactions. The approach embankment wall shall support the vertical live load surcharge. The approach slab shall not transfer loads to the approach embankment wall facing. The minimum gap between the back of the columns, piles, or shafts and the retained structure shall be 2’-0” to allow for inspection access. An enclosing fascia wall is required to prohibit unwanted access with associated public health, maintenance staff safety, and law enforcement problems. The design shall include a concrete fascia enclosing the columns and void. The fascia shall have bridge inspection access on the bridge side of the columns, piles, or shafts. The access door shall be a minimum 3′-6″ square with the sill located 2′-6″ above finished grade. Contact the State Bridge and Structures Architect for configuration and concrete surface treatments. Ventilation shall be incorporated into the design of the enclosed space. There shall be a minimum of two 4 inch diameter air vent openings near the top of the enclosing fascia wall. The air vents shall be spaced approximately 5’-0” apart and shall be on either side of the access door. Air vents shall conform to Figure 5.2.6-2. Design shall be reviewed and approved by the WSDOT State Bridge Preservation Office and the State Bridge and Structures Architect for access and safety requirements. When approved by the State Bridge and Structures Architect, the columns may be located just outside the fascia. In this case, the access criteria of Section 5 shall be followed.

An isolated abutment is an abutment that utilizes a separate retaining system to support the embankment and is shown in Figure 7.5.1-5. The gap between the abutment and the retaining system shall be wide enough to avoid contact of the two isolated structures due to movements caused by earthquakes, but shall not be less than 6 inches. This configuration shall only be used with the approval of the WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer for abutments 30 ft or greater in height. The approach embankment wall does not require a fascia. A curtain wall shall be designed to enclose the gap on the bridge side of the retaining system. This curtain wall is generally attached to the abutment. There shall not be any access designed within the abutment or curtain wall. However, the curtain wall shall have a future blockout location established in the plans. The size of this future blockout shall be a minimum of the gap dimension or 3’-0” square and shall be centered on the gap. Ventilation shall be incorporated into the design of the enclosed space. Access design shall be reviewed and approved by the WSDOT State Bridge Preservation Office and the State Bridge and Structures Architect.

Bridges with spread footing abutments supported by a geosynthetic wall or SE wall
These bridges shall conform to the following requirements, see Figure 7.5.2-3: 1.
Walls shall be 30 feet or less in total height, which includes the retained soil height up to the bottom of the embedded spread footing.
2.
For SE walls, the front edge of the bridge footing shall be placed 4 feet minimum from the back face of the fascia panel. For geosynthetic retaining walls with a wrapped face, the front edge of the bridge footing shall be placed 2 feet minimum from the back face of the fascia panel.
3.
The abutment footing shall be covered by at least 6 inch of soil for frost protection.
4.
The superstructure of continuous span bridges shall be designed for differential settlement between piers.
5.
Abutment spread footings shall be designed for bearing pressure at service loads not to exceed 2.0 TSF and factored load at strength and extreme limit states not to exceed 3.5 TSF. The bearing pressure may be increased to 3.0 TSF at service loads and 4.5 TSF at strength and extreme limit states if a vertical settlement monitoring program is conducted in accordance with the Geotechnical Design Manual Section 15.5.3.5.
6.
Walls supporting abutments shall be special designed wall systems, and shall conform to GDM Section 15.5.3.5 MSE Wall Supported Abutments. Additionally, the top 3 rows of dry-cast modular concrete blocks shall be grouted with #4 rebar.
7.
Concrete slope protection shall be provided. Fall protection shall be provided in accordance with Design Manual Chapter 730.
8.
The presence of a landform shelf beneath the superstructure between the abutment face and top of wall may constitute an attractive nuisance. Limiting access to this area per BDM Chapter 2.8, may also be required. Where required, coordinate with the State Bridge and Structures Architect for bridge security issues.
Deviations from the design requirements require approval from the State Bridge Design Engineer and the State Geotechnical Engineer.

At the ends of the abutment, the fill may be contained with wing walls or in the case of concrete structures, placed against the exterior girders. The minimum clearance between the bottom of the superstructure and the embankment below shall be 3’-0” for girder bridges and 5’-0” for non-girder, slab, and box girder bridges. The presence of a horizontal landform shelf beneath the superstructure at the abutment face may constitute an attractive nuisance. Limiting access to superstructure, by increasing the stem wall height, may also be required. Where required, coordinate with the State Bridge and Structures Architect for bridge security issues.

Chapter 7
Abutment Loading In general, bridge abutment loading shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Chapter 3 and 11. The following simplifications and assumptions may be applied to the abutment design. See Section 7.7.4 for a force diagram of typical loads as they are applied to an abutment spread footing. 7.5.4.A
Dead Load - DC
Approach slab dead load reaction taken as 2 kips/foot of wall applied at the pavement seat. 7.5.4.B
Live Load - LL
Live load impact does not apply to the abutment. For bridge approach slab live load assumptions, see Section 10.6. If bridge approach slabs are not to be constructed in the project (e.g. bride approach slab details are not included in the bridge sheets of the Plans) a live load surcharge (LS) applies. 7.5.4.C
Earth Pressure - EH, EV
Active earth pressure (EH) and the unit weight of backfill on the heel and toe (EV) will be provided in a geotechnical report. The toe fill shall be included in the analysis for overturning if it adds to overturning. Passive earth pressure resistance (EH) in front of a footing may not be dependable due to potential for erosion, scour, or future excavation. Passive earth pressure may be considered for stability at the strength limit state only below the depth that is not likely to be disturbed over the structure’s life. The Geotechnical Branch should be contacted to determine if passive resistance may be considered. The top two feet of passive earth pressure should be ignored. 7.5.4.D
Earthquake Load - EQ
Seismic superstructure loads shall be transmitted to the substructure through bearings, girder stops or restrainers. As an alternative, the superstructure may be rigidly attached to the substructure. The Extreme Event I load factor for all EQ induced loads shall be 1.0. For bearing pressure and wall stability checks, the seismic inertial force of the abutment, PIR, shall be combined with the seismic lateral earth pressure force, PAE, as described in AASHTO LRFD Section 11.6.5.1. For structural design of the abutment, the seismic inertial force, PIR, shall be combined with the seismic lateral earth pressure force, PAE, as described in AASHTO LRFD Section 11.6.5.1 for stability checks. The inertial force shall include the inertia of the concrete, but need not include the inertia of the soil above the heel. 7.5.4.E
Bearing Forces - TU
For strength design, the bearing shear forces shall be based on ½ of the annual temperature range. This force is applied in the direction that causes the worst case loading. For extreme event load cases, calculate the maximum friction force (when the bearing slips) and apply in the direction that causes the worst case loading.

Temporary Construction Load Cases 7.5.5.A
Superstructure Built after Backfill at Abutment
If the superstructure is to be built after the backfill is placed at the abutments, the resulting temporary loading would be the maximum horizontal force with the minimum vertical force. During the abutment design for all abutment types except bent-type or isolated, a load case shall be considered to check the stability and sliding of abutments after placing backfill but prior to superstructure placement. This load case is intended as a check for a temporary construction stage, and not meant to be a controlling load case that would govern the final design of the abutment and footing. This loading will generally determine the tensile reinforcement in the top of the footing heel. If this load case check is found to be satisfactory, a note shall be added to the general notes in the contract plans and the contractor will not be required to make a submittal requesting approval for early backfill placement. This load case shall include a 2′-0″ deep soil surcharge for the backfill placement equipment (LS) as covered by the Standard Specifications Section 2-03.3(14)I. 7.5.5.B
Wing Wall Overturning
It is usually advantageous in sizing the footing to release the falsework from under the wing walls after some portion of the superstructure load is applied to the abutment. A note can cover this item, when applicable, in the sequence of construction on the plans.
7.5.6
Abutment Bearings and Girder Stops All structures shall be provided with some means of restraint against lateral displacement at the abutments due to temperature, shrinkage, wind, earth pressure, and earthquake loads, etc. Such restraints may be in the form of concrete girder stops with vertical elastomeric pads, concrete hinges, or bearings restrained against movement. All prestressed girder bridges in Western Washington (within and west of the Cascade mountain range) shall have girder stops between all girders at abutments and intermediate expansion piers. This policy is based on fact that the February 28, 2001 Nisqually earthquake caused significant damage to girder stops at bridges where girder stops were not provided between all girders. In cases where girder stops were cast prior to placement of girders and the 3″ grout pads were placed after setting the girders, the 3″ grout pads were severely damaged and displaced from their original position. 7.5.6.A
Abutment Bearings
Longitudinal forces from the superstructure are normally transferred to the abutments through the bearings. The calculated longitudinal movement shall be used to determine the shear force developed by the bearing pads. The shear modulus of Neoprene at 70°F (21°C) shall be used for determining the shear force. However, the force transmitted through a bearing pad shall be limited to that which causes the bearing pad to slip. Normally, the maximum percentage of the vertical load reaction transferred in shear is assumed to be 6 percent for PTFE sliding bearings and 20 percent for elastomeric bearing pads. For semi-integral abutments, the horizontal earth pressure acting on the end diaphragm is transferred through the bearings.
Page 7-62
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Substructure Design
Chapter 7
When the force transmitted through the bearing pads is very large, the designer should consider increasing the bearing pad thickness, using PTFE sliding bearings and/or utilizing the flexibility of the abutment as a means of reducing the horizontal design force. When the flexibility of the abutment is considered, it is intended that a simple approximation of the abutment deformation be made. For semi-integral abutments with overhanging end diaphragms at the Extreme Event, the designer shall consider that longitudinal force may be transmitted through the end diaphragm. If the gap provided is less than the longitudinal displacement demand, assume the end diaphragm is in contact with abutment wall. In this case, the bearing force shall not be added to seismic earth pressure force. 7.5.6.B
Bearing Seats
The bearing seats shall be wide enough to accommodate the size of the bearings used with a minimum edge dimension of 3″ and satisfy the requirements of AASHTO LRFD Section 4.7.4.4. On L abutments, the bearing seat shall be sloped away from the bearings to prevent ponding at the bearings. The superelevation and profile grade of the structure should be considered for drainage protection. Normally, a ¼″ drop across the width of the bearing seat is sufficient. 7.5.6.C
Transverse Girder Stops
Transverse girder stops are required for all abutments in order to transfer lateral loads from the superstructure to the abutment. Abutments shall normally be considered as part of the Earthquake Resisting System (ERS). Girder stops shall be full width between girder flanges except to accommodate bearing replacement requirements as specified in Chapter 9. The girder stop shall be designed to resist loads at the Extreme Limit State for the earthquake loading, Strength loads (wind etc.) and any transverse earth pressure from skewed abutments, etc. Girder stops are designed using shear friction theory and the shear strength resistance factor shall be φs = 0.9. The possibility of torsion combined with horizontal shear when the load does not pass through the centroid of the girder stop shall also be investigated. Transverse stiffness of abutments may be considered in the overall dynamic response of bridge systems on a case-by-case basis upon State Bridge Design Engineer approval as specified in BDM Section 5.2.3. The detail shown in Figure 7.5.6-1 may be used for prestressed girder bridges. Prestressed girders shall be placed in their final position before girder stops are cast to eliminate alignment conflicts between the girders and girder stops. Elastomeric girder stop pads shall run the full length of the girder stop. All girder stops shall provide ⅛″ clearance between the prestressed girder flange and the elastomeric girder stop pad. For skewed bridges with semi-integral or end type A diaphragms, the designer shall evaluate the effects of earth pressure forces on the elastomeric girder stop pads. These pads transfer the skew component of the earth pressure to the abutment without restricting the movement of the superstructure in the direction parallel to centerline. The performance of elastomeric girder stop pads shall be investigated at Service Limit State. In some cases bearing assemblies containing sliding surfaces may be necessary to accommodate large superstructure movements.

The compressibility of abutment expansion joints shall be considered in the design of the abutment when temperature, shrinkage, and earthquake forces may increase the design load. For structures without abutment expansion joints, the earth pressure against the end diaphragm is transmitted through the superstructure.
7.5.8
Open Joint Details Vertical expansion joints extending from the top of footings to the top of the abutment are usually required between abutments and adjacent retaining walls to handle anticipated movements. The expansion joint is normally filled with premolded joint filler which is not water tight. There may be circumstances when this joint must be water tight; ⅛ butyl rubber may be used to cover the joint. The open joint in the barrier shall contain a compression seal to create a watertight joint. Figure 7.5.8-1 shows typical details that may be used. Aesthetic considerations may require that vertical expansion joints between abutments and retaining walls be omitted. This is generally possible if the retaining wall is less than 60 feet long. The footing beneath the joint may be monolithic or cast with a construction joint. In addition, dowel bars may be located across the footing joint parallel to the wall elements to guard against differential settlement or deflection. On semi-integral abutments with overhanging end diaphragms, the open joints must be protected from the fill spilling through the joint. Normally butyl rubber is used to seal the openings. See the end diaphragm details in the Appendices of Chapter 5 for details.

Construction Joints Construction joints should be provided between the footings/caps and stems of abutments. Shear keys shall be provided at vertical construction joints and at any construction joint that requires shear transfer. To simplify construction, vertical construction joints are often necessary, particularly between the abutment and adjacent wing walls. The Standard Specifications cover the size and placement of shear keys. The location of such joints shall be detailed on the plans. Construction joints with roughened surface can be used at locations with horizontal joints. These should be shown on the plans and labeled “Construction Joint With Roughened Surface.” When construction joints are shown in the Plans for the convenience of the Contractor and are not structurally required, they shall be indicated as optional. When construction joints are located within the face of the abutment wall, a pour strip or an architectural reveal should be used for a clean appearance. Details should be shown in the plans.
7.5.10
Abutment Wall Design When the primary structural action is parallel to the superstructure or normal to the abutment face, the wall shall be treated as a column subjected to combined axial load and bending moment. Compressive reinforcement need not be included in the design of cantilever walls, but the possibility of bending moment in the direction of the span as well as towards the backfill shall be considered. A portion of the vertical bars may be cut off where they are no longer needed for stress. 7.5.10.A
General
In general, horizontal reinforcement should be placed outside of vertical reinforcement to facilitate easier placement of reinforcement. 7.5.10.B
Temperature and Shrinkage Reinforcement
AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.6 shall be followed for providing the minimum temperature and shrinkage steel near surfaces of concrete exposed to daily temperature changes and in structural mass concrete. On abutments that are longer than 60′, consideration should be given to have vertical construction joints to minimize shrinkage cracks.

Drainage and Backfilling 3″ diameter weep holes shall be provided in all bridge abutment walls. These shall be located 6″ above the finish ground line at about 12′ on center. In cases where the vertical distance between the top of the footing and the finish groundline is greater than 10′, additional weep holes shall be provided 6″ above the top of the footing. No weep holes are necessary in cantilever wing walls where a wall footing is not used. The details for gravel backfill for wall, underdrain pipe and backfill for drain shall be indicated on the plans. The gravel backfill for wall shall be provided behind all bridge abutments. The underdrain pipe and gravel backfill for drain shall be provided behind all bridge abutments except abutments on fills with a stem wall height of 5′ or less. When retaining walls with footings are attached to the abutment, a blockout may be required for the underdrain pipe outfall. Cooperation between Bridge and Structures Office and the Design PE Office as to the drainage requirements is needed to guarantee proper blockout locations. Underdrain pipe and gravel backfill for drain are not necessary behind cantilever wing walls. A 3′ thickness of gravel backfill for wall behind the cantilever wing walls shall be shown in the plans. The backfill for wall, underdrain pipe and gravel backfill for drain are not included in bridge quantities, the size of the underdrain pipe should not be shown on the bridge plans, as this is a Design PE Office design item and is subject to change during the design phase. Figure 7.5.11-1 illustrates backfill details.

Abutment Wing Walls and Curtain Walls Particular attention should be given to the horizontal reinforcing steel required at fixed corners between abutment and wing/curtain walls. Since wall deflections are zero near the abutment, curtain walls and cantilever wing walls shall assume an at-rest soil pressure. This increased loading can normally be reduced to an Active soil pressure at a distance (from the corner), equal to the average height of the wall under design. At this distance, the wall deflections are assumed large enough to allow the active state soil pressures to be developed. See Geotechnical Design Manual Section 15.4.2.7, “Active, Passive, and At-Rest Pressures.”
7.6.1
Traffic Barrier Loads Traffic barriers shall be rigidly attached to a bridge approach slab that is cantilevered over the top of a wing/curtain wall or Structural Earth wall. The barrier collision load is applied directly to the bridge approach slab. The yield line theory as specified in AASHTO LRFD Appendix A13.3 is primarily for traffic barrier on bridge deck slabs and may not be applicable to traffic barrier on less rigid supports, such as retaining walls.

Footing thickness shall be not less than 1′-6″.
3.
Exterior girder top flanges should be located (at the least) inside the curb line at the end pier.
4.
For skewed bridges, modify the details on the traffic barrier and approach slab sheet so the expansion joint detailing agree. List appropriate manufacturers and model numbers for the expansion joint system. Generally, a 1″ expansion joint with a 1″ open joint in the barrier is shown in the plans, unless the bridge expansion joint design dictates otherwise.
Wing Wall Detailing All wing wall reinforcement should be a vertical grid and not follow a tapered bottom of wall. This allows for the steel to be placed in two layers that fits better with abutment reinforcing.

General Footing Criteria The provisions given in this section pertain to both spread footings and pile supported footings. 7.7.1.A
Minimum Cover and Footing Depth
The geotechnical report may specify a minimum footing depth in order to ensure adequate bearing pressure. Stream crossings may require additional cover depth as protection against scour. The State Hydraulic Engineer shall be consulted on this matter. The end slope on the bridge approach fill is usually set at the preliminary plan stage but affects the depth of footings placed in the fill.

Pedestals
A pedestal is sometimes used as an extension of the footing in order to provide additional depth for shear near the column. Its purpose is to provide adequate structural depth while saving concrete. For proportions of pedestals, see Figure 7.7.1-2. Since additional forming is required to construct pedestals, careful thought must be given to the tradeoff between the cost of the extra forming involved and the cost of additional footing concrete. Also, additional foundation depth may be needed for footing cover. Whenever a pedestal is used, the plans shall note that a construction joint will be permitted between the pedestal and the footing. This construction joint should be indicated as a construction joint with roughened surface. Figure 7.7.1-2

The following Table 7.7.2-1 is a general application of minimum and maximum load factors as they apply to a generic footing design. Footing design must select the maximum or minimum Load Factors for various modes of failure for the Strength and Extreme Event Limit States. The dead load includes the load due to structural components and non-structural attachments (DC), and the dead load of wearing surfaces and utilities (DW). The live load (LL) does not include vehicular dynamic load allowance (IM). Designers are to note, if column design uses magnified moments, then footing design must use magnified column moments.

Geotechnical Report Summary The Geotechnical Branch will evaluate overall bridge site stability. Slope stability normally applies to steep embankments at the abutment. If stability is in question, a maximum service limit state load will be specified in the report. Bridge design will determine the maximum total service load applied to the embankment. The total load must be less than the load specified in the geotechnical report. Based on the foundations required in the Preliminary Plan and structural information available at this stage, the Report provides the following Geotechnical Engineering results. For all design limit states, the total factored footing load must be less than the factored resistance. 7.7.3.A
Bearing Resistance - Service, Strength, and Extreme Event Limit States
The nominal bearing resistance (qn) may be increased or reduced based on previous experience for the given soils. The geotechnical report will contain the following information:
• Nominal bearing resistance (qn) for anticipated effective footing widths, which is the same for the strength and extreme event limit states.
• Service bearing resistance (qser) and amount of assumed settlement.
• Resistance factors for strength and extreme event limit states (fb).
• Embedment depth requirements or footing elevations to obtain the recommended qn.
Spread footings supported on SE walls or geosynthetic walls shall be designed with nominal bearing resistances not to exceed 6.0 ksf at service limit states and 9.0 ksf at strength and extreme event limit states. A vertical settlement monitoring program shall be conducted where nominal bearing resistance exceeds 4.0 ksf at service limit states or 7.0 ksf at strength or extreme event limit states. See GDM Section 15.5.3.5 for additional requirements. 7.7.3.B
Sliding Resistance - Strength and Extreme Event Limit States
The geotechnical report will contain the following information to determine earth loads and the factored sliding resistance (RR = fRn)
• Resistance factors for strength and extreme event limit states (fτ, fep)
• If passive earth pressure (Rep) is reliably mobilized on a footing: ff or Su and s’v, and the depth of soil in front of footing that may be considered to provide passive resistance. 7.7.3.C
Foundation Springs - Extreme Event Limit States
When a structural evaluation of soil response is required for a bridge analysis, the Geotechnical Branch will determine foundation soil/rock shear modulus and Poisson’s ratio (G and µ). These values will typically be determined for shear strain levels of 2 to 0.2 percent, which are typical strain levels for large magnitude earthquakes.

Spread Footing Design The following section is oriented toward abutment spread footing design. Spread footing designs for intermediate piers or other applications use the same concepts with the appropriate structural analysis. Structural designers should complete all design checks before consulting with the Geotechnical Engineer about any design problem. There may be several problem criteria that should be addressed in the solution. 7.7.4.A

Bearing Stress
For geotechnical and structural footings design, the bearing stress calculation assumes Definition and Location of Forces and Moments a uniform bearing pressure distribution. For footing designs on rock, the bearing stress for L-Abutments and Interior Footings is based on a triangular or trapezoidal bearing pressure distribution. The procedure to Figure 7.7.4.-2 outline. See Abutment Spread calculate bearing stress is summarized in the following Footing Force Diagrams for typical loads and eccentricity. Step 1:
Calculate the Resultant force (Rstr), location (Xostr) and eccentricity for Strength (estr).
Xostr = (factored moments about the footing base)/(factored vertical loads) Step 2A:
For Footings on Soil: Calculate the maximum soil stress (sstr) based on a uniform pressure distribution. Note that this calculation method applies in both directions for biaxially loaded footings. See AASHTO LRFD Section 10.6.3.1.5 for guidance on biaxial loading. The maximum footing pressure on soil with a uniform distribution is: sstr = R/B′ = R/2Xo = R/(B-2e), where B′ is the effective footing width.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 7-75
Chapter 7
Substructure Design
Step 2B:
For Footings on Rock: If the reaction is outside the middle ⅓ of the base, use a triangular distribution. sstr max = 2R/3 Xo, where “R” is the factored limit state reaction.
If the reaction is within the middle ⅓ of the base, use a trapezoidal distribution. sstr max = R/B (1+ 6 e/B)
In addition, WSDOT limits the maximum stress (P/A) applied to rock due to vertical loads only. This is because the rock stiffness approaches infinity relative to the footing concrete. The maximum width of uniform stress is limited to C+2D as shown in Figure 7.7.4-3.
Step 3:		 Compare the factored bearing stress (sstr) to the factored bearing 		resistance (fbcqn) of the soil or rock. The factored bearing stress must
be less than or equal to the factored bearing resistance. 		 sstr ≤ fbcqn Step 4:		 Repeat steps 1 thru 3 for the Extreme Event limit state. Calculate Xoext, 		eext, and sext using Extreme Event factors and compare the factored
stress to the factored bearing (fbqn). Figure 7.7.4-3

If the structural analysis yields a bearing stress (sser) greater than the bearing resistance, then the footing must be re-evaluated. The first step would be to increase the footing size to meet bearing resistance. If this leads to a solution, recheck layout criteria and inform the Geotechnical Engineer the footing size has increased. If the footing size cannot be increased, consult the Geotechnical Engineer for other solutions.

Footing Thickness and Shear
The minimum footing thickness shall be 1′-0″. The minimum plan dimension shall be 4′-0″. Footing thickness may be governed by the development length of the column dowels, or by concrete shear requirements (with or without reinforcement). If concrete shear governs the thickness, it is the engineer’s judgment, based on economics, as to whether to use a thick footing unreinforced for shear or a thinner footing with shear reinforcement. Generally, shear reinforcement should be avoided but not at excessive cost in concrete, excavation, and shoring requirements. Where stirrups are required, place the first stirrup at d/2 from the face of the column or pedestal. For large footings, consider discontinuing the stirrups at the point where vu = vc. 7.7.4.F.2
Footing Force Distribution
The maximum internal forces in the footing shall be determined based on a triangular or trapezoidal bearing pressure distribution, see AASHTO LRFD Section 10.6.5. 7.7.4.F.3
Vertical Reinforcement (Column or Wall)
Vertical reinforcement shall be developed into the footing to adequately transfer loads to the footing. Vertical rebar shall be bent 90° and extend to the top of the bottom mat of footing reinforcement. This facilitates placement and minimizes footing thickness. Bars in tension shall be developed using 1.25 Ld. Bars in compression shall develop a length of 1.25 Ld, prior to the bend. Where bars are not fully stressed, lengths may be reduced in proportion, but shall not be less than ¾ Ld. The concrete strength used to compute development length of the bar in the footing shall be the strength of the concrete in the footing. The concrete strength to be used to compute the section strength at the interface between footing and a column concrete shall be that of the column concrete. This is allowed because of the confinement effect of the wider footing. 7.7.4.F.4
Bottom Reinforcement
Concrete design shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD. Reinforcement shall not be less than #6 bars at 12″ centers to account for uneven soil conditions and shrinkage stresses.

Top Reinforcement
Top reinforcement shall be used in any case where tension forces in the top of the footing are developed. Where columns and bearing walls are connected to the superstructure, sufficient reinforcement shall be provided in the tops of footings to carry the weight of the footing and overburden assuming zero pressure under the footing. This is the uplift earthquake condition described under “Superstructure Loads.” This assumes that the strength of the connection to the superstructure will carry such load. Where the connection to the superstructure will not support the weight of the substructure and overburden, the strength of the connection may be used as the limiting value for determining top reinforcement. For these conditions, the AASHTO LRFD requirement for minimum percentage of reinforcement will be waived. Regardless of whether or not the columns and bearing walls are connected to the superstructure, a mat of reinforcement shall normally be provided at the tops of footings. On short stub abutment walls (4′ from girder seat to top of footing), these bars may be omitted. In this case, any tension at the top of the footing, due to the weight of the small overburden, must be taken by the concrete in tension. Top reinforcement for column or wall footings designed for two-way action shall not be less than #6 bars at 12″ centers, in each direction while top reinforcement for bearing wall footings designed for one-way action shall not be less than #5 bars at 12″ centers in each direction. 7.7.4.F.6
Shrinkage and Temperature Reinforcement
For footings greater than 3 feet thick, temperature and shrinkage reinforcing shall be provided on the side faces in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.6.

Pile-Supported Footing Design The minimum footing thickness shall be 2′-0″. The minimum plan dimension shall be 4′-0″. Footing thickness may be governed by the development length of the column dowels, or by concrete shear requirements. The use of strut and tie modeling is recommended for the design of all pile caps and pile footings. Figure 7.7.5-1 identifies the modes of failure that should be investigated for general pile cap/footing design. Figure 7.7.5-1

Shafts
7.8.1
Axial Resistance
Chapter 7
The factored axial resistance of the shaft (R) is generally composed of two parts: the nominal end bearing (Rp) and the nominal skin friction (Rs). The general formula is as follows, where φ is the limit state resistance factor. R = jp Rp + js Rs
(7.8.1-1)
The total factored shaft loading must be less than the factored axial resistance. Rp and Rs are treated as independent quantities although research has shown that the end bearing and skin friction resistance have some interdependence. Rp and Rs shown as a function of depth will be stated in the geotechnical report for the bridge. End bearing resistance, Rp, is typically provided by the Geotechnical Branch as a net value. Thus, the effective weight of the shaft can be reduced by the total weight of the excavated soil when examining compressive loads and resistances. Shafts with permanent casing, installed by drilling and not driven, require reduced side resistance specified by the geotechnical engineer. Side resistance shall be limited to 10 percent of the nominal (ultimate) side resistance unless otherwise approved by the WSDOT State Geotechnical Engineer. This is due to the overcutting required when installing permanent casing. The designer shall consider all applicable factored load combination limit states and shaft resistances when determining shaft axial resistance and demand and shaft tip elevations. For some shaft designs, liquefiable soils, scour conditions and/or downdrag forces may need to be considered. Determining which limit states to include these conditions or forces can be complex. The State Hydraulics Branch and the State Geotechnical Engineer shall be consulted to ensure overly and/or under conservative load combinations and resistances are not being considered. Open and frequent communication is essential during design. Although the AASHTO LRFD include water loads, WA, in Extreme Event I limit states, in most cases the loss of soil resistance due to scour conditions is not combined with Extreme Event I load combinations. The probability of a design earthquake occurring in the presence of the maximum scour event is low. However, in some instances it is appropriate to include some scour effects. When scour is included with Extreme Event I load combinations, the skin resistance of the soil, up to a maximum of 25 percent of the scour depth for the design flood (l00 year event), shall be deducted from the resistance of the shaft. The loss of skin resistance for the full scour depth for the design flood shall be considered when checking axial resistance of the shaft for all strength and service limit states. The loss of skin resistance for the full scour depth of the check flood (500 year event) shall be considered when checking the axial resistance of the shaft for Extreme Event II limit states. It should be noted that scour does not produce a load effect on the structure but changes the geometry of the bridge pier and available soil resistance so that effects of other loads are amplified. The engineer may also need to consider scour effects on piers that are currently outside of the ordinary high water zones due to potential migration of rivers or streams during flood events. The State Hydraulics Branch will provide guidance for these rare cases.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 7-81
Chapter 7
Substructure Design
Downdrag forces may also need to be considered in some designs. Downdrag forces are most often caused by the placement of fill adjacent to shafts, which causes consolidation and settlement of underlying soils. This situation is applicable to service and strength limit states. Downdrag forces can also be caused by liquefaction-induced settlement caused by a seismic event. Pore water pressure builds up in liquefiable soils during ground shaking. And as pore water pressure dissipates, the soil layer(s) may settle, causing downdrag forces on the shaft to develop. These liquefaction induced downdrag forces are only considered in the Extreme Event I limit state. However, downdrag induced by consolidation settlement is never combined with downdrag forces induced by liquefaction, but are only considered separately in their applicable limit states. The downdrag is treated as a load applied to the shaft foundations. The settling soil, whether it is caused by consolidation under soil stresses (caused, for example, by the placement of fill), or caused by liquefaction, creates a downward acting shear force on the foundations. This shear force is essentially the skin friction acting on the shaft, but reversed in direction by the settlement. This means that the skin friction along the length of the shaft within the zone of soil that is contributing to downdrag is no longer available for resisting downward axial forces and must not be included with the soil resistance available to resist the total downward axial (i.e., compression) loads acting on the foundation. In general, the Geotechnical Engineer will provide shaft soil resistance plots as a function of depth that includes skin friction along the full length of the shaft. Therefore, when using those plots to estimate the shaft foundation depth required to resist the axial compressive foundation loads, this “skin friction lost” due to downdrag must be subtracted from the resistance indicated in the geotechnical shaft resistance plots, and the downdrag load per shaft must be added to the other axial compression loads acting on the shaft. Similarly, if scour is an issue that must be considered in the design of the foundation, with regard to axial resistance (both in compression and in uplift), the skin friction lost due to removal of the soil within the scour depth must be subtracted from the shaft axial resistance plots provided by the Geotechnical Engineer. If there is any doubt as to whether or not this skin friction lost must be subtracted from the shaft resistance plots, it is important to contact the Geotechnical Engineer for clarification on this issue. Note that if both scour and downdrag forces must be considered, it is likely that the downdrag forces will be reduced by the scour. This needs to be considered when considering combination of these two conditions, and assistance from the Geotechnical Engineer should be obtained. The Geotechnical Design Manual Chapters 6, 8, and 23, should be consulted for additional explanation regarding these issues. Following is a summary of potential load combination limit states that shall be checked if scour effects, liquefiable soils and/or downdrag forces are included in the design. The geotechnical report will provide the appropriate resistance factors to use with each limit state.

Embankment Consolidation Downdrag
Embankment downdrag from fill or the presence of compressible material below the foundations; no liquefaction. Checks: 1.
7.8.1.B
Include embankment induced downdrag loads with all Strength and Service Limit States. Do not include with Extreme Limit States. Use maximum load factor unless checking an uplift case, where the minimum shall be used. Subtract the skin friction lost within the downdrag zone from the shaft axial resistance plots provided by the Geotechnical Engineer. Seismic Liquefaction Downdrag
Liquefiable soils with post-earthquake downdrag forces. No embankment downdrag. If embankment downdrag is present, it shall not be included with liquefaction-induced downdrag therefore it would not be included in Check 3 below. Checks: 1.
Extreme Event I Limit State Use static soil resistances (no loss of resistance due to liquefaction) and no downdrag forces. Use a live load factor of 0.5.
2.
Extreme Event I Limit State Use reduced soil resistance due to liquefaction and no downdrag forces. Use a live load factor of 0.5. The soils in the liquefied zone will not provide the static skin friction resistance but will in most cases have a reduced resistance that will be provided by the Geotechnical Engineer.
3.
Extreme Event I Limit State Post liquefaction. Include downdrag forces, a live load factor of 0.5 and a reduced post-liquefaction soil resistance provided by the Geotechnical Engineer. Do not include seismic inertia forces from the structure since it is a post-earthquake check. There will be no skin resistance in the post-earthquake liquefied zone. Therefore, subtract the skin friction lost within the downdrag zone from the shaft axial resistance plots provided by the Geotechnical Engineer.
7.8.1.C
Scour
Scour from design flood (100 year events) and check floods (500 year events.) The shaft shall be designed so that shaft penetration below the scour of the applicable flood event provides enough axial resistance to satisfy demands. Since in general the Geotechnical Engineer will provide shaft resistance plots that include the skin friction within the scour zone, the skin friction lost will need to be subtracted from the axial resistance plots provided to determine the shaft resistance acting below the scour depth. A special case would include scour with Extreme Event I limit states without liquefiable soils and downdrag. It is overly conservative to include liquefied soil induced downdrag and scour with the Extreme Event I limit states. The Hydraulics Branch and the Geotechnical Engineer will need to be consulted for this special case.

Service and Strength Limit States Subtract the skin friction lost within the scour depth (i.e., 100 percent of the scour depth for the 100 year design flood) from the shaft axial resistance plots provided by the Geotechnical Engineer, to estimate the shaft depth required to resist all service and strength limit demands.
2.
Extreme Event II Limit State Subtract the skin friction lost within the scour depth (i.e., 100 percent of the scour depth for the 500 year check flood event) from the shaft axial resistance plots provided by the Geotechnical Engineer, to estimate the shaft depth required to resist all Extreme Event II limit demands. Use a live load factor of 0.5. Do not include ice load, IC, vessel collision force, CV, and vehicular collision force, CT.
3.
Extreme Event II Limit State Subtract the skin friction lost within the scour depth (in this case only 50 percent of the scour depth for the 500 year check flood event) from the shaft axial resistance plots provided by the Geotechnical Engineer, to estimate the shaft depth required to resist all Extreme Event II limit demands. Use a live load factor of 0.5. In this case, include ice load, IC, vessel collision force, CV, and vehicular collision force, CT.
4.
Extreme Event I Limit State (special case - no liquefaction) Subtract the skin friction lost within the scour depth (i.e., in this case 25 percent of the scour depth for the 100 year design flood) from the shaft axial resistance plots provided by the Geotechnical Engineer, to estimate the shaft depth required to resist the Extreme Event I limit state demands.
7.8.1.D
Axial Resistance Group Reduction Factors
The group reduction factors for axial resistance of shafts for the strength and extreme event limit states shall be taken as shown in Table 7.8.1-1 unless otherwise specified by the Geotechnical Engineer. These reduction factors presume that good shaft installation practices are used to minimize or eliminate the relaxation of the soil between shafts and caving. If this cannot be adequately controlled due to difficult soils conditions or for other constructability reasons, lower group reduction factors shall be used as recommended by the Geotechnical Engineer of record. Alternatively, steps could be required during and/ or after shaft construction to restore the soil to its original condition. The Geotechnical Engineer will provide these recommendations, which could include but is not limited to, pressure grouting of the tip, grouting along side of the shaft or full length casing.

These group reduction factors apply to both strength and extreme event limit states. For the service limit state the influence of the group on settlement as shall be determined from the AASHTO LRFD and the Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03.
7.8.2
Structural Design and Detailing Standard Specifications Section 6-19 should be reviewed as part of the design of shafts. The structural design of shafts is similar to column design. The following guidelines shall be followed: 1.
For shaft foundation supporting columns in any SDC C or D, the shaft nominal moment capacity shall be designed to resist 1.25 times the moment demand generated in the shaft by the overstrength column plastic hinge moment at the base of the column.
2.
Concrete Class 5000P shall be specified for the entire length of the shaft for wet or dry conditions of placement.
3.
When shafts are constructed in water, the concrete specified for the casing shoring seal shall be Class 4000W.
4.
The assumed concrete compressive strength may be taken as ƒ′c for structural design of shafts. For seismic design, the expected compressive strength may be increased by 1.3 in accordance with AASHTO Seismic Section 8.4.4.

Substructure Design
5.
The presence of permanent steel casing shall be taken into account in the shaft design (i.e. for stiffness, and etc.), but the structural resistance of permanent steel casing shall not be considered for structural design of shafts unless the design conforms to Section 7.10.
6.
Cover requirements vary depending on the shaft diameter and shall be as specified below:
• Diameter less than or equal to 3′-0″ = 3″
• Diameter greater than 3′-0″ and less than 5′-0″ = 4″
• Diameter greater than or equal to 5′-0″ = 6″ Standard Specifications Section 6-19 lists exceptions to these cover requirements when permanent slip casings are used in column splice zones.
7.
In general, shaft reinforcing shall be detailed to minimize congestion, facilitate concrete placement by tremie, and maximize consolidation of concrete.
8.
The clear spacing between spirals and hoops shall not be less than 6″ or more than 9″, with the following exception. The clear spacing between spirals or hoops may be reduced in the splice zone in single column/single shaft connections because shaft concrete may be vibrated in this area, negating the need for larger openings to facilitate good flow of concrete through the reinforcing cage.
9.
The volumetric ratio and spacing requirements of the AASHTO Seismic Specifications for confinement need not be met. The top of shafts in typical WSDOT single column/ single shaft connections remains elastic under seismic loads due to the larger shaft diameter (as compared to the column). Therefore this requirement does not need to be met.
10. Shaft transverse reinforcement may be constructed as hoops or spirals, or a combination of the two. Spiral reinforcement is preferred for shaft transverse reinforcement. However, if #6 spirals at 6″ (excluding the exception in Section 7.8.2.H) clear do not satisfy the shear design, circular hoops may be used. Circular hoops in shafts up to #9 bars may be lap spliced using a welded lap detail. Note: Welded lap splices for spirals are currently acceptable under the AWS D1.4 up to bar size #6. Recent testing has been performed by WSDOT for bar sizes #7 through #9. All tests achieved full tensile capacity (including 125 percent of yield strength.) Therefore, #7 through #9 welded lap spliced hoops are acceptable to use provided they are not located in possible plastic hinge regions. Circular hoops may also be fabricated using a manual direct butt weld, resistance butt weld, or mechanical coupler. Weld splicing of hoops for shafts shall be completed prior to assembly of the shaft steel reinforcing cage. Refer to Section 7.3.5.F for additional discussion on circular hoops. Mechanical couplers may be considered provided cover and clearance requirements are accounted for in the shaft details. When welded hoops or mechanical couplers are used, the plans shall show a staggered pattern around the perimeter of the shaft so that no two adjacent welded splices or couplers are located at the same location. 11. In single column/single shaft configurations, the spacing of the shaft transverse reinforcement in the splice zone shall meet the requirements of the following equation, which comes from the TRAC Report titled, “Noncontact Lap Splices in Bridge Column-Shaft Connections”: Page 7-86

Where 3-bar bundles are used, the plans shall allow the contractor to construct the cage with two of the three bars located towards the center of the shaft. This allows the contractor flexibility in constructing the cage, but it reduces the flexural resistance of the shaft.
14. Longitudinal reinforcing in shafts should be straight with no hooks to facilitate concrete placement and removal of casing. If hooks are necessary to develop moment at the top of a shaft (in a shaft cap situation) the hooks should be turned toward the center of the shaft while leaving enough opening to allow concrete placement with a tremie. 15. Locations of longitudinal splices shall be shown in the contract plans. Mechanical splices shall be placed in low stress regions and staggered 2′-0″ minimum. 16. Use of two concentric circular rebar cages shall be avoided. 17. Resistance factors for Strength Limit States shall be per the latest AASHTO LRFD. Resistance factors for Extreme Event Limit States shall be per the latest AASHTO Seismic Specifications. The resistance factor for shear shall conform to the AASHTO LRFD.

18. The axial load along the shaft varies due to the side friction. It is considered conservative, however, to design the shaft for the full axial load plus the maximum moment. The entire shaft normally is then reinforced for this axial load and moment. 19. Access tubes for Crosshole Sonic Log (CSL) testing or thermal wires for Thermal Integrity Profiling (TIP) shall be provided in all shafts per Standard Specifications Section 6-19.3(6)B. 20. Shafts shall be specified in English dimensions and shall be specified in sizes that do not preclude any drilling method. Shafts shall be specified in whole foot increments except as allowed here. The tolerances in Standard Specifications Section 6-19 accommodate metric casing sizes and/or oversized English casing sizes. Oversized English casings are often used so that tooling for drilling the shafts, which are the nominal English diameter, will fit inside the casing. There are a few exceptions, which will be discussed below. See Table 7.8.2-1 for casing sizes and tolerances. Table 7.8.2-1

*Check Standard Specifications Section 6-19. **Construction tolerances would allow either 1.2 or 1.5 meter casing to be used. # Designer shall check that undersize shaft meets the design demands.
As seen in Table 7.8.2-1, construction tolerances shown in Column “C” allow shaft diameters to be increased up to 12″ for shafts 5′-0″ diameter or less and increased up to 6″ for shafts greater than 5′-0″ in diameter. In most cases these construction tolerances allow either metric or English casings to be used for installation of the shafts. Page 7-88

There are a few exceptions to these typical tolerances. These exceptions are as follows: A. 4.0′ Diameter Shafts The tolerances in Columns “C” and “D” of Table 7.8.2-1 allow either an oversized 4.92′ diameter shaft or an undersized 3.94′ shaft to be constructed. The reinforcement cage shall be sized to provide a minimum of 3″ of cover to the undersized diameter. B.
5.0′ Diameter Shafts The tolerances in Columns “C” and “D” of Table 7.8.2-1 allow either an oversized 6.0′ diameter shaft or an undersized 4.92′ diameter shaft to be constructed. The reinforcement cage shall be sized to provide a minimum of 4″ of cover to the undersized diameter.
C.
10.0′ Diameter Shafts The tolerances in Columns “C” and “D” of Table 7.8.2-1 allow either an oversized 10.5′ diameter shaft or an undersized 9.84′ diameter shaft to be constructed. The reinforcement cage shall be sized to provide a minimum of 4″ of cover to the undersized diameter.
For all shaft diameters, the designer should bracket the design so that all possible shaft diameters, when considering the construction tolerances, will satisfy the design demands. The minimum shaft diameter (nominal or undersized) shall be used for design of the flexural and shear reinforcement. The nominal English shaft diameter shall be specified on the plans. When requesting shaft resistance charts from the Geotechnical Engineer, the designer should request charts for the nominal English shaft diameter. 21. Shafts supporting a single column shall be sized to allow for construction tolerances, as illustrated in Figure 7.8.2-1. Figure 7.8.2-1

The shaft diameter shall be based on the maximum column diameter allowed by the following equation, Maximum Column Diameter = Shaft Diameter – 2*(Shaft Concrete Cover) – 2*(Shaft Horizontal Construction Tolerance) – 2*(Shaft Cage Thickness) The shaft horizontal construction tolerance and shaft concrete cover shall conform to Standard Specifications Section 6-19. If the column diameter used in design is larger than the maximum allowed for a given shaft size, as defined by the equation above, a larger shaft diameter shall be used. The shaft diameter specified here should not be confused with the desirable casing shoring diameter discussed below. 22. Casing shoring shall be provided for all shafts below grade or waterline. However, casing shoring requirements are different for shafts in shallow excavations and deep excavations. Shafts in deep excavations require a larger diameter casing shoring to allow access to the top of the shaft for column form placement and removal. The top of shafts in shallow excavations (approximately 4′ or less) can be accessed from the ground line above, by reaching in or by “glory-holing”, and therefore do not require larger diameter casing shoring, see Figure 7.8.2-2. The designer shall locate the top of in-water shafts above the water line when it simplifies construction. Where there is a strong design benefit to lowering the top of in-water shafts, they may be located below the groundline/mudline. Figure 7.8.2-2

23. Changes in shaft diameters due to construction tolerances shall not result in a reinforcing steel cage diameter different from the diameter shown in the plans (plan shaft diameter minus concrete cover). For example, metric casing diameters used in lieu of English casing diameters shall only result in an increase in concrete cover, except as noted below for single column/single shaft connections requiring slip casings. There are also exceptions for 4′-0″, 5′-0″, and 10′-0″ diameter shafts, see Table 7.8.2-1. 24. Rotator and Oscillator drilling methods typically use a slip casing for permanent casing in single column/single shaft connections, as shown in Figure 7.8.2-3. Figure 7.8.2-3

The use of the slip casing typically requires a modification to the reinforcing cage diameter. This should be considered during the structural design of the shaft. The  slip casing also results in less concrete cover than the area of the shaft below the slip casing. See Table 7.8.2-2 for expected reinforcing cage diameters and clear cover. Shafts shall be designed such that the reduced concrete cover is acceptable in this area because the casing is permanent. A minimum of 3″ of concrete cover is achievable in this area for shafts 4′-0″diameter and larger and 1½″ of cover for shafts less than 4′-0″. These concrete cover requirements shall be kept as a minimum requirement. The reduction in strength (compared to the area below the slip casing) associated with the reduced shaft diameter that results from the slip casing is bounded within the shaft analysis and design methods prescribed here and elsewhere. Therefore the reduction in strength in this area can be ignored. 25. Reinforcing bar centralizers shall be detailed in the plans as shown in Figure 7.8.2-4.

Piles and Piling
7.9.1
Pile Types This section describes the piling used by the Bridge and Structures Office and their applications. In general, piles should not be used where spread footings can be used. 7.9.1.A
Cast-in-place Concrete Piles
Cast-in-place (CIP) concrete piles utilize driven steel pipe casings, which are then filled with reinforcing steel and concrete. The steel pile is generally ignored for strength considerations but may be considered for stiffness. Refer to Section 7.10 Concrete Filled Tubes where the steel pile and concrete are utilized as composite section. The bottom of the casing is typically capped with a suitable flat plate for driving. However, the Geotechnical Branch may specify special tips when difficult driving is expected. The Geotechnical Branch will determine the minimum wall thickness of the steel pipe casings based on driving conditions. However, the Standard Specifications require the contractor to provide a wall thickness that will prevent damage during driving. 7.9.1.B
Structural Steel Pipe Piles
Structural steel pipe piles shall follow the current Special Provisions in addition to the requirements in the Standard Specifications. Additionally, the design wall thickness shall be reduced for corrosion over a 75-year minimum design life. Minimum corrosion rates are specified in Section 6.7.1. 7.9.1.C
Steel H Piles
Steel piles have been used where there are hard layers that must be penetrated in order to reach an adequate point bearing stratum. H piling can act efficiently as friction piling due to its large surface area. Do not use steel H piling where the soil consists of only moderately dense material. In such conditions, it may be difficult to develop the friction capacity of the H piles and excessive pile length may result. Steel H Pile design thickness shall be reduced for corrosion over a 75-year minimum design life as specified in Section 6.7.1. 7.9.1.D
Timber Piles
Timber piles may be untreated or treated and are used only for temporary applications. Untreated piles may be used where the entire pile will be permanently below the water line. Where composite piles are used, the splice must be located below the permanent water table. If doubt exists as to the location of the permanent water table, treated timber piles shall be used. Where dense material exists, consideration should be given to allowing jetting (with loss of uplift capacity), use of shoes, or use of other pile types. 7.9.1.E
Steel Sheet Piles
Steel sheet piles are typically used for cofferdams and shoring and cribbing, but are usually not made a part of permanent construction. Timber piles and auger cast piles shall not be used for WSDOT permanent bridge structures. These types of piles may be used for temporary bridges and other non-bridge WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

applications subject to approval by the State Geotechnical Engineer and the State Bridge Design Engineer. Micropiles shall not be used for new bridge foundations unless approved by the State Bridge Design Engineer. This type of pile may be used for foundation strengthening of existing bridges, temporary bridges and other non-bridge applications subject to approval by the State Geotechnical Engineer and the State Bridge Design Engineer. Precast, prestressed concrete piles shall only be used in SDC A or B unless approved by the State Bridge Design Engineer. Their use shall be limited to locations where uncertainties in pile length are minimal. Steel H Piles shall only be used at bridge abutments unless approved by the State Bridge Design Engineer. The connections into the cap shall develop the strength required for design and to prevent pull out during uplift. This could be done with welded end plate or welded rebar connection details into the pile cap similar to those for CFSTs in Section 7.10.3. Battered piles shall not be used for bridge foundations to resist lateral loads unless approved by the State Bridge Design and State Geotechnical Engineers. In seismic applications there is a need for bi-directional demands. Steel H piles have proven to have little bending resistance for the purposes of resisting seismic load while circular pilesprovide consistent capacities in all directions. Also, CIP pile casing 7 .2 .3-1CIP         1  is generally available in a full range of casing diameters. CIP piles are easily inspected after driving toensure quality of the finished pile prior to placing reinforcing steel    1the  7 .3 .6-1  3 and concrete.

Pile selfweight is typically neglected. As shown above, downdrag forces are treated as load to the pile when designing for axial resistance. However, it should not be included in the structural analysis of the bridge. See Section 7.8.1 “Axial Resistance” of shafts for discussion on load combinations when considering liquefaction, scour and on downdrag effects. These guidelines are also applicable to piles.
7.9.3
Block Failure For the strength and extreme event limit states, if the soil is characterized as cohesive, the pile group resistance shall also be checked for the potential for a “block” failure, as described in AASHTO LRFD Section 10.7.3.9. This check requires interaction between the designer and the Geotechnical Engineer. The check is performed by the Geotechnical Engineer based on loads provided by the designer. If a block failure appears likely, the pile group size shall be increased so that a block failure is prevented.
7.9.4
Pile Uplift Piles may be designed for uplift if specified in the geotechnical report. In general, pile construction methods that require preboring, jetting, or spudding will reduce uplift capacity.
7.9.5
Pile Spacing Pile spacing determination is typically determined collaboratively with the Geotechnical Engineer. The Geotechnical Design Manual M 46-03 specifies a minimum center-to-center spacing of 30″ or 2.5 pile diameters. However, center-to-center spacings of less than 2.5 pile diameters may be considered on a case-by-case basis.
7.9.6
Structural Design and Detailing of CIP Concrete Piles The structural design and detailing of CIP Concrete piles is similar to column design with the following guidelines: 1.
Concrete Class 5000P Concrete shall be specified for CIP concrete piles. The top 10′ of concrete in the pile is to be vibrated. Use 1.0 ƒ′c for the structural design.
2.
For structural design, the reinforcement alone shall be designed to resist the total moment throughout the length of pile without considering strength of the steel casing. The minimum reinforcement shall be 0.75 percent Ag for SDC B, C, and D and shall be provided for the full length of the pile unless approved by the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer. Minimum clearance between longitudinal bars shall meet the requirements in Appendix 5.1-A2.
3.
If the pile to footing/cap connection is not a plastic hinge zone longitudinal reinforcement need only extend above the pile into the footing/cap a distance equal to 1.0 ld (tension). If the pile to footing/cap connection is a plastic hinge zone longitudinal reinforcement shall extend above the pile into the footing/cap a distance equal to 1.25 ld.

Since the diameter of the concrete portion of the pile is dependent on the steel casing thickness, the as-built diameter will not be known during design (since the casing thickness is determined by the contractor). As such, a casing thickness must be assumed for design. The structural engineer should work closely with the Geotechnical Engineer to determine a suitable casing thickness to assume based on expected driving conditions. A pile drivability analysis may be required for this. Otherwise, the following can typically be assumed:
• ¼″ for piles less than 14″ in diameter
• ⅜″ for piles 14″ to 18″ in diameter
• ½″ for larger piles
5.
Steel casing for 24″ diameter and smaller CIP piling should be designated by nominal diameter rather than inside diameter. Standard Specifications Section 9-10.5 requires steel casings to meet ASTM A252 Grade 2, which is purchased by nominal diameter (outside diameter) and wall thickness. A pile thickness should not be stated in the plans. As stated previously, the Standard Specifications require the contractor to determine the pile casing thickness required for driving.
6.
Transverse spiral reinforcement shall be designed to resist the maximum shear in the pile. Avoid a spiral pitch of less than 3″. The minimum spiral shall be a #4 bar at 9″ pitch. If the pile to footing/cap connection is not a plastic hinge zone the volumetric requirements of AASHTO LRFD Section 5.11.4.5 need not be met.
7.
Resistance factors for Strength Limit States shall be per the latest AASHTO LRFD. Resistance factors for Extreme Event Limit States shall be per the latest AASHTO Seismic Specifications.
8.
Piles are typically assumed to be continuously supported. Normally, the soil surrounding a foundation element provides sufficient bracing against a buckling failure. Piles that are driven through very weak soils should be designed for reduced lateral support, using information from the Geotechnical Branch as appropriate. AASHTO LRFD 10.7.3.13.4 may be used to estimate the column length for buckling. Piles driven through firm material normally can be considered fully supported for column action (buckling not critical) below the ground.
9.
The axial load along the pile varies due to side friction. It is considered conservative, however, to design the pile for the full axial load plus the maximum moment. The entire pile is then typically reinforced for this axial load and moment.
10. In all cases of uplift, the connection between the pile and the footing must be carefully designed and detailed. The bond between the pile and the seal may be considered as contributing to the uplift resistance. This bond value shall be limited to 10 psi. The pile must be adequate to carry tension throughout its length. For example, a timber pile with a splice sleeve could not be used.
7.9.7
Pile Splices Pile splices shall be avoided where possible. If splices may be required in timber piling, a splice shall be detailed on the plans. Splices between treated and untreated timber shall always be located below the permanent water line.

Chapter 7
Pile Lateral Design The strength limit state for lateral resistance is only structural, though the determination of pile fixity is the result of soil-structure interaction. A failure of the soil does not occur; the soil will continue to displace at constant or slightly increasing resistance. Failure occurs when the pile reaches the structural limit state and this limit state is reached, in the general case, when the nominal combined bending, shear, and axial resistance is reached. Piles resist horizontal forces by a combination of internal strength and the passive pressure resistance of the surrounding soil. The capacity of the pile to carry horizontal loads should be investigated using a soil/structural analysis. For more information on modeling individual piles or pile groups, see Section 7.2, Foundation Modeling and Section 7.2.6 Lateral Analysis of Piles and Shafts.
7.9.9
Battered Piles As stated previously, battered piles shall not be used to resist lateral loads for new bridge foundations. Where battered piles are used, the maximum batter shall be 4½:12. Piles with batters in excess of this become very difficult to drive and the bearing values become difficult to predict. Ensure that battered piling do not intersect piling from adjacent footings within the maximum length of the piles.
7.9.10
Pile Tip Elevations and Quantities Pile length quantities provided to PS&E are based on the minimum tip elevation given in the geotechnical report or the expected depth required for axial design, whichever is greater. If the minimum tip elevation given in the geotechnical report is greater than the design tip elevation, overdriving the pile will be required. The Geotechnical Engineer shall be contacted to evaluate driving conditions. A General Provision will be required in the Special Provisions to alert the contractor of the additional effort needed to drive these piles. If a minimum tip elevation is required, it shall be shown in the contract plans. Minimum pile tip elevations provided in the geotechnical report may need to be adjusted to lower elevations depending on the results of the lateral, axial, and uplift analysis. If adjustment in the minimum tip elevations is necessary, or if the pile diameter needed is different than what was assumed for the geotechnical report, the Geotechnical Branch must be informed so that pile drivability can be re-evaluated. Note that lateral loading and uplift requirements may influence (possibly increase) the number of piles required in the group if the capacity available at a reasonable minimum tip elevation is not adequate. This will depend on the soil conditions and the loading requirements. For example, if the upper soil is very soft or will liquefy, making the minimum tip elevation deeper is unlikely to improve the lateral response of the piles enough to be adequate. Adding more piles to the group or using a larger pile diameter to increase the pile stiffness may be the only solution.

Plan Pile Resistance The Bridge Plan General Notes shall list the Ultimate Bearing Capacity (Nominal Driving Resistance, Rndr) in tons. This information is used by the contractor to determine the pile casing thickness and size the hammer to drive the piles. The resistance for several piers may be presented in a table as shown in Figure 7.9.11-1. If overdriving the piles is required to reach the minimum tip elevation, the estimated amount of overdriving (tons) shall be specified in the Special Provisions. Figure 7.9.11-1

The total factored pile axial loading must be less than fRn for the pile design. Designers should note that the driving resistance might be greater than the design loading for liquefied soil conditions. This is not an overdriving condition. This is due to the resistance liquefied soils being ignored for design, but included in the driving criteria to place the piles.

Concrete-Filled Steel Tubes
7.10.1
Scope
Chapter 7
This section shall be taken to supersede AASHTO LRFD and AASHTO Seismic requirements for concrete-filled steel tubes (or pipes). The use of concrete-filled steel tubes (CFST) and reinforced concrete-filled steel tubes (RCFST) requires approval from the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer when used as a ductile element as part of an earthquake-resisting system. CFST and RCFST have been shown to offer strength and stiffness beyond a conventional reinforced concrete (RC) member. Recent research has shown that CFST members can sustain large cyclic drifts with minimal damage. The design methods herein regarding concrete-filled steel tubes are largely based on study, testing and recommendations compiled by the University of Washington (UW). The concrete for CFST members tested at the UW was a low-shrinkage, self-consolidating concrete. The nominal concrete strengths were 6 ksi and 10 ksi. This represents structural concrete with a minimum specified strength of 4 ksi, and an expected strength 25 percent to 50 percent larger. Prior CALTRANS and ARMY research programs studied fully restrained connections for CFST pier to foundation connections. Two of those connections are further discussed in this section and are shown in Figure 7.10.1-1. The first CFST-to-cap connection type involves an annular ring attached to the top of the CFST, and is partially embedded into the pile cap. This anchored connection resists flexural loading from the pile through strutting action to the bottom of the pile cap (resulting from the portion of tube of the CFST that is in tension) and the top of the pile cap (resulting from the portion of tube of the CFST column that in compression). Tests show this connection is both simple to construct and fully effective in transferring flexure. The current ACI procedure (ACI 318-2011) was recommended by the UW as a conservative approach to design against punching shear in this type of connection. The second CFST-to-cap connection type requires a circular reinforcing cage with headed longitudinal bars that extend into the concrete cap. The CFST is discontinued just below the cap. This connection type is beneficial for plastic design in that it allows the designer some flexibility in the plastic demand that must be resisted by the cap. Refer to Section 7.10.4 for further discussion. Transition connections between RC shafts and CFST shafts have not been tested, but considerable analysis has been performed at the UW. Models have been developed to predict the strength of RCFST members, and this RCFST behavior may be used to provide increased strength over a significant length of the pile relative to conventional RC construction. Overstrength factors for capacity protection design of adjacent members and joint shear design at connections were not addressed in the research.

Stability Considerations for Unbraced of Partially-braced Members
2ℎ   Piles and shafts are=typically assumed to be continually braced by the surrounding 7 .8 .2-1    soil. Therefore they are not normally subject to P-∆ effects or other secondary effects. However, it is recognized that special circumstances such as scour, soil liquefaction, piles used in marine structures, or other conditions may leave piles and shafts subject to less than full bracing. In these circumstances, it may be necessary to consider stability effects. 7 .9 .2-1    =    / +   / +  7.10.2.G Shear Resistance
The shear resistance of CFST and RCFST shall be taken as:
7 .10 .2-15 Where: As Ac g1 g2 g3 g4
 =  = 4 1 0.6 2   + 0.03163  ′ 
(7.10.2-16)
= cross-sectional area of the steel tube = area of concrete within the steel tube = coefficient for the shear capacity of the steel tube = 2.0 = coefficient for the effective shear area of steel tube = 0.5 = coefficient for the effect on concrete strength in shear due to confinement from the steel tube = 3.0 = coefficient for bond development between the concrete and steel tube = 1.0
The value of 1.0 for term g4 is based on the assumption that the tube is fully developed as a composite section with the concrete and should be at least one diameter, D, from the point of maximum moment. If this condition is not satisfied, a reduction in g4 may be required. Equation 7.10.2-16 does not account for the influence of axial load on shear capacity. An alternate equation is presented in the UW research that accounts for axial load and can be utilized at the designer’s discretion. 7.10.2.H
Corrosion
The design wall thickness for tubes shall be reduced for corrosion over a 75-year minimum design life. Minimum corrosion rates are specified in Section 6.7.1. 7.10.2.I
Side resistance
Concrete filled steel tube shafts, installed by drilling and not driven, require reduced side resistance specified by the geotechnical engineer. Side resistance shall be limited to 10 percent of the nominal (ultimate) side resistance unless otherwise approved by the WSDOT State Geotechnical Engineer. This is due to the overcutting required when installing permanent casing.

CFST-to-Cap Annular Ring Connections CFST-to-cap connections shall be designed as fully-restrained connections capable of resisting all load effects. The preferred connection to a concrete cap includes an annular ring at the top of the embedded tube. The connection design involves:
• Design of the annular ring
• Determination of the embedment depth
• A punching shear evaluation in the cap
• General design of the cap for flexure and shear
• An alternative to the annular ring connection involves using a conventional reinforcing cage to splice the CFST or RCFST to the cap.
• Reinforced concrete connection design 7.10.3.A
Annular Ring
An annular ring shall be welded to the end of the tube to provide anchorage and stress distribution, as shown in Figure 7.10.3-1. The ring shall be made of a steel of the same thickness and grade as the steel tube. The ring shall extend outside and inside the tube a distance of 8t, where t is the thickness of the tube after considering corrosion. The ring shall have 1” diameter vent holes near the connection to the CFST to ensure concrete consolidation under the annular ring. There shall be a minimum of 4 holes equally spaced on the ring both outside the tube and inside the tube as shown in Figure 7.10.3-1.
