Shoulder Rumble Strips
Rumble strips are milled grooves or rows of raised pavement markers placed perpendicular to the direction of travel, or a continuous sinusoidal pattern milled longitudinal to the direction of travel, intended to alert inattentive drivers to a potential lane departure. The sinusoidal pattern can be used when a low noise design is desired. Rumble strips including those placed on the shoulder are considered a proven safety countermeasure by FHWA and can reduce fatal and injury crashes on two-lane rural highways by 36 percent.11
Although rumble strips are a proven roadway safety feature they can affect other users of the roadway, particularly bicyclists. WSDOT serves all roadway users, therefore designs should consider safety purpose and assume the potential presence of active transportation users regardless of the level of usage. Additional information to determine level of bicycle usage include: • Local transportation maps. These maps may be generated at the regional level in a
Metropolitan Planning Organization or Regional Transportation Planning Organization such as bike map for Thurston Regional Planning Council in Thurston County, WA. • WSDOT Bicycle and Pedestrian Count Portal • Active Transportation Division’s State Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinator is a good resource for information on how a particular segment fits into the statewide active transportation network. • Local bicycle groups. Note: When meeting with local bicycle groups include discussion of project needs, safety data, and why rumble strips are being considered. Be open to discuss how to balance all competing and complementary uses of the transportation systems. Also, it is helpful to become familiar with what national advocacy groups are recommending to their membership. Once such National advocacy organization is
Adventure Cycling Association has a website regarding rumble strips and recognizes
WSDOT practices for being bicycle friendly. • Design accommodations for bicyclists should consider within the context, volumes, and adjacent land use: – The design, spacing and placement of rumble strips on roads with signif-icant bicycle traffic and if appropriate how other safety strategies such as wide edge lines, improved curve signing, or speed management if appro-priate for context and land use might work to address the crash potential for all users. • Adjusting rumble strip dimensions12 • Reduce width. For example consider 5 to 6 inch wide rumble strips instead of 12 and
16 inches. If used check for any documentation requirements in the Design Manual. • Reduce depth. For example consider 3/8 inch grooves instead of ½”

Multimodal Planning, Design, and Operational Considerations • Place rumble strips on edge line. The practice allows the placing the edge line pavement markings over the rumble strip. This improves nighttime marking visibility, particularly in wet conditions, by better positioning the marking optics on the back side of each rumble. This practice can also increase the longevity of the markings, particularly within the rumble, due to reduced wear from tires and added protection from plowing activity. • Re-purpose roadway pavement surface if shoulder widening is not possible. Consider narrowing lane width to increase shoulder width to be at least 4’ of usable shoulder or 5’ along barrier. • Providing gaps in periodic cycles to allow opportunities to move across the pattern without riding on the grooves. See Standard Plan M-60.20 for examples of different gap patterns. For highways that allow cyclists this should be considered customary practice. • Providing gaps before and through intersections, manholes, and other objects within the roadway. • Discontinue next to barriers and on downhill side of grades.
Other considerations include effects to future pavement preservation and most specifically bituminous surface treatments. Although it is preferred by the biking community to place rumble strips on the white edge line the rumble strip may be filled in by future bituminous surface treatment. To plan for countermeasures longevity consult with pavement management plans. If the roadway is to be resurfaced in the near future consider the following: • Incorporate into future resurfacing project; or • Delay the rumble strip installation until after roadway is resurfaced.
Consult the Standard Plans (rumble strips) or Plan Sheet Library (rumble stripes) for patterns design guidance. NCHRP Report 641 Guidance for Design and Application of Shoulder and
Centerline Rumble Strips is a good reference.

Active Transportation Design Considerations 1.
Design to reduce speeds – Speed affects severity of pedestrian crashes. As vehicle speeds increase pedestrians and bicyclists who are struck by a driver are more likely to die or serious injury. Also see the Washington State Strategic Highway Safety
Plan, Target Zero, Pedestrian & Bicycle section speed management strategies for consideration. Exhibit 4-7 illustrates the effect of speed on pedestrian survivability.

4.
Network Connectivity – A fundamental concept of transportation is network connectivity: connecting people to where they want to go. Motorists can rely on having access to a complete network. However, this is not the case for pedestrians and bicyclists. Lack of connected infrastructure creates conflict zones with drivers, and higher potential for crashes. Disconnected street networks, highway or railroad barriers, high-crash or uncomfortable intersections, and difficult midblock crossings must be addressed to improve network connectivity and reduce crash exposure.
Appropriate treatments along roadways vary widely based on context. Often times the first place to examine system gaps and opportunities are local plans and maps. 5.
Separate active transportation users from drivers – Exposure to moving motor vehicle traffic can be stressful for people walking and riding bicycles which affects both the appeal of active transportation options and actual trip safety. Comfort and exposure to crashes are closely related. Higher comfort facilities lower crash exposure by locating higher speed heavier vehicles further from lower speed and lighter active transportation. Improved connectivity and comfort for active transportation users benefits all roadway users by providing visibility and predictability, leading to better perception and reaction within the roadway environment.

Low cost countermeasures – These projects offer opportunities to improve conditions for other roadway users using low cost measures especially in urban and rural town contexts where budget constraints would otherwise prevent installation of an improvement. Considerations could include updating older pedestrian crossing signs, replacing/enlarging school zone beacons, adding painted bulb-outs at intersections, and/or narrowing wide lanes to allow wider shoulders or bike lane buffers. There also may be opportunities to partner with other organization efforts such as signal replacement program, etc. that may allow for more cost effective solutions that benefit more roadway users and WSDOT programs.

Bicycle Treatments
Green Bicycle Boxes. A green bicycle box is helpful for routes that are also used as freight routes in order for drivers to better see bicyclists by situating them ahead of drivers at intersections.
Green Bicycle Lane Extensions
Source: AASHTO
Bicycle signals can be used to improve truck and bicycle safety at intersections by separating the turning and allowing for increased conflict point management.
Allowing for independent or early movement of bikes, given their much smaller size increases visibility and allows for necessary maneuvers such as lane changing to occur without higher speed vehicles at intersections.
Protected bike lanes. Protected bike lanes are defined by their separation from the sidewalk and the roadway. Protected bike lanes that are part of a freight network, can provide higher visibility and predictability, information for all travelers. If a protected bike lane cannot be accommodated, a buffered bike lane with vertical separators is recommended.
C.
Curb Extensions

Curb Extension
Source: PedSafe curb extensions extend the curb face to the edge of the nearest driving lane. The curb extension takes the place of a parking lane or shoulder at an intersection or midblock location. They are most commonly applied at intersections where they are intended to reduce the exposure to pedestrian by reducing crossing distance, slowing right-turning vehicles, increasing the line of site between motorists and pedestrians; and providing more space for landscaping or stormwater management, among other features. Curb extensions are also seen in mid-block situations to slow vehicle speeds and reduce crossing distances at mid-block crossings. Curb extensions can affect bicyclist mobility; that design needs to take this into consideration. The description for alternative to pedestrian refuge islands in this section provides an example on how to accommodate bicycles. Also see Design Manual

Pedestrian Refuge Islands
A pedestrian refuge island is typically constructed in the middle of a street at an intersection or midblock locations. It provides a place for pedestrians to stand and wait for a gap in traffic or for drivers to stop. Whereas medians can vary in width, and composition, the minimum width of an island or median to be considered a pedestrian refuge is six feet.
Pedestrian Reguge Island (before/after)
Source: NACTO
Pedestrian refuge islands are considered a proven safety strategy by FHWA with an expected 56 percent reduction in pedestrian crashes. Washington State Strategic Highway
Safety Plan, Target Zero, recommends refuge islands at pedestrian crossings to reduce crash potential.13
This countermeasure is highly desirable for midblock pedestrian crossings on roads with four or more lanes. Some key points are that pedestrian refuge islands minimize the exposed crossing distance; reduce the conflict area; allows pedestrians time to decide to cross one direction at a time; and minimize the effects on vehicular traffic. See Design Manual Chapter
1510 for accessibility Criteria for Raised Medians and Traffic Islands. Also see MUTCD
Sections 3B.10—Approach Markings for Obstructions, 3B.18— Crosswalk Markings, and 3B.23—Curb Markings that provide information regarding use of signs and markings when raised medians or traffic islands are installed. See Standard Plan F-45.10 for dimensions and examples of median cut-through.

I.
Pedestrian Refuge Islands (Alternatives)
A median is the portion of the roadway separating the traveled lane portions of opposing directions, or turn lanes. Medians may be depressed, raised, or ﬂush with the road surface.
Medians less than six feet and not raised do not qualify as a pedestrian refuge. However, they still provide benefits by narrowing the roadway, providing additional and more visible delineation, and contributing to speed management could be considered a low cost modification.
Edge line pedestrian medians can be considered at midblock locations or intersections where turn lanes need to remain. They can also be used in combination with pedestrian refuge islands to shorten the pedestrian crossing distance. These islands differ from medians and pedestrian refuge islands in that they align with the edge of the travel lane and have a bike lane behind them. 13

Pedestrian Signals including Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons (PHBs) and
Half Signals
In some locations drivers may need to come to a complete stop to allow pedestrians to cross a roadway. A pedestrian traffic signal or PHB may be the preferred countermeasure.
These are candidate treatments for crosswalks across roads with three or more lanes that generally have traffic volumes above 9,000 vehicles. Refer to Exhibit 4-2 for other conditions where Pedestrian Signals and PHBs should be considered and MUTCD Sections 4C.05 Pedestrian Volume warrants and 4F-pedestrian hybrid beacons for their application.
Currently the FHWA does not recommend half signals (see Sections 4C.05 and 4C.06 of
MUTCD) nor placing PHB’s at intersections (see Section 4F.02 of MUTCD). Pedestrian signals and PHB’s can be used at roundabout intersection crossings and one- way approaches to intersections such as freeway exit ramps.
Currently, WSDOT prefers the use of pedestrian signals or rectangular rapid flashing beacons (RRFB) over PHB’s due to maintenance and compatibility with existing systems.
If a pedestrian traffic signal or PHB is being considered also examine the feasibility of a raised crosswalk or roundabout at the study location or adjacent intersection. Roundabouts slow driving speeds, provide refuge areas for pedestrians. For more information regarding roundabouts with pedestrians and bicyclists see FHWA Roundabouts with Pedestrians &

K.
Rapid Flash Beacon (RRFB)
RRFB’s are active (user-actuated) or passive (automated detection) amber LEDs that use an irregular flash pattern at mid-block or uncontrolled crossing locations. They significantly increase driver yielding behavior. See Section 4-6.3 for additional guidance on use of RRFB on State Highways.

Road Reallocation for All Modes (Also called Road Diets)
A road reconfiguration, also called a road diet, is a technique in transportation planning whereby the number of motor vehicle travel lanes and/or effective width of the road is reduced in order to achieve systemic improvements. FHWA considers road diets a proven safety strategy to reduce severe crashes. See Section 4-9 for more detailed discussion of roadway relocation.

M. Roundabouts
A roundabout is a type of circular intersection, but is quite unlike a neighborhood traffic circle or large rotary. Roundabouts have been proven safer and more efficient than other types of circular intersections. FHWA identified roundabouts as a Proven Safety
Countermeasure because of their ability to substantially reduce the types of crashes that result in injury or loss of life. Roundabouts are designed to improve safety for all users, including pedestrians and bicycles. They also provide significant operational benefits compared to conventional intersections. Benefits of roundabouts to walkers and bikers include:
Less conflict: Roundabouts have fewer conflict points. A single lane roundabout has 50% fewer pedestrian-vehicle conflict points than a comparable stop or signal controlled intersection. Conflicts between bicycles and vehicles are reduced as well.
Shorter, setback crossings: Pedestrians cross a shorter distance of only one direction of traffic at a time since the entering and exiting flows are separated. Drivers focus on pedestrians apart from entering, circulating and exiting maneuvers.
Lower Speeds: Traffic speed any road or intersection is important for everyone, and especially non-motorized users. Lower speeds is associated with better yielding rates, reduced vehicle stopping distance, and lower risk of serious injury or fatality. Also the speed through a roundabout is more consistent with comfortable bicycle riding speeds.
N.
Raised Crosswalks
Raised Crosswalk
Raised crosswalks function as an extension of a sidewalk and allow a pedestrian to cross the Interstate 35 off-ramp in Austin, Texas
Source: Google street without moving down to street level. The elevated crossing draws attention to the crosswalk. Drivers slow down to cross the raised pedestrian crosswalk. It offers particular benefits for pedestrians using mobility assistance devices such as wheelchairs or walkers; consider land use, transit access and destinations that indicate potential for larger numbers of these users.

Page 4-34
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Multimodal Planning, Design, and Operational Considerations
Chapter 4
FHWA suggests a raised crosswalk is typically a candidate treatment on two-lane or threelane roads with speed limits of 30 mph or less and traffic volumes below 9,000. FHWA also suggested raised crossings are generally avoided on truck routes, emergency routes, and arterial streets. NACTO on the other hand suggests speed tables may be used on collector streets and/or transit and emergency response routes with vehicle operating speeds between 25 mph and 45 mph. Coordinate with emergency services and transit agencies when considering raised crossings.
See MUTCD Section 3B.25—Speed Hump Markings for additional information about markings that can be used alongside raised crosswalks.

Tighter Curb Radii
Tighter curb radii can increase sight lines
Tighter curb radius between driver and pedestrian, shorten the
Source: PedSafe crossing distance time to reduce exposure, bring crosswalks closer to the intersection, shortening crossing distances, and reduce speeds of right-turning drivers. The appropriate radius should be determined for each corner on a case by case based on the design vehicle for each right turn movement. Some key points are that each leg of an intersection may have a different design vehicle; that WSDOT policy provides flexibility when choosing the intersection design vehicle. The purpose for this policy is to balance user needs and avoid the unnecessary expense of oversizing intersections. Considerations include frequency of the design vehicle and effects on other design users, specifically pedestrian crossing distance and times, and bicycle turning and through movements. Consider providing more protected intersection treatments and Section 4-8 of this chapter for discussing about accommodating design vehicles and compound curves for right turn lanes.
Compound right turn curves provides a path that accommodates larger design vehicles and provides a tighter curb radii.

Public Transportation
The need for public transportation in Washington continues to grow in many different ways. Washington is a diverse state with various public transportation markets such as urban and rural, commuter and off-peak, regional and local; and services, such as fixed-route, on-demand, bike/pedestrian facilities, telework, demand management tools and more. The figure below provides examples of different types of public transportation.
M 51-02.10
Definition
Public Transportation includes a broad array of transportation services and systems, public and private, that are accessible and available to the public and do not involve a single person in a motorized vehicle.
Page 4-37 Chapter 4
Multimodal Planning, Design, and Operational Considerations
Washington’s economy benefits demonstrably from public transportation’s contribution to access, mobility and capacity of the transportation system.
Delays on state highways, which are only a portion of the transportation system, cost Washington citizens and businesses over $800 million in 2014.1414 By increasing the person-carrying capacity of our roadways, public transportation supports the speed and reliability of freight movement critical to our statewide economy, and reduces crash potential by lowering the amount of vehicles on the roadway.

Primary Goal of Public
Transportation
Baseline needs of transit capital projects on urban
WSDOT right-of-way can relate to travel time and reliability of service. It may also be to provide access to key destinations, such as schools, hospitals, recreational destinations, or places of business.
Public transportation also benefits the financial well-being of individuals in Washington
State. For example, a person who lives in Seattle can save up to $11,000 a year by simply switching from driving to riding the bus.15 Transit is also important to support growth; space is currency as the transportation system strains from traffic demands. Transit will increase in importance as communities, transit agencies, local agencies, and WSDOT examine ways to maximize the efficiency of the existing transportation system. Exhibit 4-8 illustrates the space needed for different transportation modes.

A robust public transportation network can also support the development of compact, walkable, bikeable communities with lower infrastructure demands and can create hubs of activity that support local economies. 4-7.1
Traffic Operations Role in Public Transportation
WSDOT plays an important role in transit service as state routes affects the quality and safety of transit services. Transit routes often span many jurisdictions and one of our roles is to facilitate project development and coordinate with stakeholders.

Leading through Collaboration
All transportation partners in Washington state work together to provide a system of diverse and integrated public transportation options.
WSDOT plays an important role to help integrate station
People throughout the connections with the surrounding transportation network state use these options to such as highways, local roads, communities, and park make transportation choices and ride lots. A complete trip from origin to destination that enable their families, typically involves one or more connections at either end. communities, economy and environment to thrive. Public
These connections are an important aspect of transit, transportation also ensures and can make the difference between efficient and the reliability, travel time, and inefficient service. This is often referred to as first-mile sustainability of the integrated and last-mile access. Improvements to transit access could transportation system, include looking for off-system solutions such as sidewalk including WSDOT owned right connections into neighborhoods, commercial areas, public of way and facilities. facilities, regional trails, or other strategies developed in coordination with project stakeholders. Off-system solutions are supported by Practical
WSDOT also reviews those facilities directly supporting transit stops and stations such as sidewalks, pathways, and lighting around transit stops and stations. Adding appropriate improvements to projects supports local and regional transit services. Contact transit agencies as part of the project scoping and look for cooperative partnerships to improve transit services.
Section 4-7.2 provides examples of ways to improve public transportation on WSDOT, local agency, or developer projects.

Bus Travel Time and Reliability and Bus Rapid Transit Considerations
Transit agencies in Washington are implementing
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and other bus speed and reliability treatments on WSDOT roads. Treatments such as transit signal priority (TSP), Business Access and Transit (BAT) lanes, and bus queue jumps are part of creating effective bus service, which increases the person-carrying capacity of
WSDOT facilities in a cost-effective manner meeting
WSDOT’s strategic vision. 1.
Partnership

What is Bus Rapid Transit?
BRT can best be described as a combination of facility, systems, and vehicle investments that convert conventional bus services into fixed-facility transit service, greatly increasing their efficiency and effectiveness to the end user.
Consider public transportation agencies as partners working toward common goals. While mindful of core issues such as safety and ongoing operating costs, work with transit agencies to support the WSDOT overall mission and vision. BRT projects differ from private development projects in that the former generate vehicle trips while the later reduce vehicle trips. 2.
Issue Resolution
Identify process to navigate issues as they arise to minimize effects on scope, schedule, and budget. This would be a multi-agency process and should include all involved
WSDOT offices, which may include one or more WSDOT regions, HQ Traffic, and the
Regional Transit Coordination Division (in central Puget Sound). 3.
Practical Solutions
Follow the intent of Design Manual Practical purpose and context. Work with the transit agency to define baseline needs and measures, such as transit travel time, transit reliability, transit priority, pedestrian access to stations, connectivity between transit routes, and safety. Contextual needs should include examination of existing general purpose vehicle travel, impacts to active transportation travel/safety, existing/planned land use. 4.
Performance Measures.

What are baseline needs for transit projects? • Reducing transit travel time • Increasing transit reliability • Improving transit connections • Improving transit priority • Improving pedestrian and bicycle access to stations • Enhancing system identity • Increasing travel comfort • Enhancing safety & security
Identify key performance measures that will guide guidance on defining baseline needs, performance metrics, and contextual needs.
When considering performance metrics consider transportation measures beyond vehicle based capacity analysis. Also see Section 4-5.

Traffic and Intersection Control Analysis Coordination and Quality Control
Traffic analysis and intersection control evaluations including BRT systems include complicated traffic interactions. Amplified coordination should be conducted between the department, transit agency, consultant team(s), and other affected agencies.
Coordination is necessary to communicate expectations, reduce misunderstandings, and promote efficiency and quality control. This helps reduce unexpected issues, delays, and extra costs.

6.
Example QA/QC process
The Protocol for Vissim simulation can be adapted to for corridor and intersection evaluations and Region traffic offices should require that the transit agency’s consultant to prepare a plan prior to beginning a traffic study or intersection control evaluation.
Design Considerations • Many of the active transportation design considerations mentioned in Section 4-11.4 and 4-12.2 of this section apply to Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). • BRT systems may run in a dedicated pathway separate from the general purpose lanes of traffic. As such, they are expected to run independent of other traffic.
At intersections, however, the BRT system must interact with general traffic. • BRT vehicles may need priority or pre-emption at signalized intersections. • Roundabouts have shown efficiencies, serious and fatal injury crash reductions, and travel time improvements when applied as corridor improvements. This may allow for narrower cross sections between intersections that can be re-allocated for other modes. Roundabouts may be signalized or metered to allow for transit priority.
Concerns expressed by transit agencies include roundabouts do not provide bus priority, create long walking distances, or cost more than preferred traffic signal improvements. Contact HQ Traffic Operations for design and operations modeling assistance. • Pedestrian and bicycle crossings are an important aspect of BRT designs, especially for connecting to other BRT routes, light rail, or other public transportation or bike share systems. Additional crossings may be necessary at median stops. The Traffic
Impact Analysis and ICE should include pedestrian and bicycle access design to BRT stops. Contact HQ Traffic Operations for design assistance. Bike lanes running on the same roadways also require consideration to reduce conflicts with buses and transit users. • BRT vehicles dimensions vary and their turning radii can affect intersection design and interaction with general traffic. For example, an articulated bus typically has a tighter turning radius than the 40 foot coaches. It is important for the designer to check with local transit agency to get information to use in modeling swept paths.
AutoTURN default inputs may not always represent coach turning movements. • BRT projects at the core are people moving projects. Look for opportunities to increase the number, and improve the safety and convenience, of active transportation facilities on and adjacent to BRT routes including first and last mile connections. 7.
Operations and Maintenance • Identify infrastructure elements and agency maintenance responsibilities.
Responsibilities should be included in an inter-governmental agreement.

Freight Transportation

Freight Economics they need. Virtually every business and household depend
On a per capita basis, on freight delivery for shipping and receiving goods –
Washington is the secondin many cases multiple times a day. The growth of most trade-dependent state in the nation, behind Michigan, ecommerce has increased the simplicity of purchasing with total imports and exports products and masks the details of a complicated system valued at $126.8 billion. that permits and sustains such activity. Freight - 2017 Washington State transportation and goods movement involves a complex
Freight System Plan and dynamic network of logistics and supply chains. Freight logistics relies on the multimodal transportation system in Washington. As a result this multimodal system is vital to the economy of the state and country in many ways.
It underpins the national and state economies, supports national defense, directly sustains hundreds of thousands of jobs, and delivers the daily necessities of life to residents.
As the population grows freight traffic or distribution of products will grow to and adapt as the ways to order and deliver goods and services changes. Freight traffic in Washington
State is expected to grow by about 30 percent by 2035.
How WSDOT designs highways could have an effects on freight mobility? This section will cover two concepts: 1) background on the freight network in Washington State and; 2) Examples of design considerations when dealing with freight as part of the multimodal network.

Freight Transportation System
The following is an introduction to the various freight networks in Washington State. These networks will help define modal priorities and context for the project. See Design Manual
A.
National Multimodal Freight Network (interim)
This network, when finalized, is intended to inform freight transportation planning and funding processes. NFMN maps for Washington State are available from the USDOT.
B.

National Highway System
The National Highway System (NHS) is considered the backbone of the nation’s economy, as well as being critical to its defense and mobility networks. The NHS is an important component of the eligibility criteria for the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway
Projects Program for highway or bridge projects. A total of 4,556 centerline miles are designated as NHS routes in Washington, including 3,577 miles of state highways and 979 miles of local roads. Subsets of the NHS include: • Intermodal Connectors. These highways provide access between major intermodal facilities and the other four subsystems making up the National Highway System.
There are 87 designated NHS intermodal connectors in Washington, some of which are freight-related. Port intermodal connectors are the most common type of freight intermodal connector representing 45 percent of all NHS intermodal connectors in the state. • Strategic Highway Network. The Strategic Highway Network (STRAHNET) is a designated national network that is important to national strategic defense and used for emergency mobilization and peacetime movement of military vehicles. This 63,000-mile network provides defense access, continuity, and emergency capabilities for defense purposes. This network is a component of the NHS.
C.
National Highway Freight Network with WSDOT and other partners to strategically direct federal resources and policies toward improved performance of highway portions of the U.S. freight transportation system.
Components of the NHFN include: • Primary Highway Freight Systems (PHFS) is a network of highways identified as the most critical highway portions of the U.S. freight transportation system determined by measurable and objective national data. The network consists of 41,518 centerlines miles, including 37,436 centerline miles of Interstate and 4,082 centerline miles of nonInterstate roads. 16

Chapter 4 • Non-Primary Highway Freight Systems (non-PHFS). These highways consist of the remaining portion of Interstate roads not included in the PHFS. These routes provide important continuity and access to freight transportation facilities. These portions amount to an estimated 9,843 centerline miles of Interstate, nationwide, and will fluctuate with additions and deletions to the Interstate Highway System. • Critical Rural Freight Corridors (CRFC). These are public roads not in an urbanized area which provide access and connection to the PHFS and the Interstate with other important ports, public transportation facilities, or other intermodal freight facilities.
Nationwide, there are 4,412 centerline miles designated as CRFCs. • Critical Urban Freight Corridors (CUFC). These are public roads in urbanized areas which provide access and connection to the PHFS and the Interstate with other ports, public transportation facilities, or other intermodal transportation facilities. Nationwide, there are 2,213 centerline miles designated as CUFCs.
D.
Freight and Goods Transportation System
The Freight and Goods Transportation System (FGTS) is a Washington-specific designation system, separate from the national designation. FGTS truck corridors classifies all highways, county roads, and city streets by reported annual gross truck tonnage, ranging from T-1, with the highest tonnage, to T-5, with the least tonnage. Corridor classification and maps can be found at the WSDOT FGTS website.
E.
Truck Freight Economic Corridors
The designations were built on the FGTS classification by considering resiliency and firstmile and last-mile connectivity. A truck freight economic corridor designation helps inform how freight connectors are being used by industry, and inform future planning efforts to identify the needs and opportunities for improving those connectors. The Truck Freight
Economic Corridors include the following components: • High volume truck corridors: T-1 and T-2 freight corridors (as defined in the FGTS) carrying at least 4 million tons of gross truck tonnage per year. • Alternate freight routes: routes that serve as alternatives to primary cross-state freight routes during severe weather or other disruptions to increase freight system resiliency. • First-mile or last-mile connector routes: routes that connect freight intensive land uses to high volume and alternate routes. These routes provide important freight linkage to strategic national defense facilities, significant intermodal facilities, warehouse districts, industrial land and distribution centers, and agricultural processing centers.

Types of Trucks
Trucks and buses come in a variety of sizes.
These sizes and overall dimensions are dictated by the type of transit route or goods, materials, being transported. Trucks typically range from 8.5- to 10.0-feet wide, and with permits can be even wider.
The American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) has classified the most common sized trucks on United States roadways based either on the overall length of the vehicle (buses and single unit trucks) or vehicle wheel base (tractor-trailers). The classifications include but are not limited to: • SU-30: 30.0-foot, single unit vehicles typical of most local delivery vehicles. • WB-40 and WB-50: small tractor trailers with wheelbases in the 40.0-foot and 50.0-foot range. • WB-67: 67-foot wheelbase long haul trucks, sometimes called the interstate design vehicle that has an overall length on the order of 74.0-feet.
Transit agencies operate a wide variety of city buses.
For purposes of determining the swept path contact transit agencies affected by the project to city bus dimensions and turning specifications.
Other vehicles include various emergency vehicles, and public works maintenance trucks.
The figure on this page shows the typical dimensions of the most commonly used AASHTO design vehicles.
Additional information on these and other design vehicles can be found in the AASHTO
Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.

Design for” versus “Accommodate” appropriate design vehicle, many factors such as the number and type of trucks, functional classification of the highway, transit use, pedestrians and bicyclist shall be considered. See
The concept of design vehicle involves providing a path for the vehicle that is free of encroachments upon other lanes, and facilities such as sidewalks. The Design Vehicle is the largest typical vehicle that will commonly use the street. It is acceptable for the design vehicle to use all of the first lane, and part of the second lane of the receiving street. In multilane roundabouts, it is considered “designing” for large trucks for them to take both lanes to navigate the roundabout.
Providing a design that accommodates a vehicle means that some level of encroachment upon other lanes is inevitable for the vehicle to make a particular movement. The accommodated vehicle is the largest vehicle that will rarely use the street. It is expected to use mountable elements, and may enter the lane adjacent to its lane of origin. The decision to design or accommodate will be based upon the context of the highway/ intersection under consideration. A balanced design approach takes into consideration more than just the amount of room required by the design vehicle. For example: • What is the intended operating speed of the facility? • What is the context? Designing for the largest but rare vehicle may result in an overdesigned intersection that is not compatible with other modes. • How does the design affect pedestrians and bicyclists? For example, large turning radii at intersections increase the speed of drivers making the turns, and the time it takes to cross the road for pedestrians. So, designing for a large design vehicle will increase speeds and travel distances for all users, thereby increasing crash potential for all road users without proper consideration of the potential effects.

Oversize-Overweight and other unique vehicles
Planning for freight does not end with selecting a standard design vehicle. Other types of freight traffic may be affected by a highway or intersection project. For example if the highway is near a port then accommodating very long loads such as wind turbine blades may be necessary. Identifying vehicle types includes reviewing the surrounding land use, transit plans, community input. Contact the Rail, Freight, and Ports Division and Commercial Vehicle
Services to obtain information on how a unique freight could possible effect the project site.

Emerging freight delivery modes
Bicycle delivery in urban areas represents another freight delivery mode that may be a factor. Cargo bicycles and tricycles are wider than a traditional two-wheeled bicycle. In some locations a freight corridor may provide the only feasible connection for the active transportation network. 4-8.6
A.

Design Considerations
Multi-centered Corners (Compound Curves)
When trucks turn, particularly tractor-trailers, they sweep a path that can best be simulated by a series of curves. A simplified approach shown by the figure to the right would use two or three compound curves to best match the pathway of the truck. By using this approach, the full swept path of the design vehicle can be designed for and larger vehicles checked for accommodation, if appropriate, while still minimizing the amount of roadway surface.
Minimizing roadway surface also manages crossing distances, signal pole arm lengths, maintenance, improves distance vehicles travel through the intersection, and reduces project cost. These designs also allow for a tighter radius corner, which will help promote speed reduction for drivers of smaller vehicles making the turn. This figure illustrates this.

Setback for Stop Bar Placement
Signalized intersections can be striped to improve the overall geometry for turning trucks without compromising traffic engineering requirements. Stop bar location on both the street a truck is turning from, as well as the cross street approach the truck driver is turning into, can have a dramatic effect on the accommodation of truck driver turning movements.
Moving back the STOP bar can also assist pedestrian crossing movements and allow for a relatively small curb radii. 2. Setback for Stop Bar Placement

Mountable Curbs
Mountable curbs can provide a means for a large truck to more easily navigate while making a turn. These types of curbs are mostly useful for at driveways, intersections, medians, or splitter islands. Use at intersection corners; however, should only be considered on a limited basis and must be carefully designed to minimize trucks from overrunning pedestrian areas. Mountable curbs are also used at roundabouts. Standard Plans Section F has several mountable curb options including Standard Plan F-10.18 that is specific to roundabouts. 3. Mountable Curbs
D.
Left Turn Medians
Left turning vehicles are generally more controlled than right turning vehicles due to a greater number of vehicle-to-vehicle conflicts. Goods movement and livability concerns focus heavily on median nose treatments. Medians can provide pedestrian refuge, especially for large intersections. Full curb medians are most effective for pedestrian safety, but reduce the turning area for large vehicles. They also can be easily damaged if a truck’s rear wheels run over them. Mountable and painted treatments are sometimes used, but can introduce conflicts between pedestrians and trucks. Truncating the median nose prior to the crosswalk is another option, but will not provide pedestrian refuge.
E.
Bicycle Treatments
Bike boxes, bicycle signals, and protected bike lanes can be helpful for routes that are also used as freight routes. See Section 4-6.6 for further rther information. inf
Green Bicycle Boxes – A green bicycle box is helpful for routes that are also used as freight routes in order for drivers to better see bicyclists by situating them ahead of drivers at intersections.

Chapter 4 5. Roundabouts
Roundabouts
User perspectives regarding roundabouts are generally very context-sensitive. For 5.pedestrians 5. Roundabouts and bicyclists, roundabouts can be particularly effective in creating a more comfortable operating environment for all roadway users. Motorists benefit from roundabouts where delays and crash severities are substantially reduced and safety improved compared to stop-control or signal-control. Even if there are peak times when motorists are delayed at a roundabout, the peak hour delay needs to be considered with respect to the overall daily delay benefit. Truck drivers can similarly benefit from reduced delays, particularly where the cost of coming to, and accelerating from, a full stop can be eliminated; but care in design is necessary to all for a roundabout design that accommodates large vehicles.
Roundabouts can require more right-of-way than typical intersections at the immediate junction, but less right-of-way upstream due to the ability to reduce turn lane lengths or eliminate turn-lanes. Specific considerations regarding roundabouts are in Design Manual

Work Zones
Effective temporary traffic control strategies allow all road users to successfully maneuver through or around work areas while still permitting needed work to be completed efficiently and economically. Chapter 5 provides a detailed work zone discussion. The following are examples of work zone traffic management techniques that address commercial vehicles:
Road Narrowing and
Restricting Vehicle Clearance
If a construction or maintenance project is narrowing the roadway or restricting the vertical clearance, WSDOT
Commercial Vehicle Services needs to be contacted in advance.

Work Zone Queue Warning System. At 65 MPH, it may take fully loaded semi-tractor and trailers at least 7 seconds and
500 feet to stop per the Work Zone Safety Consortium.
It is critical for drivers of large truck to anticipate queued traffic and get slowed down in advance. Queue warning systems have reduced associated collisions up to 45 percent per the FHWA supported Work Zone Safety Consortium report. Examples of queue warning systems include Truck Mounted PCMS and Smart Work Zone Systems.
Portable Transverse Rumble Strips. Portable transverse rumble strips serve to increase driver alertness by providing both an audible warning and physical vibration as the vehicle’s tires cross over them.

Road Reallocation (aka Road Diets)
Wide street crossings can be major impediments
Benefits of Roadway to pedestrian access, connectivity, and increase crash reallocation potential; therefore, an effective countermeasure for
Four to three lane roadway pedestrians is a “road diet.” A roadway reallocation known conversions have documented as a road diet offers several high-value improvements at crash reductions from 19 to a low cost when applied to traditional undivided highways.
47 percent according to FHWA
The primary benefits include reduced crossing distance, space for separated travel, mobility, and access for road users and a “complete streets” environment to accommodate a variety of transportation modes. FHWA considers road diets a proven safety countermeasure due to proven effectiveness in reducing fatalities and serious injuries.
Lane diets involve reducing the width of the travel lanes and road diets involve removing one or more lanes of traffic and, in some cases, reducing the width of the travel lanes. The excess space is converted into space for pedestrians or cyclists, such as wider sidewalks, curb extensions, medians, pedestrian refuge areas, or bicycle facilities. In rural and suburban areas lane diets or narrowing can reduce intersection crash potential by reducing traffic speeds and improving conspicuity of intersections.17
Road diet benefits include a crash reduction of 19 to
47 percent of all crashes, all severities according to FHWA’s
Road Diets/Roadway Reconfiguration webpage. Road diets also result in reduced vehicle speed differential, improved mobility and access for all road users, and integration of the roadway into surrounding uses that results in an enhanced quality of life. A key feature of a road diet is that it allows reclaimed space to be allocated for other uses, such as turn lanes, bus lanes, pedestrian refuge islands, bike lanes, sidewalks, bus shelters, parking, or landscaping. Other road diet benefits include:

What about traffic volume?
FHWA advises roads with traffic volumes of 20,000 or less are good candidates for road reallocations. However,
City of Seattle has successfully implemented projects on roads greater than 20,000 vehicles per day. Reports on
City of Seattle’s road diets are available on their reports & studies website.
The key is to understand the purpose and need for intervention, understand community priorities, and communicate tradeoffs such as increased side street delays.
Often communities are willing to trade some additional peak hour congestion for safer more livable roads. • Reduced rear-end and left-turn crashes due to the dedicated left-turn lanes • Reduced right-angle crashes as side street motorists cross three versus four travel lanes • Fewer lanes for pedestrians to cross • Opportunity to install pedestrian refuge islands, bicycle lanes, on-street parking, and/or transit stops • Traffic calming and more consistent speeds • A more community-focused, “Complete Streets” environment that better accommodates the needs of all road users 17

A road diet can be a low-cost safety solution when planned in conjunction with a simple pavement resurfacing project, and the reconfiguration can be accomplished at no additional cost. An example is provided Section 4-9.C where a roadway was simply re-striped after a chip seal application.
Road diets or lane diets are not appropriate for all roadways.
Careful analysis to help determine the feasibility needs to be done up front utilizing traffic count data, existing and future traffic volumes, type of road, and the need and purpose of the project to determine whether the street or road is suitable for a road or lane diet.
FHWA’s Road Diets/Roadway Reconfiguration webpage states a number of strategies may be considered to reconfigure the street to reduce vehicle and pedestrian crashes, while simultaneously increasing vehicle flow and reducing vehicle speeds.
A.
Design Considerations
When converting a four-lane road into a two-lane road with a two-way left turn lane, medians or pedestrian refuge areas may be placed at intersections or mid-block pedestrian crossing locations.
The practitioner should determine the types of vehicles that primarily use the street before reducing the lane widths.

Road Diet Plus
The Road Diet Plus is borne from the convergence of the standard road diet, the safety advantages of the modern roundabout, and the throughput advantages of the modern roundabout in a corridor. La Jolla Blvd in
San Diego is an example of a
Road Diet Plus. Priorities for this 23,000+ ADT corridor were livability, economic development, and traffic calming. Results included higher retail sales, lower noise, reduced traffic speeds,
90 percent drop in crashes, and spurred new development.

A similar concept can be applied to state highway interchanges to reduce the need to widen structures and to provide the opportunity to reallocate space for other purposes.
A best management practice may be considered for utilizing mountable curbs on narrower lanes to accommodate larger vehicles.

Work Zone Traffic Control
General
Effective temporary traffic control strategies allow all road users to successfully maneuver through or around work areas while still permitting needed work to be completed efficiently and economically. The following goals apply to work zones: • Give safety highest priority for both highway workers and traveling public • Manage congestion to maintain mobility through and/or around work zones • Be cost effective with resources taxpayers and legislature entrust to us.
Work zone traffic control planning needs consideration early, as it greatly impacts how and what work is completed. Work zones are interdependent with design, construction, maintenance, and traffic operations; what happens to one affects the others. The better we understand these interactions, the more successful and cost effective projects will be.
There is no “cookbook” solution to all work zones; solutions require innovation, adaptation, and ingenuity. Work zone design and operation is as much art as science.
Properly mitigating work zone impacts to all road users is a critical component in the successful design, construction, maintenance, and operation of a fully functional highway system and is required by federal regulations and state policy.
Road users include, but are not limited to: • Pedestrians, including those with disabilities • Bicyclists • Motorists, including motorcyclists • Commercial Vehicle Freight operators, including oversized/overweight permitted vehicles • Transit operators and users 5-2
Federal and State Laws Applicable to Work Zones
Work zones are subject to numerous federal laws, state laws and codes, and standards that are critical to understand:

A.
Federal Laws
23 CFR Part 630 J focuses on work zone standards, policy, and processes: • The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (currently 2009 MUTCD) is the national standard for traffic control on all public roads • States shall develop policy to systematically consider and manage work zone impacts • All significant projects shall have Transportation Management Plans unless the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) grants an exception based on the State’s ability to show a specific project will not have sustained work zone impacts. • States shall perform a work zone process review at least every two years
WSDOT Traffic Manual

Work Zone Principles & Considerations 1.
Guide all road users in a clear, positive, and safe manner through or around work zones utilizing sufficient signage, delineation, and channelization. Work zones should be “self-explanatory” to road users the maximum extent feasible. Abrupt, unexpected changes in roadway geometrics should be avoided. 2.
Consistent and proper installation of temporary traffic control devices to optimize road user expectancy and compliance which enhance work zone safety and improve mobility. 3.
Remove traffic control devices when they are no longer applicable, otherwise they may be soon disregarded. 4.
Avoid placing traffic control devices that inhibit movement of other road users unless accommodations are provided. • Maintain a clear temporary pedestrian accessible route of at least 48 inches in width or use 7-foot minimum mounting height when it is necessary to place traffic control signage within the limits of existing sidewalks 5.
Separate decision points; avoid having road users react to two events at the same location. • Avoid lane closure tapers adjacent to merging on-ramp traffic due to conflicting merges • Avoid lane closure or lane shift tapers within limits of horizontal curves

6.
Page 5-6
Consider positive protection devices whenever practical. Positive protection devices enhance safety for both road users and workers by using physical barriers not easily penetrated by errant vehicles, such as transportable attenuators or temporary barriers.
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control 7.
Chapter 5
Design work zones to operate in a manner consistent with the desired target speed dependent upon desired mobility, operation, and safety objectives. • Per MUTCD, drivers reduce their speeds only if they clearly perceive a need to do so • Avoid reductions greater than 10 mph below the existing speed limit unless a unique, restrictive condition is present. Work crews should also be present • Avoid “overdesigning” work zones (e.g. using a lane closure taper designed for
60 mph when a 45 mph work zone speed limit is posted) • All work zone speed limit reductions shall be approved per Secretary’s Executive
Order E 1060.02 and in compliance with Project Delivery Memo #19-01 8.
Manage adverse work zone impacts to road users overall while balancing the need to efficiently, economically, and safely complete work. • Regions may decide to implement closures with high traffic impacts occurring over shorter durations (days) versus traditional methods with lower traffic impacts occurring occur over several months or years. In particular, these aggressive closure strategies are justified when there are substantial benefits that more than offset the adverse traffic impacts including significant reduction in working days, considerable cost savings during construction, and enhanced safety benefits for both road users and workers. For such closures, Region Administrator approval should be obtained.

9.
Maintain effective public relations starting early in Design and lasting throughout
Construction phases for projects with high-impact closures. • During planning, work closely with stakeholders and local agencies to understand their concerns and needs during these closures as well as obtaining their concurrence. This will aid in avoiding surprises with unplanned, lengthy delays. • Develop traffic closure, detour, and/or alternative route schematics for the public and media use to visually explain the limits of the closure and how to navigate through and around them. • Explain the anticipated work zone congestion and delays as well as what time of day they are expected. • Consider different outreach tools (news coverage, social media, WSDOT blogs) • Encourage alternative modes of transportation (carpools and public transit) and to delay trips to early morning/late evening hours to manage work zone congestion

Work Zone Traffic Control
Work Zone Mobility, Corridor, and Network Management
The traditional practice of only permitting closure hours with minimal traffic impacts is still desirable on many roadways, but is becoming increasingly less feasible or economical due to higher traffic volumes persisting later into the evenings and beginning earlier in the mornings on congested corridors. Per Secretary Executive Order E 1001.02, traffic delays should be minimized while the safety of workers and the traveling public be the highest priority. Thus, proactive work zone congestion management strategies are necessary to effectively complete work while still maintaining mobility and maintaining safety. Work zone mobility management should be a priority beginning early in Design and continuing throughout Construction.
First and foremost, it is important to understand actual work hours are significantly less than the closure hours. In other words, for work operations such as HMA paving, a permitted 5-hour closure may only result in 2.5 working hours. If not addressed, this may result in the project duration extending into two construction seasons, also known as “wintering over”.
For the areas where reasonable duration of work shift is challenging to obtain, it may become necessary to select an extended closure duration resulting in congestion.
Therefore, it is necessary to understand the following: • When to avoid work zone congestion (Section 5-6.A) • Work zone congestion management strategies (Section 5-6.B) • Closure coordination along detours and alternative routes (Section 5-6.C) • Detour route considerations (Section 5-6.D)
For detailed guidance for various extended closure strategies see the following: • Extended Intermediate-Term Duration Closures (Section 5-7) • Long-Term Duration Closures & Reconfigurations (Section 5-8)

A.
When to Avoid Work Zone Congestion
Typical periods to avoid work zone congestion include certain times and events, such as the following: • During weekday AM/PM commutes & school hours
During weekday commutes there may be limited flexibility for alternative schedules or fewer discretionary trips, resulting in minimal traffic diversion and higher traffic impacts.
Morning and evening commute periods vary significantly in time and duration depending on its specific location and are best determined by obtaining actual traffic volumes or conduct field observations. Be sure to take into account local operations such as work shift changes at major corporations, school and daycare traffic, or other events that generate traffic surges over a short duration.
Without the availability of better data or information, then assume the following weekday commute hours in congested, urban areas: – AM Commute @ 4:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. – PM Commute @ 2:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.
Page 5-8
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5

Without the availability of better data or information, then assume the following weekday commute hours in more rural areas: – AM Commute @ 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. – PM Commute @ 2:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. • During Friday afternoons and Sundays on recreational routes
Recreational routes tend to experience much higher volumes on weekends, typically in the inbound direction Friday afternoons and the outbound direction on Sunday. Such roads include I-90 over Snoqualmie Pass, U.S. 2 over Stevens Pass, and SR109 between
Ocean Shores and Aberdeen.
Recreational periods vary significantly in time and duration depending on its specific location and are best determined by obtaining actual traffic volumes or conduct field observations. • During major regional special events
Major sporting events, concerts, fairs, etc. generate significant traffic volumes increases, typically up to two hours prior going towards the event (inbound) and up to two hours after existing the event (outbound). In contrast, all-day events tend to see increased volumes spread out over the day without the large “spikes” experienced with games or concerts. • During major statewide special events
Major special events can generate traffic across the state. Volumes on intrastate corridors such as Interstate 90 increase in one direction at the beginning of the weekend and then increase in the opposite direction at the end of the weekend. • During significant local special events
Significant local special events can generate large, but localized traffic impacts that need to be considered. Such events include runs, bike rides, or festivals.
B.
Work Zone Congestion Management Strategies
When causing work zone congestion, detailed work zone traffic analysis needs to be performed by the Region Traffic Operations to determine anticipated delays and queues (Section 5-9) when determining closures, permitted closure hours, and working with
TDGMO to determine the value of any interim liquidated damages.
The WSDOT Transportation Data, GIS & Modeling Office (TDGMO) can assistant Regions by providing work zone traffic analysis to help determine expected queuing and delays.
Only TDGMO has the authority to determine the maximum interim liquidate damage values;
Region Traffic Operations will assign the actual interim liquidated damage value for each closure based on the maximum allowable amounts determined by TDGMO (Section 5-14).
Based on the anticipated traffic impacts, additional work zone mobility, safety, and traffic demand management strategies may need to be considered: • Advanced Notification
Use Portable Changeable Message Signs (PCMSs) or Class A signs to provide notice at least one week notification in advance of closures with high traffic impacts.

WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10
Page 5-9 Chapter 5
Work Zone Traffic Control • Public Outreach
WSDOT Communications serves an invaluable role in reaching out to the general public and stakeholders. They serve as the “front-line” spokesperson for WSDOT by working with news media, utilizing social media, and responding to citizen inquires.
Using their established relationships with various stakeholders (including local interest groups), it is valuable to obtain concurrence, or at least understanding, of high-impact closures during Planning and Design before projects go to Construction.
During Construction, prior to the high-impact closures, WSDOT can collaborate with these stakeholders to help determine when high-impact closures occur to reduce adverse impacts as well as providing advanced notification. • WSDOT Traffic Management Centers (TMCs)
Utilizing their access to permanent variable message signs, Regional TMCs may provide advance notification for upcoming significant, high-impact closures and provide realtime information for major incidents and closure status. TMCs typically only provide supplemental messaging so critical messages (major incidents, silver alerts, blue alerts, etc.) can be displayed if necessary.
During Design, working with Region Traffic Operations, collaborate with the TMC to determine to what extent these permanent systems can supplement the project’s messaging methods (portable Highway Advisory Radio, PCMSs, etc.).
During Construction, working with Region Traffic Operations, provide TMCs notification of upcoming of high-impact closures preferably two weeks in advance.
On Active Traffic and Demand Management corridors (only present in the Northwest
Region at this time), lane usage symbols and speed limits can be displayed in real-time to supplement the temporary traffic control closures. • WSDOT Incident Response Team (IRT)
Because capacity is already minimized in work zones, vehicle breakdowns or collisions can have significant adverse traffic impacts if not resolved quickly. IRT minimizes response times by collaborating with WSDOT TMC, police and emergency agencies, and towing companies to relocate or remove the blocking vehicles quickly.
During significant high-impact closures, consider placing IRT and towing services (under
IRT’s direction) on standby in strategic work zone locations in the event disabled vehicles need to be quickly towed. See Section 5-16.E for details.
During Design, engage IRT to determine anticipated costs and ensure reimbursement funding is provided for this operation via internal accounting methods. Verify necessary
IRT staff is available and how they will be requested and utilized. • WSDOT Maintenance and Internal Staff Assistance
During major closures, advanced notification and closure notification signage may be necessary as far as 50 miles from the actual closure in isolated locations. An example of such a scenario would be a week-long closure of the Hood Canal Bridge where the shortest detour route is over 100 miles and 2½ hours.

Page 5-10
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5
Instead of arranging for Contractors to provide such services over such a vast area, an alternative approach is to arrange for the collaboration of several WSDOT Maintenance and/or IRT staff to perform duties in their own local areas. Ensure funding is available for reimbursement of services rendered via internal accounting methods. • WSDOT Signal Operations Assistance
During significant closures or detours, temporary adjustments to WSDOT- operated traffic signals may be necessary due to large increases in traffic along detour or alternative routes.
Engage the Region’s Signal Operations group during Design and then provide advanced notification in Construction preferably two weeks prior to the major closure. If needed, ensure funding is available for this operation for reimbursement for services rendered via internal accounting methods. • Local Agency Signal Operations Assistance
During significant closures or detours, temporary adjustments to Local Agency operated traffic signals may be necessary due to large increases in traffic along detour or alternative routes.
Engage the local agency during Design and then provide advanced notification in
Construction preferably two weeks prior to the major closure. Any agreements should be included in the Transportation Management Plan. • Motorist Use of GPS Technology
A majority of motorists use GPS for navigation purposes which may provide motorists an optional alternative route in real-time based on shortest travel time automatically (without needing extensive traffic control messaging) that effectively reduces work zone delays and queues by redistributing traffic across multiple corridors.

C.
Coordinate Closures along Detours & Alternative Routes during HighImpact Closures
It is critical to restrict concurrent lane or ramp closures on parallel, alternative routes during high-impact closures. In Design, it should be determined if such closure restrictions are necessary by working with the Region Traffic Operations. If needed, be sure to include the closure restrictions in the Contract PS&E.
During Construction, Region Traffic Operations may still allow these restricted lane or ramp closures to occur on a case-by-case basis, but may reduce allowable hours to account for the additional traffic volumes that will be diverted onto the detour or alternative route.
Example: A full closure of southbound Interstate 5 (SB I-5) is occurring overnight in
Vancouver, Washington. Thus, any concurrent lane closures along SB I-205 (parallel, alternative route) should be delayed until the work zone capacity can handle the additional traffic volumes from the SB I-5 closure. The SB I-5 to SB I-205 ramp should remain open during the SB I-5 as well as any ramps along the detour route or alternative route path.
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10
Page 5-11 Chapter 5
Work Zone Traffic Control

D.
Detour Route Considerations
Detour routes using local agency roadways require detour agreements, which should be completed in Design and included in the Transportation Management Plan. Coordinate early with local agencies, especially for significant road or ramp closures. In Construction, collaboration is needed to prevent conflicting concurrent closures along the detour route.
Consider rather the detour route can accommodate commercial vehicles, particularly oversized/overweight permitted vehicles, during closures. If travel restrictions are necessary, contact WSDOT Commercial Vehicle Services in advance (Section 5-15).
Consider the detour route’s capacity. Of particular concern are signalized intersections at the beginning of the detour where only a single left-turn lane is provided operating as a protected movement (left only on green arrow).
Mitigations may include uniform police officers controlling traffic at any problematic intersections until traffic volumes are low enough to resume normal signal operation or to temporarily adjust signal timing.
Permissive-protect single left-turn lane, protected double left-turn lanes, and right turns serve greater traffic volumes and typically do not require additional mitigation.
Be cautious of all-way stop intersections along a detour route as they have capacities as low as 600 vehicles/hour (from all approaches).
Pedestrian and bicyclist detour routes should be short, in close proximity, and have accessibility features and grades comparable to the existing route to maximize their use.
Provide advanced closure signage at decision points far enough in advance to allow the opportunity to utilize alternative routes without backtracking given that these users may have expended considerable physical effort reaching the closure and may not have access to check websites or other postings regarding upcoming work.

5-7
Extended Intermediate-Term Duration Closures
Intermediate-term duration closures are defined as those lasting 3 days or less and include weekend-duration closures (Friday night to Monday morning). Extended closures permit closure hours to extend beyond those normally used in PS&E and result in work zone congestion.
When it has been identified and utilizing extended closure hours is justified, detailed work zone traffic analysis needs to be performed by the Region Traffic Operations to determine anticipated delays and queues (Section 5-9) to determine permitted extended closure hours and any associated interim liquidated damages (Section 5-14). The WSDOT Transportation
Data, GIS & Modeling Office (TDGMO) can provide Regions assistance with work zone traffic analysis and determine maximum allowable interim liquidated damages.
Diversion rates used in work zone traffic analysis are determined by Region Traffic
Operations based on considerations such as the quality and number of alternative routes available, special event occurrence, and quality of public outreach.
Page 5-12
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10

Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5
In the Contract PS&E, clearly list permitted extended closures including days and times, maximum number allowable, and restrictions on what work operations are allowed to utilize the extended closures.
When work zone queues are anticipated to exceed more than 1 mile, consider work zone safety management strategies (Section 5-17), including a work zone queue warning system, in addition to implementing work zone congestion management strategies (Section 5-6.B).
There are several extended intermediate-term duration closure strategies available, including: • Extended weeknights (Section 5-7.A) • Extended Friday night into Saturday morning (Section 5-7.B) • Extended Saturday night into Sunday morning (Section 5-7.C) • Extended weekend morning closures (Section 5-7.D) • Weekend-duration lane closures (Section 5-7.E) • Weekend-duration road closures (Section 5-7.F)
A.
Extended Weeknight Closures
After the weekday PM commute, decreasing traffic volumes allows any work zone queues to dissipate overnight. Thursday PM volumes tend to be higher later into the evening compared to other weeknights.
Traffic typically diverts around congested work zones using alternative routes, which reduces the traffic volume the work zone must serve. Diversion rates used in work zone traffic analysis are determined by Region Traffic Operations based on considerations such as the quality and number of alternative routes available, special event occurrence, and quality of public outreach.
On the other hand, traffic volumes typically increase quickly during weekday AM commute hours, which minimizes dissipation of any work zone congestion created; thus, work zone impacts to the weekday AM commute should be minimal and assume no traffic diversion.

Extended Friday Night into Saturday Morning Closures
After the Friday PM commute, decreasing traffic volumes allows any work zone queues to dissipate overnight. Friday PM volumes tend to be higher later into the evening compared to all other weeknights.
When congestion occurs, traffic may divert using alternative routes around the work zone; therefore, decreasing the volume the work zone must serve. Diversion rates used in work zone traffic analysis are determined by Region Traffic Operations based on considerations such as the quality and number of alternative routes available, special event occurrence, and quality of public outreach.
Because there is no AM commute, closures may be extended into Saturday morning several hours later than weekdays. Because of increasing volumes, the ability to dissipate queues becomes reduced later into the morning.

Friday night is typically used to accommodate Superload freight by keeping a minimum of two lanes open on T-1 and T-2 freight corridors when feasible. Superload freight over 20 feet wide is typically restricted to travel during early Saturday morning (1:00 a.m.-6:30 a.m.) or Sunday morning (1:00 a.m.-6:30 a.m.).
C.
Extended Saturday Night into Sunday Morning Closures
Decreasing Saturday PM traffic volumes allows any work zone queues to dissipate overnight. Saturday PM volumes tend to be comparable to Friday PM volumes.
When congestion occurs, traffic may divert using alternative routes around the work zone; therefore, decreasing the volume the work zone must serve. Diversion rates used in work zone traffic analysis are determined by Region Traffic Operations based on considerations such as the quality and number of alternative routes available, special event occurrence, and quality of public outreach.
Because there is no AM commute, closures may be extended into Sunday morning several hours later than weekdays and typically an hour later than Saturday morning. Because of increasing volumes, the ability to dissipate queues becomes reduced later into the morning.

Extended Weekend Morning Closures
Some work operations, such as bridge inspections or maintenance operations without noise permits, require daytime closure hours even in heavy congested urban areas but weekday daytime closures would result in unacceptable work zone congestion.
Instead, utilize extended weekend morning closures. Begin closures 1.5 hours before sunrise (times available for Seattle and Spokane) so traffic control and mobilization occur during darkness and crews begin work operations at first light. Balance the need to complete work and keep adverse traffic impacts tolerable using work zone traffic analysis (Section 5-9).
Typically, Sunday morning closures reopen an hour later than Saturday.

E.
Weekend-Duration Lane Closures
Weekend-duration lane closures, Friday evening to Monday morning commute, are practical solutions for longer work operations when extended overnight closure hours still do not yield sufficient work durations.
Weekend traffic demand tends to be less commute oriented and more discretionary than weekdays. With strong public outreach, motorists can plan ahead by avoiding an area using alternative routes, traveling early morning or later in evenings, or using public transit.
However, avoid weekend lane closures on major recreational routes due to greater communication and outreach challenges. Consider performing these closures during the offseason or weekdays (Sunday evening to noon Friday) instead.
Superload freight is not typically accommodated during weekend-duration lane closures but oversized freight should be along T-1 and T-2 freight corridors. If the roadway is narrowed or vertical clearances reduced, then WSDOT Commercial Vehicle Services should be contacted at least 7 days in advance. See Section 5-15 for details.
Perform work zone traffic analysis (Section 5-9) to assess traffic impacts and mitigation needs. It may be a good time to involve Region Management in the decision process. Region
Traffic Operations will determine anticipated diversion rates, which range from 0 percent to 50 percent during hours of congestion for weekend-duration closures. Be aware hourly traffic volumes may be up to 15 percent higher early AM hours on weekends as motorists travel earlier to avoid the worse work zone congestion.

Interim liquidated damage values for weekend-duration closure should be included in the Contract PS&E (see Section 5-14 for details). Consider additional work zone safety management strategies (Section 5-17) when using these strategies.
Freeway Lane & Ramp Closure Weekend-Duration Strategies: • Closing up to half the existing freeway lanes
Reducing a 4-lane directional freeway to 2 open lanes needs viable alternative routes (2+ multilane principle arterials) and extensive public outreach.
Reducing a 2-lane directional freeway to 1 open lane needs viable alternative routes (principle arterial, preferably multilane) and extensive public outreach. • Farther reduce roadway to a single open lane during overnight hours, but consider the additional work zone congestion created during the day.
Typical Friday and Saturday Night Strategy on Congested Urban Freeways: Reduce roadway to a single open lane at 10:30 p.m. and reopen the following morning to two lanes when traffic volumes reach 150 percent of a single open lane’s capacity (typically
Saturday 5:30 a.m. or Sunday 6:00 a.m.) to clear any early- morning congestion created before congestion starting building during the daytime weekend-duration lane closures. • Strategically closing freeway on-ramps can effectively manage congestion along mainline.
By strategically closing on-ramps, traffic volumes served by the work zone is reduced by forcing on-ramp traffic to use detour routes or alternative routes; however, avoid closing on-ramps with major trip generators (airport or other major freeways).
Eliminating on-ramp merges maximizes the capacity through the work zone; therefore, minimizing queues and delays.
Closing on-ramps prevent queues from spreading onto other corridors via queues extending up ramps and spilling into adjacent corridor thru lanes. With the ramp closed, the traffic queue remain contained on the original corridor, but additional congestion will occur along the detour route or alternative routes.
Be cautious of closing freeway on-ramps in rural areas as detour routes may be several miles due to the large distances between interchanges.
This strategy is ineffective if the detour route or alternative route does not bypass the work zone.
Conventional Highway (Non-Freeway) Weekend-Duration Lane Closure Strategies: • Temporary two-way, two-lane configuration an existing multilane highways
Each direction is reduced to a single open lane, then one direction of traffic is shifted into either the closed two-way, left-turn lane or the closed left lane of the oncoming direction, known as contraflow.
On divided highways, each direction is reduced to a single open lane, then one direction of traffic is shifted via median crossover over into the closed left lane of the oncoming direction. • Temporary two-way, one-lane configuration on an existing highway
A single lane is maintained through the work zone with alternating traffic via flagger or temporary signal-control, which may include a pilot car operation.

Weekend-Duration Road Closures
For critical work operations it may not be practical to maintain mobility necessitating the use of weekend-duration road closures. Such work operations may include fish passage culverts and modifying existing intersections into roundabouts.
For the traveling public, closing the road for a short duration may be less inconvenience than traveling through a work zone for an extended period of time. Productivity during weekend closures are significantly greater than daily or nightly closures; thus, the project duration can be reduced considerably.
The main requirement for road closures is the availability of a detour route and its ability to accommodate increased traffic volumes, truck turning movements, and pavement integrity.
Weekend traffic demand tends to be less commute oriented and more discretionary than weekdays. With strong public outreach motorists are able to plan ahead by avoiding an area by taking alternative routes, traveling earlier or later, or using public transit.
However, avoid weekend lane closures on major recreational routes due to greater communication and outreach challenges. Consider performing these closures using longterm duration closures during the off-season or weekdays (Sunday evening to noon Friday).
For roadway closures along truck freight critical corridors, WSDOT Commercial Vehicle
Services should be contacted at least 7 days in advance (see Section 5-15 for details). For
FHWA notification requirements for Interstate Highway closures, see Section 5-12.
Perform work zone traffic analysis (Section 5-9) to assess traffic impacts and mitigation needs. It may be a good time to involve Region Management in the decision process.
Interim liquidated damage values for weekend-duration closure should be included in the Contract PS&E (see Section 5-14 for details). Consider additional work zone safety management strategies (Section 5-17) when using these strategies.
Freeway Weekend-Duration Closure Strategies: • Directional freeway mainline closure utilizing a collector-distributor
Using lane closures, all traffic is forced to exit onto the collector-distributor around the work area before rejoining the mainline. This strategy provides the benefit of a “full roadway closure” in terms of productivity and safety, but maintains limited mobility through the work zone for the traveling public. • Directional freeway mainline closure utilizing a median crossover
Two-way, two-lane freeway traffic is maintained by placing all traffic on one side of the median with 11-foot lanes, 2-foot right shoulders, and 3-foot left shoulders adjacent to the temporary barrier separating opposing directions of traffic desirable; however, actual site conditions may justify narrower configurations and work zone speed limit reductions (Section 5-18).
If existing paved shoulders are within the temporary travel lanes, verify the pavement depth is sufficient, drainage features/electrical J-box covers are traffic bearing, and roadway widths across bridges are sufficient.

Work Zone Traffic Control
Often, roadside safety features on freeways are designed for one-way traffic; when temporary two-way configurations are used verify these roadside safety components are • Directional freeway mainline closure utilizing a detour
Used in conjunction with lane closures, all traffic is forced to exit at an exit-ramp. A route-specific signed detour route should be provided along with significant mitigation and outreach strategies along with advanced notification. • Complete freeway mainline closure utilizing detours
For work operations such as overhead bridge demolition across all lanes, it may be necessary to close both directions of a freeway concurrently. A route-specific signed detour route should be provided for each direction along with substantial mitigation and outreach strategies.
Conventional Highway Closure Strategy: • Roadway closure with detour
The roadway is closed to all traffic with a signed detour route in place. Local traffic access may be permitted up to the actual roadway closure to maintain access for residents and local businesses. 5-8
Long-Term Duration Closures & Reconfigurations
Long-Term duration closures are defined as those lasting 4 days or more. Weekend- duration closures are considered intermediate-term duration (see Section 5-7.E and Section 5-7.F).
Some work operations may require extended closures, even longer than weekend- durations, in order to complete needed work. Such work operations include bridge rehabilitation, major roundabout installation, fish passage culverts, and roadway widening.
These extended closures occur on commuter, freight, and/or recreational routes and should be used only after other traffic control approaches were found to be ineffective or impractical.
When it has been identified and utilizing long-term duration closures is justified, detailed work zone traffic analysis needs to be performed by the Region Traffic Operations to determine anticipated delays and queues (Section 5-9) to determine permitted extended closure hours and any associated interim liquidated damages (Section 5-14). The WSDOT
Transportation Data, GIS & Modeling Office (TDGMO) can provide Regions assistance with work zone traffic analysis and determine maximum allowable interim liquidated damages.
Diversion rates used in work zone traffic analysis are determined by Region Traffic
Operations based on considerations such as the quality and number of alternative routes available, special event occurrence, and quality of public outreach.
In the Contract PS&E, clearly list permitted long-term duration closures including days and times, maximum number allowable, and any allowable work operation restrictions.

WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5
Section 5-12 provides FHWA notification requirements in advance of Interstate Highway closures or on the Federal-aid primary highway system.
When work zone queues are anticipated to exceed more than 1 mile, consider work zone safety management strategies (Section 5-17), including a work zone queue warning system, in addition to implementing work zone congestion management strategies (Section 5-6.B).
Multiple weekday-duration closures, typically Sunday night to noon on Friday, are similar to the weekend-duration strategies but serves as a practical solution for work operations requiring more than a weekend to complete or the work zone occurs along recreational routes experiencing high weekend traffic volumes, but are lower during weekdays.
Regions should expect work zone congestion to be very heavy the first day or two, but easing as the traveling public adjusts their driving habits. After a few days, locals will simply avoid the work zone while others utilize alternative routes or simply avoid travel. When possible, travelers will travel earlier in the morning or later in the evening to avoid the worst of the congestion.
For long-term duration closures, the exact traffic control strategy and closures will be determined on a case-by-case basis and is site-specific. The following are only some of the possible long-duration closure strategies: • Temporary Bypasses (Section 5-8.A) • Roadway Lane Closure & Reconfiguration (Section 5-8.B)
A.

Temporary Bypasses
A strategy utilized for some bridge reconstruction and fish passage projects is to construct a temporary highway bypass around the fish culvert during its construction, particularly in areas where a sufficient detour or alternative route is unavailable. In addition, it may be utilized on routes serving commuting traffic during the week and recreation traffic on the weekend. Depending on traffic volumes, environmental restrictions, cost, and other practical considerations the bypass could be as follows: • Two-lane, two-way temporary configuration • One-lane, two-way temporary configuration utilizing temporary signals to alternate traffic during nonworking hours with flagger-controlled traffic during working hours.
B.
Roadway Lane Closure & Reconfiguration
In locations with constrained geometrics, may require lane closures combined with reduced shoulder and lane widths that are laterally shifted onto the shoulders, work can occur on one-half of the roadway and/or bridge at a time. Typically, a two-stage configuration is utilized to complete work across the road/bridge. Such freeway reconfigurations should use a reduced continuous work zone speed limit based on the minimum shoulder and lane widths as shown in Exhibit 5-12 (Section 5-18.A).
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10
Page 5-19 Chapter 5
Work Zone Traffic Control
Typically, site-specific staging plans and traffic control plans are included in the Contract
PS&E for each stage including any needed temporary illumination plans. For more complex projects or locations with tight geometrics, multiple stages and reconfigurations may be necessary.
These long-term reconfigurations should be based on permanent design standards to the extent feasible (horizontal curvature, long-duration temporary pavement markings, temporary traffic barriers with impact attenuators, illumination) while being supplemented
Manual for additional work zone design information.

5-9
Work Zone Traffic Analysis
Work zone traffic analysis compares the anticipated work zone traffic volumes with its estimated capacity. When traffic volumes exceed capacity, queues grow and congestion build. When traffic volumes are less than capacity, queues dissipate.
The unit of measurement is vehicle per hour (vph) but may also be measured as vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) for multilane roadways.
First, determine the anticipated traffic volume through the work zone. Obtain historical traffic volumes (Section 5-9.A) and correct older data for growth (Section 5-9.B). Next, account for any expected traffic diversion, determined by Region Traffic Operations, which decreases the volume served by the work zone. Next, determine the work zone’s traffic capacity (Section 5-9.C for freeways and Section 5-9.D for conventional roadways).
With the anticipated traffic volume and work zone capacity, expected work zone queues and delays can then be calculated. For simple scenarios, see Section 5-9.E. For more complex scenarios, see Section 5-9.F.
Region Traffic Operations should perform work zone traffic analysis, but may delegate it to the Project Engineering Office. The WSDOT Transportation Data, GIS & Modeling Office (TDGMO)can assist by providing work zone traffic analysis to help determine expected queuing and delays.
Much of the same information used for work zone traffic analysis is also used by WSDOT
TDGMO to determine maximum interim liquidated damage values (Section 5-14). Based on these maximum values, Region Traffic Operations can determine actual interim liquidated damage values for each closure which are listed in the Contract PS&E. Based on these maximum values, Region Traffic Operations can determine actual interim liquidated damage values for each closure which are listed in the Contract PS&E.
A.

Obtaining Traffic Volumes
When possible, obtain current traffic volumes within the work zone limits. Be cautious of using traffic data older than a year, especially in high-growth areas.
Directional traffic volumes should be taken at several locations. On freeways, obtain mainline volumes between each interchange and volumes of each exit-ramp and on-ramp.
On conventional roadways, obtain mainline volumes between significant intersections.
Page 5-20
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5
Traffic volumes should be obtained each day of the week closures are permitted as they may change significantly from day to day. For extended intermediate-term duration closures (Section 5-7) and long-term duration closures (Section 5-8) obtain several sets of data for each day for a good average, desirably 10 for each day. Screen the data set for any significant special events or holidays that may significantly skew the traffic volume average.
It is desirable to obtain traffic volumes in 15-minute intervals for greater accuracy in determining closure hours for closures on freeways and major arterials. It may become necessary to assign closures in 15-minute intervals on heavily congested corridors instead of typical hourly intervals. When 15-minute traffic volumes are used, multiply by four to obtain an equivalent hourly volume to use the hourly intermediate-term work zone capacities provided in Section 5-9.C and Section 5-9.D.
Recreational roadways will experience significant fluctuations in traffic volumes seasonally; however, most roadways experience higher traffic volumes in summer and lower in winter.
Similarly, work zone capacities also are higher in summer and lower in winter by similar amounts usually eliminating the need for seasonal adjustments for work zone traffic analysis in most areas.
The following resources may be used to obtain existing traffic volumes on state routes and the Interstate Highway system: • WSDOT Traffic Data GeoPortal
This application allows users to obtain historic hourly and aggregate traffic volume data from WSDOT’s network of Permanent Traffic Recorders (PTRs).
For detailed information on GeoPortal application, including the map layer information and instructions for obtaining data within this system, see Traffic Data GeoPortal Help. • WSDOT Transportation Data, GIS & Modeling Office (TDGMO)
Hourly volume, classification, speed, and weight data can be obtained, when available, from the TDGMO. This includes data from both the PTR network and short-duration mechanical counts conducted throughout the state. To obtain this data, complete and submit a Traffic Data Request Form to TDGMO. • WSDOT ECM Portal “Short Duration Count” searches an internal database for various hourly traffic counts, including NWR Traffic Studies Database. • CDR Software (Northwest Region Only)
This software allows engineers to access detailed traffic data for freeways and major arterial roadways from PTRs. Historic PTR data is available in 5-minute intervals but can be automatically aggregated and summarized as needed by the software, with 15-minute or one-hour intervals being the most useful for work zone traffic analysis. • Request New Traffic Studies
New traffic studies can be performed by the TDGMO and the Northwest Region upon request.
To request new traffic studies statewide, contact TDGMO.

Correcting Traffic Volumes for Growth
When traffic volumes are more than a year old, then account for annual changes in traffic volumes. The growth rate of traffic is location specific. Traffic volumes often decrease during times of economic recession.
If needed, location specific growth rate estimates can be generated by contacting TDGMO or Region Traffic Operations. Without the availability of better data or information, a conservative growth rate of 3 percent per year can be assumed.
Caution should be used when applying a constant growth rate across all hourly traffic volumes because congested corridors may experience much higher growth rates during early AM commute hours as motorists adapt to worsening congestion by beginning their commutes earlier, as early as 3:30 a.m. in a few locations.
Without the availability of better data or information, using hourly traffic volumes from one location along a corridor and using the AADTs of both location to “adjust” the hourly volumes may be acceptable; however, if the “adjusted” hourly volumes are near the work zone traffic capacities then new traffic counts should be obtained.

C.
Freeway Work Zone Traffic Capacities
The “rule of thumb” work zone capacity thresholds provided in this subsection include ranges based on the understanding that roadway conditions, roadway configurations, and work activity intensity all impact actual capacities; therefore, sound engineering judgement and Regional experience is still needed to perform proper work zone traffic analysis.
Stationary freeway lane closures are ones that occupy a location and are set up with standard traffic control devices.

Special Scenarios: • Increase directional capacity by 100 vehicles/hour when traffic barriers separate travel lanes from work areas. • When High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) and Express Toll Lane (ETL) is present, assume its lane capacity as 1000 unless it is the only lane open, even when signed as “OPEN TO ALL”. • For steep upgrades (≥ 5 percent for more than ½ mile), reduce one lane’s capacity by one-half to account for the slow trucks.
Mobile freeway lane closures are “moving lane closures” using transportable attenuators without channelization devices where work moves intermittently or continuously.

When determining permitted closure hours for ramps, it is important to understand ramp closure hours are dependent on the excess capacity available along its entire detour route, including any intersections. If the detour route is already congested, then it has no excess capacity to absorb the detouring traffic. In short, the capacity of the detour route increases as overall volumes become lower. In other words, a detour route can serve higher detour traffic volumes at 11:00 p.m. than at 7:00 p.m.. Because overall traffic volumes higher later into evenings weekends than weeknights, the thresholds vary to account for this trend.
The opposite is true during the morning because overall traffic volumes are increasing.
Because excess capacity along the detour route decreases into the morning, the detour traffic volume that can be sufficiently served also decreases later into the morning. In other words, a detour route can sufficiently serve lower detour traffic volumes at 6:00 a.m. than at 4:00 a.m.. Because weekends have no AM commute traffic, the thresholds remain higher later into the morning.
Suburban & urban corridors experience higher traffic volume levels than rural corridors; however, suburban & urban motorists are more accepting of higher congestion levels.
The thresholds account for this trend as well.
It is also important to distinguish between exit-ramp and on-ramps detour routes; particularly when temporary lane closures are in place on mainline in one or both directions of travel. Exit-ramp detours typically route on towards the next interchange and then back in the opposite direction resulting in higher traffic volumes than normal along the detour route, which should be accounted for when temporary lane closures are in place in either direction or additional work zone congestion may occur. On the other hand, on-ramps tend to use surface streets and local road detours to adjacent interchanges which lowers traffic volumes on the mainline in that section, and may help offset the additional traffic volumes generated by exit-ramp detours.
WSDOT Traffic Manual

M 51-02.10
Page 5-23 Chapter 5
Work Zone Traffic Control
It is important to verify the entire detour route can sufficiently handle the added traffic volumes detoured, not just focusing on the ramp’s volume in isolation. Additional work zone congestion strategies may be needed along the detour route (see Section 5-6.B for details).
Pay particular attention to detour routes turning left at signalized intersections with a short, single left turn lane with a protected left turn signal phase. Signal retiming or uniform police officer(s) controlling traffic at the intersection may be necessary. When traffic volumes sufficiently decrease, normal signal operation may be restored.
For guidance, ramp closure volume thresholds are available in Exhibit 5-6. Exhibit 5-7 provides ramp reopening thresholds. Note this guidance is for nightly ramp closures.

The following ramp reopening examples are based on Exhibit 5-7 guidance to assist users:
Example #1: A ramp can remain closed thru 3:30 a.m. during early weekday mornings regardless of its ramp volumes.
Example #2: A suburban/urban ramp should be reopened no later than 4:30 a.m.

Example #3: A rural ramp should be reopened no later than 5:00 a.m. Wednesday morning if its volumes exceed 250 vehicles per hour at that time; unless otherwise justified, reopen the ramp by 6:00 a.m. on weekday mornings.
Example #4: Any ramp can remain closed thru 5:00 a.m. early Saturday morning regardless of its ramp volumes; unless otherwise justified, reopen the ramp by 8:00 a.m. on Saturday mornings (excludes extended weekend morning or weekendduration closures).
Example #5: Any ramp can remain closed thru 6:00 a.m. early Sunday morning regardless of its ramp volumes; unless otherwise justified, reopen the ramp by 9:00 a.m. on Sunday mornings (excludes extended weekend morning or weekend-duration closures). • Daytime Freeway Ramp Closures
Some work operations, such as bridge inspections or maintenance operations without noise permits, require daytime closure hours even in heavy congested urban areas.
Permitted closure hours for this situation should be examined on a case-by-case basis by
Region Traffic Operations.
Consider the following: What are the ramp volumes during the closure? Does the detour add considerable delays, especially for commuter and school traffic?
If permitted, weekday daytime ramp closure hours are typically assigned between the
AM commute and PM commute (9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.).
When daytime closures during weekdays result in unacceptable work zone congestion, an alternative approach is to utilize extended Saturday morning or Sunday morning closures. See Section 5-7.D for details.

Conventional Roadway Work Zone Traffic Capacities (Non-Freeway)
The “rule of thumb” work zone capacity thresholds provided in this subsection include ranges based on the understanding that roadway conditions, roadway configurations, and work activity intensity all impact actual capacities; therefore, sound engineering judgement and Regional experience is still needed to perform proper work zone traffic analysis. • Multilane Closures (Non-Freeway)
These lane closures maintain two-way traffic with at least one thru lane in each direction (no flaggers, pilot cars, temporary signals, etc.). Contraflow means two- way traffic is maintained by shifting one direction of travel into the opposing direction’s closed thru lanes or closed two-way, left-turn center lane.

Traffic capacity is further reduced when closures extend through signalized intersections, particularly for contraflow configurations. When traffic is shifted at or thru signalized intersections via contraflow, the signalized intersection shall be either controlled by uniform police officer(s) within the intersection per WAC 468-95-3015 or flaggers on all approaches with an optional flagger added within the intersection.

Thru Signalized Intersections: 700-800 • Single Open Lane with Alternating Traffic
Traffic capacities are significantly affected by the distance between flaggers or temporary signals due to the lost time waiting for alternating traffic directions to take turns. Additional intersections between flaggers farther exasperate this issue.
Alternating traffic can be controlled via flaggers, AFADs, pilot cars, or temporary signals.
Different methods will yield different work zone capacities. Pilot cars increase capacity by guiding motorists through the work zone more effectively, especially for work zones exceeding 800 feet between flaggers.
When bicyclists are combined with alternating vehicular traffic, work zone capacity is significantly reduced due to their slow speeds and longer clearance intervals. Temporary signals are especially affected because the all-red clearance intervals for temporary signals typically assume bicycle speeds of 10 mph (unless a separate bicycle lane or shuttle is provided). All-red clearance time becomes excessively lengthy when distances between temporary signals exceed 1000 feet.

Work Zone Traffic Control
For congested work zones with alternating traffic, queues and delays can be minimized by reducing the distance between flaggers and the clearance time needed. For example, reducing the longitudinal buffer space and upgrading the protective vehicle up to a transportable attenuators (for speed 45 mph or higher) would minimize queues while still protecting the work area from errant vehicle intrusions because the flaggers are closer.

Temporary Signal (Separate Bicycle (Bicyclists Share Open

Notes: [1] If bicycle volumes are significant and share open lane with motorists, use capacity listed in “Temporary
Signal (Bicyclist Share Open Lane with Motorists)”. • Intersecting roadways lower capacities based on volume and frequency. • When temporary signals are used to alternating traffic, consider Driveway Assistance Devices (DADs) control driveways avoid capacity reductions.

Simple Work Zone Queues & Delays
When work zone congestion is expected, then calculating the expected queue and delay becomes necessary to determine the level of work zone impact to determine the closure’s traffic diversion % feasibility and the level of mitigation needed.
