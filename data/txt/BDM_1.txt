Engineering and Regional Operations Bridge and Structures Office
Foreword This manual has been prepared to provide Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) bridge design engineers with a guide to the design criteria, analysis methods, and detailing procedures for the preparation of highway bridge and structure construction plans, specifications, and estimates. It is not intended to be a textbook on structural engineering. It is a guide to acceptable WSDOT practice. This manual does not cover all conceivable problems that may arise, but is intended to be sufficiently comprehensive to along with sound engineering judgment, provide a safe guide for bridge engineering. A thorough knowledge of the contents of this manual is essential for a high degree of efficiency in the engineering of WSDOT highway structures. This loose leaf form of this manual facilitates modifications and additions. New provisions and revisions will be issued from time to time to keep this guide current. Suggestions for improvement and updating the manual are always welcome. All manual modifications shall be approved by the Bridge Design Engineer. The Federal Highway Administration has agreed to approve designs that follow the guidance in the Bridge Design Manual; therefore, following the guidance is mandatory for state highway projects. When proposed designs meet the requirements contained in the Bridge Design Manual, little additional documentation is required. The electronic version of this document is available at: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/manusl/m23-50.htm

Manual Description
1.1.1
Purpose The Bridge Design Manual (BDM) M 23-50 sets the standard for bridge and structure designs within the Washington State Department of Transportation’s (WSDOT) right of way. This manual outlines WSDOT design details and methods, incorporating standard practices that are based on years of experience. The BDM also identifies where WSDOT standard of practices differ from the AASHTO specifications. The design details and design methods of the BDM shall be used in the development of any bridge or structure project within the WSDOT right of way. Adherence to the BDM is expected for all bridge or structural projects that are located within the WSDOT right of way. The Bridge Design Manual is a dynamic document, which constantly changes because of the creativity and innovative skills of our bridge designers and structural detailers. It is not intended for the design of unusual structures or to inhibit the designer in the exercise of engineering judgment. The information, guidance, and references contained herein are not intended as a substitute for experience, sound engineering judgment, and common sense. 1.1.1.A
Use of Bridge Design Manual on Design-Build and Progressive Design-Build Projects
When a reference is made to “Bridge Design Manual” or “BDM” in the Design-Build Contract or Mandatory Standards, the Design-Builder shall proceed as follows:
• Refer first to Bridge Design Manual Chapter 15 “Structural Design Requirements for Design-Build Contracts”. All requirements in Bridge Design Manual Chapter 15 are Contract requirements.
• If the Design-Build Contract or a Mandatory Standard references a specific section of the Bridge Design Manual, the Design-Builder shall review the applicable portions of Bridge Design Manual Chapter 15. If there are discrepancies between Bridge Design Manual Chapter 15 and the specific section reference, Chapter 15 shall have contractual precedence.
• All other portions of Chapters 1-14 of the Bridge Design Manual shall be considered a Reference Document.
1.1.2
Specifications This manual and the current editions of the following AASHTO Specifications are the basic documents used to design highway bridges and structures in Washington State:
• AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications (LRFD-BDS)
• AASHTO Guide Specifications for LRFD Seismic Bridge Design (LRFD-SGS) The Bridge Design Manual is not intended to duplicate the AASHTO Specifications. This manual supplements the AASHTO Specifications by providing additional direction, design aides, examples, and information on office practice. The Bridge Design Manual takes precedence where conflict exists with the AASHTO Specifications. The WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer will provide guidance as necessary.

1.3.2.A.1
Design Team
The design team usually consists of the Designer(s), Checker(s), Structural Detailer(s), Bridge & Structures Architect, and a Specification and Estimate Engineer, who are responsible for preparing a set of contract documents on or before the scheduled due date(s) and within the budget allocated for the project. On large projects, the Design Unit Manager may designate a designer to be a Project Coordinator with additional duties, such as: assisting the Design Unit Manager in communicating with the Region, coordinating and communicating with the Geotechnical Branch, and monitoring the activities of the design team. In general, it is a good practice to have some experienced designers on every design team. All design team members should have the opportunity to provide input to maximize the quality of the design plans. 1.3.2.A.2
Designer Responsibility
The designer is responsible for the content of the contract plan sheets, including structural analysis, completeness and correctness. A good set of example plans, which is representative of the bridge type, is indispensable as an aid to less experienced designers and detailers. During the design phase of a project, the designer will need to communicate frequently with the Design Unit Manager and other stakeholders. This includes acquiring, finalizing or revising roadway geometrics, soil reports, hydraulics recommendations, and utility requirements. Constructability issues may also require that the designer communicate with the Region or Construction Office. The designer may have to organize face-to-face meetings to resolve constructability issues early in the design phase. The bridge plans must be coordinated with the PS&E packages produced concurrently by the Region. The designer shall advise the Design Unit Manager as soon as possible of any scope and project cost increases and the reasons for the increases. The Design Unit Manager will then notify the Region project office if the delivery schedule will have to be changed. If Region concurs with a change in the delivery date, the Design Unit Manager shall notify the Bridge Scheduling Engineer of the revised delivery dates. The designer or Project Coordinator is responsible for project planning and development which involves the following: 1.
Determines scope of work, identifies tasks and plans order of work.
2.
Prepare design criteria that are included in the front of the design calculations. Compares tasks with BDM office practice and AASHTO Bridge Design Specifications. A. Insures that design guidelines are sufficient.

iii. Coordinate all final changes, including review comments received from the Bridge Specifications and Estimates Engineer. iv. Meet with Region design staff and other project stakeholders at the constructability review/round table review meetings to address final project coordination issues. The designer should inform the Design Unit Manager of any areas of the design, which should receive special attention during checking and review. The design and check calculations are prepared by the designer and checker in accordance with Section 1.3.3 and become a very important record document. Design calculations will be a reference document during the construction of the structure and throughout the life of the structure. It is critical that the design calculations be user friendly. The design calculations shall be well organized, clear, properly referenced, and include numbered pages along with a table of contents. The design and check calculation shall be assembled and archived in accordance with Section 1.3.3 and Section 1.3.8. The PDF calculations files shall be stamped, signed, and dated by a registered professional Engineer in the State of Washington. Computer data files shall be saved for use during construction, in the event that changed conditions arise. The designer is also responsible for providing construction support and may be assigned to serve as a Bridge Technical Advisor. See BDM Section 1.3.6. The designer and Bridge Technical Advisor (BTA) shall review as-builts for accuracy prior to the Project Engineer submitting them to HQ Engineering Records in accordance with BDM Section 1.3.6.B.3.

Consultant PS&E — Projects on County and City Right of Way
Counties and cities frequently hire Consultants to design bridges. WSDOT Local Programs Office determines which projects are to be reviewed by the Bridge and Structures Office. WSDOT Local Programs Office sends the PS&E to the Bridge Project Support unit for assignment when a review is required. The Bridge and Structures Office’s Consultant Liaison Engineer is not involved. A WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office Design Reviewer or Coordinator will be assigned to the project and will review the project as outlined for Consultant PS&E Projects on WSDOT Right of Way. Plans with the reviewers’ comments marked in red should be returned to the Bridge Project Support Unit. One set of plans will be returned to Local Programs Office. The first review should be made of the Preliminary Plan followed later by review of the PS&E and design calculations. Comments are treated as advisory, although major structural issues must be addressed and corrected. An engineer from the county, city, or consultant may contact the reviewer to discuss the comments. 1.3.2.D
Structural Engineering and Significant Structures
Structural engineering is recognized as a specialized branch of professional engineering. An engineer must be registered as a structural engineer in order to provide structural engineering services for significant structures (see RCW 18.43.040(1)(a)(iii) & (iv)). Structural Engineering license requirement for WSDOT bridges and structures shall meet the requirement of BDM Section 1.4.3 A-7. The practice of engineering is defined in RCW 18.43.020(5)(a). Structural engineering services for significant structures include but are not limited to practice of engineering on:
Page 1-16
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
General Information
Chapter 1
• Vertical and lateral load-resisting components of significant structures including but not limited to foundations, columns, walls, abutments, girders, beams, diaphragms, cross-bracing, floors, decks, bearings and expansion joints.
• Retaining walls and other structures adjacent to a significant structure, when the failure of the structure would affect the structural adequacy of the significant structure. Structural engineering services for significant structures do not include:
• Practice of engineering on other structural elements of significant structures including railings, barriers, approach slabs, utility supports, and supports for miscellaneous appurtenances such as signs and luminaires. The licensed structural engineer will be responsible for designing the vertical and lateral load resisting components of the significant structure to safely resist loads from these elements.
• Engineering services of other civil disciplines, including geotechnical and hydraulic engineering services.
• Creation of specifications and estimates Supervision of construction on significant structures for the purpose of assuring compliance with the contract requirements (see RCW 18.43.020(5)(a)) may be performed by a registered professional engineer who is not also a registered structural engineer if all changes requiring structural engineering services are referred to a registered structural engineer (WAC 196-27A-020(2)(f)).
1.3.3
Design/Check Calculation File 1.3.3.A
File Format and Naming
The official Design/Check Calculation File for a structure shall be in electronic PDF format and may consist of multiple PDF files. When a project consists of multiple structures, each structure shall have a unique Design/Check Calculation File. In special circumstances, the Bridge Archive Engineer may allow multiple minor structures to be combined into a single Design/Check Calculation File. The electronic PDF files that comprise the Design/Check Calculation File should be divided and organized in an orderly manner. A typical three-span girder highway overpass design calculation package is expected to consist of around one to five individual PDF files. File sizes should not exceed 50 MB for each PDF file. The Design/Check Calculation File created for the PS&E submittal will eventually be electronically archived as described in Section 1.3.8, and reasonable PDF file sizes will support future download/retrieval of archive documents. Judgment should be used to determine the lowest resolution image appropriate to legibly portray the information. For example, a 200 dpi scan may save disk space and provide reasonable clarity as compared to a 600 dpi image. The filename for each PDF file shall be rational and shall be clearly listed in the Index Sheets (or Table of Contents). Since the electronic archiving process will tag each PDF file with the contract number and Structure ID, the filenames need only be consistent with the naming and layout described in the Index Sheets. Example filenames:
• Volume 1.pdf, Volume 2.pdf, Volume 3.pdf, etc.
• SuperDesign.pdf, SuperCheck.pdf, SubDesign.pdf, SubCheck.pdf

WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 1-21
Chapter 1
General Information
If in doubt between “Make Corrections Noted” and “Revise and Resubmit”, check with the Design Unit Manager or Construction Support Engineer. An acceptable detail may be shown in red, in which case the Plans would be marked. “Make Corrections Noted”. Notify the Design Unit Manager and the Construction Support Engineer if problems are encountered which may cause a delay in the checking of the shop plans or completion of the contract. Typically, WSDOT administered contracts require reviews to be completed within 20 calendar days for Type 2 Working Drawings and 30 calendar days for Type 3 Working Drawings. The review time starts when the Project Engineer first receives the submittal from the Contractor and ends when the Contractor has received the submittal back from the Project Engineer. The Bridge Office does not have the entire review period to complete the review. Therefore, designers should give construction reviews high priority and complete reviews in a timely manner so costly construction delays are avoided. Time is also required for marking, mailing and other processing. It is the goal of the Bridge and Structures Office to return reviewed submittals back to the Project Engineer within 7 to 14 days of their receipt by the Bridge Office. When checking is completed, return all shop drawings to the Construction Support Unit when Bridge Construction Support is listed as a WSDOT Review Group in Figure 1-1 of the WSDOT Construction Manual. Return all other shop drawings directly to the Project Engineering Office, and cc the Construction Support Unit for email submittals. Include a list of any deviations from the Contract Plans that are structurally acceptable and a list of any disagreements with the Project Engineer’s comments (regardless of how minor they may be). Deviations from the Contract Plans may require engineering and a Change Order. Note that changes to the contract that are also practice of engineering will require a seal by a licensed professional in accordance with the WSDOT Construction Manual Section SS 1-04.4 Changes/ Responsibility of Licensed Professionals for Changes to Structural Engineered Drawings During Design-Bid-Build Construction Contracts. Under no circumstances should the reviewer mark on the shop plans that a change order is required or notify the Project Engineer that a change order is required. The authority for determining whether a change order is required rests with State Construction Engineer assigned to the project. 1.3.6.A.2

Quality Control/Quality Assurance/Quality Verification (QC/QA/ QV) Procedures
1.4.1
General The purpose of the QC/QA/QV procedure is to improve the quality of the structural designs and plans. The key element to the success of this process is effective communication between all parties. The objectives of the QC/QA/QV procedure are to:
• Design structures that improve public safety and meet state regulations.
• Design structures which meet the requirements of the Bridge Design Manual M 23-50, AASHTO LRFD Bridge Specifications, current structural engineering and architectural practices, and geometric criteria provided by the Region.
• Create contract documents that meet the customer’s needs, schedule, budget, and construction staging requirements.
• Maximize plan quality.
• Produce an organized and indexed set of design calculations with the criteria and assumptions included in the front after the index.
• Minimize structural and architectural design costs. The goals are listed in order of importance. If there is a conflict between goals, the more important goal takes precedence. The Design Unit Manager determines project assignments and the QC/QA/QV process to be used in preparation of the structural design. The intent of the QC/QA/QV process is to facilitate plan production efficiency and cost-effectiveness while assuring the structural integrity of the design and to maximize the quality of the structural contract documents. Professional Engineering license stamp is required for all proprietary buried structures as defined in BDM Section 8.3.3 with at least 2 feet of backfill on top of the structure and placed on spread footings or has a bottom slab. Deep foundations including shafts and piles shall be stamped by a Structural Engineer.

1.4.3.A.3
Checker Responsibility
The Checker is responsible to the Design Unit Manager for Quality Control of the structural design, which includes checking the design, plans, calculations and quantities to assure accuracy and constructability. The Design Unit Manager works with the Checker to establish the level of checking required. The checking procedure for assuring the quality of the design will vary from project to project. Following are some general checking guidelines: 1.
Job File Scan the job file for unconventional or project specific items relating to geometrics, hydraulics, geotechnical, environmental, etc.
2.
Design Calculations The design calculations may be checked by either of two methods: Design calculations may be checked with a line-by-line review and initialing by the Checker. If it is more efficient, the Checker may choose to perform his/her own independent calculations. Iterative design methods may be best checked by review of the Designer’s calculations, while standard and straight-forward designs may be most efficiently checked with independent calculations. The Designer and Checker calculations shall both be retained for archiving. Revision of design calculations, if required, is the responsibility of the Designer.
3.
Structural Plans The Checker’s plan review comments are recorded on a set of check prints, including details and bar lists, and returned to the Designer for consideration. These check prints are a vital part of the checking process, and shall be preserved. If the Checker’s comments are not incorporated, the Designer should provide justification for not doing so. If there is a difference of opinion that cannot be resolved between the Designer and Checker, the Design Unit Manager shall resolve any issues. Check prints shall be submitted to the Design Unit Manager at the time of 100 percent PS&E turn-in. If assigned by the Design Unit Manager, a structural detailer shall perform a complete check of the geometry using CADD or hand calculations. Revision of plans, if required, is the responsibility of the designer.
4.
Quantities and Barlist The Checker shall provide an independent set of quantity calculations. These together with the Designer’s quantity calculations shall be placed in the job file. Resolution of differences between the Designer and Checker shall be completed before the Bridge PS&E submittal. See Section 12.2.2 for procedures and requirements. The Checker shall also check the barlist.

General Information
Guidelines for Bridge Site Visits When conducting site visits, the design team shall conform to the safety requirements of WSDOT and the Contractor. WSDOT safety requirements are included in the Secretary of Transportation’s Executive Order E 1033, the WSDOT Safety Procedures and Guidelines Manual M 75-01 and other policy documents. Contractor safety requirements are included in the safety plan for the site (see Standard Specifications section 1-07.1 and the WSDOT Construction Manual Section SS 1-07.1). Personal protective equipment shall be used as appropriate. A pre-activity safety plan is required prior to any site visit. When visiting sites that are not under construction, it is recommended to consult Region personnel beforehand. They are typically familiar with the site and can provide escort and traffic control if necessary. Traffic control may require significant advance notice. In some cases, an in-depth inspection with experienced BPO inspectors is appropriate. The decision to perform an in-depth inspection should include the Design Unit Manager, Region, the State Bridge Design Engineer, and the State Bridge Preservation Engineer. It may be necessary to use inspection equipment such as BPO’s Under Bridge Inspection Trucks (UBIT) to access details and obtain measurements during a site visit. Advance planning and coordination with BPO and the Region project office will be necessary if inspection equipment is required because of BPO’s heavy workload and the need to provide traffic control well in advance of the site visit. When visiting construction sites, Region personnel shall be consulted beforehand. They will be familiar with the safety plan for the site and will be able to educate the design team on the safety plan. They will also be able to provide escort and arrange for traffic control if necessary.
1.6.1
Existing Structure Modifications It is critical that the design team know as much as possible about the existing structure. Recent inspection reports, prepared by inspectors from the Bridge Preservation Office (BPO), contain useful information on the condition of existing structures. The inspection reports, as well as as-built plans, are available on the Intranet through Bridge Engineering Information System (BEIST). As-built plans are also available from the Regions through the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) Portal. The WSDOT Maintenance Operations Division documents maintenance work on existing structures in the MPET and HATS systems, which can be another source of information for the design team. As-built plans, inspection documentation and maintenance documentation are helpful, but may not necessarily be accurate or complete. Site visits are recommended when modifying existing bridges. However, if there is any doubt about the adequacy of the available information or concern about accelerated deterioration of the structural elements, a site visit is required. Region personnel or others may perform the site visit to obtain the information needed to detail existing conditions, especially for remote or difficult to access locations.
Page 1-40
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
General Information
Chapter 1
Site visits are especially important for expansion joint rehabilitation projects. On many recent expansion joint rehabilitation projects, field conditions during construction have not matched as-built and contract plan details. This can cause large impacts in construction since new steel joint components are typically prefabricated and typically must be installed in a short time frame or closure. Consideration should be given to exposing portions of existing expansion joints to confirm as-built or plan details either during design or by the Contractor during construction. When done by the Contractor:
• The plans should include new expansion joint details based upon the information available to the design team
• Adequate time should be given in the Contract between the investigation and the installation of the new joint assembly (typically at least four weeks) to allow for possible redesign and fabrication
• A materials procurement suspension should be considered.
1.6.2
New Structures Generally, photographs and site data from the Region are adequate for most new structure designs. However, if the new structure is a replacement for an existing structure, a site visit is recommended, particularly if the project requires staged removal of the existing structure and/or staged construction of the new structure.
1.6.3
Structure Demolition If structure demolition is required as part of a project, a site visit is recommended for the design team to determine if there are unique site restrictions that could affect the demolition. If unique site restrictions are observed, they should be documented, included in the job file, and noted on the special provisions checklist.

Preliminary Design
Preliminary Studies Different levels of preliminary studies are discussed below. Not all are applicable to a specific project. Bridge and Structures Office should participate in all applicable studies. Reports from the studies should be filed for future reference.
2.1.1
Interdisciplinary Design Studies Region may set up an Interdisciplinary Design Team (IDT) to review the various design alternatives for major projects. The IDT is composed of members from Regions, HQ, outside agencies, and consulting firms. The members have different areas of expertise, contribute ideas, and participate in the selection of design alternatives. This work will often culminate in the publication of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Bridge designers may be asked to participate either as a support resource or as a member of the IDT.
2.1.2
Value Engineering Studies Value Engineering (VE) is a review process and analysis of a design project. The VE team seeks to define the most cost-effective means of satisfying the basic function(s) of the project. Usually a VE study takes place before or during the time that the region is working on the design. Occasionally, a VE study examines a project with a completed PS&E. VE studies are normally required for projects with cost overruns. The VE team is headed by a facilitator and is composed of members with different areas of expertise from Regions, HQ, outside agencies, and consulting firms. The Team Facilitator will lead the team through the VE process. The team will review Region’s project as defined by the project’s design personnel. The VE team will determine the basic function(s) that are served by the project, brainstorm all possible alternatives to serve the same function(s), evaluate the alternatives for their effectiveness to meet the project’s basic functions, determine costs, and prioritize and recommend alternatives. The VE team will prepare a report and present their findings to the region. The Region is then required to investigate and address the VE team’s findings in the final design. Bridge designers may be asked to participate either as a support resource or as a member of the VE team. VE studies usually take place over a three to five day period. Engineers participating in VE studies, Cost-Risk Assessment (CRA) or Cost Estimate and Validation Process (CEVP) meetings shall call the S&E Engineers and double check all costs when providing cost estimates at VE studies and CRA meetings.

Preliminary Design
Preliminary Recommendations for Bridge Rehabilitation Projects When the Region starts a bridge rehabilitation project, they will submit a written memo requesting that the Bridge and Structures Office make preliminary project recommendations. The Bridge and Structures Office will review the as-built plans, load ratings, existing inspection and condition reports prepared by the Bridge Preservation Office (BPO), and schedule a site visit with Region and other stakeholders. Special inspection of certain portions of the structure may be included in the site visit or scheduled later with Region and BPO. The purpose of the inspections is to obtain more detailed information as to the bridge’s condition, to obtain dimensions and take photographs of details needed for the project recommendations. Following the site visit, the next steps are:
• Determine the load capacity of the existing bridge.
• Determine what type of rehabilitation work is needed and time frame required to accomplish the work.
• Determine any special construction staging requirements. Can the bridge be totally shut down for the rehabilitation period? How many lanes will need to be open? Can the work be accomplished during night closures or weekend closures?
• Develop various alternatives and cost estimates for comparison, ranging from “do nothing” to “new replacement”.
• Determine what the remaining life expectancies are for the various rehabilitation alternatives.
• Determine the cost of a new replacement bridge. If the cost for the rehabilitation is equal or greater than 60 percent of a new replacement bridge, a new replacement bridge is recommended. The Bridge and Structures Office will provide Region with a written report with background information. The Region will be given an opportunity to review the draft report and to provide input prior to finalization. The Bridge Project Support Engineer and Specifications & Estimates Engineers (S&E) provide bridge scoping cost estimates to Regions for their use in determining budgets during Region's project definition phase. The S&E Engineers will check the Bridge Project Support Engineer's estimate as well as check each other.
2.1.4
Preliminary Recommendations for New Bridge Projects The Region will seek assistance from the Bridge and Structures Office when they are preparing a design project requiring new bridges. Similar to the procedures outlined above for rehabilitation projects. The Region will submit a written memo requesting that the bridge office make preliminary project recommendations. The Bridge and Structures Office will provide scope of work, cost estimate(s), and a summary of the preferred alternatives with recommendations. Face to face meetings with the Region project staff are recommended prior to sending a written memo. The Bridge Project Support Engineer and Specifications & Estimates Engineers provide bridge scoping cost estimates to Regions for their use in determining budgets during Region's project definition phase. The S&E Engineers will check the Bridge Project Support Engineer's estimate as well as check each other.

Type, Size, and Location (TS&L) Reports The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) requires that major or unusual bridges must have a Type, Size, and Location (TS&L) report prepared. The report will describe the project, proposed structure(s), cost estimates, other design alternatives considered, and recommendations. The report provides justification for the selection of the preferred alternative. A letter of approval by FHWA of the TS&L study is the basis for advancing the project to the design stage. The need for Type, Size, and Location (TS&L) report will be determined by the Bridge and Structures and WSDOT Project offices. The FHWA should be contacted as early as possible in the Project Development stage because the FHWA requires a TS&L study for tunnels, movable bridges, unusual structures, and major structures. Smaller bridges that are unusual or bridge projects for Local Agencies may also require a TS&L study. Other projects, such as long viaducts, may not. Check with the Bridge Project Support Engineer to see if a TS&L report is necessary. The preparation of the TS&L report is the responsibility of the Bridge and Structures Office. The TS&L cannot be submitted to FHWA until after the environmental documents have been submitted. However, TS&L preparation need not wait for environmental document approval, but may begin as soon as the bridge site data is available. See the Design Manual M 22-01 for the type of information required for a bridge site data submittal. 2.1.5.A
TS&L General
The designer should first review the project history in order to become familiar with the project. The environmental and design reports should be reviewed. The bridge site data should be checked so that additional data, maps, or drawings can be requested. A meeting with Region and a site visit should be arranged after reviewing the history of the project. The Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Services Branch must be contacted early in the TS&L process in order to have foundation information. Specific recommendations on the foundation type must be included in the TS&L report. The Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Services Branch will submit a detailed foundation report for inclusion as an appendix to the TS&L report. To determine the preferred structural alternative, the designer should: 1.
Develop a list of all feasible alternatives. At this stage, the range of alternatives should be kept wide open. Brainstorming with the Design Unit Managers and other engineers can provide new and innovative solutions.
2.
Eliminate the least desirable alternatives by applying the constraints of the project. Question and document the assumptions of any restrictions and constraints. There should be no more than four alternatives at the end of this step.
3.
Perform preliminary design calculations for unusual or unique structural problems to verify that the remaining alternatives are feasible.
4.
Compare the advantages, disadvantages, and costs of the remaining alternatives to determine the preferred alternative(s).
5.
Visit the project site with the Region, Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Services Branch, and HQ Hydraulics staff.

Preliminary Design
FHWA expects specific information on scour and backwater elevations for the permanent bridge piers, as well as, for any temporary falsework bents placed in the waterway opening. After the piers have been located, a memo requesting a Hydraulics Report should be sent to the HQ Hydraulics Unit. The HQ Hydraulics Unit will submit a report for inclusion as an appendix to the TS&L report. The State Bridge and Structures Architect should be consulted early in the TS&L study period. “Notes to the File” should be made documenting the aesthetic requirements and recommendations of the State Bridge and Structures Architect. Cost backup data is needed for any costs used in the TS&L study. FHWA expects TS&L costs to be based on estimated quantities. This cost data is to be included in an appendix to the TS&L report. The quantities should be compatible with the S&E Engineer’s cost breakdown method. The Specifications & Estimates Engineers will check the designer's estimated costs included in TS&L reports. In the case of consultant prepared TS&L reports, the designer shall have the S&E Engineers check the construction costs. 2.1.5.B
TS&L Outline
The TS&L report should describe the project, the proposed structure, and give reasons why the bridge type, size, and location were selected. 2.1.5.B.1
Cover, Title Sheet, and Index
These should identify the project, owner, location and the contents of the TS&L. 2.1.5.B.2
Photographs
There should be enough color photographs to provide the look and feel of the bridge site. The prints should be numbered and labeled and the location indicated on a diagram. 2.1.5.B.3
Introduction
The introduction describes the report, references, and other reports used to prepare the TS&L study. The following reports should be listed, if used.
• Design Reports and Supplements
• Environmental Reports
• Architectural Visual Assessment or Corridor Theme Reports
• Hydraulic Report
• Geotechnical Reports 2.1.5.B.4
Project Description
The TS&L report clearly defines the project. A vicinity map should be shown. Care should be taken to describe the project adequately but briefly. The project description summarizes the preferred alternative for the project design.

2.1.5.B.5
Design Criteria
The design criteria identify the AASHTO LRFD and AASHTO Guide Specifications that will be used in the bridge design. Sometimes other design criteria or special loadings are used. These criteria should be listed in the TS&L. Some examples in this category might be the temperature loading used for segmental bridges or areas defined as wetlands. 2.1.5.B.6
Structural Studies
The structural studies section documents how the proposed structure Type, Size, and Location were determined. The following considerations should be addressed.
• Aesthetics
• Cost estimates
• Geometric constraints
• Project staging and stage construction requirements
• Foundations
• Hydraulics
• Feasibility of construction
• Structural constraints
• Maintenance
This section should describe how each of these factors leads to the preferred alternative. Show how each constraint eliminated or supported the preferred alternatives. Here are some examples. “Prestressed concrete girders could not be used because environmental restrictions required that no permanent piers could be placed in the river. This requires a 230-foot clear span.” “Restrictions on falsework placement forced the use of self supporting precast concrete or steel girders.” 2.1.5.B.7
Executive Summary
The executive summary should be able to “stand alone” as a separate document. The project and structure descriptions should be given. Show the recommended alternative(s) with costs and include a summary of considerations used to select preferred alternatives or to eliminate other alternatives. 2.1.5.B.8
Drawings
Preliminary plan drawings of the recommended alternative are included in an appendix. The drawings show the plan, elevation, and typical section. For projects where alternative designs are specified as recommended alternatives, preliminary plan drawings for each of the different structure types shall be included. Supplemental drawings showing special features, such as complex piers, are often included to clearly define the project. 2.1.5.C
Reviews and Submittals
While writing the TS&L report, all major decisions should be discussed with the Design Unit Manager, who can decide if the State Bridge Design Engineer needs to be consulted. A peer review meeting with the State Bridge Design Engineer should be scheduled at the 50 percent completion stage. If applicable, the FHWA Bridge Engineer should be invited to provide input. The final report must be reviewed, approved, and the Preliminary Plan drawings signed by the State Bridge and Structures Architect, the Bridge Project Support Engineer, the State Bridge Design Engineer, and the State Bridge and Structures Engineer. The TS&L report is submitted with a cover letter to FHWA signed by the State Bridge and Structures Engineer.

Preliminary Design
Alternate Bridge Designs Bridge site conditions or current market conditions may justify the creation of alternate bridge designs. WSDOT has successfully used alternate bridge designs in the past to obtain best-value bridge design and construction solutions for specific locations. Alternate bridge designs may be considered when the following conditions can be satisfied:
• Construction cost estimates for the alternate designs should be comparable (within 10 percent). Cost estimates should include anticipated life-cycle costs (painting, maintenance, inspection). Periods of market uncertainty, with associated structure cost fluctuations, can provide further justification for alternate bridge designs.
• Region staff must approve the design expenditures for the preparation of alternate bridge designs, including preliminary plans, final bridge plans, specifications and construction cost estimates.
• WSDOT Bridge Office staffing levels and design schedules should allow for the preparation of alternate bridge designs.
• Variations in pier location may be required in order to optimize superstructure design for different alternates. Environmental constraints, geotechnical, hydraulic and scour conditions all need to allow for variations in pier location.
• Construction staging and traffic control must be determined for the alternates.
• Alternate bridge design concepts must be reviewed and approved by the Bridge and Structures Architect.

Preliminary Plan The Preliminary Plan preparation stage is the most important phase of bridge and buried structure design because it is the basis for the final design. The Preliminary Plan should completely define the bridge and buried structure geometry so the final roadway design by the Regions and the structural design by the Bridge and Structures Office can take place with minimal revisions.
2.2.1
Development of the Preliminary Plan 2.2.1.A
Process and Sequence of Development
2.2.1.A.1
Schedule
Development of the Preliminary Plan is the first milestone in the Structure design process. The Scope Of Work (SOW) agreement negotiated between the Region Design PEO and the Bridge and Structures Office at or shortly after the project kickoff establishes the deliverables (design submittals) to be produced and the due dates for the various deliverable review milestones for the specific project. The Structural Submittal Expectations Matrix at www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/ ProjectMgmt/DEM/Bridge.pdf outlines the expected content of the design submittal deliverables at specific stages of design development. 2.2.1.A.2
Structure Site Data
Structure Site Data is the background data and information developed by the Region Project Office and submitted to the Bridge and Structures Office for use in developing the Preliminary Plan. Development and content of Structure Site Data is defined by Chapter 710 of the WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01. Upon receipt by the Bridge and Structures Office, the Bridge Preliminary Plan Engineer and the Bridge Preliminary Plan Detailer in the Bridge Project Support Unit review the contents against the Structure Site Data checklist, Exhibit 710-01 of Design Manual Chapter 710, to ensure completeness of the submittal. Conformance with WSDOT CAD detailing protocol, especially geometric consistency, is also confirmed at this time. If inconsistencies or omissions are discovered, the Region Project Office is contacted to revise and supplement the Structure Site Data submittal as necessary. When the Structure Site Data is confirmed as complete, the development of the Preliminary Plan begins. 2.2.1.A.3
Preliminary Plan Design Assignment
Development of the Preliminary Plan within the Bridge and Structures Office generally occurs in two different ways. The primary approach as project schedules allow, is for the Preliminary Plan to be developed by designers and detailers within the Bridge Project Support Unit. An alternative approach is for the Preliminary Plan to be developed by designers and detailers within one of the Bridge Office Structural Design Units under the review guidance of the Bridge Preliminary Plan Engineer and the Bridge Preliminary Plan Detailer in the Bridge Project Support Unit. The flowchart for alternative approach for the Preliminary Plan preparation is shown in Appendix 1.2-A1: Bridge & Structures Design Office Workflow. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

2.2.1.A.4
Preliminary Plan Development
Preliminary Plan development includes initial steps outlined in Sections 2.2.1.B through 2.2.1.G, further development under Section 2.2.3 and Section 2.2.4, and the review, submittal, and approval process outlined in Section 2.2.6. The development steps of Sections 2.2.1.B through 2.2.1.G and Section 2.2.3 lead to selection of a preferred Structure Alternative for structure type, configuration, and orientation. Through this process, the CAD details of plan, elevation, cross sections, and other pertinent details are developed to sufficient completeness and consistency to bring the Preliminary Plan to the Initial Internal Review milestone. 2.2.1.A.5
Initial Internal Review
Once the Preliminary Plan is developed and detailed to the point of presenting a complete concept solution, including an initial set of Notes To The Region questions, the plan is ready for circulation for an initial internal review. At this point, the preliminary plan designer circulates a PDF file of the Preliminary Plan to the following:
• Region Project Office, including Designer(s), Team Leader, and Project Engineer and any other actively involved Project Office management staff
• The Chief Foundation Engineer of the Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Division, or the Geotechnical Engineer assigned to the project, if assigned at that time
• The State Hydraulics Engineer
• The State Bridge and Structures Architect - see Section 2.2.6.A
• The appropriate Bridge and Structures Office structure design specialist for the structure material type - Steel Specialist for steel bridges, Concrete Specialist for concrete bridges and buried structures - see Section 2.2.6.A.
• The Bridge Project Support Unit Manager
• The Structure Design Unit Manager assigned to design the structure
• The designer in the Structure Design Unit assigned to lead the design (if assigned at that time)
• The State Bridge Design Engineer
• The Coast Guard Liaison Engineer when the bridge requires a US Coast Guard permit for navigation opening and clearance.
• The checker assigned to review the project - either another designer in the Bridge Project Support Unit or, in the case of a Preliminary Plan prepared in a Bridge Office Structural Design Unit, the Bridge Preliminary Plan Engineer in the Bridge Project Support Unit The deadline for return of review comments is specified in the distribution email. The review period is conventionally two-weeks, but this may be adjusted as appropriate to account for holidays, project schedule status, and complexity of the project. Comments are reviewed and addressed as they are received. If comments received are significant enough to trigger changes in structure type, configuration, and orientation, there may be additional internal reviews at the discretion of the Bridge Preliminary Plan Engineer.

2.2.1.A.6
Request for Geotechnical and Hydraulics Information
Coincident with the initial internal review distribution, the Request for Geotechnical & Hydraulics Information for Bridge Preliminary Plan form (Appendix 2.2.A-5) is completed and distributed to the (1) the Chief Foundation Engineer or the Geotechnical Engineer assigned to the project, and, for waterway crossings (2) the State Hydraulics Engineer. The Preliminary Plan designer completes the project name and location, and the survey line stations defining the structure limits. The geotechnical and hydraulic contacts are responsible to complete the tabular data in the form. The return of a completed form shall coincide with the end of the initial internal review. The hydraulics information generated by this request pertains to how hydrology affects geotechnical aspects of the foundation design (scour and channel migration). This information is supplemental to the stream flow data provided with the Structure Site Data. 2.2.1.A.7
Cost Estimate
Once consensus is reached on the structure type, configuration, and orientation through the internal review process, and the Request for Geotechnical & Hydraulics Information form is completed and returned, the Preliminary Plan with the completed geotechnical and hydraulics Information form is presented to the Bridge Project Support Engineer, or designee, for preparation of the preliminary cost estimate. See Section 2.2.5. 2.2.1.A.8
Distribution for Preliminary Plan Approval
With the completion of the cost estimate, the Preliminary Plan is ready for distribution to the Region for approval. See Section 2.2.6.B and Section 2.2.6.C. 2.2.1.A.9
Distribution of Final Preliminary Plan
When consensus is reached with Region signature approval on the Preliminary Plan as distributed in accordance with Section 2.2.6.B and Section 2.2.6.C, the Preliminary Plan is ready for final distribution, to officially conclude the Preliminary Plan process and fully transfer design responsibility for the project to the Bridge Structural Design Unit. The distribution list for the Final Preliminary Plan remains the same as specified in Section 2.2.6.B. 2.2.1.B
Responsibilities
In general, the responsibilities of the designer, checker, detailer, and Design Unit Manager are described in Section 1.2.2. The Preliminary Plan designer as defined in Section 2.2.1.A.3 is responsible for developing a Preliminary Plan for the bridge or buried structure. The Preliminary Plan must be compatible with the geometric, aesthetic, staging, geotechnical, hydraulic, and structural requirements and conditions at the bridge site as presented by the Structure Site Data. The Structural Design Unit Manager shall be kept informed of progress on the Preliminary Plan so that the schedule can be monitored. If problems develop, the Structural Design Unit Manager can request adjustments to the schedule or allocate additional manpower to meet the schedule.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 2-9
Chapter 2
Preliminary Design
The Preliminary Plan designer keeps the job file up-to-date by documenting all conversations, meetings, requests, questions, and approvals concerning the project. Notes-to-the-designer, and details not shown in the preliminary plan shall be documented in the job file. The checker, as defined in Section 2-2.1.A.5, shall provide an independent review of the plan, verifying that it is in compliance with the Structure Site Data as provided by the Region and as corrected in the job file. The plan shall be compared against the Preliminary Plan checklist (see Appendix 2.2-A4) to ensure that all necessary information is shown. The checker reviews the plan for consistency with office design practice, detailing practice, and for constructability. The Preliminary Plan shall be detailed using current office CAD equipment and software. 2.2.1.C
Site Reconnaissance
The Structure Site Data submitted by the Region will include photographs, and in some cases a video, of the site. Even for minor projects, this may not be enough information for the designer to work from to develop a Preliminary Plan. For most bridge projects, site visits are necessary. Site visits with Region project staff and other project stakeholders, such as, Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Division, HQ Hydraulics Office, and Region Design PEO should be arranged through the Bridge Project Support Unit Manager. 2.2.1.D
Coordination
The designer is responsible for coordinating the design and review process throughout the project. This includes seeking input from various WSDOT Offices and outside agencies. The designer should consult with Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Division, HQ Hydraulics Office, Bridge Preservation Office, and Region design and maintenance, and other resources for their input. One aspect of coordination with the Region Design PEO is review of the Not Included In Bridge Quantities List (NIBQ), DOT Form 230-038 - see Appendix 12.1-A1. The NIBQ itemizes elements shown in the Preliminary Plan that are not related to the structural design, but rather are of civil design context and as such are the design responsibility of the Region. Creation of the NIBQ helps to ensure that responsibility for all elements identified in the Preliminary Plan is clearly assigned and understood. 2.2.1.E
Consideration of Alternatives
In the process of developing the Preliminary Plan, the designer brainstorms, develops, and evaluates various design alternatives. See Section 2.2.3 General Factors for Consideration and how they apply to a particular site. See also Section 2.1.5A. Preliminary design calculations shall be done to verify feasibility of girder span and spacing, falsework span capacity, geometry issues, and construction clearances. Generally, the number of alternatives is usually limited to only an obvious few for most projects. For some smaller projects and most major projects, design alternatives merit development and close evaluation.

Chapter 2
Designer Recommendation
After a thorough analysis of the needs and limitations of the site, studying all information, and developing and evaluating the design alternatives for the project, the designer selects the preferred alternative, and places justification of the selection in the job file. At this stage, the designer should discuss the recommendation with the Bridge Project Support Unit Manager. 2.2.1.G
Concept Approval
For some projects, the presentation, in “F” above, to the Bridge Project Support Unit Manager satisfies the need for concept approval. Large complex projects, projects of unique design, or projects where two or more alternatives appear viable, should be presented to the Bridge Project Support Unit Manager, the Structure Design Unit Manager assigned to design the project and the designer, if assigned at that time, and State Bridge Design Engineer for concurrence before Preliminary Plan development is completed. 2.2.1.H
Consideration for Accelerated Bridge Construction
In the process of developing the Preliminary Plan, the designer develops, and evaluates to possibility of accelerated bridge construction (ABC). Preliminary design calculations shall be done to verify feasibility of ABC for some projects with consultation with the Region Development Engineer and Project office.
2.2.2
Documentation 2.2.2.A
Job File
An official job file is created by the Bridge Preliminary Plan Detailer in the Bridge Project Support Unit when a Structure Site Data submittal is received by the Bridge and Structures Office from the Region Project Office. This job file serves as a depository for all communications and resource information for the job. Scheduling and time estimates are kept in this file, as well as cost estimates, preliminary quantities, and documentation of all approvals. Records of important telephone conversations and copies of e-mails approving decisions are also kept in the job file. After completing the Preliminary Plan, the job file continues to serve as a depository for useful communications and documentation for all pertinent project related information and decisions during the design process through and including preparation of the Final Bridge PS&E. 2.2.2.B
Structure Site Data
All Preliminary Plans are developed from Structure Site Data submitted by the Region Project Office. This submittal consists of a document describing the project with a bullet list itemization of the Structure Site Data components, forms, files, and data that are also attached to or linked by the email transmittal. See WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01 Chapter 710 and Exhibit 710-01. See also Section 2.2.1.A.2 and Appendices 2.2-A1, 2.2-A2, and 2.2-A3.

Design Report or Design Summary and Value Engineering Studies
Some bridge and buried structure projects have a Design File Report or Design Summary prepared by the Region. This is a document, which includes design considerations and conclusions reached in the development of the project. It defines the scope of work for the project. It serves to document the design standards and applicable deviations for the roadway alignment and geometry. It is also an excellent reference for project history, safety and traffic data, environmental concerns, and other information. If a VE study was done on the project, the report will identify alternatives that have been studied and why the recommended alternative was chosen. 2.2.2.D

Permits 2.2.4.A
Coast Guard Waterway Jurisdiction and Navigation Permits for New Construction
For all waterway crossings, the US Coast Guard shall be contacted for determination and confirmation of waterway jurisdiction and any associated permit requirements or categorical assignment. When the structure length parallel to the roadway centerline is less than 20-feet, this action is the responsibility of the Region, whether by the Region Design Project Office or the associated Region Environmental Services Office (ESO). When the structure length parallel to the roadway centerline is 20-feet or greater, this action is the responsibility of either the Region ESO, ideally as part of the project scoping phase, or the Bridge and Structures Office as part of the preliminary plan process. Based on the response provided by the US Coast Guard, whether through the Region or through the Coast Guard Liaison Engineer, the preliminary plan identifies the waterway jurisdiction status in the left margin of the plan. The USCG block specifies whether the USCG has jurisdiction or not, along with the date that the USCG made the determination, and indicates whether a USCG navigation permit is required. When the response received from the US Coast Guard indicates that a navigation permit Is required, the Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for coordinating and applying for this permit, in accordance with Design Manual M 22.01 Section 710.03. The Coast Guard Liaison Engineer in the Bridge Project Support Unit of the Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for this. See the Design Manual M 22-01, chapter covering Environmental Permits and Approvals, or the Environmental Manual Chapter 500 for general permitting information. Section 9 Permit – Bridge Work in Navigable Waters can be found on the WSDOT Federal Environmental Permits and Approval web page, www.wsdot.wa.gov/environment/ technical/permits-approvals/other-aquatic-resource-permits. Permitting procedures are available on the WSDOT Environmental Permitting tools and help page, www.wsdot. wa.gov/environment/technical/permits-approvals. The work on developing the permit application should be started early in the preliminary plan process so that it is ready to be sent to the US Coast Guard at least eight months prior to the project ad date. The Coast Guard Liaison Engineer should be included in all distributions of the Preliminary Plan as outlined in Sections 2.2.1.A.5, 2.2.1.A.8, and 2.2.1.A.9. The Coast Guard Liaison Engineer uses these Preliminary Plans to develop the Coast Guard Application plan sheets, which become part of the permit.

Coast Guard Temporary Regulation Adjustments for Construction Operations at Existing Structures
Existing bridges crossing navigable waters occasionally require construction or maintenance activities that impact navigation channels governed by USCG permits. For fixed span bridges, this may include construction or maintenance activities that infringe upon the horizontal and vertical navigation opening defined in the USCG permit. For movable bridges, in addition to the above, this may also include adjustments to existing bridge opening operating regulations. Such temporary adjustments require coordination with the US Coast Guard, and the primary responsibility for this contact and coordination lies with the Region Design Project Office. The scope of such coordination varies depending on the extent of the infringement into the defined horizontal or vertical navigation clearance opening, the extent of the change to the bridge operation regulation, and the duration of the construction or maintenance activity. This coordination activity may require the Design Project Office to conduct a survey of waterway users or to perform other background information tasks requested by the US Coast Guard. Projects with more extensive impacts may lie outside the approval authority of the local USCG Commander and may require review and action by US Coast Guard HQ in Washington, DC. In all cases, the earlier in the design process that the Region Design Project Office initiates these coordination efforts, the more likely the USCG can complete their regulatory process without impacting the project schedule. 2.2.4.C
Other
All other permits will be the responsibility of the Region (see the Design Manual M 22-01). The Bridge and Structures Office may be asked to provide information to the Region to assist them in making applications for these permits.
2.2.5
Preliminary Cost Estimate A preliminary cost estimate is developed when the bridge type, foundation type, deck area and adjacent retaining walls are confirmed. At the Preliminary Plan stage the cost estimate is based on square-foot costs taken from the Chapter 12 and adjusted for structure specifics. Consult with the Bridge Project Support Engineer or designee. The preliminary cost estimate is based on recent bidding history on similar structures, degree of difficulty of construction, inflation trends, and length of time until Ad Date, and time for completion of construction. It is considered accurate to within 15 percent, but should be accurate enough to preclude a surprise increase at the time of the Engineer’s estimate, which is based on completed design quantities. The preliminary cost estimate shall be updated frequently as changes are made to the Preliminary Plan or new data influences the costs. As the Preliminary Plan is developed through the Initial Internal Review stage of Section 2.2.1.A.5, but before sending to the Bridge Design Engineer for signature, the Preliminary Plan and completed Request For Geotechnical & Hydraulics Information form is submitted to the Bridge Project Support Engineer or designee. The information presented shall include the complete Preliminary Plan and all backup data previously prepared on costs for the structures (such as preliminary quantity calculations, preliminary foundation type selection, etc,). The Bridge Project Support Engineer or designee reviews the Preliminary
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Chapter 2
Preliminary Design
Plan, prepares, signs, and dates a cost estimate summary sheet, and returns the package to the designer. When the Preliminary Plan is presented to the State Bridge Design Engineer for signature (see Section 2.2.6.B), the submittal shall include the summary sheet prepared by the Bridge Project Support Engineer or designee. The summary sheet and backup data is then placed in the job file. Do not send the summary sheet to the Region. After submittal of the Preliminary Plan to the Region, the Region shall be notified immediately of any increases in the preliminary cost estimate during the structural design.

Approvals 2.2.6.A
State Bridge and Structures Architect/Specialists
For all preliminary plans, the State Bridge and Structures Architect and appropriate specialists should be aware and involved when the designer is first developing the plan. The State Bridge and Structures Architect and specialists should be given a print of the plan by the Preliminary Plan designer. This is concurrent with the checking of the Preliminary Plan. The State Bridge and Structures Architect and specialist reviews, approves, signs and dates the print. This signed print is placed in the job file. If there are any revisions, which affect the aesthetics of the approved preliminary plan, the State Bridge and Structures Architect should be asked to review and approve, by signature, a print showing the revisions, which change elements of aesthetic significance. For large, multiple bridge projects, the State Bridge and Structures Architect should be contacted for development of a coordinated architectural concept for the project corridor. The architectural concept for a project corridor is generally developed in draft form and reviewed with the project stakeholders prior to finalizing. When finalized, it should be signed by the Region Administrator or designee. Approval from the State Bridge and Structures Architect is required on all retaining walls and noise wall aesthetics including finishes and materials, and configuration. In order to achieve superstructure type optimization and detailing consistency, the following guidelines shall be used for the preparation of all Preliminary Plans:
• Preliminary Plans for all steel bridges and structures shall be reviewed by the Steel Specialist.
• Preliminary Plans for all concrete bridges and structures shall be reviewed by the Concrete Specialist.
• Detailing of all Preliminary Plans shall be reviewed by the Preliminary Plans Detailing Specialist. These individuals shall signify their approval by signing the Preliminary Plan in the Architect/Specialist block on the first plan sheet, together with the State Bridge and Structures Architect.

Railroad
When a railroad is involved with a structure on a Preliminary Plan, the HQ RR Liaison Engineer of the Design Office must be involved during the plan preparation process. A copy of the Preliminary Plan is sent to the HQ RR Liaison Engineer, who then sends a copy to the railroad involved for their comments and approval. The railroad will respond with approval by letter to the HQ RR Liaison Engineer. A copy of this letter is then routed to the Bridge and Structures Office and then placed in the job file. For design plans prepared within the Bridge and Structures Office, the Design Unit Manager or lead designer will be responsible for coordinating and providing shoring plans for structures adjacent to railroads. It is recommended that the Construction Support Unit design, prepare, stamp, and sign shoring plans. However, the design unit may elect to design, prepare, stamp, and sign shoring plans. For consultant prepared design plans, the Design Unit Manager or lead reviewer will be responsible for coordinating and having the consultant design shoring plans for structures adjacent to railroads. The Construction Support Unit has design criteria and sample plan details which can be used by the design units and consultants. A Construction Support engineer is available to attend design project kick-off meetings if there is a need for railroad shoring plans or other constructability issues associated with the project. Regardless of who prepares the bridge plans, all shoring plans should be reviewed by the Construction Support Unit before they are submitted for railroad review and approval at the Constructability Review stage. At the Constructability Review stage or sooner if possible, especially for seismic retrofit project, the S&E Engineer will send copies of the layout, foundation plan, temporary shoring plans, and appropriate special provision section for structures adjacent to railroads to the HQ RR Liaison Engineer, who will submit this package to the appropriate railroad for review and approval. The shoring plans shall show the pressure loading diagram and calculations to expedite the railroad’s review and approval.

Preliminary Plan Criteria
2.3.1
Highway Crossings 2.3.1.A
General
A highway crossing is defined as a grade separation between two intersecting roadways. Naming convention varies slightly between mainline highway crossings and ramp highway crossings, but essentially, all bridges carry one highway, road, or street over the intersecting highway, road, or street. 2.3.1.A.1
Mainline Highway Crossings
Names for mainline highway crossings are defined by the route designation or name of state highway, county road, or city street being carried over another highway, road, or street. For example, a bridge included as part of an interchange involving I-205 and SR 14 and providing for passage of traffic on I-205 under SR 14 would be named SR 14 Over I-205 (followed by the bridge number). 2.3.1.A.2
Ramp Highway Crossings
Names for ramp highway crossings are defined by the state highway route numbers being connected, the directions of travel being connected, and the designation or name of the highway, road, or street being bridged. For example, a bridge in the Hewitt Avenue Interchange connecting traffic from westbound US 2 to northbound I-5 and passing over Everett Street would be named 2W-5N Ramp Over Everett Street (followed by the bridge number). A bridge connecting traffic from northbound I-5 to westbound SR 518 and passing over northbound I-405 and a ramp connecting southbound I-405 to northbound I-5 would be named 5N-518W Over 405N, 405S-5N (followed by the bridge number). 2.3.1.B
Bridge Width
The bridge roadway channelization (configuration of lanes and shoulders) is provided by the region with the Bridge Site Data. For state highways, the roadway geometrics are controlled by the Design Manual M 22-01. For city and county arterials, the roadway geometrics are controlled by Chapter 42 of the Local Agency Guidelines M 36-63. 2.3.1.C
Horizontal Clearances
Safety dictates that fixed objects be placed as far from the edge of the roadway as is economically feasible. Criteria for minimum horizontal clearances to bridge piers and retaining walls are outlined in the Design Manual M 22-01. The Design Manual M 22-01 outlines clear zone and recovery area requirements for horizontal clearances without guardrail or barrier being required. Actual horizontal clearances shall be shown in the plan view of the Preliminary Plan (to the nearest 0.1 foot). Minimum horizontal clearances to inclined columns or wall surfaces should be provided at the roadway surface and for a vertical distance of 6′ above the edge of pavement. When bridge end slopes fall within the recovery area, the minimum horizontal clearance should be provided for a vertical distance of 6′ above the fill surface. See Figure 2.3.1-1. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 2-19
Chapter 2
Preliminary Design
Bridge piers and abutments ideally should be placed such that the minimum clearances can be satisfied. However, if for structural or economic reasons, the best span arrangement requires a pier to be within clear zone or recovery area, and then guardrail or barrier can be used to mitigate the hazard. There are instances where it may not be possible to provide the minimum horizontal clearance even with guardrail or barrier. An example would be placement of a bridge pier in a narrow median. The required column size may be such that it would infringe on the shoulder of the roadway. In such cases, the barrier safety shape would be incorporated into the shape of the column. Barrier or guardrail would need to taper into the pier at a flare rate satisfying the criteria in the Design Manual M 22-01. See Figure 2.3.1-2. The reduced clearance to the pier would need to be approved by the Region. Horizontal clearances, reduced temporarily for construction, are covered in Section 2.3.9. Horizontal Clearance to Incline Piers

Chapter 2
Vertical Clearances
The required minimum vertical clearances are established by the functional classification of the highway and the construction classification of the project. For state highways, this is as outlined in the Design Manual M 22-01. For city and county arterials, this is as outlined in Chapter IV of the Local Agency Guidelines M 36-63. Actual minimum vertical clearances are shown on the Preliminary Plan (to the nearest 0.1 foot). The approximate location of the minimum vertical clearance is noted in the upper left margin of the plan. For structures crossing divided highways, minimum vertical clearances for both directions are noted. 2.3.1.E
End Slopes
The type and rate of end slope used at bridge sites is dependent on several factors. Soil conditions and stability, right of way availability, fill height or depth of cut, roadway alignment and functional classification, and existing site conditions are important. The region should have made a preliminary determination based on these factors during the preparation of the bridge site data. The side slopes noted on the Roadway Section for the roadway should indicate the type and rate of end slope. The Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Services Branch will recommend the minimum rate of end slope. This should be compared to the rate recommended in the Roadway Section and to existing site conditions (if applicable). The types of end slopes and bridge slope protection are discussed in the Design Manual M 22-01. Examples of slope protection are shown in Standard Plans M 21-01 Section A. 2.3.1.F
Determination of Bridge Length
Establishing the location of the end piers for a highway crossing is a function of the profile grade of the overcrossing roadway, the superstructure depth, the minimum vertical and horizontal clearances required for the structure, the profile grade and channelization (including future widening) of the undercrossing roadway, and the type and rate of end slope used. For the general case of bridges in cut or fill slopes, the control point is where the cut or fill slope plane meets the bottom of roadside ditch or edge of shoulder as applicable. From this point, the fill or cut slope plane is established at the recommended rate up to where the slope plane intersects the grade of the roadway at the shoulder. Following the requirements of Standard Plans M 21-01 Section A, the back of pavement seat, end of wing wall or end of retaining wall can be established at 3′ behind the slope intersection. See Figure 2.3.1-3.

For the general case of bridges on wall type abutments or “closed” abutments, the controlling factors are the required horizontal clearance and the size of the abutment. This situation would most likely occur in an urban setting or where right of way or span length is limited. 2.3.1.G
Pedestrian Crossings
Pedestrian crossings follow the same format as highway crossings. Geometric criteria for bicycle and pedestrian facilities are established in the Design Manual M 22-01. Width and clearances would be as established there and as confirmed by region. Minimum vertical clearance over a roadway is given in the Design Manual M 22-01. Unique items to be addressed with pedestrian facilities include ADA requirements, the railing to be used, handrail requirements, overhead enclosure requirements, and profile grade requirements for ramps and stairs. 2.3.1.H
Bridge Redundancy
Design bridges to minimize the risk of catastrophic collapse by using redundant supporting elements (columns and girders). For substructure design use the following in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification Section 1.3.4.
• One column minimum for roadways 40′ wide and under.
• Two columns minimum for roadways over 40′ to 60′.
• Three columns minimum for roadways over 60′. Collision protection or design for collision loads for piers with one or two columns shall be provided. For superstructure design use:
• Three girders (webs) minimum for roadways 32′ and under.
• Four girders (webs) minimum for roadways over 32′. See Appendix 2.3-A2-1 for details. Note: Any deviation from the above guidelines shall have a written approval by the Bridge Design Engineer.

Railroad Crossings 2.3.2.A
General
A railroad crossing is defined as a grade separation between an intersecting highway and a railroad. Names for railroad crossings are defined either as railroad over state highway or state highway over railroad. For example, a bridge carrying BNSF railroad tracks over I-5 would be named BNSF Over I-5 (followed by the bridge number) A bridge carrying I-90 over Union Pacific railroad tracks would be named I-90 Over UPRR (followed by the bridge number). Requirements for highway/railway grade separations may involve negotiations with the railroad company concerning clearances, geometrics, utilities, and maintenance roads. The railroad’s review and approval will be based on the completed Preliminary Plan. 2.3.2.B
Criteria
The initial Preliminary Plan shall be prepared in accordance with the criteria of this section to apply uniformly to all railroads. Variance from these criteria will be negotiated with the railroad, when necessary, after a Preliminary Plan has been provided for their review. 2.3.2.C
Bridge Width
For highway over railway grade separations the provisions of Section 2.3.1 pertaining to bridge width of highway crossings shall apply. Details for railway over highway grade separations will depend on the specific project and the railroad involved. 2.3.2.D
Horizontal Clearances
For railway over highway grade separations, undercrossings, the provisions of Section 2.3.1 pertaining to horizontal clearances for highway crossings shall apply. However, because of the heavy live loading of railroad spans, it is advantageous to reduce the span lengths as much as possible. For railroad undercrossings skewed to the roadway, piers may be placed up to the outside edge of standard shoulders (or 8′ minimum) if certain conditions are met (known future roadway width requirements, structural requirements, satisfactory aesthetics, satisfactory sight distance, barrier protection requirements, etc.). For railroad overcrossings, minimum horizontal clearances are as noted below: Fill Section Cut Section
Railroad Alone 14′ 16′
Horizontal clearance shall be measured from the center of the outside track to the face of pier. When the track is on a curve, the minimum horizontal clearance shall be increased at the rate of 1½″ for each degree of curvature. An additional 8′ of clearance for off-track equipment shall only be provided when specifically requested by the railroad. The actual minimum horizontal clearances shall be shown in the Plan view of the Preliminary Plan (to the nearest 0.1 foot).

2.3.2.E
Crash Walls
Crash walls, when required, shall be designed to conform to the criteria of the AREMA Manual. To determine when crash walls are required, consult the following: Union Pacific Railroad “Guidelines for Design of Highway Separation Structures over Railroad (Overhead Grade Separation)” AREMA Manual Railroad Liaison Engineer the Railroad. 2.3.2.F
Vertical Clearances
For railway over highway grade separations, the provisions of Section 2.3.1 pertaining to vertical clearances of highway crossings shall apply. For highway over railway grade separations, the minimum vertical clearance shall satisfy the requirements of the Design Manual M 22-01. The actual minimum vertical clearances shall be shown on the Preliminary Plan (to the nearest 0.1 foot). The approximate location of the minimum vertical clearance is noted in the upper left margin of the plan. 2.3.2.G
Determination of Bridge Length
For railway over highway grade separations, the provisions of Section 2.3.1 pertaining to the determination of bridge length shall apply. For highway over railway grade separations, the minimum bridge length shall satisfy the minimum horizontal clearance requirements. The minimum bridge length shall generally satisfy the requirements of Figure 2.3.2-1. Figure 2.3.2-1

Special Considerations
For highway over railway grade separations, the top of footings for bridge piers or retaining walls adjacent to railroad tracks shall be 2′ or more below the elevation of the top of tie and shall not have less than 2′ of cover from the finished ground. The footing face shall not be closer than 10′ to the center of the track. Any cofferdams, footings, excavation, etc., encroaching within 10′ of the center of the track requires the approval of the railroad.

Construction Openings For railroad clearances, see Design Manual M 22-01. The minimum horizontal construction opening is 9′ to either side of the centerline of track. The minimum vertical construction opening is 23′-6″ above the top of rail at 6′ offset from the centerline of track. Falsework openings shall be checked to verify that enough space is available for falsework beams to span the required horizontal distances and still provide the minimum vertical falsework clearance. Minimum vertical openings of less than 23′-6″ shall be coordinated with the HQ Railroad Liaison Engineer.
2.3.3
Water Crossings 2.3.3.A
Bridge Width
The provisions of Section 2.3.1 pertaining to bridge width for highway crossings apply here. 2.3.3.B
Horizontal Clearances
Water crossings over navigable waters requiring clearance for navigation channels shall satisfy the horizontal clearances required by the Coast Guard. Communication with the Coast Guard will be handled through the Coast Guard Liaison Engineer. For bridges over navigable waters, the centerline of the navigation channel and the horizontal clearances (to the nearest 0.1 foot) to the piers or the pier protection shall be shown on the Plan view of the Preliminary Plan. Pier locations shall be reviewed by the HQ Hydraulics unit. 2.3.3.C
Vertical Clearances
Water crossings structures shall provide vertical clearance for both freeboard, maintenance, hydraulic and, where applicable, shall satisfy navigation clearance requirements. Bridges over navigable waters shall satisfy the vertical clearances required by the Coast Guard. Communication with the Coast Guard will be handled through the Coast Guard Liaison Engineer. The actual minimum vertical clearance (to the nearest 0.1 foot) for the channel span shall be shown on the Preliminary Plan. The approximate location of the minimum vertical clearance shall be noted in the upper left margin of the plan. The clearance shall be shown to the water surface as required by the Coast Guard criteria. Minimum vertical clearances for the 100-year design freeboard and Maintenance shall be determined and documented in accordance with the WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01 Section 720.03(5)(b)(4) for Water Crossing Structures. The roadway profile and the bridge superstructure depth shall accommodate all minimum vertical clearances provided. The actual minimum vertical clearance to the 100-year flood shall be shown (to the nearest 0.1 foot) on the Preliminary Plan, and the approximate location of the minimum vertical clearance shall be noted in the upper left margin of the plan.

Chapter 2
Preliminary Design
2.3.3.D
End Slopes
The type and rate of end slopes for water crossings is similar to that for highway crossings. Soil conditions and stability, fill height, location of toe of fill, existing channel conditions, flood and scour potential, and environmental concerns are all important. As with highway crossings, the Region, and HQ Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Services Branch will make preliminary recommendations as to the type and rate of end slope. The State Hydraulics Branch will also review the Region’s recommendation for slope protection. 2.3.3.E
Determination of Bridge Length
Determining the overall length of a water crossing is not as simple and straightforward as for a highway crossing. Floodway requirements and environmental factors have a significant impact on where piers and fill can be placed. If a water crossing is required to satisfy floodway and environmental concerns, it will be known by the time the Preliminary Plan has been started. Environmental studies and the Design Report prepared by the region will document any restrictions on fill placement, pier arrangement, and overall floodway clearance. The Hydraulics Branch will need to review the size, shape, and alignment of all bridge piers in the floodway and the subsequent effect they will have on the base flood elevation. The overall bridge length may need to be increased depending on the span arrangement selected and the change in the flood backwater, or justification will need to be documented. 2.3.3.F
Scour and Stream Migration
The State Hydraulics Branch will indicate the anticipated depth of scour at the bridge piers. They will recommend pier shapes to best streamline flow and reduce the scour forces. They will also recommend measures to protect the piers from scour activity or accumulation of drift (use of deep foundations, minimum cover to top of footing, riprap, pier alignment to stream flow, closure walls between pier columns, etc.). The State Hydraulics Branch will indicate the likelihood and severity of stream migration at the bridge piers. Where lateral stream migration is a possibility, the design shall include a reliability based estimate of the effects on the structure. The design requirements for stream migration is shown in BDM Section 7.1.7. 2.3.3.G
Pier Protection
For bridges over navigable channels, piers adjacent to the channel may require pier protection such as fenders or pile dolphins. The Coast Guard will determine whether pier protection is required. This determination is based on the horizontal clearance provided for the navigation channel and the type of navigation traffic using the channel. 2.3.3.H
Construction Access and Time Restrictions
Water crossings will typically have some sort of construction restrictions associated with them. These must be considered during preliminary plan preparation. The time period that the Contractor will be allowed to do the work within the waterway may be restricted by regulations administered by various agencies. Depending on the time limitations, a bridge with fewer piers or faster pier construction may be more advantageous even if more expensive. Page 2-26
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Preliminary Design
Chapter 2
Contractor access to the water may also be restricted. Shore areas supporting certain plant species are sometimes classified as wetlands. A work trestle may be necessary in order to work in or gain access through such areas. Work trestles may also be necessary for bridge removal as well as new bridge construction. Work trestle feasibility, location, staging, deck area and approximate number of piles, and estimated cost need to be determined to inform the Region as part of the bridge preliminary plan. 2.3.3.I
2.3.4
Buried structures that qualify as a bridge per National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) shall be designed to meet above requirements for Water Crossings.
Bridge Widening 2.3.4.A
Bridge Width
The provisions of Section 2.3.1 pertaining to bridge width for highway crossings shall apply. In most cases, the width to be provided by the widening will be what is called for by the design standards, unless a deviation is approved. 2.3.4.B
Traffic Restrictions
Bridge widening involve traffic restrictions on the widened bridge and, if applicable, on the lanes below the bridge. The bridge site data submitted by the region should contain information regarding temporary lane widths and staging configurations. This information should be checked to be certain that the existing bridge width and the bridge roadway width during the intermediate construction stages of the bridge are sufficient for the lane widths, shy distances, temporary barriers, and construction room for the contractor. These temporary lane widths and shy distances are noted on the Preliminary Plan. The temporary lane widths and shy distances on the roadway beneath the bridge being widened should also be checked to ensure adequate clearance is available for any substructure construction. 2.3.4.C
Construction Sequence
A construction sequence shall be developed using the traffic restriction data in the bridge site data. The construction sequence shall take into account the necessary steps for construction of the bridge widening including both the substructure and superstructure. Placement of equipment is critical because of limited access and working space limitations. Space is required for cranes to construct shafts and erect the girders. Consult the Construction Support Unit for crane information, such as: boom angle, capacities, working loads, working radius, and crane footprint. Construction work off of and adjacent to the structure and the requirements of traffic flow on and below the structure shall be taken into account. Generally, cranes are not allowed to lift loads while supported from the existing structure. Checks shall be made to be certain that girder spacing, closure pours, and removal work are all compatible with the traffic arrangements. Projects with several bridges being widened at the same time should have sequencing that is compatible with the Region’s traffic plans during construction and that allow the Contractor room to work. It is important to meet with the Region project staff to assure that the construction staging and channelization of traffic during construction is feasible and minimizes impact to the traveling public.

Temporary Bridge Traffic Barrier
Temporary bridge traffic barrier shall be designed in accordance with Section 10.13.3.C.
2.3.6
Retaining Walls and Noise Walls The requirements for Preliminary Plans for retaining walls and noise walls are similar to the requirements for bridges. The plan and elevation views define the overall limits and the geometry of the wall. The section view will show general structural elements that are part of the wall and the surface finish of the wall face. The most common types of walls are outlined in Chapter 730 of the Design Manual M 22-01. The Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for all nonstandard walls (retaining walls and noise walls) as spelled out in the Design Manual M 22-01.
2.3.7
Bridge Deck Drainage The State Hydraulics Branch provides a review of the Preliminary Plan with respect to the requirements for bridge deck drainage. An 11″ x 17″ print shall be provided to the State Hydraulics Branch for their review as soon as the Preliminary Plan has been developed. The length and width of the structure, profile grade, superelevation diagram, and any other pertinent information (such as locations of drainage off the structure) should be shown on the plan. For work with existing structures, the locations of any and all bridge drains shall be noted. The State Hydraulics Branch or the Region Hydraulics staff will determine the type of drains necessary (if any), the location, and spacing requirements. They will furnish any details or modifications required for special drains or special situations. If low points of sag vertical curves or superelevation crossovers occur within the limits of the bridge, the region should be asked to revise their geometrics to place these features outside the limits of the bridge. If such revisions cannot be made, the Hydraulics Branch will provide details to handle drainage with bridge drains on the structure.

Bridge Deck Protection Systems An appropriate Bridge Deck Protection System shall be selected for each bridge in accordance with Section 5.7.4. The Preliminary Plan shall note in the lower left margin the type of Bridge Deck Protective System to be utilized on the bridge.
2.3.9
Construction Clearances Most projects involve construction in and around traffic. Both traffic and construction must be accommodated. Construction clearances and working room must be reviewed at the preliminary plan stage to verify bridge constructability. For construction clearances for roadways, the Region shall supply the necessary traffic staging information with the bridge site data. This includes temporary lane widths and shoulder or shy distances, allowable or necessary alignment shifts, and any special minimum vertical clearances. With this information, the designer can establish the falsework opening or construction opening. The horizontal dimension of the falsework or construction opening shall be measured normal to the alignment of the road which the falsework spans. The horizontal dimension of the falsework or construction opening shall be the sum of the temporary traffic lane widths and shoulder or shy distances, plus two 2′ widths for the temporary concrete barriers, plus additional 2′ shy distances behind the temporary barriers. For multi-span falsework openings, a minimum of 2′, and preferably 4′, shall be used for the interior support width. This interior support shall also have 2′ shy on both sides to the two 2-foot wide temporary concrete barriers that will flank the interior support. The minimum vertical clearance of the construction opening shall normally be 16′-6″ or as specified by the Region. The vertical space available for the falsework must be deep to accommodate the falsework stringers, camber strips, deck, and all deflections. If the necessary depth is greater than the space available, either the minimum vertical clearance for the falsework shall be reduced or the horizontal clearance and span for the falsework shall be reduced, or the profile grade of the structure shall be raised. Any of these alternatives shall be approved by the Region. Once the construction clearances have been determined the designer should meet with the region to review the construction clearances to ensure compatibility with the construction staging. This review should take place prior to finalizing the preliminary bridge plan. For railroads, see Section 2.3.2H.
2.3.10
Design Guides for Falsework Depth Requirements Where falsework is required to support construction of cast-in-place superstructure or segmental elements, the designer of the Preliminary Plan shall confirm with the Region the minimum construction opening. See Section 2.3.9 The bridge designer shall consult with the Construction Support Engineer on falsework depth requirements outlined below. Bridge designers shall evaluate falsework depth requirements based on the following guidelines:

Preliminary Design
2.3.10.A
Falsework Spans < 36′ and No Skews
No evaluation is necessary. Provide for a minimum vertical clearance and a minimum falsework depth of 4′ to accommodate: W36X___ steel beam sections ¾″ camber strip ⅝″plywood 4 x 4 joists 6″ depth for segmental falsework release 2.3.10.B
Falsework Spans > 36′ or Spans with Skews or Limited Falsework Depth
While the falsework or construction openings are measured normal to the alignment which the falsework spans, the falsework span is measured parallel to the bridge alignment. The Preliminary Plan designer shall perform preliminary design of the falsework sufficiently to determine its geometric and structural feasibility. Shallow, heavy, closespaced wide-flange steel beams may be required to meet the span requirements within the available depth. The preliminary design shall be based on design guides in the Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(17). Beams shall be designed parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bridge. The falsework span deflection shall be limited according to the Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(17)B: generally span/360 for a single concrete placement, such as a slab, and span/500 for successive concrete placement forming a composite structure. This limits the stresses in the new structure from the construction and concrete placement sequences. Beam sizes shall be shown in the final plans (and in the Preliminary Plans as required) with the Contractor having the option of submitting an alternate design. The designer shall verify availability of the beam sizes shown in the plans. 2.3.10.C
Bridge Widening
For bridge widening where the available depth for the falsework is fixed, designers shall design falsework using shallower and heavier steel beams to fit within the available depth. Beam sizes and details shall be shown in the final plans (and in the Preliminary Plans as required) with the Contractor having the option of using an alternate design. The designer shall verify availability of the beam sizes shown in the plans. In some cases it may be appropriate to consider a shallower superstructure widening, but with similar stiffness, in order to accommodate the falsework and vertical clearance. 2.3.10.D
Bridge with Skews
Falsework beams shall be laid out and designed for spans parallel to the bridge centerline or perpendicular to the main axis of bending. The centerline of falsework beams shall be located within 2′ of the bridge girder stems and preferably directly under the stems or webs in accordance with the Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(17)E. Falsework beams placed normal to the skew or splayed complicate camber calculations and shall be avoided.

Inspection and Maintenance Access 2.3.11.A
General
FHWA mandates that bridges be inspected every 24 months. The BPO inspectors are required to access bridge components to within 3′ for visual inspection and to access bearings close enough to measure movement. Maintenance personnel need to access damaged members and locations that may collect debris. This is accomplished by using many methods. Safety cables, ladders, bucket trucks, Under Bridge Inspection Truck (UBIT), (see Figure 2.3.11-1), and under bridge travelers are just a few of the most common methods. Preliminary Plan designers need to be aware of these requirements and prepare designs that allow access for bridge inspectors and maintenance personnel throughout the Preliminary Plan and TS&L planning phases.

2.3.11.B
Safety Cables
Safety cables strung on steel plate girders or trusses allow for walking access. Care must be given to the application and location. Built-up plate girder bridges are detailed with a safety cable for inspectors walking the bottom flange. However, when the girders become more than 8′ deep, the inspection of the top flange and top lateral connections becomes difficult to access. It is not feasible for the inspectors to stand on the bottom flanges when the girders are less than 5′ deep. On large trusses, large gusset plates (3′ or more wide) are difficult to circumvent. Tie-off cables are best located on the interior side of the exterior girder of the bridge except at large gusset plates. At these locations, cables or lanyard anchors should be placed on the inside face of the truss so inspectors can utilize bottom lateral gusset plates to stand on while traversing around the main truss gusset plates. 2.3.11.C
Travelers
Under bridge travelers, placed on rails that remain permanently on the bridge, can be considered on large steel structures. This is an expensive option, but it should be evaluated for large bridges with high average daily traffic (ADT) because access to the bridge would be limited by traffic windows that specify when a lane can be closed. Some bridges are restricted to weekend UBIT inspection for this reason. 2.3.11.D
Abutment Slopes
Slopes in front of abutments shall provide enough overhead clearance to the bottom of the superstructure to access bearings for inspection and possible replacement (usually 3′ minimum). 2.3.11.E
Inspection Lighting and Access

Reinforced Concrete Box and Post-Tensioned Concrete Box Girders

• Inside clear height shall be 5 feet or greater to provide reasonable inspection access.
• Refer to Section 6.4.9 for design criteria.

Selection of Structure Type
2.4.1
Bridge Types The required superstructure depth is determined during the preliminary plan development process. The AASHTO LRFD Section 2.5.2.6.3 shows traditional minimum depths for constant depth superstructures. WSDOT has developed superstructure depth-to-span ratios based on past experience. The AASHTO LRFD Section 2.5.2.6.1, states that it is optional to check deflection criteria, except in a few specific cases. The WSDOT criteria is to check the live load deflection for all structures as specified in AASHTO LRFD Section 3.6.1.3.2 and 2.5.2.6.2. The superstructure depth is used to establish the vertical clearance that is available below the superstructure. For preliminary plans, the designer should use the more conservative depth determined from either the AASHTO LRFD criteria or the WSDOT criteria outlined below. In either case, the minimum depth includes the deck thickness. For both simple and continuous spans, the span length is the horizontal distance between centerlines of bearings. Refer to Section 2.3.11 for inspection and maintenance access requirements. Superstructure depth may be influenced when inspection lighting and access is required for certain bridge types. The superstructure depth may be refined during the final design phase. It is assumed that any refinement will result in a reduced superstructure depth so the vertical clearance is not reduced from that shown in the preliminary plan. However, when profile grade limitations restrict superstructure depth, the preliminary plan designer shall investigate and/or work with the structural designer to determine a superstructure type and depth that will fit the requirements. 2.4.1.A
Reinforced Concrete Slab
2.4.1.A.1
Application
Used for simple and continuous spans up to 60′. 2.4.1.A.2
Characteristics
Design details and falsework relatively simple. Shortest construction time for any cast-inplace structure. Correction for anticipated falsework settlement must be included in the dead load camber curve because of the single concrete placement sequence. 2.4.1.A.3 1.

Reinforced Concrete Tee-Beam
WSDOT restricts the use of cast-in-place reinforced concrete Tee-Beam girder for bridge superstructure. This type of superstructure may only be used for bridges with tight curvatures or irregular geometry upon Bridge Design Engineer approval. 2.4.1.B.1
Application
This type of Super Structure is not recommended for new bridges. It could only be used for bridge widening and bridges with tight curvature or unusual geometry. Used for continuous spans 30′ to 60′. Has been used for longer spans with inclined leg piers. 2.4.1.B.2

Application
This type of super structure is not recommended for new bridges. It could only be used for bridge widening and bridges with tight curvature or unusual geometry. Used for continuous spans 50′ to 120′. Maximum simple span 100′ to limit excessive dead load deflections. 2.4.1.C.2
Characteristics
Forming and falsework is somewhat complicated. Construction time is approximately the same as for a tee-beam. High torsional resistance makes it desirable for curved alignments. 2.4.1.C.3 1.

Prestressed Concrete Girder Sections
2.4.1.E.1
Application
Local precast fabricators have several standard forms available for precast concrete sections based on the WSDOT standard girder series. These are versatile enough to cover a wide variety of span lengths. WSDOT standard girders are: 1.
WF100G, WF95G, WF83G, WF74G, WF58G, WF50G, WF42G, WF36G, W74G, W58G, W50G, and W42G precast, prestressed concrete I-girders requiring a cast-inplace reinforced concrete bridge deck used for spans less than 200-feet. The number (eg. 95) specifies the girder depth in inches. WF95PTG, WF83PTG and WF74PTG post-tensioned, precast segmental I-girders with cast-in-place reinforced concrete bridge deck use for simple span up to 230feet, and continuous span up to 250-feet with continuous post-tensioning over the intermediate piers.

2.4.1.E.2
Characteristics
Superstructure design is quick for pre-tensioned girders with proven user-friendly software (PGSuper, PGSplice, and QConBridge) Construction details and forming are fairly simple. Construction time is less than for a cast-in-place bridge. Little or no falsework is required. Falsework over traffic is usually not required; construction time over existing traffic is reduced. Precast girders usually require that the bridge roadway superelevation transitions begin and end at or near piers; location of piers should consider this. The Region may be requested to adjust these transition points if possible. Fully reinforced, composite 8 inch cast-in-place deck slabs continuous over interior piers or reinforced 5 inch cast-in-place deck slabs continuous over interior piers have been used with e. and f.

For railway over highway grade separations, most railroad companies prefer simple span steel construction. This is to simplify repair and reconstruction in the event of derailment or some other damage to the structure. 2.4.1.J.2
Characteristics
The heavier loads of the railroad live load require deeper and stiffer members than for highway bridges. Through girders can be used to reduce overall structure depth if the railroad concurs. Piers should be normal to the railroad to eliminate skew loading effects.

2.4.2
Wall Types Retaining walls, wingwalls, curtain walls, sound barrier walls, and tall closed abutment walls may be used where required to shorten spans or superstructure length or to reduce the width of approach fills. The process of selecting a type of retaining wall should economically satisfy structural, functional, and aesthetic requirements and other considerations relevant to a specific site. A detailed listing of the common wall types and their characteristics can be found in Section 8.3.
2.4.3
Buried Structure Types Buried structures may be used where required in accordance with specific site conditions. The process of selecting a type of buried structure should economically satisfy structural, functional, and aesthetic requirements and other considerations relevant to a specific site. Detailed discussion of the common types of buried structures, their characteristics and appropriate applications is found in Section 8.3. Refer to Section 2.3.3 for Freeboard and Maintenance access requirements.

Aesthetic Considerations
2.5.1
General Visual Impact Bridge, retaining walls and noise walls have a strong visual impact in any landscape. Steps must be taken to assure that even the most basic structure will complement rather than detract from its surroundings. The EIS and bridge site data submitted by the Region should each contain a discussion on the aesthetic importance of the project site. This commentary, together with submitted video and photographs, will help the designer determine the appropriate structure type. The State Bridge and Structures Architect should be contacted early in the preliminary bridge plan process for input on aesthetics. Normally, a visit to the bridge site with the State Bridge and Structures Architect and Region design personnel should be made. Aesthetics is a very subjective element that must be factored into the design process in the otherwise very quantitative field of structural engineering. Bridges that are structurally efficient using the least material possible are generally visually well proportioned. However, the details such as pier walls, columns, and crossbeams require special attention to ensure a structure that will enhance the general vicinity. For large projects incorporating several to many bridges and retaining walls, an architectural theme is frequently developed to bring consistency in structure type, details, and architectural appointments. The preliminary plan designer shall work with the State Bridge and Structures Architect to implement the theme.
2.5.2
End Piers 2.5.2.A
Wingwalls
The size and exposure of the wingwall at the end pier should balance, visually, with the depth and type of superstructure used. For example, a prestressed girder structure fits best visually with a 15′ wingwall (or curtain wall/retaining wall). However, there are instances where a 20′ wingwall (or curtain wall/retaining wall) may be used with a prestressed girder (maximizing a span in a remote area, for example or with deep girders where they are proportionally better in appearance). The use of a 20′ wingwall shall be approved by the Bridge Design Engineer and the State Bridge and Structures Architect. It is less expensive for bridges of greater than 40′ of overall width to be designed with wingwalls (or curtain wall/retaining wall) than to use a longer superstructure. 2.5.2.B
Retaining Walls
For structures at sites where profile, right of way, and alignment dictate the use of high exposed wall-type abutments for the end piers, retaining walls that flank the approach roadway can be used to retain the roadway fill and reduce the overall structure length. Stepped walls are often used to break up the height, and allow for landscape planting. A curtain wall runs between the bridge abutment and the heel of the abutment footing. In this way, the joint in the retaining wall stem can coincide with the joint between the abutment footing and the retaining wall footing. This simplifies design and provides a convenient breaking point between design responsibilities if the retaining walls happen to be the responsibility of the Region. The length shown for the curtain wall dimension is an estimated dimension based on experience and preliminary foundation assumptions. It can be revised under design to satisfy the intent of having the wall joint coincide with the end of the abutment footing. Page 2-40

2.5.2.C
Chapter 2
Slope Protection
The Region is responsible for making initial recommendations regarding slope protection. It should be compatible with the site and should match what has been used at other bridges in the vicinity. The type selected shall be shown on the Preliminary Plan. It shall be noted on the “Not Included in Bridge Quantities” list. 2.5.2.D
Noise Walls
Approval of the State Bridge and Structures Architect is required for the final selection of noise wall appearance, finish, materials and configuration.
2.5.3
Intermediate Piers The size, shape, and spacing of the intermediate pier elements must satisfy two criteria. They must be correctly sized and detailed to efficiently handle the structural loads required by the design and shaped to enhance the aesthetics of the structure. The primary view of the pier must be considered. For structures that cross over another roadway, the primary view will be a section normal to the roadway. This may not always be the same view as shown on the Preliminary Plan as with a skewed structure, for example. This primary view should be the focus of the aesthetic review. Tapers and flares on columns should be kept simple and structurally functional. Fabrication and constructability of the formwork of the pier must be kept in mind. Crossbeam ends should be carefully reviewed. Skewed bridges and bridges with steep profile grades or those in sharp vertical curves will require special attention to detail. Column spacing should not be so small as to create a cluttered look. Column spacing should be proportioned to maintain a reasonable crossbeam span balance.
2.5.4
Barrier and Wall Surface Treatments 2.5.4.A
Plain Surface Finish
This finish will normally be used on structures that do not have a high degree of visibility or where existing conditions warrant. A bridge in a remote area or a bridge among several existing bridges all having a plain finish would be examples. 2.5.4.B
Formliner Finishes
These finishes are the most common and an easy way to add a decorative texture to a structure. Variations on this type of finish can be used for special cases. The specific areas to receive this finish should be reviewed with the State Bridge and Structures Architect. 2.5.4.C
Pigmented Sealer
The use of a pigmented sealer is used to control graffiti and can also be an aesthetic enhancement. Most commonly it is always used in urban areas. The selection should be reviewed with the State Bridge and Structures Architect and the Region.

Architectural Details
Rustication grooves, relief panels, pilasters, and decorative finishes may visually improve appearance at transitions between different structure types such as cast-in-place abutments to structural earth retaining walls. Contact the State Bridge and Structures Architect for guidance. In special circumstances custom designs may be provided. Designs rising to the level of art shall be subject to the procedures outlined in the Design Manual M 22-01
2.5.5
Superstructure The horizontal elements of the bridge are perhaps the strongest features. The sizing of the structure depth based on the span/depth ratios in Section 2.4.1, will generally produce a balanced relationship. Designs rising to the level of "Art" shall be subject to the procedures outlined in the Design Manual M 22-01. Haunches or rounding of girders at the piers can enhance the structure’s appearance. The use of such features should be kept within reason considering fabrication of materials and construction of formwork. The amount of haunch should be carefully reviewed for overall balance from the primary viewing perspective. Haunches are not limited to cast-inplace superstructures, but may be used in special cases on precast, prestressed I girders. They require job-specific forms which increase cost, and standard design software is not directly applicable. The slab overhang dimension should approach that used for the structure depth. This dimension should be balanced between what looks good for aesthetics and what is possible with a reasonable slab thickness and reinforcement. For box girders, the exterior webs can be sloped, but vertical webs are preferred. The amount of slope should not exceed l½: l for structural reasons, and should be limited to 4:1 if sloped webs are desired. Sloped webs should only be used in locations of high aesthetic impact. When using precast, prestressed girders, all spans shall be the same series, unless approved otherwise by the Bridge Design Engineer.

Structure Costs
Chapter 2
See Section 12.3 for preparing cost estimates for preliminary bridge design.
2.6.2
Handling and Shipping Precast Members and Steel Beams Bridges utilizing precast concrete beams or steel beams need to have their access routes checked and sites reviewed to be certain that the beams can be transported to the site. It must also be determined that they can be erected once they reach the site. Both the size and the weight of the beams must be checked. Likely routes to the site must be adequate to handle the truck and trailer hauling the beams. Avoid narrow roads with sharp turns, steep grades, and/or load-rated bridges, which may prevent the beams from reaching the site. The Bridge Preservation Office should be consulted for limitations on hauling lengths and weights. Generally, 252 kips is the maximum weight of a girder that may be hauled by truck. The site should be reviewed for adequate space for the contractor to set up the cranes and equipment necessary to pick up and place the girders. The reach and boom angle should be checked and should accommodate standard cranes.
2.6.3
Salvage of Materials When a bridge is being replaced or widened, the material being removed should be reviewed for anything that WSDOT may want to salvage. Items such as aluminum rail, luminaire poles, sign structures, and steel beams should be identified for possible salvage. The Region should be asked if such items are to be salvaged since they will be responsible for storage and inventory of these items.

WSDOT Standards for Highway Bridges
2.7.1
Design Elements The following are standard design elements for bridges carrying highway traffic. They are meant to provide a generic base for consistent, clean looking bridges, and to reduce design and construction costs. Modification of some elements may be required, depending on site conditions. This should be determined on a case-by-case basis during the preliminary plan stage of the design process. 2.7.1.A
General
Fractured Fin Finish shall be used on the exterior face of the traffic barrier. All other surfaces shall be Plain Surface Finish. Exposed faces of wingwalls, columns, and abutments shall be vertical. The exterior face of the traffic barrier and the end of the intermediate pier crossbeam and diaphragm shall have a 1:12 backslope. 2.7.1.B
Substructure
End piers use the following details: 15-foot wingwalls with prestressed concrete girders up to 74-inches in depth or a combination of curtain wall/retaining walls. Stub abutment wall with vertical face. Footing elevation, pile type (if required), and setback dimension are determined from recommendations in the Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Services Branch Geotechnical Report. Intermediate piers use the following details: “Dropped” Crossbeams – The crossbeam below the girders is designed for the girder and bridge deck dead load, construction loads, live load, and superimposed dead loads. The minimum depth of the crossbeam shall be 3-feet. This crossbeam may be used for simple span continuous prestressed concrete girder bridges and continuous steel girder bridges. “Semi-raised” Crossbeams – The crossbeam below the girders is designed for the girder and slab dead load, and construction loads.

Bridge Security
2.8.1
General Security based bridge design and its direct correlation to modern social issues is addressed in this section. Criminal activity, illegal encampments, graffiti, hindrance to economic development and public eyesore create unwanted expensive. They also pose safety hazard for State Maintenance and Operations practices. The issue exists in urban areas as well as rural and recreational locales. Bridges are dominant structures in landscapes. They are held to a higher standard of design due to their influence on communities, where economic and social settings are affected by their quality. Initial project cost savings may quickly be overshadowed by increased externalized costs. These externalized costs are born by local municipalities and businesses as well as other departments within WSDOT. WSDOT bridge inspectors are required to inspect all bridges at least once every 24 months. The presence of the illegal encampments, as well as garbage, hypodermic needles, and feces often makes it impossible to do a close, hands-on inspection of the abutments and bearings of bridges. The Bridge Preservation Office has requested that maintenance clean up transient camps when it becomes difficult or impossible to do an adequate inspection of the bridges. Campfires set by the homeless have also caused damage to bridges. Bridge Maintenance Crews also face the same difficulty when they need to do repair work on bridges in the urban area. Clean up requires (per law) posting the bridge seventy-two hours prior to any work. Material picked up is tagged, bagged, and stored for retrieval. Often the offenders are back the next day.
2.8.2
Design Design is determined on a case by case basis using two strategies. These strategies are universally accepted best practices. The first, Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED), is a multi-disciplinary approach to deterring criminal behavior. The second, Context Sensitive Solutions (CSS), is also multi-disciplinary and focuses on project development methods. Multi-disciplinary teams consist of engineers and architects but may include law enforcement, local businesses, social service providers, and psychologists. 1.
CPTED principals are based upon the theory that the proper design and effective use of the built environment can reduce crime, reduce the fear of crime, and improve the quality of life. Built environment implementations of CPTED seek to dissuade offenders from committing crimes by manipulating the built environment in which those crimes proceed from or occur. The six main concepts are territoriality, surveillance, access control, image/maintenance, activity support and target hardening. Applying all of these strategies is key when preventing crime in any neighborhood or right-of-way.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 2-47
Chapter 2
Preliminary Design
Natural surveillance and access control strategies limit the opportunity for crime. Territorial reinforcement promotes social control through a variety of measures. These may include enhanced aesthetics or public art. Image/maintenance and activity support provide the community with reassurance and the ability to stop crime by themselves. Target hardening strategies may involve fencing or concrete enclosures or they may include all techniques to resolve crime or chronic trespass into one final step. 2.
2.8.3
WSDOT implements FHWA’s CSS design development principles. The CSS methods require designers to consider the physical, economic, and social setting of a project. Stakeholder’s interests are to be accounted for; including area residents and business owners.
Design Criteria New bridges need to address design for the environment by basic criteria:
• Slopes under bridges need to be steep slope, and hardened with something like solid concrete so that flat areas cannot be carved into the hillside. Flat areas under bridge superstructures attract inappropriate uses and should be omitted.
• Illegal urban campers have been known to build shelters between the concrete girders. Abutment walls need to be high enough that they deny access to the superstructure elements. When it is not feasible to design for deterrence the sites need to be hardened with fencing buried several feet into the soil or with solid concrete walls. See Figures 2.8.3-1 and 2.8.3-2 for high security fence and concrete wall examples.
• Regular chain link is easy cut, therefore stouter material needs to be specified.
• Landscape design should coordinate with region or headquarters landscape architects. Areas need to be visible to law enforcement. Figure 2.8.3-1

Limit States The basic limit state equation given by AASHTO LRFD 1.3.2.1 is as: ΣηiγiQi ≤ φRn = Rr Ση ΣηiiγγiiQ Qii ≤ ≤ φR φRnn = =R Rrr
For loads for which a maximum value of γi is appropriate For For loads loads for for which which a a maximum maximum value value of of 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is is appropriate appropriate
(3.4-1) (3.4-1) (3.4-1)
For loads for which a minimum value of γi is appropriate:
where: ηi γi Qi φ Rn Rr
= load modifier = load factor = force effect = resistance factor = nominal resistance = factored resistance
The modifier, ηi is the product of factors for ductility, redundancy, and importance. For simplicity use a value of 1.0 for ηi except for the design of columns when a minimum value of γi is appropriate. In such a case, use ηi = 0.95. Compression members in seismic designs are proportioned and detailed to ensure the development of significant and visible inelastic deformations at the extreme event limit states before failure. Strength IV load combination shall not be used for foundation design. The load factor for live load in the Service III load combination shall be as specified in Section 3.5. The tsunami load is considered an Extreme Event load with load factor of 1.0 and load combination similar to Extreme Event I.

Chapter 3
Load Factors and Load Combinations The limit states load combinations, and load factors (γi) used for structural design are in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Table 3.4.1-1. For foundation design, loads are factored after distribution through structural analysis or modeling. The design live load factor for the Service III Limit State load combination shall be as follows: γLL = 0.8 when the requirements of Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 are satisfied and stress analysis is based on gross section properties. γLL = 1.0 when the requirements of Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 are satisfied and stress analysis is based on transformed section properties. In special cases that deviate from the requirements of Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 and have been approved by the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer, γLL, shall be as specified in AASHTO LRFD Table 3.4.1-4. The Service III live load factor for load rating shall be as specified in Section 13.1.1. The live load factor for Extreme Event-I Limit State load combination, γEQ as specified in the AASHTO LRFD Table 3.4.1-1 for all WSDOT bridges and walls shall be taken equal to 0.50. The γEQ factor applies to the live load force effect obtained from the bridge live load analysis. Associated mass of live load need not be included in the dynamic analysis. The AASHTO LRFD allows the live load factor in Extreme Event-I load combination, γEQ, to be determined on a project specific basis. The commentary indicates that the possibility of partial live load, i.e., γEQ < 1.0, with earthquakes should be considered. The application of Turkstra’s rule for combining uncorrelated loads indicates that γEQ = 0.50 is reasonable for a wide range of values of average daily truck traffic (ADTT). The NCHRP Report 489 recommends live load factor for Extreme Event-I Limit State, γEQ equal to 0.25 for all bridges. This factor shall be increased to γEQ equal to 0.50 for bridges located in main state routes and congested roads. Since the determination of live load factor, γEQ is based on ADTT or bridges located in congested roads could be confusing and questionable, it is decided that live load factor of γEQ equal to 0.50 to be used for all WSDOT bridges regardless the bridge location or traffic congestion. The live load factor equal to zero shall be used for tsunami load combination. The base construction temperature may be taken as 64°F for the determination of Temperature Load. The load factors γTG and γSE are to be determined on a project specific basis in accordance with AASHTO LRFD 3.4.1 and 3.12. Load Factors for Permanent Loads, γp are provided in AASHTO LRFD Table 3.4.1-2. The load factor for down drag loads shall be as specified in the AASHTO LRFD Table 3.4.1-2. The Geotechnical Report will provide the down drag force (DD). The down drag force is a load applied to the pile/shaft with the load factor specified in the Geotechnical Report. Generally, live loads (LL) are less than the down drag force and should be omitted when considering down drag forces.

Load Factors for Substructure Table 3.5-4 below provides general guidelines for when to use the maximum or minimum shaft/pile/column permanent load factors for axial capacity, uplift, and lateral loading. In general, substructure design should use unfactored loads to obtain force distribution in the structure. Moment, shear and axial force responses are then factored for final structural design. All forces and load factors are as defined previously.

In the table above, “causing moment” and “causing shear” are taken to be the moment and shear causing axial, uplift, and lateral loading respectively. “Resisting” is taking to mean those force effects that are diminishing axial capacity, uplift, and lateral loading.

Strength IV investigations shall use the appropriate factors from AASHTO LRFD Tables 3.4.1-1 and 3.4.1-2. Where evaluation of construction deflections is required by the contract documents, Load Combination Service I shall apply. Construction dead loads shall be considered as part of the permanent load and construction transient loads considered part of the live load. The associated permitted deflections shall be included in the contract documents. For falsework and formwork design loads, see Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(17)A.

Load Factors for Post-tensioning
3.7.1
Post-tensioning Effects from Superstructure When cast-in-place, post-tensioned superstructure is constructed monolithic with the piers, the substructure design should consider frame moments and shears caused by elastic shortening and creep of the superstructure upon application of the axial posttensioning force at the bridge ends. Frame moments and shears thus obtained should be added algebraically to the values obtained from the primary and secondary moment diagrams applied to the superstructure. When cast-in-place or precast, post-tensioned superstructure are supported on sliding bearings at some of the piers, the design of those piers should include the longitudinal force from friction on the bearings generated as the superstructure shortens during jacking. When post-tensioning is complete, the full permanent reaction from this effect should be included in the governing AASHTO load combinations for the pier under design.
3.7.2
Secondary Forces from Post-tensioning, PS The application of post-tensioning forces on a continuous structure produces reactions at the structure’s support and internal forces that are collectively called secondary forces. Secondary prestressing forces (i.e. secondary moments) are the force effects in continuous members, as a result of continuous post-tensioning. In frame analysis software, the secondary moments are generally obtained by subtracting the primary moment (P*e) from the total PS moment obtained by applying an equivalent static load which represents the forces due to post-tensioning. A load factor, γPS, of 1.0 is appropriate for the superstructure. For fixed columns a 50 percent reduction in PS force effects could be used given the elasto-plastic characteristics of the soil surrounding the foundation elements.

3.8.1
Deck Overlay Requirement Vehicular traffic will generate wear and rutting on a concrete bridge deck over the life of a bridge. One option to correct excessive wear is to add a Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) overlay on top of the existing concrete deck. This type of overlay requires less construction time and is less expensive compared to removing a portion of the deck and adding a modified concrete overlay. The initial bridge design needs to incorporate the future overlay dead load. All new bridge designs with a concrete driving surface, excluding modified concrete overlays, shall be designed for a 35 psf future wearing surface load. The future wearing surface load does not apply to girder deflection, “A” dimension, creep, or profile grade calculations. Concrete bridge deck protection systems shall be in accordance with Section 5.7.4 for new bridge construction and widening projects.
3.8.2
Distribution of Permanent Loads The dead load of one traffic barrier is divided uniformly among the three nearest girders. When there are six or fewer girders, traffic barrier loads are equally distributed to all girders. Sidewalk loads are distributed by the same method as traffic barrier loads. However, if a wide sidewalk is directly supported by more than three girders, the sidewalk load shall be distributed equally to all supporting girders.

Design Live Load Live load design criteria are specified in the lower right corner of the bridge preliminary plan sheet. The Bridge Preliminary Plan Engineer determines the criteria using the following guideline:
• New bridges and bridge widening with addition of substructure – HL-93
• Bridge superstructure widening with no addition of substructure – Live load criteria of the original design
• Temporary widening of existing bridges: Live load criteria of the existing bridge
• Detour and other temporary bridges, except as required by Section 10.13.2 – 75 percent of HL-93 The application of design vehicular live loads shall be as specified in AASHTO LRFD 3.6.1.3. The design tandem, or “low boy”, defined in AASHTO LRFD C3.6.1.3.1 shall be included in the design vehicular live load. The effect of one design tandem combined with the effect of the design lane load specified in AASTHO LRFD 3.6.1.2.4 and, for negative moment between the points of contraflexure under a uniform load on all spans and reactions at interior supports, shall be investigated a dual design tandem spaced from 26.0 feet to 40.0 feet apart, measured between the trailing axle of the lead vehicle and the lead axle of the trailing vehicle, combined with the design lane load. For the purpose of this article, the pairs of the design tandem shall be placed in adjacent spans in such position to produce maximum force effect. Axles of the design tandem that do not contribute to the extreme force effect under consideration shall be neglected.
3.9.2
Loading for Live Load Deflection Evaluation The loading for live load deflection criteria is defined in AASHTO LRFD 3.6.1.3.2. Live load deflections for the Service I limit state shall satisfy the requirements of AASHTO LRFD 2.5.2.6.2.

Multi Girder Superstructure
The live load distribution factor for exterior girder of multi girder bridges designated in AASHTO LRFD Table 4.6.2.2.1-1 as type a, b, c, e, k and also i, j if sufficiently connected to act as a unit, shall be as follows:
• For exterior girder design with slab cantilever length equal or less than 40 percent of the adjacent interior girder spacing, use the live load distribution factor for interior girder. The slab cantilever length is defined as the distance from the centerline of the exterior girder to the edge of the slab.
• For exterior girder design with slab cantilever length exceeding 40 percent of the adjacent interior girder spacing, use the lever rule with the multiple presence factor of 1.0 for single lane to determine the live load distribution. The live load used to design the exterior girder shall not be less than the live load used for the adjacent interior girder.

The live load distribution factor for interior girders shall then be multiplied by the number of webs to obtain the design live load for the entire superstructure. The live load distribution need not exceed the total number of design lanes. The correction factor for live load distribution for skewed support as specified in AASHTO LRFD Table 4.6.2.2.2e-1 for bending moment and AASTHO LRFD Table 4.6.2.2.3c-1 for shear shall apply.

Distribution to Substructure
The number of traffic lanes to be used in the substructure design shall be determined by dividing the entire roadway slab width by 12. No fractional lanes shall be used. Roadway slab widths of less than 24 feet shall have a maximum of two design lanes. 3.9.3.E
Distribution to Crossbeam
The design and load rating live loading are distributed to the substructure by placing wheel line reactions in lane configurations that generate the maximum force effects in the substructure. A wheel line reaction is one-half of the reaction of a single lane of live load. For integral and hinged continuity diaphragms, live loads are considered to act directly on the substructure without further distribution through the superstructure as illustrated in Figure 3.9‑1. For girder configurations where there is a clear load path through the girders to the cross beam, such as at expansion piers with girders supported on individual bearings, live load reactions are applied through the bearings. Normally, substructure design will not consider live load torsion or lateral distribution. Sidesway effects shall be considered.

WHEEL LINE LOADS APPLIED TO SUBSTRUCTURE CROSSBEAM
For steel and prestressed concrete superstructure where the live load is transferred to substructure through bearings, cross frames or diaphragms, the girder reaction may be used for substructure design. Live load placement is dependent on the member under design. Some examples of live load placement are as follows: the exterior vehicle wheel is placed 2 feet from the curb for maximum crossbeam cantilever moment or maximum eccentric foundation moment. For crossbeam design between supports, the lanes are placed to obtain the maximum positive moment in the member; then re-located to obtain the maximum shear or negative moment in the member. For column design, the design lanes are placed to obtain the maximum transverse moment at the top of the column; then re-located to obtain the maximum axial force of the column.

Vertical wind pressure, per AASHTO LRFD 3.8.2, shall be included in the design where appropriate, for example, on single column piers. Wind loads shall be applied through shear keys or other positive means from the superstructure to the substructure. Wind loads shall be distributed to the piers and abutments in accordance with the laws of statics. Transverse wind loads can be applied directly to the piers assuming the superstructure to act as a rigid beam.

For substructure in the strength limit state, the value of 0.50 for γPS, γCR, γSH, and γTU may be used when calculating force effects in non-segmental structures, but shall be taken in conjunction with the gross moment of inertia in the columns or piers. The larger of the values provided for load factor of TU shall be used for deformations and the smaller values for all other effects. The calculation of displacements for TU loads utilizes a factor greater than 1.0 to avoid under sizing joints, expansion devices, and bearings. The current AASHTO LRFD requires a load factor of 1.2 on CR, SH, and TU deformations, and 0.5 on other CR/SH/TU force effects. The lower value had been rationalized as dissipation of these force effects over time, particularly in the columns and piers. Changing the load factors for creep and shrinkage is not straight-forward because CR, SH are “superimposed deformations”, that is, force effects due to a change in material behavior that cause a change in the statical system. For safety and simplicity in design, they are treated as loads--despite not being measurable at time t = 0. However, behavior is nonlinear and application of the load factor must also be considered. Some software will run service load analysis twice: once with and once without CR, SH effects. The CR and SH can then be isolated by subtracting the results of the two runs. Other software will couple the CR and SH with the dead load, giving a shrinkage- or creep-adjusted dead load. The proposed compromise is to assign creep and shrinkage the same load factor as the DC loads but permit a factor of 1.0 if the project-specific creep coefficient can be determined and is then used in the linear analysis software. Thermal and shrinkage loadings are induced by movements of the structure and can result from several sources. Movements due to temperature changes are calculated using coefficients of thermal expansion of 0.000006 feet/foot per degree for concrete and 0.0000065 feet/foot per degree for steel. Reinforced concrete shrinks at the rate of 0.0002 feet/foot.

Bridges Subjected to Tsunami Effects The AASHTO Guide Specifications for Bridges Subject to Tsunami Effects are intended for the design and construction of conventional bridges to resist the effects of tsunami waves. The conventional bridges are taken as those that:
• Have slab, beam, or box girder superstructures
• Are supported by pier and abutment substructures
• Are founded on shallow or deep foundations
• Have minimal changes in elevation along the bridge length
• Are straight in plan view (including skewed but not curved) The tsunami design requirements for non-conventional bridges shall be considered on a case-by-case basis and consultation with the Bridge and Structures Office. Determination of whether the tsunami hazard applies shall be made at the bridge preliminary plan or conceptual plan stage using the above-mentioned tools and shall be noted in the Job File. Bridge preliminary plan or conceptual plan shall specify the most probably bridge soffit elevation and superstructure depth, and substructure/foundation type for tsunami hazard determination. Where possible, all new bridges shall be designed so that the tsunami wave does not contact the superstructure. If this is not possible the bridge shall be designed to ensure that the bridge can resist the tsunami hazard loading as specified in the AASHTO Guide Specifications for Bridges Subject to Tsunami Effects.

Chapter 3
A bridge superstructure shall be considered for the tsunami hazard if the inundation at Mean High Water (MHW) is high enough to contact the bridge superstructure soffit based on the modeled inundation depth. Substructure design should consider loading applied through the superstructure and loads applied directly to the substructure. Both scour and geotechnical hazards due to tsunami inundation shall be investigated during final design. The critical tsunami parameters including wave direction, velocity and depth, can be obtained from the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR), at: Tsunami Hazard Maps - WA or Tsunami Inundation Database Interactive Web Portal at: Tsunami Inundation Database Portal — The B. John Garrick Institute for the Risk Sciences (ucla.edu). The performance requirement for bridges subjected to tsunami effects is life safety no-collapse as defined in Chapter 4 for seismic performance requirement. Higher performance for post-tsunami serviceability may be considered on a case-by-case basis for recovery bridges as defined in Chapter 4. Simultaneous consideration of tsunami and seismic, or tsunami and scour are not recommended tsunami design of conventional bridges. The provisions outlined in Section 7 of the AASHTO Guide Specifications for Bridges Subject to Tsunami Effects for reduction of tsunami loading, accommodation of forces, geometric proportioning, venting, and sacrificial elements could be used with the approval of the Bridge Design Engineer regardless of the contracting method.

Seismic Design and Retrofit
General Seismic design of new bridges and bridge widenings shall conform to AASHTO Guide Specifications for LRFD Seismic Bridge Design (SEISMIC) as modified by Sections 4.2 and 4.3. The bridge seismic terminology of Ordinary for Normal bridges, and Recovery for Essential bridges, has been adopted in this edition of Bridge Design Manual in anticipation of AASHTO changing the bridge seismic terminology. Analysis and design of seismic retrofits for existing bridges shall be completed in accordance with Section 4.4. Seismic design of retaining walls shall be in accordance with Section 4.5. For nonconventional bridges, bridges that are deemed critical or Recovery, or bridges that fall outside the scope of the Guide Specifications for any other reasons, project specific design requirements shall be developed and submitted to the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer for approval. The importance classifications for all highway bridges in Washington State are classified as “Ordinary” except for special major bridges. Special major bridges fitting the classifications of either “Critical” or “Recovery” will be so designated by either the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Engineer or the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer. Bridges are considered as Critical, Recovery, or Ordinary for their operational classification as described below. Two-level performance criteria are required for design of Recovery and Critical bridges. Recovery and Critical bridges shall be designated by WSDOT Regions or Local Agencies, in consultation with WSDOT State Bridge and Structures Engineer and State Bridge Design Engineer.
• Critical Bridges Critical bridges are expected to provide immediate access to emergency and similar life-safety facilities after an earthquake. The Critical designation is typically reserved for high-cost projects where WSDOT intends to protect the investment or for projects that would be especially costly to repair if they were damaged during an earthquake.
• Recovery Bridges Recovery bridges serve as vital links for rebuilding damaged areas and provide access to the public shortly after an earthquake.
• Ordinary Bridges All bridges not designated as either Critical or Recovery shall be designated as Ordinary.

4.1.2
Expected Post-earthquake Service Levels
• No Service – Bridge is closed for repair or replacement.
• Limited Service – Bridge is open for emergency vehicle traffic: A reduced number of lanes for Ordinary traffic is available within three months of the earthquake; Vehicle weight restriction may be imposed until repairs are completed. It is expected that within three months (Recovery Bridges) or within three days (Critical Bridges) of the earthquake, repair works on a damaged bridge would have reached the stage that would permit Ordinary traffic on at least some portion of the bridge.
• Full Service – Full access to Ordinary traffic is available almost immediately after the earthquake. The expected post-earthquake damage states and service levels of Critical bridges are included in Table 4.1-2 to provide an indication of their expected performance relative to Ordinary bridge categories.

Expected Post-earthquake Damage States
• Significant – “imminent failure,” i.e., onset of compressive failure of core concrete. Bridge replacement is likely. All plastic hinges within the structure have formed with ductility demand values approaching the limits specified in Table 4.1-2.
• Moderate – “extensive cracks and spalling, and visible lateral and/or longitudinal reinforcing bars”. Bridge repair is likely but bridge replacement is unlikely
• Minimal – “flexural cracks and minor spalling and possible shear cracks”. Essentially elastic performance
• None – No damage The Design Spectrum for Safety Evaluation Earthquake (SEE) shall be taken as a spectrum based on a 7% probability of exceedance in 75 years (or 975-year return period). BDM Section 4.2.3 provides the ground motion software tool SPECTRA to develop spectral response parameters. The Design Spectrum for Functional Evaluation Earthquake (FEE) shall be taken as a spectrum based on a 30% probability of exceedance in 75 years (or 210-year return period). The Geotechnical Engineer shall provide final design spectrum recommendations. The FEE may be obtained using the USGS Interactive website (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/interactive). Ordinary and Recovery bridges subjected to the seismic hazard levels specified in Table 1 shall satisfy the displacement criteria specified in LRFD-SGS as applicable and the maximum displacement ductility demand, μD values as specified in Table 4.1-2.

4.2.1
Definitions Guide Specifications Article 2.1 – Add the following definitions:
• Oversized Pile Shaft – A drilled shaft foundation that is larger in diameter than the supported column and has a reinforcing cage larger than and independent of the columns. The size of the shaft shall be in accordance with Section 7.8.2.
• Owner – Person or agency having jurisdiction over the bridge. For WSDOT projects, regardless of delivery method, the term “Owner” in these Guide Specifications shall be the WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer or/and the WSDOT State Geotechnical Engineer.
4.2.2
Earthquake Resisting Systems (ERS) Requirements for Seismic Design Categories (SDCs) C and D Guide Specifications Article 3.3 – WSDOT Global Seismic Design Strategies:
• Type 1 – Ductile Substructure with Essentially Elastic Superstructure. This category is permissible.
• Type 2 – Essentially Elastic Substructure with a Ductile Superstructure. This category is not permissible.
• Type 3 – Elastic Superstructure and Substructure with a Fusing Mechanism between the two. This category is permissible with WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer’s approval. With the approval of the State Bridge Design Engineer, for Type 1 ERS for SDC C or D, if columns or pier walls are considered an integral part of the energy dissipating system but remain elastic at the demand displacement, the forces to use for capacity design of other components are to be a minimum of 1.2 times the elastic forces resulting from the demand displacement in lieu of the forces obtained from overstrength plastic hinging analysis. Because maximum limiting inertial forces provided by yielding elements acting at a plastic mechanism level is not effective in the case of elastic design, the following constraints are imposed. These may be relaxed on a case by case basis with the approval of the State Bridge Design Engineer.
Page 4-4
1.
Unless an analysis that considers redistribution of internal structure forces due to inelastic action is performed, all substructure units of the frame under consideration and of any adjacent frames that may transfer inertial forces to the frame in question must remain elastic at the design ground motion demand.
2.
Effective member section properties must be consistent with the force levels expected within the bridge system. Reinforced concrete columns and pier walls should be analyzed using cracked section properties. For this purpose, in absence of better information or estimated by Figure 5.6.2-1, a moment of inertia equal to one half that of the un-cracked section shall be used.

Chapter 4
3.
Foundation modeling must be established such that uncertainties in modeling will not cause the internal forces of any elements under consideration to increase by more than 10 percent.
4.
When site specific ground response analysis is performed, the response spectrum ordinates must be selected such that uncertainties will not cause the internal forces of any elements under consideration to increase by more than 10 percent.
5.
Thermal, shrinkage, prestress or other forces that may be present in the structure at the time of an earthquake must be considered to act in a sense that is least favorable to the seismic load combination under investigation.
6.
P-Delta effects must be assessed using the resistance of the frame in question at the deflection caused by the design ground motion.
7.
Joint shear effects must be assessed with a minimum of the calculated elastic internal forces applied to the joint.
8.
Detailing as normally required in either SDC C or D, as appropriate, must be provided.
It is permitted to use expected material strengths for the determination of member strengths except shear for elastic response of members. The use of elastic design in lieu of overstrength plastic hinging forces for capacity protection described above shall only be considered if designer demonstrates that capacity design of Article 4.11 of the AASHTO Guide Specifications for LRFD Bridge Seismic Design is not feasible due to geotechnical or structural reasons. If the columns or pier walls remain elastic at the demand displacement, shear design of columns or pier walls shall be based on 1.2 times elastic shear force resulting from the demand displacement and normal material strength shall be used for capacities. The minimum detailing according to the bridge seismic design category shall be provided. Type 3 ERS may be considered only if Type 1 strategy is not suitable and Type 3 strategy has been deemed necessary for accommodating seismic loads. Use of isolation bearings needs the approval of WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer. Isolation bearings shall be designed per the requirement specified in Section 9.3 Limitations on the use of ERS and ERE are shown in Figures 3.3-1a, 3.3-1b, 3.3-2, and 3.3-3.
• Figure 3.3-1b Type 6, connection with moment reducing detail should only be used at column base if proved necessary for foundation design. Fixed connection at base of column remains the preferred option for WSDOT bridges.
• The design criteria for column base with moment reducing detail shall consider all applicable loads at service, strength, and extreme event limit states.
• Figure 3.3-2 Types 6 and 8 are not permissible for non-liquefied configuration and permissible with WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer’s approval for liquefied configuration. For ERSs and EREs requiring approval, the WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer’s approval is required regardless of contracting method (i.e., approval authority is not transferred to other entities).

Damage to backwalls and wingwalls during earthquakes may be considered acceptable when considering no collapse criteria, provided that unseating or other damage to the superstructure does not occur. Abutment participation in the overall dynamic response of the bridge system shall reflect the

structural configuration, the load transfer mechanism from the bridge to the abutment system, the effective stiffness and force capacity of the wall-soil system, and the level of acceptable abutment damage. The capacity of the abutments to resist the bridge inertial loads shall be compatible with the soil resistance that can be reliably mobilized, the structural design of the abutment wall, and whether the wall is permitted to be damaged by the design earthquake. The lateral load capacity of walls shall be evaluated on the basis of a rational passive earth-pressure theory. The participation of the bridge approach slab in the overall dynamic response of bridge systems to earthquake loading and in providing resistance to seismically induced inertial loads may be considered permissible upon approval from both the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer and the WSDOT Geotechnical Engineer. The participation of the abutment in the ERS should be carefully evaluated with the Geotechnical Engineer and the Owner when the presence of the abutment backfill may be uncertain, as in the case of slumping or settlement due to liquefaction below or near the abutment. 4.2.11.2 - Longitudinal Direction Under earthquake loading, the earth pressure action on abutment walls changes from a static condition to one of two possible conditions:
• The dynamic active pressure condition as the wall moves away from the backfill, or
• The passive pressure condition as the inertial load of the bridge pushes the wall into the backfill. The governing earth pressure condition depends on the magnitude of seismically induced movement of the abutment walls, the bridge superstructure, and the bridge/abutment configuration. For semi-integral (Figure 4.2.11-1a), L-shape abutment with backwall fuse (Figure 4.2.11-1b), or without backwall fuse (Figure 4.2.11-1c), for which the expansion joint is sufficiently large to accommodate both the cyclic movement between the abutment wall and the bridge superstructure (i.e., superstructure does not push against abutment wall), the seismically induced earth pressure on the abutment wall shall be considered to be the dynamic active pressure condition. However, when the gap at the expansion joint is not sufficient to accommodate the cyclic wall/bridge seismic movements, a transfer of forces will occur from the superstructure to the abutment wall. As a result, the active earth pressure condition will not be valid and the earth pressure approaches a much larger passive pressure load condition behind the backwall. This larger load condition is the main cause for abutment damage, as demonstrated in past earthquakes. For semi-integral or L-shape abutments, the abutment stiffness and capacity under passive pressure loading are primary design concerns.

4.2.11.2.2 - Calculation of Best Estimate Passive Pressure Pp If the strength characteristics of compacted or natural soils in the "passive pressure zone" are known, then the passive force for a given height, Hw, may be calculated using accepted analysis procedures. These procedures should account for the interface friction between the wall and the soil. The properties used shall be those indicative of the entire "passive pressure zone" as indicated in Figure 1. Therefore, the properties of backfill present immediately adjacent to the wall in the active pressure zone may not be appropriate as a weaker failure surface can develop elsewhere in the embankment. For L-shape abutments where the backwall is not designed to fuse, Hw shall conservatively be taken as the depth of the superstructure, unless a more rational soilstructure interaction analysis is performed. If presumptive passive pressures are to be used for design, then the following criteria shall apply:
• Soil in the "passive pressure zone" shall be compacted in accordance with Standard 5.2.2.3Calculation of Passive Stiffness Specifications Section 2-03.3(14)I, which Soil requires compaction to 95 percent maximum density for all “Bridge Approach Embankments”.

4.2.11.2.4 - Modeling Passive Pressure Stiffness in the Longitudinal Direction In the longitudinal direction, when the bridge is moving toward the soil, the full passive resistance of the soil may be mobilized, but when the bridge moves away from the soil no soil resistance is mobilized. Since passive pressure acts at only one abutment at a time, linear elastic dynamic models and frame pushover models should only include a passive pressure spring at one abutment in any given model. Secant stiffness values for passive pressure shall be developed independently for each abutment. As an alternative, for straight or with horizontal curves up to 30 degrees single frame bridges, and compression models in straight multi-frame bridges where the passive pressure stiffness is similar between abutments, a spring may be used at each abutment concurrently. In this case, the assigned spring values at each end need to be reduced by half because they act in simultaneously, whereas the actual backfill passive resistance acts only in one direction and at one time. Correspondingly, the actual peak passive resistance force at either abutment will be equal to the sum of the peak forces developed in two springs. In this case, secant stiffness values for passive pressure shall be developed based on the sum of peak forces developed in each spring. If computed abutment forces exceed the soil capacity, the stiffness should be softened iteratively until abutment displacements are consistent (within 30 percent) with the assumed stiffness. 4.2.11.3 - Transverse Direction Transverse stiffness of abutments may be considered in the overall dynamic response of bridge systems on a case by case basis upon State Bridge Design Engineer approval. Upon approval, the transverse abutment stiffness used in the elastic demand models may be taken as 50 percent of the elastic transverse stiffness of the adjacent bent. Girder stops are typically designed to transmit the lateral shear forces generated by small to moderate earthquakes and service loads and are expected to fuse at the design event earthquake level of acceleration to limit the demand and control the damage in the abutments and supporting piles/shafts. Linear elastic analysis cannot capture the inelastic response of the girder stops, wingwalls or piles/shafts. Therefore, the forces generated with elastic demand assessment models should not be used to size the abutment girder stops. Girder stops for abutments supported on a spread footing shall be designed to sustain the lesser of the acceleration coefficient, As, times the superstructure dead load reaction at the abutment plus the weight of abutment and its footing or sliding friction forces of spread footings. Girder stops for pile/shaft supported foundations shall be designed to sustain the sum of 75 percent total lateral capacity of the piles/shafts and shear capacity of one wingwall. The elastic resistance may be taken to include the use of bearings designed to accommodate the design displacements, soil frictional resistance acting against the base of a spread footing supported abutment, or pile resistance provided by piles acting in their elastic range. The stiffness of fusing or breakaway abutment elements such as wingwalls (yielding or non-yielding), elastomeric bearings, and sliding footings shall not be relied upon to reduce displacement demands at intermediate piers. Unless fixed bearings are used, girder stops shall be provided between all girders regardless of the elastic seismic demand. The design of girder stops should consider that unequal forces that may develop in each stop. Page 4-16

Chapter 4
When fusing girder stops, transverse shear keys, or other elements that potentially release the restraint of the superstructure are used, then adequate support length meeting the requirements of Article 4.12 of the AASHTO SEISMIC must be provided. Additionally, the expected redistribution of internal forces in the superstructure and other bridge system element must be considered. Bounding analyses considering incremental release of transverse restraint at each end of the bridge should also be considered. 4.2.11.4 - Curved and Skewed Bridges Passive earth pressure at abutments may be considered as a key element of the ERS of straight and curved bridges with abutment skews up to 20 degrees. For larger skews, due to a combination of longitudinal and transverse response, the span has a tendency to rotate in the direction of decreasing skew. Such motion will tend to cause binding in the obtuse corner and generate uneven passive earth pressure forces on the abutment, exceeding the passive pressure near one end of the backwall, and providing little or no resistance at other end. This requires a more refined analysis to determine the amount of expected movement. The passive pressure resistance in soils behind semi-integral or L-shape abutments shall be based on the projected width of the abutment wall normal to the centerline of the bridge. Abutment springs shall be included in the local coordinate system of the abutment wall.

Seismic Resiliency using Innovative Materials and Construction Innovative materials and bridge construction are ideas that encourage engineers to consider principles that will enhance bridge performance, speed up construction, or add any other benefit to the industry. BDM Section 14.4 describes the self-centering columns that are designed restore much of their original shape after a seismic event. They’re intended to improve the serviceability of a bridge after an earthquake. Self-centering columns are constructed with a precast concrete column segment with a duct running through it longitudinally. They rest on footings with post-tensioning (PT) strand developed into them. Once the precast column piece is set on the footing, the PT strand threads through the duct and gets anchored into the crossbeam above the column. The PT strand is unbonded to the column segment. As a column experiences a lateral load, the PT strand elastically stretches to absorb the seismic energy and returns to its original tension load after the seismic event. The expectation is the column would rotate as a rigid body and the PT strand would almost spring the column back to its original orientation. Self-centering in bridge columns can be achieved using Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) and Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC). These products are introduced into bridge design as a means to improve ductility, seismic resiliency, and serviceability of a bridge after an earthquake. SMA is a class of alloys that are manufactured from either a combination of nickel and titanium or copper, magnesium and aluminum. The alloy is shaped into round bars in sizes similar to conventional steel reinforcement. When stressed, the SMA can undergo large deformations and return to original shape.

Seismic Design Requirements for Bridge Modifications and Widening Projects
4.3.1
General A bridge modification or widening is defined as where substructure bents are modified and new columns or piers are added, or an increase of bridge deck width or widenings to the sidewalk or barrier rails of an existing bridge resulting in significant mass increase or structural changes.

The seismic design of Ordinary, Recovery and Critical bridges shall be in accordance with the requirements of the AASHTO Guide Specifications for LRFD Seismic Bridge Design (AASHTO SEISMIC), and WSDOT BDM. The spectral response parameters shall be determined using USGS 2014 Seismic Hazard Maps and Site Coefficients defined in Section 4.2.3. The widening portion (new structure) shall be designed to meet current WSDOT standards for new Ordinary, Recovery and Critical bridges. Seismic analysis is required in accordance with Section 4.3.3 and is not required for single span bridges and bridges in SDC A. However, existing elements of single span bridges shall meet the requirements of AASHTO SEISMIC as applicable.

• There are major changes of the seismicity of the bridge site that can increase seismic hazard levels or reduce seismic performance of the structure since the initial screening or most recent seismic retrofit.
• Change in live load use of the bridge Major changes in seismicity include, but are not limited to, the following: near fault effect, significant liquefaction potential, or lateral spreading. If there are concerns about changes to the Seismic Design Response Spectrum at the bridge site, about a previous retrofit to the existing bridge, or an unusual imbalance of mass distribution resulting from the structure widening, the designer should consult the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office.
4.3.3
Seismic Design Requirements Bridge Widening Projects The Seismic Design requirements for Bridge Modifications and Widening are as follows and as illustrated in BDM Figure 4.3-1: 1.
Ordinary bridge modification or widening projects classified as Minor Modification or Widening do not require either a seismic evaluation or a retrofit of the structure. If the conditions for Minor Modification or Widening project are met, it is anticipated that the modified or widened structure will not draw enough additional seismic demand to significantly affect the existing sub-structure elements.
2.
Seismic analysis is required for all Major Modifications and Widening projects at project scoping level in accordance with Section 4.1. A complete seismic analysis is required for Ordinary bridges in Seismic Design Category (SDC) B, C, and D for major modifications and widening projects as described below. A project geotechnical report (including any unstable soil or liquefaction issues) shall be available to the structural engineer for seismic analysis. Seismic analysis shall be performed for both existing and widened structures. Capacity/Demand (C/D) ratios are required for existing bridge elements including foundation.
3.
The widening portion of the structure shall be designed for liquefiable soils condition in accordance to the AASHTO Seismic, and WSDOT BDM, unless soils improvement is provided to eliminate liquefaction.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Chapter 4
Seismic Design and Retrofit
4.
Procedure for Ordinary Bridges: Seismic improvement of existing columns and crossbeams to C/D > 1.0 is required. The cost of seismic improvement shall be paid for with widening project funding (not from the Retrofit Program). The seismic retrofit of the existing Ordinary structure shall conform to the BDM, while the newly widened portions of the bridge shall comply with the AASHTO Seismic, except for balanced stiffness criteria, which may be difficult to meet due to the existing bridge configuration. However, the designer should strive for the best balanced frame stiffness for the entire widened structure that is attainable in a cost effective manner. Major Modification and Widening Projects require the designer to determine the seismic C/D ratios of the existing bridge elements in the final widened condition. If the C/D ratios of columns and crossbeam of existing structure are less than 1.0, the improvement of seismically deficient elements is mandatory and the widening project shall include the improvement of existing seismically deficient bridge elements to C/D ratio of above 1.0. The C/D ratio of 1.0 is required to prevent the collapse of the bridge during the seismic event as required for life safety. Seismic improvement of the existing foundation elements (footings, pile caps, piles, and shafts to C/D ratios > 1.0) could be deferred to the Bridge Seismic Retrofit Program.
5.
Procedure for Recovery/Critical Bridges: The initial goal is to conduct the seismic design effort so the composite structure (existing bridge and widening) meet requirements of the two-level seismic design (FEE and SEE) de-scribed in BDM Section 4.1. This includes the superstructure, substructure and foundation elements of the composite structure. Retrofitting or strengthening of the existing structure may be necessary to achieve this. Depending on the year the bridge was constructed, type of foundation and capacity of the soils during a seismic event, it may become expensive to meet this goal. If the Engineer determines it is cost prohibitive to meet the two-level design criteria, the State Bridge Design Engineer may approve deviations. Examples of potential deviations include: A. Meeting two-level design criteria for the widened portion, but only achieving Ordinary bridge criteria for the existing bridge. B.
Meeting two-level design criteria for the above-ground portions of the composite structure, but not achieving this for the below-ground portions (foundations).
C.
Performing a two-level design, but requiring deviations from the displacement ductility demand limits identified in BDM Section 4.1.
D. Only achieving Ordinary (no collapse) criteria for the composite structure.

Scoping for Bridge Widening and Liquefaction Mitigation The Region project manager should contact the Bridge Office for bridge widening and retaining wall scoping assistance before project funding commitments are made to the legislature and the public. The WSDOT Bridge and Structures office will work with the WSDOT Geotechnical Office to assess the potential for liquefaction or other seismic hazards that could affect the cost of the proposed structures. The initial evaluation design time and associated costs for the WSDOT Geotechnical and WSDOT Bridge and Structures offices shall be considered at the scoping phase.

Seismic Design and Retrofit
Design and Detailing Considerations Support Length – The support length at existing abutments, piers, in-span hinges, and pavement seats shall be checked. If there is a need for longitudinal restrainers, transverse restrainers, or additional support length on the existing structure, they shall be included in the widening design. Connections Between Existing and New Elements – Connections between the new elements and existing elements should be designed for maximum over-strength forces. Where yielding is expected in the crossbeam connection at the extreme event limit state, the new structure shall be designed to carry live loads independently at the Strength I limit state. In cases where large differential settlement and/or a liquefaction-induced loss of bearing strength are expected, the connections may be designed to deflect or hinge in order to isolate the two parts of the structure. Elements subject to inelastic behavior shall be designed and detailed to sustain the expected deformations. Longitudinal joints between the existing and new structure are not permitted. Differential Settlement – The geotechnical designer should evaluate the potential for differential settlement between the existing structure and widening structure. Additional geotechnical measures may be required to limit differential settlements to tolerable levels for both static and seismic conditions. The bridge designer shall evaluate, design, and detail all elements of new and existing portions of the widened structure for the differential settlement warranted by the WSDOT State Geotechnical Engineer. Angular distortions between adjacent foundations greater than 0.008 (RAD) in simple spans and 0.004 (RAD) in continuous spans should not be permitted in settlement criteria. The horizontal displacement of pile and shaft foundations shall be estimated using procedures that consider soil-structure interaction (see Geotechnical Design Manual Section 8.12.2.3). Horizontal movement criteria should be established at the top of the foundation based on the tolerance of the structure to lateral movement with consideration of the column length and stiffness. Tolerance of the superstructure to lateral movement will depend on bridge seat widths, bearing type(s), structure type, and load distribution effects. Foundation Types – The foundation type of the new structure should match that of the existing structure. However, a different type of foundation may be used for the new structure due to geotechnical recommendations or the limited space available between existing and new structures. For example, a shaft foundation may be used in lieu of spread footing. Existing Strutted Columns – The horizontal strut between existing columns may be removed. The existing columns shall then be analyzed with the new unbraced length and retrofitted if necessary. Non Structural Element Stiffness – Median barrier and other potentially stiffening elements shall be isolated from the columns to avoid any additional stiffness to the system. Deformation capacities of existing bridge members that do not meet current detailing standards shall be determined using the provisions of Section 7.8 of the Retrofitting Manual for Highway Structures: Part 1 – Bridges, FHWA-HRT-06-032. Deformation capacities of existing bridge members that meet current detailing standards shall be determined using the latest edition of the AASHTO SEISMIC.

Computer Analysis Verification The computer results will be verified to ensure accuracy and correctness. The designer should use the following procedures for model verification:
• Using graphics to check the orientation of all nodes, members, supports, joint, and member releases. Make sure that all the structural components and connections correctly model the actual structure.
• Check dead load reactions with hand calculations. The difference should be less than 5 percent.
• Calculate fundamental and subsequent modes by hand and compare results with computer results.
• Check the mode shapes and verify that structure movements are reasonable.
• Increase the number of modes to obtain 90 percent or more mass participation in each direction. GTSTRUDL/SAP2000 directly calculates the percentage of mass participation.
• Check the distribution of lateral forces. Are they consistent with column stiffness? Do small changes in stiffness of certain columns give predictable results?

General The provisions in this section apply to the design of cast-in-place (CIP) and precast concrete structures, both reinforced and prestressed. Design of concrete structures shall be based on the requirements and guidance cited herein and in the current AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications (LRFD), AASHTO Guide Specifications for LRFD Seismic Bridge Design (SEISMIC), AASHTO Guide Specification for Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC), Special Provisions and the Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction (Standard Specifications) M 41-10.

Concrete 5.1.1.A
Strength of Concrete
Pacific NW aggregates have consistently resulted in concrete strengths, which may exceed 10,000 psi in 28 days. Specified concrete strengths should be rounded to the next highest 100 psi. 5.1.1.A.1
CIP Concrete Bridges
Since conditions for placing and curing concrete for CIP components are not as controlled as they are for precast bridge components, Class 4000 concrete is typically used. Where significant economy can be gained or structural requirements dictate, Class 5000 concrete may be used with the approvals of the State Bridge Design Engineer, State Bridge Construction Office, and WSDOT Materials Lab. 5.1.1.A.2
Prestressed Concrete Girders
The recommended specified 28-day concrete compressive strength (ƒ'c) is 7.0 ksi. Where higher strengths would eliminate a line of girders, a maximum of 10.0 ksi can be specified. Slab girders should be limited to 8.0 ksi. The minimum specified concrete compressive strength at release (ƒ'ci) is 5.0 ksi for prestressed concrete slab girders and 6.0 ksi for all other prestressed girders. Where higher strengths would eliminate a line of girders, the compressive strength at release may be increased up to 7.5 ksi. Release strengths as high as 8.5 ksi can be achieved with extended curing for special circumstances. Specified concrete strengths should generally be rounded to the nearest 0.1 ksi above what is required for design and constructability. 5.1.1.B
Classes of Concrete
5.1.1.B.1
Class 3000
Used in large sections with light to nominal reinforcement, mass pours, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, and nonstructural concrete guardrail anchors, luminaire bases. 5.1.1.B.2
Class 4000
Used in CIP post-tensioned or conventionally reinforced concrete box girders, slabs, traffic and pedestrian barriers, approach slabs, footings, box culverts, wing walls, curtain walls, retaining walls, columns, and crossbeams. 5.1.1.B.3
Class 4000A
Used for bridge approach slabs. 5.1.1.B.4
Class 4000D
Used for CIP bridge decks. 5.1.1.B.5
Class 4000P and 5000P

Class 5000 or Higher
Used in CIP post-tensioned concrete box girder construction, deep bridge foundations, or in other special structural applications if significant economy can be gained or structural requirements dictate. Class 5000 or higher concrete is generally available near large urban centers. Designers shall confirm availability at the project site before specifying Class 5000 or higher concrete (such as with WACA). The specified 28-day compressive strengths (ƒ'c) are equal to the numerical class of concrete. The compressive strengths for design are shown in Table 5.1.1-1. 
Table 5.1.1-1 28-Day Compressive Design Strength

5.1.1.C
Relative Compressive Concrete Strength
1.
During design or construction of a bridge, it is necessary to determine the strength of concrete at various stages of construction. For instance, Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(17)J discusses the time at which falsework and forms can be removed to various percentages of the concrete design strength. Occasionally, construction problems will arise which require a knowledge of the relative strengths of concrete at various ages. Table 5.1.1-2 shows the approximate values of the minimum compressive strengths of different classes of concrete at various ages. If the concrete has been cured under continuous moist curing at an average temperature, it can be assumed that these values have been developed.
2.
Curing of the concrete (especially in the first 24 hours) has a very important influence on the strength development of concrete at all ages. Temperature affects the rate at which the chemical reaction between cement and water takes place. Loss of moisture can seriously impair the concrete strength.
3.
If test strength is above or below that shown in Table 5.1.1-2, the age at which the design strength will be reached can be determined by direct proportion. For example, if the relative strength at 10 days is 64 percent instead of the minimum 70 percent shown in Table 5.1.1-2, the time it takes to reach the design strength can be determined using equation 5.1.1-1 below. Let x = relative strength to determine the age at which the concrete will reach the design strength

From Table 5.1.1-2, the design strength should be reached in 40 days. Table 5.1.1-2

Modulus of Elasticity
The modulus of elasticity shall be determined as specified in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.4.2.4. For calculation of the modulus of elasticity, the unit weight of plain concrete (wc) shall be taken as 0.155 kcf for prestressed concrete girders and 0.150 kcf for normalweight concrete. The correction factor (K1) shall normally be taken as 1.0. 5.1.1.E

Shrinkage and CreepBridge & Structures Branch
Shrinkage and creep shall be calculated in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.4.2.3. The relative humidity, H, may be taken as 75 percent for standard conditions. The maturity of concrete, t, may be taken as 2,000 days for standard conditions. The volume-to-surface ratio, V/S, is given in Table 5.6.1‑1 for standard WSDOT prestressed concrete girders. In determining the maturity of concrete at initial loading, ti, one day of accelerated curing by steam or radiant heat may be taken as equal to seven days of normal curing.

Mass concrete is any volume of concrete with dimensions large enough to require that measures be taken to cope with the generation of heat from hydration of the cement and attendant volume change to minimize cracking. Temperature-related cracking may be experienced in thick-section concrete structures, including spread footings, pile caps, bridge piers, crossbeams, thick walls, and other structures as applicable. Concrete placements with least dimension greater than 6 feet should be considered mass concrete, although smaller placements with least dimension greater than 3 feet WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-5
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
may also have problems with heat generation effects. Shafts need not be considered mass concrete. The temperature of mass concrete shall not exceed 160°F. The temperature difference between the geometric center of the concrete and the center of nearby exterior surfaces shall not exceed 35°F. Designers could mitigate heat generation effects by specifying construction joints and placement intervals. Designers should consider requiring the Contractor to submit a thermal control plan, which may include such things as: 1.
Temperature monitors and equipment.
2.
Insulation.
3.
Concrete cooling before placement.
4.
Concrete cooling after placement, such as by means of internal cooling pipes.
5.
Use of smaller, less frequent placements.
6.
Other methods proposed by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer of Record.
Concrete mix design optimization, such as using low-heat cement, fly ash or slag cement, low-water/cement ratio, low cementitious materials content, larger aggregate, etc. is acceptable as long as the concrete mix meets the requirements of the Standard Specifications for the specified concrete class. The ACI Manual of Concrete Practice Publication 207 and specifications used for the Tacoma Narrows Bridge Project suspension cable anchorages (2003-2006) can be used as references. 5.1.1.I
Self-Consolidating Concrete (SCC) Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) may be used in structural members such as precast prestressed concrete girders, precast noise wall panels, barriers, three-sided structures, etc. as described in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(27). SCC may be specified for cast-in-place applications where the use of conventional concrete could be challenging and problematic. Examples are where new concrete is being cast up against an existing soffit, or in members with very dense/congested reinforcing steel. Use of SCC for primary structural components such as columns, crossbeams, slabs, etc., requires the approval of the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer.
5.1.1.J
Shotcrete
Shotcrete could be used as specified in WSDOT Standard Plans. Shotcrete may not be suitable for some critical applications unless approved by the Engineer of Record. Substitution of CIP conventional concrete in the contract document with shotcrete requires the approval of the Engineer of Record. Some potential shortfalls of shotcrete as compared to conventional CIP concrete include:
• Durability – Conventional concrete is placed in forms and vibrated for consolidation. Shotcrete, whether placed by wet or dry material feed, is pneumatically applied to the surface and is not consolidated as conventional concrete. Due to the difference in consolidation, permeability can be affected. If the permeability is not low enough, the service life of the shotcrete will be affected and may not meet the minimum of 75 years specified for conventional concretes. Page 5-6
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
Observation of some projects indicates the inadequate performance of shotcrete to properly hold back water. This results in leaking and potential freezing, seemingly at a higher rate than conventional concrete. Due to the method of placement of shotcrete, air entrainment is difficult to control. This leads to less resistance of freeze/thaw cycles.
• Cracking – There is more cracking observed in shotcrete surfaces compared to conventional concrete. Excessive cracking in shotcrete could be attributed to its higher shrinkage, method of curing, and lesser resistance to freeze/thaw cycles. The shotcrete cracking is more evident when structure is subjected to differential shrinkage.
• Corrosion Protection – The higher permeability of shotcrete places the steel reinforcement (whether mesh or bars) at a higher risk of corrosion than conventional concrete applications. Consideration for corrosion protection may be necessary for some critical shotcrete applications.
• Safety – Carved shotcrete and shotcrete that needs a high degree of relief to accent architectural features lead to areas of 4″-6″ of unreinforced shotcrete. These areas can be prone to an accelerated rate of deterioration. This, in turn, places pedestrians, bicyclists, and traffic next to the wall at risk of falling debris.
• Visual Quality and Corridor Continuity – As shotcrete is finished by hand, standard architectural design, as defined in the Design Manual M 22-01, typically cannot be met. This can create conflicts with the architectural guidelines developed for the corridor. Many times the guidelines are developed with public input. If the guidelines are not met, the public develops a distrust of the process. In other cases, the use of faux rock finishes, more commonly used by the private sector, can create the perception of the misuse of public funds. 5.1.1.K
Lightweight Aggregate Concrete
Lightweight aggregate concrete shall not be used on bridge decks or other components exposed to traffic wheel loads in service. 5.1.1.L
Concrete Cover to Reinforcement
Concrete cover to reinforcement shall conform to AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.1. 5.1.1.L.1
Precast Prestressed Concrete Girders
Cover to prestressing strands in precast prestressed concrete girders may be measured to the center of the strand. Cover to mild steel reinforcement in precast prestressed concrete girders shall conform to AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.1. However, cover to ties and stirrups may be reduced to 1.0 inch in “Exterior other than above” applications. See Section 5.6.7.A for additional cover requirements for deck girders. 5.1.1.L.2
Concrete Exposed to Salt/Seawater
Salt/sea water can be an aggressive corrosive environment that significantly shortens the service life of reinforced concrete structures. ACI 201.2R 7.2.1 provides some guidance on severity of exposure: “The severity of marine exposures can vary greatly within a given concrete structure. In general, continuous submersion is the least aggressive exposure. Areas where capillary suction and evaporation are prevalent are the most aggressive WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-7
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
because these processes tend to increase the concentration of salts. Examples of such exposures include reclaimed coastal areas with foundations below saline groundwater level, intertidal zones, and splash zones. ”Corrosive water or soil contains greater or equal to 500 part per million (ppm) of chlorides. Sites that are considered corrosive due soley to sulfate content greater than or equal to 2,000 ppm and/or a pH of less than or equal to 5.5 should be considered non-corrosive in determining minimum cover. Designers shall provide the minimum cover specified in AASHTO LRFD Table 5.12.3-1 to concrete structures with direct exposure to salt/sea water such as the Pacific Ocean and the Puget Sound. However, use of other corrosion mitigation strategies described in ACI 201.2R 7.2.3 and ACI 357.3R could be used to reduce this cover or provide additional protection such as minimizing concrete permeability, using corrosion resistant reinforcement, cathodic protection, treatments that penetrate or are applied on the surface of the concrete to slow the entry of chloride ions, etc. 5.1.1.M
Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC)
Ultra-high performance concrete is allowed for field cast-connections between precast elements. It may be used for repairs, overlays or other uses with State Bridge Design Engineer approval. WSDOT has funded two research projects with the Washington State University and the University of Washington studying the connection of wide flange deck girders using UHPC. The material studied is a high strength, high bond, fiber reinforced, flowable concrete capable of developing non-contact lap splices in a short distance. The material studied does not provide the same properties as common prepackaged commercial UHPC products, but it is capable of developing compact field connections between precast elements using locally available materials.
5.1.2
Reinforcing Steel 5.1.2.A
Types and Grades
Steel reinforcement conforming to ASTM A 706 provides controlled ductility and enhanced weldability. Steel reinforcement for cast-in-place components and precast substructure components of bridges shall conform to ASTM A 706 unless noted otherwise. Steel reinforcement for precast bridge superstructure components, precast buried structures, retaining walls, barriers and other structures not designed for ductile seismic behavior shall conform to either ASTM A 706 or AASHTO M31 (ASTM A615). Steel reinforcement that is welded shall conform to ASTM A 706. Grade 60 is the preferred grade for most components and structures. Grade 80 highstrength reinforcing steel may be used selectively to reduce congestion, reduce weight, speed up installation and/or reduce cost where its use is permitted and economical. Bridge decks, crossbeams, spread footings and foundation caps are components where Grade 80 longitudinal reinforcement could be economical. See Section 4.2.20 for additional seismic design requirements. Designers should consider the need for additional development length when using high strength reinforcing steel. For improved economy, designers should minimize the number of different bar sizes on a job which use high-strength reinforcement. Where high-strength steel reinforcement is used in combination with Grade 60 reinforcement, designers should avoid specifying higher grades for bar sizes that Grade 60 is specified. This practice prevents confusion and improper installation on site. Mechanical couplers

are available for high-strength reinforcement, but splices should be staggered and located in regions of low stress. Transverse steel reinforcement for shear and torsion with a yield strength, fy, in excess of 75 ksi shall use 75 ksi for resistance calculations. The limit of 75 ksi is intended to maintain the concrete’s effectiveness in resisting shear by limiting the size of diagonal cracks that develop. 5.1.2.A.1
Corrosion Resistant Reinforcement
Corrosion resistant reinforcing such as stainless steel, chromium steel, galvanized steel or epoxy-coated steel may be used where added corrosion protection is needed. Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars may be used with State Bridge Design Engineer approval. Epoxy-coated reinforcing is a preferred and economical method of enhanced corrosion protection compared to uncoated steel reinforcing. See Section 5.7.4 for use in Bridge Deck Protection Systems. Plans shall designate bar marks with “E”. Galvanized steel reinforcing shall conform to either ASTM A767 Class 1 or ASTM A1094. Chromate treatment of galvanized steel shall be left as optional for the contractor. Plans shall designate bar marks with “G”. Stainless steel reinforcing shall conform to ASTM A955, UNS S24100, UNS S31653 or UNS31803. Plans shall designate bar marks with "SS". Corrosion resistant chromium alloyed reinforcing such as ChromX® (alternatively MMFX) shall conform to ASTM A1035 Type CM or CS. Type CS (with 9% chromium and a higher level of corrosion resistance) should be used where corrosion resistance beyond that of epoxy-coated reinforcing is desired. This reinforcement may be used in the design of bridge decks, substructure and foundation members where rebar congestion is a concern or where corrosion protection is needed. Contract documents should avoid referring to reinforcement by trade names, such as ChromX® or MMFX. Plans shall designate bar marks with “CR”. GFRP reinforcing shall conform to the requirements of ASTM D7957. This type of reinforcing bar may be used in bridge decks in any Seismic Design Category, and in crossbeams and foundations in Seismic Design Category A. Design shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Guide Specifications for GRFP-Reinforced Concrete, 2nd Edition. Plans shall designate bar marks with "GF". Engineers shall minimize the potential for dissimilar metal corrosion when combining different types of reinforcing steel in a structure. Where corrosion resistant steel is used, specifications shall be provided to require industry standard best-practices for fabrication, handling, placing and protection. 5.1.2.B
Sizes
Reinforcing bars are referred to in the contract plans and specifications by number and vary in size from #3 to #18. For bars up to and including #8, the number of the bar coincides with the bar diameter in eighths of an inch. The #9, #10, and #11 bars have diameters that provide areas equal to 1″ × 1″ square bars, 1⅛″ × 1⅛″ square bars and 1¼″ × 1¼″ square bars respectively. Similarly, the #14 and #18 bars correspond to 1½″ × 1½″ and 2″ × 2″ square bars, respectively. Appendix 5.1-A3 shows the sizes, number, and various properties of the types of bars used in Washington State.

Development
5.1.2.C.1
Tension Development Length
Development length or anchorage of reinforcement is required on both sides of a point of maximum stress at any section of a reinforced concrete member. Development of reinforcement in tension shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.8.2.1. Appendix 5.1-A4 shows the tension development length for both uncoated and epoxy coated Grade 60 bars for normal weight concrete with specified strengths of 4.0 to 6.0 ksi. 5.1.2.C.2
Compression Development Length
Development of reinforcement in compression shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.8.2.2. The basic development lengths for deformed bars in compression are shown in Appendix 5.1-A5. These values may be modified as described in AASHTO. However, the minimum development length shall be 1′-0″. 5.1.2.C.3
Tension Development Length of Standard Hooks
Standard hooks are used to develop bars in tension where space limitations restrict the use of straight bars. Development of standard hooks in tension shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.8.2.4. Tension development lengths of 90° & 180° standard hooks are shown in Appendix 5.1-A6. 5.1.2.D
Splices
The Contract Plans shall clearly show the locations and lengths of splices. Splices shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.8.4. Lap splices, for either tension or compression bars, shall not be less than 2′-0″. 5.1.2.D.1
Tension Lap Splices
Many of the same factors which affect development length affect splices. Consequently, tension lap splices are a function of the bar’s development length, ld. There are two classes of tension lap splices: Class A and B. Designers are encouraged to splice bars at points of minimum stress and to stagger lap splices along the length of the bars. Appendix 5.1-A7 shows tension lap splices for both uncoated and epoxy coated Grade 60 bars for normal weight concrete with specified strengths of 4.0 to 6.0 ksi. 5.1.2.D.2
Compression Lap Splices
Compression lap splice lengths are shown in Appendix 5.1-A5 for concrete strengths greater than or equal to 3.0 ksi. 5.1.2.D.3
Mechanical Splices
Mechanical splices are proprietary splicing mechanisms. The requirements for mechanical splices are found in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(24)F and in AASHTO LRFD Sections 5.5.3.4 and 5.10.8.4.2b.

5.1.2.D.4
Welded Splices
AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.8.4.2c describes the requirements for welded splices. On modifications to existing structures, welding of reinforcing bars may not be possible because of the non‑weldability of some steels. 5.1.2.E
Hooks and Bends
For hook and bend requirements, see AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.2. Standard hooks and bend radii are shown in Appendix 5.1-A1 for steel reinforcing bars with yield strengths up to 100 ksi. Additional tie reinforcement may be required to anchor hooked bars when the yield strength exceeds 75 ksi. When specifying and detailing galvanized reinforcing, designers should consider that larger bend diameters will be provided if the contractor elects to galvanize bars after fabrication. These diameters (see ASTM A 767) differ from standard CRSI requirements for 180 degree hooks on #7 and #8 bars and all stirrup/tie hooks. When using GFRP bars, detailed bends should be avoided where possible. If bent bars are necessary, they should be coordinated with suppliers during design. Headed bar may be an acceptable alternative. 5.1.2.F
Fabrication Lengths
Reinforcing bars are available in standard mill lengths of 40′ for bar sizes #3 and #4 and 60′ for bar sizes of #5 and greater. Designers shall limit reinforcing bar lengths to the standard mill lengths. Because of placement considerations, designers should consider limiting the overall lengths of bar size #3 to 30′ and bar size #5 to 40′. Spirals of bar sizes #4 through #6 are available on 5,000 lb coils. Spirals should be limited to a maximum bar size of #6. Straight galvanized reinforcing bars should be limited to a 40’ maximum length. Straight stainless steel reinforcing bars should be limited to a 40’ maximum length for #3#18 bar. Corrosion resistant reinforcing (ASTM A 1035) is available in 60’ lengths for #4-#18 bar. GFRP reinforcing bars should be limited to a 40’ maximum length. For some materials, longer bars are possible. But the designer should coordinate with suppliers during design prior to specifying them. Longer bars can increase lead time and/ or limit suppliers. Optional lap splices should be provided at the recommended maximum bar length where possible. 5.1.2.G
Placement
Placement of reinforcing bars can be a challenge during construction. If reinforcement is congested, as is common in column joints, additional details are recommended in the contract plans showing how each bar is placed. Appendix 5.1-A2 shows the minimum clearance and spacing of reinforcement for beams and columns. High-strength reinforcement is one possible method to reduce congestion.

Right or Obtuse Angle Corner Reinforcing Details
Adding diagonal reinforcing steel across the corner, approximately equal to 50 percent of the main reinforcing steel, will develop the corner strength to fully resist the applied moment. Extend the diagonal reinforcement past the corner each direction for anchorage. Since this bar arrangement will fully develop the resisting moment, a fillet in the corner is normally unnecessary.

Welded Wire Reinforcement Welded wire reinforcement may be used to replace steel reinforcing bars in prestressed concrete girders, precast buried structures walls, barriers, and precast deck panels. Welded wire shall be deformed and shall conform to the requirements of AASHTO M336/ ASTM A 1064. Epoxy-coated wire and welded wire reinforcement shall conform to Standard Specifications Section 9-07.3 with the exception that ASTM A884 Class A Type I shall be used instead of ASTM A775. Galvanized welded wire reinforcement shall conform to the requirements of ASTM A1060. Stainless steel welded wire reinforcement shall conform to the requirements of ASTM A1022. Welded wire reinforcement shall be deformed. The specified minimum yield strength shall be limited to a maximum of 75 ksi. Longitudinal wires and welds shall be excluded from regions with high shear demands, including girder webs, and are limited to the flange areas as described in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.8.2.8. Longitudinal wires for anchorage of welded wire reinforcement shall have an area of 40 percent or more of the area of the wire being anchored as described in ASTM A497 but shall not be less than D4.
5.1.2.J
Headed Steel Reinforcing Bars
Headed steel reinforcing bars conforming to ASTM A970 Class HA may be used to develop reinforcement in tension. Use and development length shall be in accordance with ACI 318 (see Section 25.4.4 for development length). Minimum concrete cover and clearances to headed steel reinforcing bars shall also be provided to the outermost part of the head of the bar. Designers shall provide main bar (unheaded portion) location requirements in contract documents and verify that cover and clearance requirements to the head of the bar can be satisfied. ASTM A970 Class HA requires that the net bearing area of the head shall not be less than four times the nominal cross-sectional area of the bar. However, the head shape and an upper limit to the head net bearing area are not specified. A gross head area of ten times the bar area (a net bearing area of the head of nine times the bar area) could be used as an estimate of the upper limit of the head area.

Prestressing Steel 5.1.3.A
General
Three types of high-tensile steel used for prestressing steel are: 1.
Strands AASHTO M 203 Grade 270, low relaxation
2.
Bars AASHTO M 275 Type II
3.
Parallel Wires AASHTO M 204 Type WA
All WSDOT designs are based on low relaxation strands using either 0.5″ or 0.6″ diameter strands for girders, and ⅜″ or 7/16″ diameter strands for stay-in-place precast deck panels. Properties of uncoated and epoxy-coated prestressing stands are shown in Appendix 5.1-A8. 0.62″ and 0.7″ diameter strands may be used for top temporary strands in prestressed concrete girders when 10 0.6” diameter temporary top strands are not sufficient for temporary handling cases.

Stress Limits
Stress limits for prestressing steel are as listed in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.9.2.2. 5.1.3.C
Prestressing Strands
Standard strand patterns for all types of WSDOT prestressed concrete girders are shown on the Bridge Standard Drawings website (www.wsdot.wa.gov/Bridge/Structures/ StandardDrawings.htm). 5.1.3.C.1
Straight Strands
The position of the straight strands in the bottom flange is standardized for each girder type. 5.1.3.C.2
Harped Strands
The harped strands are bundled between the harping points (the 0.4 and 0.6 points of the girder length). The girder fabricator shall select a bundle configuration that meets plan centroid requirements. There are practical limitations to how close the centroid of harped strands can be to the bottom of a girder. The minimum design value for this shall be determined using the following guide: Up to 12 harped strands are placed in a single bundle with the centroid 4″ above the bottom of the girder. Additional strands are placed in twelve-strand bundles with centroids at 3″ spacing vertically upwards. At the girder ends, the strands are splayed to a normal pattern. The centroid of strands at both the girder end and the harping point may be varied to suit girder stress requirements. The slope of any individual harped strands shall not be steeper than 8 horizontal to 1 vertical for 0.6″ diameter strands, and 6 horizontal to 1 vertical for 0.5″ diameter strands. The harped strand exit location at the girder ends shall be held as low as possible while maintaining the concrete stresses within allowable limits. 5.1.3.C.3
Temporary Strands
Temporary strands in the top flanges of prestressed concrete girders may be required for stability (see Section 5.6.3). These strands shall be considered to be pretensioned for design purposes, but may be post-tensioned at the manufacturer's discretion depending on pretensioning bed capacity. If the strands are post-tensioned, calculations shall be provided by the manufacturer considering the timing of post-tensioning (before or after lifting from the form). It is more efficient to post-tension the strands after removal of the girder from the form if they are not needed for stability during lifting. The calculations shall consider the effects on camber from any revisions to the concrete strength at transfer and timing of post-tensioning. In no case shall the temporary top strands be posttensioned more than 48 hours after transfer of permanent pretensioning. These strands can be considered in design to reduce the required strength at release, to provide stability during handling and shipping, and to reduce the “A” dimension. These strands must be cut before the CIP intermediate diaphragms are placed.

Development of Prestressing Strand
5.1.3.D.1
General
Development of prestressing strand shall be as described in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.9.4.3. The development length of bonded uncoated & coated prestressing strands are shown in Appendix 5.1-A8. 5.1.3.D.2
Partially Debonded Strands
Where it is necessary to prevent a strand from actively supplying prestress force near the end of a girder, it shall be debonded. This can be accomplished by taping a close fitting PVC tube to the stressed strand from the end of the girder to some point where the strand can be allowed to develop its load. Since this is not a common procedure, it shall be carefully detailed on the plans. It is important when this method is used in construction that the taping of the tube is done in such a manner that concrete cannot leak into the tube and provide an undesirable bond of the strand. Partially debonded strands shall meet the requirements of AASHTO LRFD Section 5.9.4.3.3. 5.1.3.D.3
Strand Development Outside of Prestressed Concrete Girders
For cases with uneven girder spacings or girders centered on columns, the designer shall verify that the total combined moment resistance of all girders within the tributary region Concrete structures O>aplerS of the column is greater than the total moment demand at the superstructure CG minus the total factored superimposed dead load moments.

Anchorage of extended strands is essential for all prestressed concrete girder bridges with fixed diaphragms at intermediate piers. Extended strand anchorage may be achieved by directly overlapping extended strands, by use of strand, by the use of the crossbeam ties along with strand ties, or by a combination of all three methods. The following methods in order of hierarchy shall be used for all prestressed concrete girders for creating continuity of extended strands: Method 1 – Direct extended strands overlapping shall be used at intermediate piers without any angle point due to horizontal curvature and for any crossbeam width. This is the preferred method of achieving extended strand continuity. Congestion of reinforcement and girder setting constructability shall be considered when large numbers of extended strands are required. In these cases, strand ties may be used in conjunction with extended strands. See Figure 5.1.3-3 Figure 5.1.3-3

Method 2 – Strand ties shall be used at intermediate piers with a girder angle point due to horizontal curvature where extended strands are not parallel and would cross during girder placement. Crossbeam widths shall be greater than or equal to 6 feet measured along the skew. It is preferable that strand ties be used for all extended strands, however if the region becomes too congested for rebar placement and concrete consolidation, additional forces may be carried by crossbeam ties up to a ¢ GIR 8D maximum limit as specified in equation 5.1.3-6.

In this case the strand ties shall be considered fully effective. For cases where less than 8″ of lap is provided, the effectiveness of the strand tie shall be reduced proportional to the reduction in lap. All additional forces not taken by strand ties must be carried by crossbeam ties up to the maximum limit as specified in equation 5.1.3-6. If this limit is exceeded, the geometry of the width of the crossbeam shall be increased to provide sufficient lap for the strand ties. See Figure 5.1.3-5.

Concrete Structures
The elastic gain due to slab shrinkage, ΔfpSS, shall be computed in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.9.3.4.3d. Deck shrinkage shall be considered as an external force applied to the composite section for the Service I, Service III, and Fatigue I limit states. This force is applied at the center of the deck with an eccentricity from the center of the deck to the center of gravity of the composite section. This force causes compression in the top of the girder, tension in the bottom of the girder, and an increase in the effective prestress force (an elastic gain). The deck shrinkage strain shall be computed as 50 percent of the strain determined by AASHTO LRFD Equation 5.4.2.3.3-1. 5.1.4.E
Temporary Losses
For checking stresses during release, lifting, transportation, and erection of prestressed concrete girders, the elastic and time-dependent losses may be computed based on the following assumptions. 5.1.4.E.1
Lifting of Girders From Casting Beds
For normal construction, forms are stripped and girders are lifted from the casting bed within one day. 5.1.4.E.2
Transportation
Girders are most difficult to transport at a young age. The hauling configuration causes reduced dead load moments in the girder and the potential for overstress between the harping points. Overstress may also occur at the support points depending on the prestressing and the trucking configuration. This is compounded by the magnitude of the prestress force not having been reduced by losses. For an aggressive construction schedule girders are typically transported to the job site around day 10. When losses are estimated by the Approximate Estimate of AASHTO LRFD Section 5.9.3.3, the losses at the time of hauling may be estimated by: (5 .1 .4-8) (5 .1 .4-8)

Erection
During construction, the non-composite girders must carry the full weight of the deck slab and interior diaphragms. This loading typically occurs around 120 days for a normal construction schedule. 5.1.4.E.4
Final Configuration
The composite slab and girder section must carry all conceivable loads including superimposed dead loads such as traffic barriers, overlays, and live loads. It is assumed that superimposed dead loads are placed at 120 days and final losses occur at 2,000 days.

Prestressing Anchorage Systems Multistrand grouted tendons with steel strand are the preferred system for posttensioned concrete bridge superstructures, spliced girders, and bridge components. For post-tensioned concrete bridge decks, unbonded single strand post tensioning systems may be used. The use of other post-tensioning systems and materials shall require the approval of the Bridge Design Engineer. Multistrand and grouted post-tensioning systems for permanent construction shall be designed and constructed in accordance with Protection Level 2 (PL-2) practices, as defined by the requirements of PTI/ASBI M50.3-19 Specification for Multistrand and Grouted Post-Tensioning and PTI M55.1-19 Specification for Grouting of Post-Tensioned Structures. Unbonded single strand post-tensioning systems shall be designed and constructed in accordance with PTI M10.2-17 Specification for Unbonded Single Strand Tendons. Designers should consult post-tensioning system supplier product guides to ensure that multiple suppliers can satisfy the design. Corrugated plastic duct shall be used and shall conform to standard sizes where possible. Common post-tensioning system component sizes and combinations are shown in Table 5.1.5-1. The nominal diameter for plastic duct may be used when interpreting code provisions that reference duct size or diameter without further clarification (i.e. inside diameter, outside diameter, etc.). The interior diameter of plastic duct shall be used when interpreting code provisions that reference duct area without further clarification. Table 5.1.5-1 Duct Size (Round) 3" 3-3/8" 4" 4-1/2"

Design Considerations
5.2.1
Service and Fatigue Limit States 5.2.1.A
General
Service limit state is used to satisfy stress limit, deflection, and control of cracking requirements. Design aids for tensile stress in reinforcement at the service limit state, ƒss, are provided in Appendices 5.2-A1, 5.2-A2, and 5.2‑A3. 5.2.1.B
Control of Cracking
Reinforcement shall be provided and spaced to meet the requirements in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.6.7 “Control of Cracking by Distribution of Reinforcement.” The exposure factor shall be based upon a Class 2 exposure condition. 5.2.1.C
Stress Limits in Prestressed Concrete Members
Allowable concrete stresses for the service and fatigue limit states are shown in Table 5.2.1-1. For prestressed concrete girders, the concrete stress limits shall be satisfied at all pre-service stages of girder construction and in service in accordance with Section 5.6.2.C. The tensile stress in the precompressed tensile zone for the final service load condition (Service III) is limited to zero. This prevents cracking of the concrete during the service life of the structure and provides additional stress and strength capacity for overloads. The controlling locations for temporary compressive stress with and without lateral bending are shown in Figure 5.2.1-1. For tensile stress limits that require bonded reinforcement sufficient to resist the tensile force in the concrete, the tensile force shall be computed using the procedure illustrated in Figure 5.2.1-2 assuming an uncracked section. The bonded reinforcement is proportioned using a stress of 0.5fy, not to exceed 30 ksi. Individual reinforcing bars are only considered if they are fully developed and are located within the tensile stress region of the member. The variable λ is the concrete density modification factor calculated in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.4.2.8. For precast prestressed segments that are continuous over supports, such as in spliced girders, the tensile stress limits at service limit states shall apply for the precast segment, but need not be applied to a CIP bridge deck.

Flexure
Design for flexural force effects shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.6. For prestressed concrete girders, the approximate methods of AASHTO LRFD Section 5.6.3 underestimate the flexural strength of the composite deck-girder system2, 23. Strain compatibility approaches such as the PCI Bridge Design Manual3 method (PCI BDM Section 8.2.2.5) and the Nonlinear Strain Compatibility Analysis method in the PCI Journal23 are recommended. In addition to the effective area of the deck, the top flange of the girder and the mild reinforcement in the deck and the top flange of the girder may be included in the analysis. The typical section for computation of prestressed concrete girder composite section properties is shown in Figure 5.6.2-1.

Shear
AASHTO LRFD Section 5.7 addresses shear design of concrete members. 1.
The shear design of prestressed members shall be based on the general procedure of AASHTO LRFD Section 5.7.3.4.2.
2.
The shear design of all non-prestressed members shall be based on either the general procedure, or the simplified procedure of AASHTO LRFD Section 5.7.3.4.1.

3.
The strut-and-tie model shall be employed as required by AASHTO LRFD Sections 5.7.1.1 and 2 for regions adjacent to abrupt changes in cross-section, openings, draped ends, deep beams, corbels, integral bent caps, c-bent caps, outrigger bents, deep footings, pile caps, etc.
4.
The maximum spacing of transverse reinforcement is limited to 18 inches.
For prestressed concrete girders, shear for the critical section at dv from the internal face of the support and at the harping point are of particular interest. 5.2.2.C
Interface Shear
Interface shear transfer (shear friction) design is to be performed in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.7.4. If a roughened surface is required for shear transfer at construction joints in new construction, they shall be identified in the plans. See Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(12)A. When designing for shear transfer between new and existing concrete, the designer shall consider the high construction cost associated with roughening existing concrete surfaces. Whenever practical, the design for placing new concrete against existing concrete shall be completed such that roughening of the existing concrete surfaces is not required (i.e. use cohesion and friction factors for a surface that is not intentionally roughened).

When the additional capacity provided by a roughened surface is required, the surface roughening shall meet the requirements specified in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.7.4.4 (i.e. uniform ¼″ minimum amplitude).

Chapter 5
Interface shear in prestressed concrete girder design is critical at the interface connection between deck slab and girder, and at the end connection of the girder to a diaphragm or crossbeam. Shear in these areas is resisted by roughened or saw-tooth shear keyed concrete as well as reinforcement extending from the girder. 5.2.2.C.1
Interface Shear Between Deck Slab and Girder
The top surfaces of prestressed concrete girders with cast-in-place decks shall be roughened as described in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25)H. The interface shear is resisted by the girder stirrups which extend up into the deck slab as well as the roughened top surface of the girder top flange. It is conservative to compute the interface shear force using the full factored loading applied to the composite deck slab and girder. However, the interface shear force need only be computed from factored loads applied to the composite section after the deck slab is placed such as superimposed dead loads and live loads. For Stay-in-Place (SIP) deck systems, only the roughened top flange surface between SIP panel supports (and the portion of the permanent net compressive force Pc on that section) is considered engaged in interface shear transfer. 5.2.2.C.2
Interface Shear Friction at Girder End
A prestressed concrete girder may be required to carry shears at the end surface of the girder. An end condition at an intermediate pier crossbeam is shown in Figure 5.2.2-2. The shear which must be carried along the interface A-A is the actual factored shear acting on the section. The portion of the girder end that is roughened with saw-toothed shear keys shown on the standard girder plans may be considered as a “surface intentionally roughened to an amplitude of 0.25 inches”. Shear resistance must be developed using interface shear theory assuming the longitudinal bars and the extended strands are actively participating. The main longitudinal deck slab reinforcement is already fully stressed by negative bending moments and thus cannot be considered for shear requirements. All bars, including the extended strands, must be properly anchored in order to be considered effective. This anchorage requirement must be clearly shown on the plans. Similar requirements exist for connecting the end diaphragm at bridge ends where the diaphragm is cast on the girders (girder End Type A). In this case, however, loads consist only of the factored diaphragm dead load, approach slab dead load, and those wheel loads which can distribute to the interface. Longitudinal reinforcement provided at girder ends shall be identical in both ends of the girder for construction simplicity. The program PGSuper does not check interface shear friction at girder ends. Standard girder plan details are adequate for girder End Types A and B. Standard girder plan details shall be checked for adequacy for girder End Types C and D.

Shear and Torsion
The design for shear and torsion is based on ACI 318-02 Building Code4 Requirements for Structural Concrete and Commentary (318F‑02) and is satisfactory for bridge members with dimensions similar to those normally used in buildings. AASHTO LRFD Section 5.7.3.6 may also be used for design. According to Hsu5, utilizing ACI 318-02 is awkward and overly conservative when applied to large-size hollow members. Collins and Mitchell6 propose a rational design method for shear and torsion based on the compression field theory or strut-and-tie method for both prestressed and non-prestressed concrete beams. These methods assume that diagonal compressive stresses can be transmitted through cracked concrete. Also, shear stresses are transmitted from one face of the crack to the other by a combination of aggregate interlock and dowel action of the stirrups. E

Strut-and-Tie Model Strut-and-tie models shall be used near regions of discontinuity or where beam theory is not applicable. Design and detailing considerations for strut-and-tie modeling is covered in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.8.2. See Appendix 5-B for a strut-and-tie design example for a pier cap.

Deflection and Camber 5.2.4.A
General
Flexural members are designed to have adequate stiffness to limit deflections or any deformations which may adversely affect the strength or serviceability of the structure at service load plus impact. The minimum superstructure depths are specified in AASHTO LRFD Table 2.5.2.6.3-1 and deflections shall be computed in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.6.3.5.2. Accurate predictions of deflections are difficult to determine, since modulus of elasticity of concrete, Ec, varies with stress and age of concrete. Also, the effects of creep on deflections are difficult to estimate. For practical purposes, an accuracy of 10 to 20 percent is often sufficient. Prestressing can be used advantageously to control deflections; however, there are cases where excessive camber due to prestress has caused problems. 5.2.4.B
Deflection Calculation for Prestressed Concrete Girders
The “D” dimension is the computed girder deflection at midspan (positive upward) immediately prior to deck slab placement. Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25)K defines two levels of girder camber at the time the deck concrete is placed, denoted D @ 40 Days and D @ 120 Days. They shall be shown in the plans to provide the contractor with lower and upper bounds of camber that can be anticipated in the
