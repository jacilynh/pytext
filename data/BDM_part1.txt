Engineering and Regional Operations Bridge and Structures Office
Foreword This manual has been prepared to provide Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) bridge design engineers with a guide to the design criteria, analysis methods, and detailing procedures for the preparation of highway bridge and structure construction plans, specifications, and estimates. It is not intended to be a textbook on structural engineering. It is a guide to acceptable WSDOT practice. This manual does not cover all conceivable problems that may arise, but is intended to be sufficiently comprehensive to along with sound engineering judgment, provide a safe guide for bridge engineering. A thorough knowledge of the contents of this manual is essential for a high degree of efficiency in the engineering of WSDOT highway structures. This loose leaf form of this manual facilitates modifications and additions. New provisions and revisions will be issued from time to time to keep this guide current. Suggestions for improvement and updating the manual are always welcome. All manual modifications shall be approved by the Bridge Design Engineer. The Federal Highway Administration has agreed to approve designs that follow the guidance in the Bridge Design Manual; therefore, following the guidance is mandatory for state highway projects. When proposed designs meet the requirements contained in the Bridge Design Manual, little additional documentation is required. The electronic version of this document is available at: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/manusl/m23-50.htm

Manual Description
1.1.1
Purpose The Bridge Design Manual (BDM) M 23-50 sets the standard for bridge and structure designs within the Washington State Department of Transportation’s (WSDOT) right of way. This manual outlines WSDOT design details and methods, incorporating standard practices that are based on years of experience. The BDM also identifies where WSDOT standard of practices differ from the AASHTO specifications. The design details and design methods of the BDM shall be used in the development of any bridge or structure project within the WSDOT right of way. Adherence to the BDM is expected for all bridge or structural projects that are located within the WSDOT right of way. The Bridge Design Manual is a dynamic document, which constantly changes because of the creativity and innovative skills of our bridge designers and structural detailers. It is not intended for the design of unusual structures or to inhibit the designer in the exercise of engineering judgment. The information, guidance, and references contained herein are not intended as a substitute for experience, sound engineering judgment, and common sense. 1.1.1.A
Use of Bridge Design Manual on Design-Build and Progressive Design-Build Projects
When a reference is made to “Bridge Design Manual” or “BDM” in the Design-Build Contract or Mandatory Standards, the Design-Builder shall proceed as follows:
• Refer first to Bridge Design Manual Chapter 15 “Structural Design Requirements for Design-Build Contracts”. All requirements in Bridge Design Manual Chapter 15 are Contract requirements.
• If the Design-Build Contract or a Mandatory Standard references a specific section of the Bridge Design Manual, the Design-Builder shall review the applicable portions of Bridge Design Manual Chapter 15. If there are discrepancies between Bridge Design Manual Chapter 15 and the specific section reference, Chapter 15 shall have contractual precedence.
• All other portions of Chapters 1-14 of the Bridge Design Manual shall be considered a Reference Document.
1.1.2
Specifications This manual and the current editions of the following AASHTO Specifications are the basic documents used to design highway bridges and structures in Washington State:
• AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications (LRFD-BDS)
• AASHTO Guide Specifications for LRFD Seismic Bridge Design (LRFD-SGS) The Bridge Design Manual is not intended to duplicate the AASHTO Specifications. This manual supplements the AASHTO Specifications by providing additional direction, design aides, examples, and information on office practice. The Bridge Design Manual takes precedence where conflict exists with the AASHTO Specifications. The WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer will provide guidance as necessary.

1.3.2.A.1
Design Team
The design team usually consists of the Designer(s), Checker(s), Structural Detailer(s), Bridge & Structures Architect, and a Specification and Estimate Engineer, who are responsible for preparing a set of contract documents on or before the scheduled due date(s) and within the budget allocated for the project. On large projects, the Design Unit Manager may designate a designer to be a Project Coordinator with additional duties, such as: assisting the Design Unit Manager in communicating with the Region, coordinating and communicating with the Geotechnical Branch, and monitoring the activities of the design team. In general, it is a good practice to have some experienced designers on every design team. All design team members should have the opportunity to provide input to maximize the quality of the design plans. 1.3.2.A.2
Designer Responsibility
The designer is responsible for the content of the contract plan sheets, including structural analysis, completeness and correctness. A good set of example plans, which is representative of the bridge type, is indispensable as an aid to less experienced designers and detailers. During the design phase of a project, the designer will need to communicate frequently with the Design Unit Manager and other stakeholders. This includes acquiring, finalizing or revising roadway geometrics, soil reports, hydraulics recommendations, and utility requirements. Constructability issues may also require that the designer communicate with the Region or Construction Office. The designer may have to organize face-to-face meetings to resolve constructability issues early in the design phase. The bridge plans must be coordinated with the PS&E packages produced concurrently by the Region. The designer shall advise the Design Unit Manager as soon as possible of any scope and project cost increases and the reasons for the increases. The Design Unit Manager will then notify the Region project office if the delivery schedule will have to be changed. If Region concurs with a change in the delivery date, the Design Unit Manager shall notify the Bridge Scheduling Engineer of the revised delivery dates. The designer or Project Coordinator is responsible for project planning and development which involves the following: 1.
Determines scope of work, identifies tasks and plans order of work.
2.
Prepare design criteria that are included in the front of the design calculations. Compares tasks with BDM office practice and AASHTO Bridge Design Specifications. A. Insures that design guidelines are sufficient.

iii. Coordinate all final changes, including review comments received from the Bridge Specifications and Estimates Engineer. iv. Meet with Region design staff and other project stakeholders at the constructability review/round table review meetings to address final project coordination issues. The designer should inform the Design Unit Manager of any areas of the design, which should receive special attention during checking and review. The design and check calculations are prepared by the designer and checker in accordance with Section 1.3.3 and become a very important record document. Design calculations will be a reference document during the construction of the structure and throughout the life of the structure. It is critical that the design calculations be user friendly. The design calculations shall be well organized, clear, properly referenced, and include numbered pages along with a table of contents. The design and check calculation shall be assembled and archived in accordance with Section 1.3.3 and Section 1.3.8. The PDF calculations files shall be stamped, signed, and dated by a registered professional Engineer in the State of Washington. Computer data files shall be saved for use during construction, in the event that changed conditions arise. The designer is also responsible for providing construction support and may be assigned to serve as a Bridge Technical Advisor. See BDM Section 1.3.6. The designer and Bridge Technical Advisor (BTA) shall review as-builts for accuracy prior to the Project Engineer submitting them to HQ Engineering Records in accordance with BDM Section 1.3.6.B.3.

Consultant PS&E — Projects on County and City Right of Way
Counties and cities frequently hire Consultants to design bridges. WSDOT Local Programs Office determines which projects are to be reviewed by the Bridge and Structures Office. WSDOT Local Programs Office sends the PS&E to the Bridge Project Support unit for assignment when a review is required. The Bridge and Structures Office’s Consultant Liaison Engineer is not involved. A WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office Design Reviewer or Coordinator will be assigned to the project and will review the project as outlined for Consultant PS&E Projects on WSDOT Right of Way. Plans with the reviewers’ comments marked in red should be returned to the Bridge Project Support Unit. One set of plans will be returned to Local Programs Office. The first review should be made of the Preliminary Plan followed later by review of the PS&E and design calculations. Comments are treated as advisory, although major structural issues must be addressed and corrected. An engineer from the county, city, or consultant may contact the reviewer to discuss the comments. 1.3.2.D
Structural Engineering and Significant Structures
Structural engineering is recognized as a specialized branch of professional engineering. An engineer must be registered as a structural engineer in order to provide structural engineering services for significant structures (see RCW 18.43.040(1)(a)(iii) & (iv)). Structural Engineering license requirement for WSDOT bridges and structures shall meet the requirement of BDM Section 1.4.3 A-7. The practice of engineering is defined in RCW 18.43.020(5)(a). Structural engineering services for significant structures include but are not limited to practice of engineering on:
Page 1-16
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
General Information
Chapter 1
• Vertical and lateral load-resisting components of significant structures including but not limited to foundations, columns, walls, abutments, girders, beams, diaphragms, cross-bracing, floors, decks, bearings and expansion joints.
• Retaining walls and other structures adjacent to a significant structure, when the failure of the structure would affect the structural adequacy of the significant structure. Structural engineering services for significant structures do not include:
• Practice of engineering on other structural elements of significant structures including railings, barriers, approach slabs, utility supports, and supports for miscellaneous appurtenances such as signs and luminaires. The licensed structural engineer will be responsible for designing the vertical and lateral load resisting components of the significant structure to safely resist loads from these elements.
• Engineering services of other civil disciplines, including geotechnical and hydraulic engineering services.
• Creation of specifications and estimates Supervision of construction on significant structures for the purpose of assuring compliance with the contract requirements (see RCW 18.43.020(5)(a)) may be performed by a registered professional engineer who is not also a registered structural engineer if all changes requiring structural engineering services are referred to a registered structural engineer (WAC 196-27A-020(2)(f)).
1.3.3
Design/Check Calculation File 1.3.3.A
File Format and Naming
The official Design/Check Calculation File for a structure shall be in electronic PDF format and may consist of multiple PDF files. When a project consists of multiple structures, each structure shall have a unique Design/Check Calculation File. In special circumstances, the Bridge Archive Engineer may allow multiple minor structures to be combined into a single Design/Check Calculation File. The electronic PDF files that comprise the Design/Check Calculation File should be divided and organized in an orderly manner. A typical three-span girder highway overpass design calculation package is expected to consist of around one to five individual PDF files. File sizes should not exceed 50 MB for each PDF file. The Design/Check Calculation File created for the PS&E submittal will eventually be electronically archived as described in Section 1.3.8, and reasonable PDF file sizes will support future download/retrieval of archive documents. Judgment should be used to determine the lowest resolution image appropriate to legibly portray the information. For example, a 200 dpi scan may save disk space and provide reasonable clarity as compared to a 600 dpi image. The filename for each PDF file shall be rational and shall be clearly listed in the Index Sheets (or Table of Contents). Since the electronic archiving process will tag each PDF file with the contract number and Structure ID, the filenames need only be consistent with the naming and layout described in the Index Sheets. Example filenames:
• Volume 1.pdf, Volume 2.pdf, Volume 3.pdf, etc.
• SuperDesign.pdf, SuperCheck.pdf, SubDesign.pdf, SubCheck.pdf

WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 1-21
Chapter 1
General Information
If in doubt between “Make Corrections Noted” and “Revise and Resubmit”, check with the Design Unit Manager or Construction Support Engineer. An acceptable detail may be shown in red, in which case the Plans would be marked. “Make Corrections Noted”. Notify the Design Unit Manager and the Construction Support Engineer if problems are encountered which may cause a delay in the checking of the shop plans or completion of the contract. Typically, WSDOT administered contracts require reviews to be completed within 20 calendar days for Type 2 Working Drawings and 30 calendar days for Type 3 Working Drawings. The review time starts when the Project Engineer first receives the submittal from the Contractor and ends when the Contractor has received the submittal back from the Project Engineer. The Bridge Office does not have the entire review period to complete the review. Therefore, designers should give construction reviews high priority and complete reviews in a timely manner so costly construction delays are avoided. Time is also required for marking, mailing and other processing. It is the goal of the Bridge and Structures Office to return reviewed submittals back to the Project Engineer within 7 to 14 days of their receipt by the Bridge Office. When checking is completed, return all shop drawings to the Construction Support Unit when Bridge Construction Support is listed as a WSDOT Review Group in Figure 1-1 of the WSDOT Construction Manual. Return all other shop drawings directly to the Project Engineering Office, and cc the Construction Support Unit for email submittals. Include a list of any deviations from the Contract Plans that are structurally acceptable and a list of any disagreements with the Project Engineer’s comments (regardless of how minor they may be). Deviations from the Contract Plans may require engineering and a Change Order. Note that changes to the contract that are also practice of engineering will require a seal by a licensed professional in accordance with the WSDOT Construction Manual Section SS 1-04.4 Changes/ Responsibility of Licensed Professionals for Changes to Structural Engineered Drawings During Design-Bid-Build Construction Contracts. Under no circumstances should the reviewer mark on the shop plans that a change order is required or notify the Project Engineer that a change order is required. The authority for determining whether a change order is required rests with State Construction Engineer assigned to the project. 1.3.6.A.2

Quality Control/Quality Assurance/Quality Verification (QC/QA/ QV) Procedures
1.4.1
General The purpose of the QC/QA/QV procedure is to improve the quality of the structural designs and plans. The key element to the success of this process is effective communication between all parties. The objectives of the QC/QA/QV procedure are to:
• Design structures that improve public safety and meet state regulations.
• Design structures which meet the requirements of the Bridge Design Manual M 23-50, AASHTO LRFD Bridge Specifications, current structural engineering and architectural practices, and geometric criteria provided by the Region.
• Create contract documents that meet the customer’s needs, schedule, budget, and construction staging requirements.
• Maximize plan quality.
• Produce an organized and indexed set of design calculations with the criteria and assumptions included in the front after the index.
• Minimize structural and architectural design costs. The goals are listed in order of importance. If there is a conflict between goals, the more important goal takes precedence. The Design Unit Manager determines project assignments and the QC/QA/QV process to be used in preparation of the structural design. The intent of the QC/QA/QV process is to facilitate plan production efficiency and cost-effectiveness while assuring the structural integrity of the design and to maximize the quality of the structural contract documents. Professional Engineering license stamp is required for all proprietary buried structures as defined in BDM Section 8.3.3 with at least 2 feet of backfill on top of the structure and placed on spread footings or has a bottom slab. Deep foundations including shafts and piles shall be stamped by a Structural Engineer.

1.4.3.A.3
Checker Responsibility
The Checker is responsible to the Design Unit Manager for Quality Control of the structural design, which includes checking the design, plans, calculations and quantities to assure accuracy and constructability. The Design Unit Manager works with the Checker to establish the level of checking required. The checking procedure for assuring the quality of the design will vary from project to project. Following are some general checking guidelines: 1.
Job File Scan the job file for unconventional or project specific items relating to geometrics, hydraulics, geotechnical, environmental, etc.
2.
Design Calculations The design calculations may be checked by either of two methods: Design calculations may be checked with a line-by-line review and initialing by the Checker. If it is more efficient, the Checker may choose to perform his/her own independent calculations. Iterative design methods may be best checked by review of the Designer’s calculations, while standard and straight-forward designs may be most efficiently checked with independent calculations. The Designer and Checker calculations shall both be retained for archiving. Revision of design calculations, if required, is the responsibility of the Designer.
3.
Structural Plans The Checker’s plan review comments are recorded on a set of check prints, including details and bar lists, and returned to the Designer for consideration. These check prints are a vital part of the checking process, and shall be preserved. If the Checker’s comments are not incorporated, the Designer should provide justification for not doing so. If there is a difference of opinion that cannot be resolved between the Designer and Checker, the Design Unit Manager shall resolve any issues. Check prints shall be submitted to the Design Unit Manager at the time of 100 percent PS&E turn-in. If assigned by the Design Unit Manager, a structural detailer shall perform a complete check of the geometry using CADD or hand calculations. Revision of plans, if required, is the responsibility of the designer.
4.
Quantities and Barlist The Checker shall provide an independent set of quantity calculations. These together with the Designer’s quantity calculations shall be placed in the job file. Resolution of differences between the Designer and Checker shall be completed before the Bridge PS&E submittal. See Section 12.2.2 for procedures and requirements. The Checker shall also check the barlist.

1.6
General Information
Guidelines for Bridge Site Visits When conducting site visits, the design team shall conform to the safety requirements of WSDOT and the Contractor. WSDOT safety requirements are included in the Secretary of Transportation’s Executive Order E 1033, the WSDOT Safety Procedures and Guidelines Manual M 75-01 and other policy documents. Contractor safety requirements are included in the safety plan for the site (see Standard Specifications section 1-07.1 and the WSDOT Construction Manual Section SS 1-07.1). Personal protective equipment shall be used as appropriate. A pre-activity safety plan is required prior to any site visit. When visiting sites that are not under construction, it is recommended to consult Region personnel beforehand. They are typically familiar with the site and can provide escort and traffic control if necessary. Traffic control may require significant advance notice. In some cases, an in-depth inspection with experienced BPO inspectors is appropriate. The decision to perform an in-depth inspection should include the Design Unit Manager, Region, the State Bridge Design Engineer, and the State Bridge Preservation Engineer. It may be necessary to use inspection equipment such as BPO’s Under Bridge Inspection Trucks (UBIT) to access details and obtain measurements during a site visit. Advance planning and coordination with BPO and the Region project office will be necessary if inspection equipment is required because of BPO’s heavy workload and the need to provide traffic control well in advance of the site visit. When visiting construction sites, Region personnel shall be consulted beforehand. They will be familiar with the safety plan for the site and will be able to educate the design team on the safety plan. They will also be able to provide escort and arrange for traffic control if necessary.
1.6.1
Existing Structure Modifications It is critical that the design team know as much as possible about the existing structure. Recent inspection reports, prepared by inspectors from the Bridge Preservation Office (BPO), contain useful information on the condition of existing structures. The inspection reports, as well as as-built plans, are available on the Intranet through Bridge Engineering Information System (BEIST). As-built plans are also available from the Regions through the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) Portal. The WSDOT Maintenance Operations Division documents maintenance work on existing structures in the MPET and HATS systems, which can be another source of information for the design team. As-built plans, inspection documentation and maintenance documentation are helpful, but may not necessarily be accurate or complete. Site visits are recommended when modifying existing bridges. However, if there is any doubt about the adequacy of the available information or concern about accelerated deterioration of the structural elements, a site visit is required. Region personnel or others may perform the site visit to obtain the information needed to detail existing conditions, especially for remote or difficult to access locations.
Page 1-40
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
General Information
Chapter 1
Site visits are especially important for expansion joint rehabilitation projects. On many recent expansion joint rehabilitation projects, field conditions during construction have not matched as-built and contract plan details. This can cause large impacts in construction since new steel joint components are typically prefabricated and typically must be installed in a short time frame or closure. Consideration should be given to exposing portions of existing expansion joints to confirm as-built or plan details either during design or by the Contractor during construction. When done by the Contractor:
• The plans should include new expansion joint details based upon the information available to the design team
• Adequate time should be given in the Contract between the investigation and the installation of the new joint assembly (typically at least four weeks) to allow for possible redesign and fabrication
• A materials procurement suspension should be considered.
1.6.2
New Structures Generally, photographs and site data from the Region are adequate for most new structure designs. However, if the new structure is a replacement for an existing structure, a site visit is recommended, particularly if the project requires staged removal of the existing structure and/or staged construction of the new structure.
1.6.3
Structure Demolition If structure demolition is required as part of a project, a site visit is recommended for the design team to determine if there are unique site restrictions that could affect the demolition. If unique site restrictions are observed, they should be documented, included in the job file, and noted on the special provisions checklist.

Preliminary Studies Different levels of preliminary studies are discussed below. Not all are applicable to a specific project. Bridge and Structures Office should participate in all applicable studies. Reports from the studies should be filed for future reference.
2.1.1
Interdisciplinary Design Studies Region may set up an Interdisciplinary Design Team (IDT) to review the various design alternatives for major projects. The IDT is composed of members from Regions, HQ, outside agencies, and consulting firms. The members have different areas of expertise, contribute ideas, and participate in the selection of design alternatives. This work will often culminate in the publication of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Bridge designers may be asked to participate either as a support resource or as a member of the IDT.
2.1.2
Value Engineering Studies Value Engineering (VE) is a review process and analysis of a design project. The VE team seeks to define the most cost-effective means of satisfying the basic function(s) of the project. Usually a VE study takes place before or during the time that the region is working on the design. Occasionally, a VE study examines a project with a completed PS&E. VE studies are normally required for projects with cost overruns. The VE team is headed by a facilitator and is composed of members with different areas of expertise from Regions, HQ, outside agencies, and consulting firms. The Team Facilitator will lead the team through the VE process. The team will review Region’s project as defined by the project’s design personnel. The VE team will determine the basic function(s) that are served by the project, brainstorm all possible alternatives to serve the same function(s), evaluate the alternatives for their effectiveness to meet the project’s basic functions, determine costs, and prioritize and recommend alternatives. The VE team will prepare a report and present their findings to the region. The Region is then required to investigate and address the VE team’s findings in the final design. Bridge designers may be asked to participate either as a support resource or as a member of the VE team. VE studies usually take place over a three to five day period. Engineers participating in VE studies, Cost-Risk Assessment (CRA) or Cost Estimate and Validation Process (CEVP) meetings shall call the S&E Engineers and double check all costs when providing cost estimates at VE studies and CRA meetings.

Preliminary Recommendations for Bridge Rehabilitation Projects When the Region starts a bridge rehabilitation project, they will submit a written memo requesting that the Bridge and Structures Office make preliminary project recommendations. The Bridge and Structures Office will review the as-built plans, load ratings, existing inspection and condition reports prepared by the Bridge Preservation Office (BPO), and schedule a site visit with Region and other stakeholders. Special inspection of certain portions of the structure may be included in the site visit or scheduled later with Region and BPO. The purpose of the inspections is to obtain more detailed information as to the bridge’s condition, to obtain dimensions and take photographs of details needed for the project recommendations. Following the site visit, the next steps are:
• Determine the load capacity of the existing bridge.
• Determine what type of rehabilitation work is needed and time frame required to accomplish the work.
• Determine any special construction staging requirements. Can the bridge be totally shut down for the rehabilitation period? How many lanes will need to be open? Can the work be accomplished during night closures or weekend closures?
• Develop various alternatives and cost estimates for comparison, ranging from “do nothing” to “new replacement”.
• Determine what the remaining life expectancies are for the various rehabilitation alternatives.
• Determine the cost of a new replacement bridge. If the cost for the rehabilitation is equal or greater than 60 percent of a new replacement bridge, a new replacement bridge is recommended. The Bridge and Structures Office will provide Region with a written report with background information. The Region will be given an opportunity to review the draft report and to provide input prior to finalization. The Bridge Project Support Engineer and Specifications & Estimates Engineers (S&E) provide bridge scoping cost estimates to Regions for their use in determining budgets during Region's project definition phase. The S&E Engineers will check the Bridge Project Support Engineer's estimate as well as check each other.
2.1.4
Preliminary Recommendations for New Bridge Projects The Region will seek assistance from the Bridge and Structures Office when they are preparing a design project requiring new bridges. Similar to the procedures outlined above for rehabilitation projects. The Region will submit a written memo requesting that the bridge office make preliminary project recommendations. The Bridge and Structures Office will provide scope of work, cost estimate(s), and a summary of the preferred alternatives with recommendations. Face to face meetings with the Region project staff are recommended prior to sending a written memo. The Bridge Project Support Engineer and Specifications & Estimates Engineers provide bridge scoping cost estimates to Regions for their use in determining budgets during Region's project definition phase. The S&E Engineers will check the Bridge Project Support Engineer's estimate as well as check each other.

Type, Size, and Location (TS&L) Reports The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) requires that major or unusual bridges must have a Type, Size, and Location (TS&L) report prepared. The report will describe the project, proposed structure(s), cost estimates, other design alternatives considered, and recommendations. The report provides justification for the selection of the preferred alternative. A letter of approval by FHWA of the TS&L study is the basis for advancing the project to the design stage. The need for Type, Size, and Location (TS&L) report will be determined by the Bridge and Structures and WSDOT Project offices. The FHWA should be contacted as early as possible in the Project Development stage because the FHWA requires a TS&L study for tunnels, movable bridges, unusual structures, and major structures. Smaller bridges that are unusual or bridge projects for Local Agencies may also require a TS&L study. Other projects, such as long viaducts, may not. Check with the Bridge Project Support Engineer to see if a TS&L report is necessary. The preparation of the TS&L report is the responsibility of the Bridge and Structures Office. The TS&L cannot be submitted to FHWA until after the environmental documents have been submitted. However, TS&L preparation need not wait for environmental document approval, but may begin as soon as the bridge site data is available. See the Design Manual M 22-01 for the type of information required for a bridge site data submittal. 2.1.5.A
TS&L General
The designer should first review the project history in order to become familiar with the project. The environmental and design reports should be reviewed. The bridge site data should be checked so that additional data, maps, or drawings can be requested. A meeting with Region and a site visit should be arranged after reviewing the history of the project. The Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Services Branch must be contacted early in the TS&L process in order to have foundation information. Specific recommendations on the foundation type must be included in the TS&L report. The Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Services Branch will submit a detailed foundation report for inclusion as an appendix to the TS&L report. To determine the preferred structural alternative, the designer should: 1.
Develop a list of all feasible alternatives. At this stage, the range of alternatives should be kept wide open. Brainstorming with the Design Unit Managers and other engineers can provide new and innovative solutions.
2.
Eliminate the least desirable alternatives by applying the constraints of the project. Question and document the assumptions of any restrictions and constraints. There should be no more than four alternatives at the end of this step.
3.
Perform preliminary design calculations for unusual or unique structural problems to verify that the remaining alternatives are feasible.
4.
Compare the advantages, disadvantages, and costs of the remaining alternatives to determine the preferred alternative(s).
5.
Visit the project site with the Region, Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Services Branch, and HQ Hydraulics staff.

Preliminary Design
FHWA expects specific information on scour and backwater elevations for the permanent bridge piers, as well as, for any temporary falsework bents placed in the waterway opening. After the piers have been located, a memo requesting a Hydraulics Report should be sent to the HQ Hydraulics Unit. The HQ Hydraulics Unit will submit a report for inclusion as an appendix to the TS&L report. The State Bridge and Structures Architect should be consulted early in the TS&L study period. “Notes to the File” should be made documenting the aesthetic requirements and recommendations of the State Bridge and Structures Architect. Cost backup data is needed for any costs used in the TS&L study. FHWA expects TS&L costs to be based on estimated quantities. This cost data is to be included in an appendix to the TS&L report. The quantities should be compatible with the S&E Engineer’s cost breakdown method. The Specifications & Estimates Engineers will check the designer's estimated costs included in TS&L reports. In the case of consultant prepared TS&L reports, the designer shall have the S&E Engineers check the construction costs. 2.1.5.B
TS&L Outline
The TS&L report should describe the project, the proposed structure, and give reasons why the bridge type, size, and location were selected. 2.1.5.B.1
Cover, Title Sheet, and Index
These should identify the project, owner, location and the contents of the TS&L. 2.1.5.B.2
Photographs
There should be enough color photographs to provide the look and feel of the bridge site. The prints should be numbered and labeled and the location indicated on a diagram. 2.1.5.B.3
Introduction
The introduction describes the report, references, and other reports used to prepare the TS&L study. The following reports should be listed, if used.
• Design Reports and Supplements
• Environmental Reports
• Architectural Visual Assessment or Corridor Theme Reports
• Hydraulic Report
• Geotechnical Reports 2.1.5.B.4
Project Description
The TS&L report clearly defines the project. A vicinity map should be shown. Care should be taken to describe the project adequately but briefly. The project description summarizes the preferred alternative for the project design.

2.1.5.B.5
Design Criteria
The design criteria identify the AASHTO LRFD and AASHTO Guide Specifications that will be used in the bridge design. Sometimes other design criteria or special loadings are used. These criteria should be listed in the TS&L. Some examples in this category might be the temperature loading used for segmental bridges or areas defined as wetlands. 2.1.5.B.6
Structural Studies
The structural studies section documents how the proposed structure Type, Size, and Location were determined. The following considerations should be addressed.
• Aesthetics
• Cost estimates
• Geometric constraints
• Project staging and stage construction requirements
• Foundations
• Hydraulics
• Feasibility of construction
• Structural constraints
• Maintenance
This section should describe how each of these factors leads to the preferred alternative. Show how each constraint eliminated or supported the preferred alternatives. Here are some examples. “Prestressed concrete girders could not be used because environmental restrictions required that no permanent piers could be placed in the river. This requires a 230-foot clear span.” “Restrictions on falsework placement forced the use of self supporting precast concrete or steel girders.” 2.1.5.B.7
Executive Summary
The executive summary should be able to “stand alone” as a separate document. The project and structure descriptions should be given. Show the recommended alternative(s) with costs and include a summary of considerations used to select preferred alternatives or to eliminate other alternatives. 2.1.5.B.8
Drawings
Preliminary plan drawings of the recommended alternative are included in an appendix. The drawings show the plan, elevation, and typical section. For projects where alternative designs are specified as recommended alternatives, preliminary plan drawings for each of the different structure types shall be included. Supplemental drawings showing special features, such as complex piers, are often included to clearly define the project. 2.1.5.C
Reviews and Submittals
While writing the TS&L report, all major decisions should be discussed with the Design Unit Manager, who can decide if the State Bridge Design Engineer needs to be consulted. A peer review meeting with the State Bridge Design Engineer should be scheduled at the 50 percent completion stage. If applicable, the FHWA Bridge Engineer should be invited to provide input. The final report must be reviewed, approved, and the Preliminary Plan drawings signed by the State Bridge and Structures Architect, the Bridge Project Support Engineer, the State Bridge Design Engineer, and the State Bridge and Structures Engineer. The TS&L report is submitted with a cover letter to FHWA signed by the State Bridge and Structures Engineer.

Alternate Bridge Designs Bridge site conditions or current market conditions may justify the creation of alternate bridge designs. WSDOT has successfully used alternate bridge designs in the past to obtain best-value bridge design and construction solutions for specific locations. Alternate bridge designs may be considered when the following conditions can be satisfied:
• Construction cost estimates for the alternate designs should be comparable (within 10 percent). Cost estimates should include anticipated life-cycle costs (painting, maintenance, inspection). Periods of market uncertainty, with associated structure cost fluctuations, can provide further justification for alternate bridge designs.
• Region staff must approve the design expenditures for the preparation of alternate bridge designs, including preliminary plans, final bridge plans, specifications and construction cost estimates.
• WSDOT Bridge Office staffing levels and design schedules should allow for the preparation of alternate bridge designs.
• Variations in pier location may be required in order to optimize superstructure design for different alternates. Environmental constraints, geotechnical, hydraulic and scour conditions all need to allow for variations in pier location.
• Construction staging and traffic control must be determined for the alternates.
• Alternate bridge design concepts must be reviewed and approved by the Bridge and Structures Architect.

Preliminary Plan The Preliminary Plan preparation stage is the most important phase of bridge and buried structure design because it is the basis for the final design. The Preliminary Plan should completely define the bridge and buried structure geometry so the final roadway design by the Regions and the structural design by the Bridge and Structures Office can take place with minimal revisions.

Development of the Preliminary Plan 2.2.1.A
Process and Sequence of Development
2.2.1.A.1
Schedule
Development of the Preliminary Plan is the first milestone in the Structure design process. The Scope Of Work (SOW) agreement negotiated between the Region Design PEO and the Bridge and Structures Office at or shortly after the project kickoff establishes the deliverables (design submittals) to be produced and the due dates for the various deliverable review milestones for the specific project. The Structural Submittal Expectations Matrix at www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/ ProjectMgmt/DEM/Bridge.pdf outlines the expected content of the design submittal deliverables at specific stages of design development. 2.2.1.A.2
Structure Site Data
Structure Site Data is the background data and information developed by the Region Project Office and submitted to the Bridge and Structures Office for use in developing the Preliminary Plan. Development and content of Structure Site Data is defined by Chapter 710 of the WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01. Upon receipt by the Bridge and Structures Office, the Bridge Preliminary Plan Engineer and the Bridge Preliminary Plan Detailer in the Bridge Project Support Unit review the contents against the Structure Site Data checklist, Exhibit 710-01 of Design Manual Chapter 710, to ensure completeness of the submittal. Conformance with WSDOT CAD detailing protocol, especially geometric consistency, is also confirmed at this time. If inconsistencies or omissions are discovered, the Region Project Office is contacted to revise and supplement the Structure Site Data submittal as necessary. When the Structure Site Data is confirmed as complete, the development of the Preliminary Plan begins. 2.2.1.A.3
Preliminary Plan Design Assignment
Development of the Preliminary Plan within the Bridge and Structures Office generally occurs in two different ways. The primary approach as project schedules allow, is for the Preliminary Plan to be developed by designers and detailers within the Bridge Project Support Unit. An alternative approach is for the Preliminary Plan to be developed by designers and detailers within one of the Bridge Office Structural Design Units under the review guidance of the Bridge Preliminary Plan Engineer and the Bridge Preliminary Plan Detailer in the Bridge Project Support Unit. The flowchart for alternative approach for the Preliminary Plan preparation is shown in Appendix 1.2-A1: Bridge & Structures Design Office Workflow. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Preliminary Plan Development
Preliminary Plan development includes initial steps outlined in Sections 2.2.1.B through 2.2.1.G, further development under Section 2.2.3 and Section 2.2.4, and the review, submittal, and approval process outlined in Section 2.2.6. The development steps of Sections 2.2.1.B through 2.2.1.G and Section 2.2.3 lead to selection of a preferred Structure Alternative for structure type, configuration, and orientation. Through this process, the CAD details of plan, elevation, cross sections, and other pertinent details are developed to sufficient completeness and consistency to bring the Preliminary Plan to the Initial Internal Review milestone. 2.2.1.A.5
Initial Internal Review
Once the Preliminary Plan is developed and detailed to the point of presenting a complete concept solution, including an initial set of Notes To The Region questions, the plan is ready for circulation for an initial internal review. At this point, the preliminary plan designer circulates a PDF file of the Preliminary Plan to the following:
• Region Project Office, including Designer(s), Team Leader, and Project Engineer and any other actively involved Project Office management staff
• The Chief Foundation Engineer of the Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Division, or the Geotechnical Engineer assigned to the project, if assigned at that time
• The State Hydraulics Engineer
• The State Bridge and Structures Architect - see Section 2.2.6.A
• The appropriate Bridge and Structures Office structure design specialist for the structure material type - Steel Specialist for steel bridges, Concrete Specialist for concrete bridges and buried structures - see Section 2.2.6.A.
• The Bridge Project Support Unit Manager
• The Structure Design Unit Manager assigned to design the structure
• The designer in the Structure Design Unit assigned to lead the design (if assigned at that time)
• The State Bridge Design Engineer
• The Coast Guard Liaison Engineer when the bridge requires a US Coast Guard permit for navigation opening and clearance.
• The checker assigned to review the project - either another designer in the Bridge Project Support Unit or, in the case of a Preliminary Plan prepared in a Bridge Office Structural Design Unit, the Bridge Preliminary Plan Engineer in the Bridge Project Support Unit The deadline for return of review comments is specified in the distribution email. The review period is conventionally two-weeks, but this may be adjusted as appropriate to account for holidays, project schedule status, and complexity of the project. Comments are reviewed and addressed as they are received. If comments received are significant enough to trigger changes in structure type, configuration, and orientation, there may be additional internal reviews at the discretion of the Bridge Preliminary Plan Engineer.

2.2.1.A.6
Request for Geotechnical and Hydraulics Information
Coincident with the initial internal review distribution, the Request for Geotechnical & Hydraulics Information for Bridge Preliminary Plan form (Appendix 2.2.A-5) is completed and distributed to the (1) the Chief Foundation Engineer or the Geotechnical Engineer assigned to the project, and, for waterway crossings (2) the State Hydraulics Engineer. The Preliminary Plan designer completes the project name and location, and the survey line stations defining the structure limits. The geotechnical and hydraulic contacts are responsible to complete the tabular data in the form. The return of a completed form shall coincide with the end of the initial internal review. The hydraulics information generated by this request pertains to how hydrology affects geotechnical aspects of the foundation design (scour and channel migration). This information is supplemental to the stream flow data provided with the Structure Site Data. 2.2.1.A.7
Cost Estimate
Once consensus is reached on the structure type, configuration, and orientation through the internal review process, and the Request for Geotechnical & Hydraulics Information form is completed and returned, the Preliminary Plan with the completed geotechnical and hydraulics Information form is presented to the Bridge Project Support Engineer, or designee, for preparation of the preliminary cost estimate. See Section 2.2.5. 2.2.1.A.8
Distribution for Preliminary Plan Approval
With the completion of the cost estimate, the Preliminary Plan is ready for distribution to the Region for approval. See Section 2.2.6.B and Section 2.2.6.C. 2.2.1.A.9
Distribution of Final Preliminary Plan
When consensus is reached with Region signature approval on the Preliminary Plan as distributed in accordance with Section 2.2.6.B and Section 2.2.6.C, the Preliminary Plan is ready for final distribution, to officially conclude the Preliminary Plan process and fully transfer design responsibility for the project to the Bridge Structural Design Unit. The distribution list for the Final Preliminary Plan remains the same as specified in Section 2.2.6.B. 2.2.1.B
Responsibilities
In general, the responsibilities of the designer, checker, detailer, and Design Unit Manager are described in Section 1.2.2. The Preliminary Plan designer as defined in Section 2.2.1.A.3 is responsible for developing a Preliminary Plan for the bridge or buried structure. The Preliminary Plan must be compatible with the geometric, aesthetic, staging, geotechnical, hydraulic, and structural requirements and conditions at the bridge site as presented by the Structure Site Data. The Structural Design Unit Manager shall be kept informed of progress on the Preliminary Plan so that the schedule can be monitored. If problems develop, the Structural Design Unit Manager can request adjustments to the schedule or allocate additional manpower to meet the schedule.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Chapter 2
Preliminary Design
The Preliminary Plan designer keeps the job file up-to-date by documenting all conversations, meetings, requests, questions, and approvals concerning the project. Notes-to-the-designer, and details not shown in the preliminary plan shall be documented in the job file. The checker, as defined in Section 2-2.1.A.5, shall provide an independent review of the plan, verifying that it is in compliance with the Structure Site Data as provided by the Region and as corrected in the job file. The plan shall be compared against the Preliminary Plan checklist (see Appendix 2.2-A4) to ensure that all necessary information is shown. The checker reviews the plan for consistency with office design practice, detailing practice, and for constructability. The Preliminary Plan shall be detailed using current office CAD equipment and software. 2.2.1.C
Site Reconnaissance
The Structure Site Data submitted by the Region will include photographs, and in some cases a video, of the site. Even for minor projects, this may not be enough information for the designer to work from to develop a Preliminary Plan. For most bridge projects, site visits are necessary. Site visits with Region project staff and other project stakeholders, such as, Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Division, HQ Hydraulics Office, and Region Design PEO should be arranged through the Bridge Project Support Unit Manager. 2.2.1.D
Coordination
The designer is responsible for coordinating the design and review process throughout the project. This includes seeking input from various WSDOT Offices and outside agencies. The designer should consult with Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Division, HQ Hydraulics Office, Bridge Preservation Office, and Region design and maintenance, and other resources for their input. One aspect of coordination with the Region Design PEO is review of the Not Included In Bridge Quantities List (NIBQ), DOT Form 230-038 - see Appendix 12.1-A1. The NIBQ itemizes elements shown in the Preliminary Plan that are not related to the structural design, but rather are of civil design context and as such are the design responsibility of the Region. Creation of the NIBQ helps to ensure that responsibility for all elements identified in the Preliminary Plan is clearly assigned and understood. 2.2.1.E
Consideration of Alternatives
In the process of developing the Preliminary Plan, the designer brainstorms, develops, and evaluates various design alternatives. See Section 2.2.3 General Factors for Consideration and how they apply to a particular site. See also Section 2.1.5A. Preliminary design calculations shall be done to verify feasibility of girder span and spacing, falsework span capacity, geometry issues, and construction clearances. Generally, the number of alternatives is usually limited to only an obvious few for most projects. For some smaller projects and most major projects, design alternatives merit development and close evaluation.

Designer Recommendation
After a thorough analysis of the needs and limitations of the site, studying all information, and developing and evaluating the design alternatives for the project, the designer selects the preferred alternative, and places justification of the selection in the job file. At this stage, the designer should discuss the recommendation with the Bridge Project Support Unit Manager. 2.2.1.G
Concept Approval
For some projects, the presentation, in “F” above, to the Bridge Project Support Unit Manager satisfies the need for concept approval. Large complex projects, projects of unique design, or projects where two or more alternatives appear viable, should be presented to the Bridge Project Support Unit Manager, the Structure Design Unit Manager assigned to design the project and the designer, if assigned at that time, and State Bridge Design Engineer for concurrence before Preliminary Plan development is completed. 2.2.1.H
Consideration for Accelerated Bridge Construction
In the process of developing the Preliminary Plan, the designer develops, and evaluates to possibility of accelerated bridge construction (ABC). Preliminary design calculations shall be done to verify feasibility of ABC for some projects with consultation with the Region Development Engineer and Project office.
2.2.2
Documentation 2.2.2.A
Job File
An official job file is created by the Bridge Preliminary Plan Detailer in the Bridge Project Support Unit when a Structure Site Data submittal is received by the Bridge and Structures Office from the Region Project Office. This job file serves as a depository for all communications and resource information for the job. Scheduling and time estimates are kept in this file, as well as cost estimates, preliminary quantities, and documentation of all approvals. Records of important telephone conversations and copies of e-mails approving decisions are also kept in the job file. After completing the Preliminary Plan, the job file continues to serve as a depository for useful communications and documentation for all pertinent project related information and decisions during the design process through and including preparation of the Final Bridge PS&E. 2.2.2.B
Structure Site Data
All Preliminary Plans are developed from Structure Site Data submitted by the Region Project Office. This submittal consists of a document describing the project with a bullet list itemization of the Structure Site Data components, forms, files, and data that are also attached to or linked by the email transmittal. See WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01 Chapter 710 and Exhibit 710-01. See also Section 2.2.1.A.2 and Appendices 2.2-A1, 2.2-A2, and 2.2-A3.

Design Report or Design Summary and Value Engineering Studies
Some bridge and buried structure projects have a Design File Report or Design Summary prepared by the Region. This is a document, which includes design considerations and conclusions reached in the development of the project. It defines the scope of work for the project. It serves to document the design standards and applicable deviations for the roadway alignment and geometry. It is also an excellent reference for project history, safety and traffic data, environmental concerns, and other information. If a VE study was done on the project, the report will identify alternatives that have been studied and why the recommended alternative was chosen. 2.2.2.D

Permits 2.2.4.A
Coast Guard Waterway Jurisdiction and Navigation Permits for New Construction
For all waterway crossings, the US Coast Guard shall be contacted for determination and confirmation of waterway jurisdiction and any associated permit requirements or categorical assignment. When the structure length parallel to the roadway centerline is less than 20-feet, this action is the responsibility of the Region, whether by the Region Design Project Office or the associated Region Environmental Services Office (ESO). When the structure length parallel to the roadway centerline is 20-feet or greater, this action is the responsibility of either the Region ESO, ideally as part of the project scoping phase, or the Bridge and Structures Office as part of the preliminary plan process. Based on the response provided by the US Coast Guard, whether through the Region or through the Coast Guard Liaison Engineer, the preliminary plan identifies the waterway jurisdiction status in the left margin of the plan. The USCG block specifies whether the USCG has jurisdiction or not, along with the date that the USCG made the determination, and indicates whether a USCG navigation permit is required. When the response received from the US Coast Guard indicates that a navigation permit Is required, the Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for coordinating and applying for this permit, in accordance with Design Manual M 22.01 Section 710.03. The Coast Guard Liaison Engineer in the Bridge Project Support Unit of the Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for this. See the Design Manual M 22-01, chapter covering Environmental Permits and Approvals, or the Environmental Manual Chapter 500 for general permitting information. Section 9 Permit – Bridge Work in Navigable Waters can be found on the WSDOT Federal Environmental Permits and Approval web page, www.wsdot.wa.gov/environment/ technical/permits-approvals/other-aquatic-resource-permits. Permitting procedures are available on the WSDOT Environmental Permitting tools and help page, www.wsdot. wa.gov/environment/technical/permits-approvals. The work on developing the permit application should be started early in the preliminary plan process so that it is ready to be sent to the US Coast Guard at least eight months prior to the project ad date. The Coast Guard Liaison Engineer should be included in all distributions of the Preliminary Plan as outlined in Sections 2.2.1.A.5, 2.2.1.A.8, and 2.2.1.A.9. The Coast Guard Liaison Engineer uses these Preliminary Plans to develop the Coast Guard Application plan sheets, which become part of the permit.

Coast Guard Temporary Regulation Adjustments for Construction Operations at Existing Structures
Existing bridges crossing navigable waters occasionally require construction or maintenance activities that impact navigation channels governed by USCG permits. For fixed span bridges, this may include construction or maintenance activities that infringe upon the horizontal and vertical navigation opening defined in the USCG permit. For movable bridges, in addition to the above, this may also include adjustments to existing bridge opening operating regulations. Such temporary adjustments require coordination with the US Coast Guard, and the primary responsibility for this contact and coordination lies with the Region Design Project Office. The scope of such coordination varies depending on the extent of the infringement into the defined horizontal or vertical navigation clearance opening, the extent of the change to the bridge operation regulation, and the duration of the construction or maintenance activity. This coordination activity may require the Design Project Office to conduct a survey of waterway users or to perform other background information tasks requested by the US Coast Guard. Projects with more extensive impacts may lie outside the approval authority of the local USCG Commander and may require review and action by US Coast Guard HQ in Washington, DC. In all cases, the earlier in the design process that the Region Design Project Office initiates these coordination efforts, the more likely the USCG can complete their regulatory process without impacting the project schedule. 2.2.4.C
Other
All other permits will be the responsibility of the Region (see the Design Manual M 22-01). The Bridge and Structures Office may be asked to provide information to the Region to assist them in making applications for these permits.
2.2.5
Preliminary Cost Estimate A preliminary cost estimate is developed when the bridge type, foundation type, deck area and adjacent retaining walls are confirmed. At the Preliminary Plan stage the cost estimate is based on square-foot costs taken from the Chapter 12 and adjusted for structure specifics. Consult with the Bridge Project Support Engineer or designee. The preliminary cost estimate is based on recent bidding history on similar structures, degree of difficulty of construction, inflation trends, and length of time until Ad Date, and time for completion of construction. It is considered accurate to within 15 percent, but should be accurate enough to preclude a surprise increase at the time of the Engineer’s estimate, which is based on completed design quantities. The preliminary cost estimate shall be updated frequently as changes are made to the Preliminary Plan or new data influences the costs. As the Preliminary Plan is developed through the Initial Internal Review stage of Section 2.2.1.A.5, but before sending to the Bridge Design Engineer for signature, the Preliminary Plan and completed Request For Geotechnical & Hydraulics Information form is submitted to the Bridge Project Support Engineer or designee. The information presented shall include the complete Preliminary Plan and all backup data previously prepared on costs for the structures (such as preliminary quantity calculations, preliminary foundation type selection, etc,). The Bridge Project Support Engineer or designee reviews the Preliminary
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Chapter 2
Preliminary Design
Plan, prepares, signs, and dates a cost estimate summary sheet, and returns the package to the designer. When the Preliminary Plan is presented to the State Bridge Design Engineer for signature (see Section 2.2.6.B), the submittal shall include the summary sheet prepared by the Bridge Project Support Engineer or designee. The summary sheet and backup data is then placed in the job file. Do not send the summary sheet to the Region. After submittal of the Preliminary Plan to the Region, the Region shall be notified immediately of any increases in the preliminary cost estimate during the structural design.
2.2.6
Approvals 2.2.6.A
State Bridge and Structures Architect/Specialists
For all preliminary plans, the State Bridge and Structures Architect and appropriate specialists should be aware and involved when the designer is first developing the plan. The State Bridge and Structures Architect and specialists should be given a print of the plan by the Preliminary Plan designer. This is concurrent with the checking of the Preliminary Plan. The State Bridge and Structures Architect and specialist reviews, approves, signs and dates the print. This signed print is placed in the job file. If there are any revisions, which affect the aesthetics of the approved preliminary plan, the State Bridge and Structures Architect should be asked to review and approve, by signature, a print showing the revisions, which change elements of aesthetic significance. For large, multiple bridge projects, the State Bridge and Structures Architect should be contacted for development of a coordinated architectural concept for the project corridor. The architectural concept for a project corridor is generally developed in draft form and reviewed with the project stakeholders prior to finalizing. When finalized, it should be signed by the Region Administrator or designee. Approval from the State Bridge and Structures Architect is required on all retaining walls and noise wall aesthetics including finishes and materials, and configuration. In order to achieve superstructure type optimization and detailing consistency, the following guidelines shall be used for the preparation of all Preliminary Plans:
• Preliminary Plans for all steel bridges and structures shall be reviewed by the Steel Specialist.
• Preliminary Plans for all concrete bridges and structures shall be reviewed by the Concrete Specialist.
• Detailing of all Preliminary Plans shall be reviewed by the Preliminary Plans Detailing Specialist. These individuals shall signify their approval by signing the Preliminary Plan in the Architect/Specialist block on the first plan sheet, together with the State Bridge and Structures Architect.

The Bridge Project Support Unit Manager signs the Preliminary Plan after it has been checked and approved by the Architect/Specialists. At this point, it is ready for review, approval, and signing by the State Bridge Design Engineer. After the State Bridge Design Engineer has signed the Preliminary Plan, it is returned to the designer. The designer places the original signed Preliminary Plan in the job file and enters the names of the signers in the signature block. A PDF File of this Preliminary Plan and a cover memorandum signed by the State Bridge Design Engineer or designee is then sent to Region through the Region Project Office by email for review and approval by the Approving Authority in the Region. The email includes the cover memorandum, the preliminary plan and the WSDOT Form 230-038 Not Included in Bridge Quantities List (NIBQ) and a brief explanation of the preliminary cost estimate. The cover memorandum is addressed to the Region Project Development Engineer/Engineering Manager or equivalent as the assigned Approving Authority.

The Region Project Office reviews the Preliminary Plan for compliance and agreement with the Structure Site Data. The Region Project Office answers any “Notes to the Region” that have been listed on the plan. When this review is complete, the Regional Project Development Engineer/Engineering Manager or equivalent position, or designee, signs the plan. The Region sends back a print of the signed plan with any comments noted in red (additions) and green (deletions) along with responses to the questions raised in the “Notes to the Region.”

Railroad
When a railroad is involved with a structure on a Preliminary Plan, the HQ RR Liaison Engineer of the Design Office must be involved during the plan preparation process. A copy of the Preliminary Plan is sent to the HQ RR Liaison Engineer, who then sends a copy to the railroad involved for their comments and approval. The railroad will respond with approval by letter to the HQ RR Liaison Engineer. A copy of this letter is then routed to the Bridge and Structures Office and then placed in the job file. For design plans prepared within the Bridge and Structures Office, the Design Unit Manager or lead designer will be responsible for coordinating and providing shoring plans for structures adjacent to railroads. It is recommended that the Construction Support Unit design, prepare, stamp, and sign shoring plans. However, the design unit may elect to design, prepare, stamp, and sign shoring plans. For consultant prepared design plans, the Design Unit Manager or lead reviewer will be responsible for coordinating and having the consultant design shoring plans for structures adjacent to railroads. The Construction Support Unit has design criteria and sample plan details which can be used by the design units and consultants. A Construction Support engineer is available to attend design project kick-off meetings if there is a need for railroad shoring plans or other constructability issues associated with the project. Regardless of who prepares the bridge plans, all shoring plans should be reviewed by the Construction Support Unit before they are submitted for railroad review and approval at the Constructability Review stage. At the Constructability Review stage or sooner if possible, especially for seismic retrofit project, the S&E Engineer will send copies of the layout, foundation plan, temporary shoring plans, and appropriate special provision section for structures adjacent to railroads to the HQ RR Liaison Engineer, who will submit this package to the appropriate railroad for review and approval. The shoring plans shall show the pressure loading diagram and calculations to expedite the railroad’s review and approval.

Preliminary Plan Criteria
2.3.1
Highway Crossings 2.3.1.A
General
A highway crossing is defined as a grade separation between two intersecting roadways. Naming convention varies slightly between mainline highway crossings and ramp highway crossings, but essentially, all bridges carry one highway, road, or street over the intersecting highway, road, or street. 2.3.1.A.1
Mainline Highway Crossings
Names for mainline highway crossings are defined by the route designation or name of state highway, county road, or city street being carried over another highway, road, or street. For example, a bridge included as part of an interchange involving I-205 and SR 14 and providing for passage of traffic on I-205 under SR 14 would be named SR 14 Over I-205 (followed by the bridge number). 2.3.1.A.2
Ramp Highway Crossings
Names for ramp highway crossings are defined by the state highway route numbers being connected, the directions of travel being connected, and the designation or name of the highway, road, or street being bridged. For example, a bridge in the Hewitt Avenue Interchange connecting traffic from westbound US 2 to northbound I-5 and passing over Everett Street would be named 2W-5N Ramp Over Everett Street (followed by the bridge number). A bridge connecting traffic from northbound I-5 to westbound SR 518 and passing over northbound I-405 and a ramp connecting southbound I-405 to northbound I-5 would be named 5N-518W Over 405N, 405S-5N (followed by the bridge number). 2.3.1.B
Bridge Width
The bridge roadway channelization (configuration of lanes and shoulders) is provided by the region with the Bridge Site Data. For state highways, the roadway geometrics are controlled by the Design Manual M 22-01. For city and county arterials, the roadway geometrics are controlled by Chapter 42 of the Local Agency Guidelines M 36-63. 2.3.1.C
Horizontal Clearances
Safety dictates that fixed objects be placed as far from the edge of the roadway as is economically feasible. Criteria for minimum horizontal clearances to bridge piers and retaining walls are outlined in the Design Manual M 22-01. The Design Manual M 22-01 outlines clear zone and recovery area requirements for horizontal clearances without guardrail or barrier being required. Actual horizontal clearances shall be shown in the plan view of the Preliminary Plan (to the nearest 0.1 foot). Minimum horizontal clearances to inclined columns or wall surfaces should be provided at the roadway surface and for a vertical distance of 6′ above the edge of pavement. When bridge end slopes fall within the recovery area, the minimum horizontal clearance should be provided for a vertical distance of 6′ above the fill surface. See Figure 2.3.1-1. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 2-19
Chapter 2
Preliminary Design
Bridge piers and abutments ideally should be placed such that the minimum clearances can be satisfied. However, if for structural or economic reasons, the best span arrangement requires a pier to be within clear zone or recovery area, and then guardrail or barrier can be used to mitigate the hazard. There are instances where it may not be possible to provide the minimum horizontal clearance even with guardrail or barrier. An example would be placement of a bridge pier in a narrow median. The required column size may be such that it would infringe on the shoulder of the roadway. In such cases, the barrier safety shape would be incorporated into the shape of the column. Barrier or guardrail would need to taper into the pier at a flare rate satisfying the criteria in the Design Manual M 22-01. See Figure 2.3.1-2. The reduced clearance to the pier would need to be approved by the Region. Horizontal clearances, reduced temporarily for construction, are covered in Section 2.3.9. Horizontal Clearance to Incline Piers

Vertical Clearances
The required minimum vertical clearances are established by the functional classification of the highway and the construction classification of the project. For state highways, this is as outlined in the Design Manual M 22-01. For city and county arterials, this is as outlined in Chapter IV of the Local Agency Guidelines M 36-63. Actual minimum vertical clearances are shown on the Preliminary Plan (to the nearest 0.1 foot). The approximate location of the minimum vertical clearance is noted in the upper left margin of the plan. For structures crossing divided highways, minimum vertical clearances for both directions are noted. 2.3.1.E
End Slopes
The type and rate of end slope used at bridge sites is dependent on several factors. Soil conditions and stability, right of way availability, fill height or depth of cut, roadway alignment and functional classification, and existing site conditions are important. The region should have made a preliminary determination based on these factors during the preparation of the bridge site data. The side slopes noted on the Roadway Section for the roadway should indicate the type and rate of end slope. The Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Services Branch will recommend the minimum rate of end slope. This should be compared to the rate recommended in the Roadway Section and to existing site conditions (if applicable). The types of end slopes and bridge slope protection are discussed in the Design Manual M 22-01. Examples of slope protection are shown in Standard Plans M 21-01 Section A. 2.3.1.F
Determination of Bridge Length
Establishing the location of the end piers for a highway crossing is a function of the profile grade of the overcrossing roadway, the superstructure depth, the minimum vertical and horizontal clearances required for the structure, the profile grade and channelization (including future widening) of the undercrossing roadway, and the type and rate of end slope used. For the general case of bridges in cut or fill slopes, the control point is where the cut or fill slope plane meets the bottom of roadside ditch or edge of shoulder as applicable. From this point, the fill or cut slope plane is established at the recommended rate up to where the slope plane intersects the grade of the roadway at the shoulder. Following the requirements of Standard Plans M 21-01 Section A, the back of pavement seat, end of wing wall or end of retaining wall can be established at 3′ behind the slope intersection. See Figure 2.3.1-3.

For the general case of bridges on wall type abutments or “closed” abutments, the controlling factors are the required horizontal clearance and the size of the abutment. This situation would most likely occur in an urban setting or where right of way or span length is limited. 2.3.1.G
Pedestrian Crossings
Pedestrian crossings follow the same format as highway crossings. Geometric criteria for bicycle and pedestrian facilities are established in the Design Manual M 22-01. Width and clearances would be as established there and as confirmed by region. Minimum vertical clearance over a roadway is given in the Design Manual M 22-01. Unique items to be addressed with pedestrian facilities include ADA requirements, the railing to be used, handrail requirements, overhead enclosure requirements, and profile grade requirements for ramps and stairs. 2.3.1.H
Bridge Redundancy
Design bridges to minimize the risk of catastrophic collapse by using redundant supporting elements (columns and girders). For substructure design use the following in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification Section 1.3.4.
• One column minimum for roadways 40′ wide and under.
• Two columns minimum for roadways over 40′ to 60′.
• Three columns minimum for roadways over 60′. Collision protection or design for collision loads for piers with one or two columns shall be provided. For superstructure design use:
• Three girders (webs) minimum for roadways 32′ and under.
• Four girders (webs) minimum for roadways over 32′. See Appendix 2.3-A2-1 for details. Note: Any deviation from the above guidelines shall have a written approval by the Bridge Design Engineer.

Railroad Crossings 2.3.2.A
General
A railroad crossing is defined as a grade separation between an intersecting highway and a railroad. Names for railroad crossings are defined either as railroad over state highway or state highway over railroad. For example, a bridge carrying BNSF railroad tracks over I-5 would be named BNSF Over I-5 (followed by the bridge number) A bridge carrying I-90 over Union Pacific railroad tracks would be named I-90 Over UPRR (followed by the bridge number). Requirements for highway/railway grade separations may involve negotiations with the railroad company concerning clearances, geometrics, utilities, and maintenance roads. The railroad’s review and approval will be based on the completed Preliminary Plan. 2.3.2.B
Criteria
The initial Preliminary Plan shall be prepared in accordance with the criteria of this section to apply uniformly to all railroads. Variance from these criteria will be negotiated with the railroad, when necessary, after a Preliminary Plan has been provided for their review. 2.3.2.C
Bridge Width
For highway over railway grade separations the provisions of Section 2.3.1 pertaining to bridge width of highway crossings shall apply. Details for railway over highway grade separations will depend on the specific project and the railroad involved. 2.3.2.D
Horizontal Clearances
For railway over highway grade separations, undercrossings, the provisions of Section 2.3.1 pertaining to horizontal clearances for highway crossings shall apply. However, because of the heavy live loading of railroad spans, it is advantageous to reduce the span lengths as much as possible. For railroad undercrossings skewed to the roadway, piers may be placed up to the outside edge of standard shoulders (or 8′ minimum) if certain conditions are met (known future roadway width requirements, structural requirements, satisfactory aesthetics, satisfactory sight distance, barrier protection requirements, etc.). For railroad overcrossings, minimum horizontal clearances are as noted below: Fill Section Cut Section
Railroad Alone 14′ 16′
Horizontal clearance shall be measured from the center of the outside track to the face of pier. When the track is on a curve, the minimum horizontal clearance shall be increased at the rate of 1½″ for each degree of curvature. An additional 8′ of clearance for off-track equipment shall only be provided when specifically requested by the railroad. The actual minimum horizontal clearances shall be shown in the Plan view of the Preliminary Plan (to the nearest 0.1 foot).

Crash Walls
Crash walls, when required, shall be designed to conform to the criteria of the AREMA Manual. To determine when crash walls are required, consult the following: Union Pacific Railroad “Guidelines for Design of Highway Separation Structures over Railroad (Overhead Grade Separation)” AREMA Manual Railroad Liaison Engineer the Railroad. 2.3.2.F
Vertical Clearances
For railway over highway grade separations, the provisions of Section 2.3.1 pertaining to vertical clearances of highway crossings shall apply. For highway over railway grade separations, the minimum vertical clearance shall satisfy the requirements of the Design Manual M 22-01. The actual minimum vertical clearances shall be shown on the Preliminary Plan (to the nearest 0.1 foot). The approximate location of the minimum vertical clearance is noted in the upper left margin of the plan. 2.3.2.G
Determination of Bridge Length
For railway over highway grade separations, the provisions of Section 2.3.1 pertaining to the determination of bridge length shall apply. For highway over railway grade separations, the minimum bridge length shall satisfy the minimum horizontal clearance requirements. The minimum bridge length shall generally satisfy the requirements of Figure 2.3.2-1. Figure 2.3.2-1

Special Considerations
For highway over railway grade separations, the top of footings for bridge piers or retaining walls adjacent to railroad tracks shall be 2′ or more below the elevation of the top of tie and shall not have less than 2′ of cover from the finished ground. The footing face shall not be closer than 10′ to the center of the track. Any cofferdams, footings, excavation, etc., encroaching within 10′ of the center of the track requires the approval of the railroad.

Construction Openings For railroad clearances, see Design Manual M 22-01. The minimum horizontal construction opening is 9′ to either side of the centerline of track. The minimum vertical construction opening is 23′-6″ above the top of rail at 6′ offset from the centerline of track. Falsework openings shall be checked to verify that enough space is available for falsework beams to span the required horizontal distances and still provide the minimum vertical falsework clearance. Minimum vertical openings of less than 23′-6″ shall be coordinated with the HQ Railroad Liaison Engineer.

Water Crossings 2.3.3.A
Bridge Width
The provisions of Section 2.3.1 pertaining to bridge width for highway crossings apply here. 2.3.3.B
Horizontal Clearances
Water crossings over navigable waters requiring clearance for navigation channels shall satisfy the horizontal clearances required by the Coast Guard. Communication with the Coast Guard will be handled through the Coast Guard Liaison Engineer. For bridges over navigable waters, the centerline of the navigation channel and the horizontal clearances (to the nearest 0.1 foot) to the piers or the pier protection shall be shown on the Plan view of the Preliminary Plan. Pier locations shall be reviewed by the HQ Hydraulics unit. 2.3.3.C
Vertical Clearances
Water crossings structures shall provide vertical clearance for both freeboard, maintenance, hydraulic and, where applicable, shall satisfy navigation clearance requirements. Bridges over navigable waters shall satisfy the vertical clearances required by the Coast Guard. Communication with the Coast Guard will be handled through the Coast Guard Liaison Engineer. The actual minimum vertical clearance (to the nearest 0.1 foot) for the channel span shall be shown on the Preliminary Plan. The approximate location of the minimum vertical clearance shall be noted in the upper left margin of the plan. The clearance shall be shown to the water surface as required by the Coast Guard criteria. Minimum vertical clearances for the 100-year design freeboard and Maintenance shall be determined and documented in accordance with the WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01 Section 720.03(5)(b)(4) for Water Crossing Structures. The roadway profile and the bridge superstructure depth shall accommodate all minimum vertical clearances provided. The actual minimum vertical clearance to the 100-year flood shall be shown (to the nearest 0.1 foot) on the Preliminary Plan, and the approximate location of the minimum vertical clearance shall be noted in the upper left margin of the plan.

2.3.3.D
End Slopes
The type and rate of end slopes for water crossings is similar to that for highway crossings. Soil conditions and stability, fill height, location of toe of fill, existing channel conditions, flood and scour potential, and environmental concerns are all important. As with highway crossings, the Region, and HQ Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Services Branch will make preliminary recommendations as to the type and rate of end slope. The State Hydraulics Branch will also review the Region’s recommendation for slope protection. 2.3.3.E
Determination of Bridge Length
Determining the overall length of a water crossing is not as simple and straightforward as for a highway crossing. Floodway requirements and environmental factors have a significant impact on where piers and fill can be placed. If a water crossing is required to satisfy floodway and environmental concerns, it will be known by the time the Preliminary Plan has been started. Environmental studies and the Design Report prepared by the region will document any restrictions on fill placement, pier arrangement, and overall floodway clearance. The Hydraulics Branch will need to review the size, shape, and alignment of all bridge piers in the floodway and the subsequent effect they will have on the base flood elevation. The overall bridge length may need to be increased depending on the span arrangement selected and the change in the flood backwater, or justification will need to be documented. 2.3.3.F
Scour and Stream Migration
The State Hydraulics Branch will indicate the anticipated depth of scour at the bridge piers. They will recommend pier shapes to best streamline flow and reduce the scour forces. They will also recommend measures to protect the piers from scour activity or accumulation of drift (use of deep foundations, minimum cover to top of footing, riprap, pier alignment to stream flow, closure walls between pier columns, etc.). The State Hydraulics Branch will indicate the likelihood and severity of stream migration at the bridge piers. Where lateral stream migration is a possibility, the design shall include a reliability based estimate of the effects on the structure. The design requirements for stream migration is shown in BDM Section 7.1.7. 2.3.3.G
Pier Protection
For bridges over navigable channels, piers adjacent to the channel may require pier protection such as fenders or pile dolphins. The Coast Guard will determine whether pier protection is required. This determination is based on the horizontal clearance provided for the navigation channel and the type of navigation traffic using the channel. 2.3.3.H
Construction Access and Time Restrictions
Water crossings will typically have some sort of construction restrictions associated with them. These must be considered during preliminary plan preparation. The time period that the Contractor will be allowed to do the work within the waterway may be restricted by regulations administered by various agencies. Depending on the time limitations, a bridge with fewer piers or faster pier construction may be more advantageous even if more expensive. Page 2-26
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Preliminary Design
Chapter 2
Contractor access to the water may also be restricted. Shore areas supporting certain plant species are sometimes classified as wetlands. A work trestle may be necessary in order to work in or gain access through such areas. Work trestles may also be necessary for bridge removal as well as new bridge construction. Work trestle feasibility, location, staging, deck area and approximate number of piles, and estimated cost need to be determined to inform the Region as part of the bridge preliminary plan. 2.3.3.I
2.3.4
Buried structures that qualify as a bridge per National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) shall be designed to meet above requirements for Water Crossings.
Bridge Widening 2.3.4.A
Bridge Width
The provisions of Section 2.3.1 pertaining to bridge width for highway crossings shall apply. In most cases, the width to be provided by the widening will be what is called for by the design standards, unless a deviation is approved. 2.3.4.B
Traffic Restrictions
Bridge widening involve traffic restrictions on the widened bridge and, if applicable, on the lanes below the bridge. The bridge site data submitted by the region should contain information regarding temporary lane widths and staging configurations. This information should be checked to be certain that the existing bridge width and the bridge roadway width during the intermediate construction stages of the bridge are sufficient for the lane widths, shy distances, temporary barriers, and construction room for the contractor. These temporary lane widths and shy distances are noted on the Preliminary Plan. The temporary lane widths and shy distances on the roadway beneath the bridge being widened should also be checked to ensure adequate clearance is available for any substructure construction. 2.3.4.C
Construction Sequence
A construction sequence shall be developed using the traffic restriction data in the bridge site data. The construction sequence shall take into account the necessary steps for construction of the bridge widening including both the substructure and superstructure. Placement of equipment is critical because of limited access and working space limitations. Space is required for cranes to construct shafts and erect the girders. Consult the Construction Support Unit for crane information, such as: boom angle, capacities, working loads, working radius, and crane footprint. Construction work off of and adjacent to the structure and the requirements of traffic flow on and below the structure shall be taken into account. Generally, cranes are not allowed to lift loads while supported from the existing structure. Checks shall be made to be certain that girder spacing, closure pours, and removal work are all compatible with the traffic arrangements. Projects with several bridges being widened at the same time should have sequencing that is compatible with the Region’s traffic plans during construction and that allow the Contractor room to work. It is important to meet with the Region project staff to assure that the construction staging and channelization of traffic during construction is feasible and minimizes impact to the traveling public.

2.3.6
Retaining Walls and Noise Walls The requirements for Preliminary Plans for retaining walls and noise walls are similar to the requirements for bridges. The plan and elevation views define the overall limits and the geometry of the wall. The section view will show general structural elements that are part of the wall and the surface finish of the wall face. The most common types of walls are outlined in Chapter 730 of the Design Manual M 22-01. The Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for all nonstandard walls (retaining walls and noise walls) as spelled out in the Design Manual M 22-01.
2.3.7
Bridge Deck Drainage The State Hydraulics Branch provides a review of the Preliminary Plan with respect to the requirements for bridge deck drainage. An 11″ x 17″ print shall be provided to the State Hydraulics Branch for their review as soon as the Preliminary Plan has been developed. The length and width of the structure, profile grade, superelevation diagram, and any other pertinent information (such as locations of drainage off the structure) should be shown on the plan. For work with existing structures, the locations of any and all bridge drains shall be noted. The State Hydraulics Branch or the Region Hydraulics staff will determine the type of drains necessary (if any), the location, and spacing requirements. They will furnish any details or modifications required for special drains or special situations. If low points of sag vertical curves or superelevation crossovers occur within the limits of the bridge, the region should be asked to revise their geometrics to place these features outside the limits of the bridge. If such revisions cannot be made, the Hydraulics Branch will provide details to handle drainage with bridge drains on the structure.

Bridge Deck Protection Systems An appropriate Bridge Deck Protection System shall be selected for each bridge in accordance with Section 5.7.4. The Preliminary Plan shall note in the lower left margin the type of Bridge Deck Protective System to be utilized on the bridge.
2.3.9
Construction Clearances Most projects involve construction in and around traffic. Both traffic and construction must be accommodated. Construction clearances and working room must be reviewed at the preliminary plan stage to verify bridge constructability. For construction clearances for roadways, the Region shall supply the necessary traffic staging information with the bridge site data. This includes temporary lane widths and shoulder or shy distances, allowable or necessary alignment shifts, and any special minimum vertical clearances. With this information, the designer can establish the falsework opening or construction opening. The horizontal dimension of the falsework or construction opening shall be measured normal to the alignment of the road which the falsework spans. The horizontal dimension of the falsework or construction opening shall be the sum of the temporary traffic lane widths and shoulder or shy distances, plus two 2′ widths for the temporary concrete barriers, plus additional 2′ shy distances behind the temporary barriers. For multi-span falsework openings, a minimum of 2′, and preferably 4′, shall be used for the interior support width. This interior support shall also have 2′ shy on both sides to the two 2-foot wide temporary concrete barriers that will flank the interior support. The minimum vertical clearance of the construction opening shall normally be 16′-6″ or as specified by the Region. The vertical space available for the falsework must be deep to accommodate the falsework stringers, camber strips, deck, and all deflections. If the necessary depth is greater than the space available, either the minimum vertical clearance for the falsework shall be reduced or the horizontal clearance and span for the falsework shall be reduced, or the profile grade of the structure shall be raised. Any of these alternatives shall be approved by the Region. Once the construction clearances have been determined the designer should meet with the region to review the construction clearances to ensure compatibility with the construction staging. This review should take place prior to finalizing the preliminary bridge plan. For railroads, see Section 2.3.2H.
2.3.10
Design Guides for Falsework Depth Requirements Where falsework is required to support construction of cast-in-place superstructure or segmental elements, the designer of the Preliminary Plan shall confirm with the Region the minimum construction opening. See Section 2.3.9 The bridge designer shall consult with the Construction Support Engineer on falsework depth requirements outlined below. Bridge designers shall evaluate falsework depth requirements based on the following guidelines:
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 2-29
Chapter 2
Preliminary Design
2.3.10.A
Falsework Spans < 36′ and No Skews
No evaluation is necessary. Provide for a minimum vertical clearance and a minimum falsework depth of 4′ to accommodate: W36X___ steel beam sections ¾″ camber strip ⅝″plywood 4 x 4 joists 6″ depth for segmental falsework release 2.3.10.B
Falsework Spans > 36′ or Spans with Skews or Limited Falsework Depth
While the falsework or construction openings are measured normal to the alignment which the falsework spans, the falsework span is measured parallel to the bridge alignment. The Preliminary Plan designer shall perform preliminary design of the falsework sufficiently to determine its geometric and structural feasibility. Shallow, heavy, closespaced wide-flange steel beams may be required to meet the span requirements within the available depth. The preliminary design shall be based on design guides in the Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(17). Beams shall be designed parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bridge. The falsework span deflection shall be limited according to the Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(17)B: generally span/360 for a single concrete placement, such as a slab, and span/500 for successive concrete placement forming a composite structure. This limits the stresses in the new structure from the construction and concrete placement sequences. Beam sizes shall be shown in the final plans (and in the Preliminary Plans as required) with the Contractor having the option of submitting an alternate design. The designer shall verify availability of the beam sizes shown in the plans. 2.3.10.C
Bridge Widening
For bridge widening where the available depth for the falsework is fixed, designers shall design falsework using shallower and heavier steel beams to fit within the available depth. Beam sizes and details shall be shown in the final plans (and in the Preliminary Plans as required) with the Contractor having the option of using an alternate design. The designer shall verify availability of the beam sizes shown in the plans. In some cases it may be appropriate to consider a shallower superstructure widening, but with similar stiffness, in order to accommodate the falsework and vertical clearance. 2.3.10.D
Bridge with Skews
Falsework beams shall be laid out and designed for spans parallel to the bridge centerline or perpendicular to the main axis of bending. The centerline of falsework beams shall be located within 2′ of the bridge girder stems and preferably directly under the stems or webs in accordance with the Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(17)E. Falsework beams placed normal to the skew or splayed complicate camber calculations and shall be avoided.

Inspection and Maintenance Access 2.3.11.A
General
FHWA mandates that bridges be inspected every 24 months. The BPO inspectors are required to access bridge components to within 3′ for visual inspection and to access bearings close enough to measure movement. Maintenance personnel need to access damaged members and locations that may collect debris. This is accomplished by using many methods. Safety cables, ladders, bucket trucks, Under Bridge Inspection Truck (UBIT), (see Figure 2.3.11-1), and under bridge travelers are just a few of the most common methods. Preliminary Plan designers need to be aware of these requirements and prepare designs that allow access for bridge inspectors and maintenance personnel throughout the Preliminary Plan and TS&L planning phases.

Preliminary Design
2.3.11.B
Safety Cables
Safety cables strung on steel plate girders or trusses allow for walking access. Care must be given to the application and location. Built-up plate girder bridges are detailed with a safety cable for inspectors walking the bottom flange. However, when the girders become more than 8′ deep, the inspection of the top flange and top lateral connections becomes difficult to access. It is not feasible for the inspectors to stand on the bottom flanges when the girders are less than 5′ deep. On large trusses, large gusset plates (3′ or more wide) are difficult to circumvent. Tie-off cables are best located on the interior side of the exterior girder of the bridge except at large gusset plates. At these locations, cables or lanyard anchors should be placed on the inside face of the truss so inspectors can utilize bottom lateral gusset plates to stand on while traversing around the main truss gusset plates. 2.3.11.C
Travelers
Under bridge travelers, placed on rails that remain permanently on the bridge, can be considered on large steel structures. This is an expensive option, but it should be evaluated for large bridges with high average daily traffic (ADT) because access to the bridge would be limited by traffic windows that specify when a lane can be closed. Some bridges are restricted to weekend UBIT inspection for this reason. 2.3.11.D
Abutment Slopes
Slopes in front of abutments shall provide enough overhead clearance to the bottom of the superstructure to access bearings for inspection and possible replacement (usually 3′ minimum). 2.3.11.E
Inspection Lighting and Access

• Inside clear height shall be 5 feet or greater to provide reasonable inspection access.
• Refer to Section 6.4.9 for design criteria.

Selection of Structure Type
2.4.1
Bridge Types The required superstructure depth is determined during the preliminary plan development process. The AASHTO LRFD Section 2.5.2.6.3 shows traditional minimum depths for constant depth superstructures. WSDOT has developed superstructure depth-to-span ratios based on past experience. The AASHTO LRFD Section 2.5.2.6.1, states that it is optional to check deflection criteria, except in a few specific cases. The WSDOT criteria is to check the live load deflection for all structures as specified in AASHTO LRFD Section 3.6.1.3.2 and 2.5.2.6.2. The superstructure depth is used to establish the vertical clearance that is available below the superstructure. For preliminary plans, the designer should use the more conservative depth determined from either the AASHTO LRFD criteria or the WSDOT criteria outlined below. In either case, the minimum depth includes the deck thickness. For both simple and continuous spans, the span length is the horizontal distance between centerlines of bearings. Refer to Section 2.3.11 for inspection and maintenance access requirements. Superstructure depth may be influenced when inspection lighting and access is required for certain bridge types. The superstructure depth may be refined during the final design phase. It is assumed that any refinement will result in a reduced superstructure depth so the vertical clearance is not reduced from that shown in the preliminary plan. However, when profile grade limitations restrict superstructure depth, the preliminary plan designer shall investigate and/or work with the structural designer to determine a superstructure type and depth that will fit the requirements. 2.4.1.A

This type of super structure is not recommended for new bridges. It could only be used for bridge widening and bridges with tight curvature or unusual geometry. Used for continuous spans 50′ to 120′. Maximum simple span 100′ to limit excessive dead load deflections. 2.4.1.C.2
Characteristics
Forming and falsework is somewhat complicated. Construction time is approximately the same as for a tee-beam. High torsional resistance makes it desirable for curved alignments. 2.4.1.C.3 1.

Prestressed Concrete Girder Sections
2.4.1.E.1
Application
Local precast fabricators have several standard forms available for precast concrete sections based on the WSDOT standard girder series. These are versatile enough to cover a wide variety of span lengths. WSDOT standard girders are: 1.
WF100G, WF95G, WF83G, WF74G, WF58G, WF50G, WF42G, WF36G, W74G, W58G, W50G, and W42G precast, prestressed concrete I-girders requiring a cast-inplace reinforced concrete bridge deck used for spans less than 200-feet. The number (eg. 95) specifies the girder depth in inches. WF95PTG, WF83PTG and WF74PTG post-tensioned, precast segmental I-girders with cast-in-place reinforced concrete bridge deck use for simple span up to 230feet, and continuous span up to 250-feet with continuous post-tensioning over the intermediate piers.

2.4.1.E.2
Characteristics
Superstructure design is quick for pre-tensioned girders with proven user-friendly software (PGSuper, PGSplice, and QConBridge) Construction details and forming are fairly simple. Construction time is less than for a cast-in-place bridge. Little or no falsework is required. Falsework over traffic is usually not required; construction time over existing traffic is reduced. Precast girders usually require that the bridge roadway superelevation transitions begin and end at or near piers; location of piers should consider this. The Region may be requested to adjust these transition points if possible. Fully reinforced, composite 8 inch cast-in-place deck slabs continuous over interior piers or reinforced 5 inch cast-in-place deck slabs continuous over interior piers have been used with e. and f.

Use
For railway over highway grade separations, most railroad companies prefer simple span steel construction. This is to simplify repair and reconstruction in the event of derailment or some other damage to the structure. 2.4.1.J.2
Characteristics
The heavier loads of the railroad live load require deeper and stiffer members than for highway bridges. Through girders can be used to reduce overall structure depth if the railroad concurs. Piers should be normal to the railroad to eliminate skew loading effects.

2.4.2
Wall Types Retaining walls, wingwalls, curtain walls, sound barrier walls, and tall closed abutment walls may be used where required to shorten spans or superstructure length or to reduce the width of approach fills. The process of selecting a type of retaining wall should economically satisfy structural, functional, and aesthetic requirements and other considerations relevant to a specific site. A detailed listing of the common wall types and their characteristics can be found in Section 8.3.
2.4.3
Buried Structure Types Buried structures may be used where required in accordance with specific site conditions. The process of selecting a type of buried structure should economically satisfy structural, functional, and aesthetic requirements and other considerations relevant to a specific site. Detailed discussion of the common types of buried structures, their characteristics and appropriate applications is found in Section 8.3. Refer to Section 2.3.3 for Freeboard and Maintenance access requirements.

Aesthetic Considerations
2.5.1
General Visual Impact Bridge, retaining walls and noise walls have a strong visual impact in any landscape. Steps must be taken to assure that even the most basic structure will complement rather than detract from its surroundings. The EIS and bridge site data submitted by the Region should each contain a discussion on the aesthetic importance of the project site. This commentary, together with submitted video and photographs, will help the designer determine the appropriate structure type. The State Bridge and Structures Architect should be contacted early in the preliminary bridge plan process for input on aesthetics. Normally, a visit to the bridge site with the State Bridge and Structures Architect and Region design personnel should be made. Aesthetics is a very subjective element that must be factored into the design process in the otherwise very quantitative field of structural engineering. Bridges that are structurally efficient using the least material possible are generally visually well proportioned. However, the details such as pier walls, columns, and crossbeams require special attention to ensure a structure that will enhance the general vicinity. For large projects incorporating several to many bridges and retaining walls, an architectural theme is frequently developed to bring consistency in structure type, details, and architectural appointments. The preliminary plan designer shall work with the State Bridge and Structures Architect to implement the theme.
2.5.2
End Piers 2.5.2.A
Wingwalls
The size and exposure of the wingwall at the end pier should balance, visually, with the depth and type of superstructure used. For example, a prestressed girder structure fits best visually with a 15′ wingwall (or curtain wall/retaining wall). However, there are instances where a 20′ wingwall (or curtain wall/retaining wall) may be used with a prestressed girder (maximizing a span in a remote area, for example or with deep girders where they are proportionally better in appearance). The use of a 20′ wingwall shall be approved by the Bridge Design Engineer and the State Bridge and Structures Architect. It is less expensive for bridges of greater than 40′ of overall width to be designed with wingwalls (or curtain wall/retaining wall) than to use a longer superstructure. 2.5.2.B
Retaining Walls
For structures at sites where profile, right of way, and alignment dictate the use of high exposed wall-type abutments for the end piers, retaining walls that flank the approach roadway can be used to retain the roadway fill and reduce the overall structure length. Stepped walls are often used to break up the height, and allow for landscape planting. A curtain wall runs between the bridge abutment and the heel of the abutment footing. In this way, the joint in the retaining wall stem can coincide with the joint between the abutment footing and the retaining wall footing. This simplifies design and provides a convenient breaking point between design responsibilities if the retaining walls happen to be the responsibility of the Region. The length shown for the curtain wall dimension is an estimated dimension based on experience and preliminary foundation assumptions. It can be revised under design to satisfy the intent of having the wall joint coincide with the end of the abutment footing. Page 2-40

2.5.2.C
Chapter 2
Slope Protection
The Region is responsible for making initial recommendations regarding slope protection. It should be compatible with the site and should match what has been used at other bridges in the vicinity. The type selected shall be shown on the Preliminary Plan. It shall be noted on the “Not Included in Bridge Quantities” list. 2.5.2.D
Noise Walls
Approval of the State Bridge and Structures Architect is required for the final selection of noise wall appearance, finish, materials and configuration.
2.5.3
Intermediate Piers The size, shape, and spacing of the intermediate pier elements must satisfy two criteria. They must be correctly sized and detailed to efficiently handle the structural loads required by the design and shaped to enhance the aesthetics of the structure. The primary view of the pier must be considered. For structures that cross over another roadway, the primary view will be a section normal to the roadway. This may not always be the same view as shown on the Preliminary Plan as with a skewed structure, for example. This primary view should be the focus of the aesthetic review. Tapers and flares on columns should be kept simple and structurally functional. Fabrication and constructability of the formwork of the pier must be kept in mind. Crossbeam ends should be carefully reviewed. Skewed bridges and bridges with steep profile grades or those in sharp vertical curves will require special attention to detail. Column spacing should not be so small as to create a cluttered look. Column spacing should be proportioned to maintain a reasonable crossbeam span balance.
2.5.4
Barrier and Wall Surface Treatments 2.5.4.A
Plain Surface Finish
This finish will normally be used on structures that do not have a high degree of visibility or where existing conditions warrant. A bridge in a remote area or a bridge among several existing bridges all having a plain finish would be examples. 2.5.4.B
Formliner Finishes
These finishes are the most common and an easy way to add a decorative texture to a structure. Variations on this type of finish can be used for special cases. The specific areas to receive this finish should be reviewed with the State Bridge and Structures Architect. 2.5.4.C
Pigmented Sealer
The use of a pigmented sealer is used to control graffiti and can also be an aesthetic enhancement. Most commonly it is always used in urban areas. The selection should be reviewed with the State Bridge and Structures Architect and the Region.

Architectural Details
Rustication grooves, relief panels, pilasters, and decorative finishes may visually improve appearance at transitions between different structure types such as cast-in-place abutments to structural earth retaining walls. Contact the State Bridge and Structures Architect for guidance. In special circumstances custom designs may be provided. Designs rising to the level of art shall be subject to the procedures outlined in the Design Manual M 22-01
2.5.5
Superstructure The horizontal elements of the bridge are perhaps the strongest features. The sizing of the structure depth based on the span/depth ratios in Section 2.4.1, will generally produce a balanced relationship. Designs rising to the level of "Art" shall be subject to the procedures outlined in the Design Manual M 22-01. Haunches or rounding of girders at the piers can enhance the structure’s appearance. The use of such features should be kept within reason considering fabrication of materials and construction of formwork. The amount of haunch should be carefully reviewed for overall balance from the primary viewing perspective. Haunches are not limited to cast-inplace superstructures, but may be used in special cases on precast, prestressed I girders. They require job-specific forms which increase cost, and standard design software is not directly applicable. The slab overhang dimension should approach that used for the structure depth. This dimension should be balanced between what looks good for aesthetics and what is possible with a reasonable slab thickness and reinforcement. For box girders, the exterior webs can be sloped, but vertical webs are preferred. The amount of slope should not exceed l½: l for structural reasons, and should be limited to 4:1 if sloped webs are desired. Sloped webs should only be used in locations of high aesthetic impact. When using precast, prestressed girders, all spans shall be the same series, unless approved otherwise by the Bridge Design Engineer.

Structure Costs
Chapter 2
See Section 12.3 for preparing cost estimates for preliminary bridge design.
2.6.2
Handling and Shipping Precast Members and Steel Beams Bridges utilizing precast concrete beams or steel beams need to have their access routes checked and sites reviewed to be certain that the beams can be transported to the site. It must also be determined that they can be erected once they reach the site. Both the size and the weight of the beams must be checked. Likely routes to the site must be adequate to handle the truck and trailer hauling the beams. Avoid narrow roads with sharp turns, steep grades, and/or load-rated bridges, which may prevent the beams from reaching the site. The Bridge Preservation Office should be consulted for limitations on hauling lengths and weights. Generally, 252 kips is the maximum weight of a girder that may be hauled by truck. The site should be reviewed for adequate space for the contractor to set up the cranes and equipment necessary to pick up and place the girders. The reach and boom angle should be checked and should accommodate standard cranes.
2.6.3
Salvage of Materials When a bridge is being replaced or widened, the material being removed should be reviewed for anything that WSDOT may want to salvage. Items such as aluminum rail, luminaire poles, sign structures, and steel beams should be identified for possible salvage. The Region should be asked if such items are to be salvaged since they will be responsible for storage and inventory of these items.

WSDOT Standards for Highway Bridges
2.7.1
Design Elements The following are standard design elements for bridges carrying highway traffic. They are meant to provide a generic base for consistent, clean looking bridges, and to reduce design and construction costs. Modification of some elements may be required, depending on site conditions. This should be determined on a case-by-case basis during the preliminary plan stage of the design process. 2.7.1.A
General
Fractured Fin Finish shall be used on the exterior face of the traffic barrier. All other surfaces shall be Plain Surface Finish. Exposed faces of wingwalls, columns, and abutments shall be vertical. The exterior face of the traffic barrier and the end of the intermediate pier crossbeam and diaphragm shall have a 1:12 backslope. 2.7.1.B
Substructure
End piers use the following details: 15-foot wingwalls with prestressed concrete girders up to 74-inches in depth or a combination of curtain wall/retaining walls. Stub abutment wall with vertical face. Footing elevation, pile type (if required), and setback dimension are determined from recommendations in the Materials Laboratory Geotechnical Services Branch Geotechnical Report. Intermediate piers use the following details: “Dropped” Crossbeams – The crossbeam below the girders is designed for the girder and bridge deck dead load, construction loads, live load, and superimposed dead loads. The minimum depth of the crossbeam shall be 3-feet. This crossbeam may be used for simple span continuous prestressed concrete girder bridges and continuous steel girder bridges. “Semi-raised” Crossbeams – The crossbeam below the girders is designed for the girder and slab dead load, and construction loads. The crossbeam and the diaphragm together are designed for all live loads and composite dead loads. The minimum depth of the crossbeam shall be 3-feet. “Raised” Crossbeams – The crossbeam is at the same level as the girders are designed for all dead and live loads. Round Columns – Columns shall be 3-feet to 6-feet diameter. Dimensions are constant full height with no tapers. Bridges with roadway widths of 40-feet or less will generally be single column piers. Bridges with roadway widths of greater the 40-feet shall have two or more columns, following the criteria established in Section 2.3.1.H. Oval or rectangular column may be used if required for structural performance or bridge visual.

Superstructure
Concrete Slab – 7½ inch minimum thickness with epoxy coated steel reinforcing bars in general with 5 inch minimum thickness for deck girders and 8 inch minimum thickness for steel girders. Prestressed Concrete Girders – Girder spacing will vary depending on roadway width and span length. The bridge deck overhang dimension is approximately half of the girder spacing. Girder spacing typically ranges between 6-feet and 12-feet. Intermediate Diaphragms – Locate in accordance with Table 5.6.2-1 and Section 5.6.4.C. Provide full or partial depth in accordance with Section 5.6.4.C.4. End Diaphragms – “End Wall on Girder” type. Traffic Barrier – Use 3’-6” high “F-shape” or Single-sloped barrier to meet worker fall protection requirements. Fixed Diaphragm at Inter. Piers – Full or partial width of crossbeam between girders and outside of the exterior girders. Hinged Diaphragm at Inter. Piers – Partial width of crossbeam between girders. Sloped curtain panel full width of crossbeam outside of exterior girders, fixed to ends of crossbeam. BP Rail – 3′–6″ overall height for pedestrian traffic. 4′–6″ overall height for bicycle traffic. Sidewalk – 6-inch height at curb line. Transverse slope of -0.02 feet per foot towards the curb line. Sidewalk barrier – Inside face is vertical. Outside face slopes 1:12 outward. Expansion Joints – refer to table in Section 9.1.1 for guidance regarding maximum bridge superstructure length beyond which the use of either intermediate expansion joints or modular expansion joints at the ends is required. 2.7.1.D

Bridge Security
2.8.1
General Security based bridge design and its direct correlation to modern social issues is addressed in this section. Criminal activity, illegal encampments, graffiti, hindrance to economic development and public eyesore create unwanted expensive. They also pose safety hazard for State Maintenance and Operations practices. The issue exists in urban areas as well as rural and recreational locales. Bridges are dominant structures in landscapes. They are held to a higher standard of design due to their influence on communities, where economic and social settings are affected by their quality. Initial project cost savings may quickly be overshadowed by increased externalized costs. These externalized costs are born by local municipalities and businesses as well as other departments within WSDOT. WSDOT bridge inspectors are required to inspect all bridges at least once every 24 months. The presence of the illegal encampments, as well as garbage, hypodermic needles, and feces often makes it impossible to do a close, hands-on inspection of the abutments and bearings of bridges. The Bridge Preservation Office has requested that maintenance clean up transient camps when it becomes difficult or impossible to do an adequate inspection of the bridges. Campfires set by the homeless have also caused damage to bridges. Bridge Maintenance Crews also face the same difficulty when they need to do repair work on bridges in the urban area. Clean up requires (per law) posting the bridge seventy-two hours prior to any work. Material picked up is tagged, bagged, and stored for retrieval. Often the offenders are back the next day.
2.8.2
Design Design is determined on a case by case basis using two strategies. These strategies are universally accepted best practices. The first, Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED), is a multi-disciplinary approach to deterring criminal behavior. The second, Context Sensitive Solutions (CSS), is also multi-disciplinary and focuses on project development methods. Multi-disciplinary teams consist of engineers and architects but may include law enforcement, local businesses, social service providers, and psychologists. 1.
CPTED principals are based upon the theory that the proper design and effective use of the built environment can reduce crime, reduce the fear of crime, and improve the quality of life. Built environment implementations of CPTED seek to dissuade offenders from committing crimes by manipulating the built environment in which those crimes proceed from or occur. The six main concepts are territoriality, surveillance, access control, image/maintenance, activity support and target hardening. Applying all of these strategies is key when preventing crime in any neighborhood or right-of-way.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 2-47
Chapter 2
Preliminary Design
Natural surveillance and access control strategies limit the opportunity for crime. Territorial reinforcement promotes social control through a variety of measures. These may include enhanced aesthetics or public art. Image/maintenance and activity support provide the community with reassurance and the ability to stop crime by themselves. Target hardening strategies may involve fencing or concrete enclosures or they may include all techniques to resolve crime or chronic trespass into one final step. 2.
2.8.3
WSDOT implements FHWA’s CSS design development principles. The CSS methods require designers to consider the physical, economic, and social setting of a project. Stakeholder’s interests are to be accounted for; including area residents and business owners.
Design Criteria New bridges need to address design for the environment by basic criteria:
• Slopes under bridges need to be steep slope, and hardened with something like solid concrete so that flat areas cannot be carved into the hillside. Flat areas under bridge superstructures attract inappropriate uses and should be omitted.
• Illegal urban campers have been known to build shelters between the concrete girders. Abutment walls need to be high enough that they deny access to the superstructure elements. When it is not feasible to design for deterrence the sites need to be hardened with fencing buried several feet into the soil or with solid concrete walls. See Figures 2.8.3-1 and 2.8.3-2 for high security fence and concrete wall examples.
• Regular chain link is easy cut, therefore stouter material needs to be specified.
• Landscape design should coordinate with region or headquarters landscape architects. Areas need to be visible to law enforcement. Figure 2.8.3-1

Permanent Loads – Loads and forces that are, or are assumed to be, either constant upon completion of construction or varying only over a long time interval. Transient Loads – Loads and forces that can vary over a short time interval relative to the lifetime of the structure. Temporary Loads – Loads that occur for a limited duration during pre-service conditions Construction Loads – Loads that occur during any construction activity and include imposed loads due to falsework and formwork, material stockpiles when permitted, and construction equipment Tsunami Loads – Loads that occur as result of tsunami

Limit States The basic limit state equation given by AASHTO LRFD 1.3.2.1 is as: ΣηiγiQi ≤ φRn = Rr Ση ΣηiiγγiiQ Qii ≤ ≤ φR φRnn = =R Rrr
For loads for which a maximum value of γi is appropriate For For loads loads for for which which a a maximum maximum value value of of 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is is appropriate appropriate
(3.4-1) (3.4-1) (3.4-1)
For loads for which a minimum value of γi is appropriate:
where: ηi γi Qi φ Rn Rr
= load modifier = load factor = force effect = resistance factor = nominal resistance = factored resistance
The modifier, ηi is the product of factors for ductility, redundancy, and importance. For simplicity use a value of 1.0 for ηi except for the design of columns when a minimum value of γi is appropriate. In such a case, use ηi = 0.95. Compression members in seismic designs are proportioned and detailed to ensure the development of significant and visible inelastic deformations at the extreme event limit states before failure. Strength IV load combination shall not be used for foundation design. The load factor for live load in the Service III load combination shall be as specified in Section 3.5. The tsunami load is considered an Extreme Event load with load factor of 1.0 and load combination similar to Extreme Event I.

Chapter 3
Load Factors and Load Combinations The limit states load combinations, and load factors (γi) used for structural design are in accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Table 3.4.1-1. For foundation design, loads are factored after distribution through structural analysis or modeling. The design live load factor for the Service III Limit State load combination shall be as follows: γLL = 0.8 when the requirements of Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 are satisfied and stress analysis is based on gross section properties. γLL = 1.0 when the requirements of Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 are satisfied and stress analysis is based on transformed section properties. In special cases that deviate from the requirements of Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 and have been approved by the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer, γLL, shall be as specified in AASHTO LRFD Table 3.4.1-4. The Service III live load factor for load rating shall be as specified in Section 13.1.1. The live load factor for Extreme Event-I Limit State load combination, γEQ as specified in the AASHTO LRFD Table 3.4.1-1 for all WSDOT bridges and walls shall be taken equal to 0.50. The γEQ factor applies to the live load force effect obtained from the bridge live load analysis. Associated mass of live load need not be included in the dynamic analysis. The AASHTO LRFD allows the live load factor in Extreme Event-I load combination, γEQ, to be determined on a project specific basis. The commentary indicates that the possibility of partial live load, i.e., γEQ < 1.0, with earthquakes should be considered. The application of Turkstra’s rule for combining uncorrelated loads indicates that γEQ = 0.50 is reasonable for a wide range of values of average daily truck traffic (ADTT). The NCHRP Report 489 recommends live load factor for Extreme Event-I Limit State, γEQ equal to 0.25 for all bridges. This factor shall be increased to γEQ equal to 0.50 for bridges located in main state routes and congested roads. Since the determination of live load factor, γEQ is based on ADTT or bridges located in congested roads could be confusing and questionable, it is decided that live load factor of γEQ equal to 0.50 to be used for all WSDOT bridges regardless the bridge location or traffic congestion. The live load factor equal to zero shall be used for tsunami load combination. The base construction temperature may be taken as 64°F for the determination of Temperature Load. The load factors γTG and γSE are to be determined on a project specific basis in accordance with AASHTO LRFD 3.4.1 and 3.12. Load Factors for Permanent Loads, γp are provided in AASHTO LRFD Table 3.4.1-2. The load factor for down drag loads shall be as specified in the AASHTO LRFD Table 3.4.1-2. The Geotechnical Report will provide the down drag force (DD). The down drag force is a load applied to the pile/shaft with the load factor specified in the Geotechnical Report. Generally, live loads (LL) are less than the down drag force and should be omitted when considering down drag forces.

Load Factors for Substructure Table 3.5-4 below provides general guidelines for when to use the maximum or minimum shaft/pile/column permanent load factors for axial capacity, uplift, and lateral loading. In general, substructure design should use unfactored loads to obtain force distribution in the structure. Moment, shear and axial force responses are then factored for final structural design. All forces and load factors are as defined previously. Table 3.5-4

Loads and Load Factors for Construction Unless otherwise specified, the load factor for construction loads and for any associated dynamic effects shall not be less than 1.5 in Strength I. When investigating Strength Load Combinations I, III, and V during construction, load factors for the weight of the structure and appurtenances, DC and DW, shall not be taken to be less than 1.25 when investigating for maximized force effects. Strength IV investigations shall use the appropriate factors from AASHTO LRFD Tables 3.4.1-1 and 3.4.1-2. Where evaluation of construction deflections is required by the contract documents, Load Combination Service I shall apply. Construction dead loads shall be considered as part of the permanent load and construction transient loads considered part of the live load. The associated permitted deflections shall be included in the contract documents. For falsework and formwork design loads, see Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(17)A. The base construction temperature shall be taken as 64°F for the determination of Temperature Load.

Load Factors for Post-tensioning
3.7.1
Post-tensioning Effects from Superstructure When cast-in-place, post-tensioned superstructure is constructed monolithic with the piers, the substructure design should consider frame moments and shears caused by elastic shortening and creep of the superstructure upon application of the axial posttensioning force at the bridge ends. Frame moments and shears thus obtained should be added algebraically to the values obtained from the primary and secondary moment diagrams applied to the superstructure. When cast-in-place or precast, post-tensioned superstructure are supported on sliding bearings at some of the piers, the design of those piers should include the longitudinal force from friction on the bearings generated as the superstructure shortens during jacking. When post-tensioning is complete, the full permanent reaction from this effect should be included in the governing AASHTO load combinations for the pier under design.
3.7.2
Secondary Forces from Post-tensioning, PS The application of post-tensioning forces on a continuous structure produces reactions at the structure’s support and internal forces that are collectively called secondary forces. Secondary prestressing forces (i.e. secondary moments) are the force effects in continuous members, as a result of continuous post-tensioning. In frame analysis software, the secondary moments are generally obtained by subtracting the primary moment (P*e) from the total PS moment obtained by applying an equivalent static load which represents the forces due to post-tensioning. A load factor, γPS, of 1.0 is appropriate for the superstructure. For fixed columns a 50 percent reduction in PS force effects could be used given the elasto-plastic characteristics of the soil surrounding the foundation elements.

3.8.1
Deck Overlay Requirement Vehicular traffic will generate wear and rutting on a concrete bridge deck over the life of a bridge. One option to correct excessive wear is to add a Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) overlay on top of the existing concrete deck. This type of overlay requires less construction time and is less expensive compared to removing a portion of the deck and adding a modified concrete overlay. The initial bridge design needs to incorporate the future overlay dead load. All new bridge designs with a concrete driving surface, excluding modified concrete overlays, shall be designed for a 35 psf future wearing surface load. The future wearing surface load does not apply to girder deflection, “A” dimension, creep, or profile grade calculations. Concrete bridge deck protection systems shall be in accordance with Section 5.7.4 for new bridge construction and widening projects.
3.8.2
Distribution of Permanent Loads The dead load of one traffic barrier is divided uniformly among the three nearest girders. When there are six or fewer girders, traffic barrier loads are equally distributed to all girders. Sidewalk loads are distributed by the same method as traffic barrier loads. However, if a wide sidewalk is directly supported by more than three girders, the sidewalk load shall be distributed equally to all supporting girders.

Live Loads
3.9.1
Design Live Load Live load design criteria are specified in the lower right corner of the bridge preliminary plan sheet. The Bridge Preliminary Plan Engineer determines the criteria using the following guideline:
• New bridges and bridge widening with addition of substructure – HL-93
• Bridge superstructure widening with no addition of substructure – Live load criteria of the original design
• Temporary widening of existing bridges: Live load criteria of the existing bridge
• Detour and other temporary bridges, except as required by Section 10.13.2 – 75 percent of HL-93 The application of design vehicular live loads shall be as specified in AASHTO LRFD 3.6.1.3. The design tandem, or “low boy”, defined in AASHTO LRFD C3.6.1.3.1 shall be included in the design vehicular live load. The effect of one design tandem combined with the effect of the design lane load specified in AASTHO LRFD 3.6.1.2.4 and, for negative moment between the points of contraflexure under a uniform load on all spans and reactions at interior supports, shall be investigated a dual design tandem spaced from 26.0 feet to 40.0 feet apart, measured between the trailing axle of the lead vehicle and the lead axle of the trailing vehicle, combined with the design lane load. For the purpose of this article, the pairs of the design tandem shall be placed in adjacent spans in such position to produce maximum force effect. Axles of the design tandem that do not contribute to the extreme force effect under consideration shall be neglected.
3.9.2
Loading for Live Load Deflection Evaluation The loading for live load deflection criteria is defined in AASHTO LRFD 3.6.1.3.2. Live load deflections for the Service I limit state shall satisfy the requirements of AASHTO LRFD 2.5.2.6.2.

Distribution to Superstructure 3.9.3.A
Multi Girder Superstructure
The live load distribution factor for exterior girder of multi girder bridges designated in AASHTO LRFD Table 4.6.2.2.1-1 as type a, b, c, e, k and also i, j if sufficiently connected to act as a unit, shall be as follows:
• For exterior girder design with slab cantilever length equal or less than 40 percent of the adjacent interior girder spacing, use the live load distribution factor for interior girder. The slab cantilever length is defined as the distance from the centerline of the exterior girder to the edge of the slab.
• For exterior girder design with slab cantilever length exceeding 40 percent of the adjacent interior girder spacing, use the lever rule with the multiple presence factor of 1.0 for single lane to determine the live load distribution. The live load used to design the exterior girder shall not be less than the live load used for the adjacent interior girder.

• The special analysis based on the conventional approximation of loads on piles as described in AASHTO LRFD C4.6.2.2.2d shall not be used unless the effectiveness of diaphragms on the lateral distribution of truck load is investigated. In accordance with the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, 7th Edition, 2014 and later, the special analysis is only applicable to steel beam-slab bridge cross-sections with diaphragms or cross-frames. 3.9.3.B
Concrete Box Girders
The load distribution factor for multi-cell cast in place concrete box girders shall be for interior girders from AASHTO LRFD Table 4.6.2.2.2b-1 for bending moment, and Table 4.6.2.2.3a-1 for shear. The live load distribution factor for interior girders shall then be multiplied by the number of webs to obtain the design live load for the entire superstructure. The live load distribution need not exceed the total number of design lanes. The correction factor for live load distribution for skewed support as specified in AASHTO LRFD Table 4.6.2.2.2e-1 for bending moment and AASTHO LRFD Table 4.6.2.2.3c-1 for shear shall apply.

Multiple Presence Factors
A reduction factor will be applied in the substructure design for multiple lane loadings in accordance with AASHTO LRFD 3.6.1.1.2. 3.9.3.D
Distribution to Substructure
The number of traffic lanes to be used in the substructure design shall be determined by dividing the entire roadway slab width by 12. No fractional lanes shall be used. Roadway slab widths of less than 24 feet shall have a maximum of two design lanes. 3.9.3.E
Distribution to Crossbeam
The design and load rating live loading are distributed to the substructure by placing wheel line reactions in lane configurations that generate the maximum force effects in the substructure. A wheel line reaction is one-half of the reaction of a single lane of live load. For integral and hinged continuity diaphragms, live loads are considered to act directly on the substructure without further distribution through the superstructure as illustrated in Figure 3.9‑1. For girder configurations where there is a clear load path through the girders to the cross beam, such as at expansion piers with girders supported on individual bearings, live load reactions are applied through the bearings. Normally, substructure design will not consider live load torsion or lateral distribution. Sidesway effects shall be considered.

For steel and prestressed concrete superstructure where the live load is transferred to substructure through bearings, cross frames or diaphragms, the girder reaction may be used for substructure design. Live load placement is dependent on the member under design. Some examples of live load placement are as follows: the exterior vehicle wheel is placed 2 feet from the curb for maximum crossbeam cantilever moment or maximum eccentric foundation moment. For crossbeam design between supports, the lanes are placed to obtain the maximum positive moment in the member; then re-located to obtain the maximum shear or negative moment in the member. For column design, the design lanes are placed to obtain the maximum transverse moment at the top of the column; then re-located to obtain the maximum axial force of the column.

Bridge Load Rating Bridge designers are responsible for Design, Legal, and Permit load rating of new bridges in accordance with the National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) and the AASHTO Manual Bridge Evaluation. See Chapter 13 for detailed information on loading requirements for bridge load rating.

3.11.2
Wind Load to Substructure Wind forces shall be applied to the substructure units in accordance with the loadings specified in AASHTO LRFD. Transverse stiffness of the superstructure may be considered, as necessary, to properly distribute loads to the substructure provided that the superstructure can sustain such loads. Vertical wind pressure, per AASHTO LRFD 3.8.2, shall be included in the design where appropriate, for example, on single column piers. Wind loads shall be applied through shear keys or other positive means from the superstructure to the substructure. Wind loads shall be distributed to the piers and abutments in accordance with the laws of statics. Transverse wind loads can be applied directly to the piers assuming the superstructure to act as a rigid beam. For large structures a more appropriate result might be obtained by considering the superstructure to act as a flexible beam on elastic supports.

Loads
Force Effects Due to Superimposed Deformations PS, CR, SH, TU and TG are superimposed deformations. Load factors for PS, CR, and SH, are as shown in Table 3.5-3. In non-segmental structures: PS, CR, and SH are symbolically factored by a value of 1.0 in the strength limit state but are actually designed for in the service limit state. For substructure in the strength limit state, the value of 0.50 for γPS, γCR, γSH, and γTU may be used when calculating force effects in non-segmental structures, but shall be taken in conjunction with the gross moment of inertia in the columns or piers. The larger of the values provided for load factor of TU shall be used for deformations and the smaller values for all other effects. The calculation of displacements for TU loads utilizes a factor greater than 1.0 to avoid under sizing joints, expansion devices, and bearings. The current AASHTO LRFD requires a load factor of 1.2 on CR, SH, and TU deformations, and 0.5 on other CR/SH/TU force effects. The lower value had been rationalized as dissipation of these force effects over time, particularly in the columns and piers. Changing the load factors for creep and shrinkage is not straight-forward because CR, SH are “superimposed deformations”, that is, force effects due to a change in material behavior that cause a change in the statical system. For safety and simplicity in design, they are treated as loads--despite not being measurable at time t = 0. However, behavior is nonlinear and application of the load factor must also be considered. Some software will run service load analysis twice: once with and once without CR, SH effects. The CR and SH can then be isolated by subtracting the results of the two runs. Other software will couple the CR and SH with the dead load, giving a shrinkage- or creep-adjusted dead load. The proposed compromise is to assign creep and shrinkage the same load factor as the DC loads but permit a factor of 1.0 if the project-specific creep coefficient can be determined and is then used in the linear analysis software. Thermal and shrinkage loadings are induced by movements of the structure and can result from several sources. Movements due to temperature changes are calculated using coefficients of thermal expansion of 0.000006 feet/foot per degree for concrete and 0.0000065 feet/foot per degree for steel. Reinforced concrete shrinks at the rate of 0.0002 feet/foot.

Bridges Subjected to Tsunami Effects The AASHTO Guide Specifications for Bridges Subject to Tsunami Effects are intended for the design and construction of conventional bridges to resist the effects of tsunami waves. The conventional bridges are taken as those that:
• Have slab, beam, or box girder superstructures
• Are supported by pier and abutment substructures
• Are founded on shallow or deep foundations
• Have minimal changes in elevation along the bridge length
• Are straight in plan view (including skewed but not curved) The tsunami design requirements for non-conventional bridges shall be considered on a case-by-case basis and consultation with the Bridge and Structures Office. Determination of whether the tsunami hazard applies shall be made at the bridge preliminary plan or conceptual plan stage using the above-mentioned tools and shall be noted in the Job File. Bridge preliminary plan or conceptual plan shall specify the most probably bridge soffit elevation and superstructure depth, and substructure/foundation type for tsunami hazard determination. Where possible, all new bridges shall be designed so that the tsunami wave does not contact the superstructure. If this is not possible the bridge shall be designed to ensure that the bridge can resist the tsunami hazard loading as specified in the AASHTO Guide Specifications for Bridges Subject to Tsunami Effects.

Chapter 3
A bridge superstructure shall be considered for the tsunami hazard if the inundation at Mean High Water (MHW) is high enough to contact the bridge superstructure soffit based on the modeled inundation depth. Substructure design should consider loading applied through the superstructure and loads applied directly to the substructure. Both scour and geotechnical hazards due to tsunami inundation shall be investigated during final design. The critical tsunami parameters including wave direction, velocity and depth, can be obtained from the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR), at: Tsunami Hazard Maps - WA or Tsunami Inundation Database Interactive Web Portal at: Tsunami Inundation Database Portal — The B. John Garrick Institute for the Risk Sciences (ucla.edu). The performance requirement for bridges subjected to tsunami effects is life safety no-collapse as defined in Chapter 4 for seismic performance requirement. Higher performance for post-tsunami serviceability may be considered on a case-by-case basis for recovery bridges as defined in Chapter 4. Simultaneous consideration of tsunami and seismic, or tsunami and scour are not recommended tsunami design of conventional bridges. The provisions outlined in Section 7 of the AASHTO Guide Specifications for Bridges Subject to Tsunami Effects for reduction of tsunami loading, accommodation of forces, geometric proportioning, venting, and sacrificial elements could be used with the approval of the Bridge Design Engineer regardless of the contracting method.

Seismic Design and Retrofit
General Seismic design of new bridges and bridge widenings shall conform to AASHTO Guide Specifications for LRFD Seismic Bridge Design (SEISMIC) as modified by Sections 4.2 and 4.3. The bridge seismic terminology of Ordinary for Normal bridges, and Recovery for Essential bridges, has been adopted in this edition of Bridge Design Manual in anticipation of AASHTO changing the bridge seismic terminology. Analysis and design of seismic retrofits for existing bridges shall be completed in accordance with Section 4.4. Seismic design of retaining walls shall be in accordance with Section 4.5. For nonconventional bridges, bridges that are deemed critical or Recovery, or bridges that fall outside the scope of the Guide Specifications for any other reasons, project specific design requirements shall be developed and submitted to the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer for approval. The importance classifications for all highway bridges in Washington State are classified as “Ordinary” except for special major bridges. Special major bridges fitting the classifications of either “Critical” or “Recovery” will be so designated by either the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Engineer or the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer. Bridges are considered as Critical, Recovery, or Ordinary for their operational classification as described below. Two-level performance criteria are required for design of Recovery and Critical bridges. Recovery and Critical bridges shall be designated by WSDOT Regions or Local Agencies, in consultation with WSDOT State Bridge and Structures Engineer and State Bridge Design Engineer.
• Critical Bridges Critical bridges are expected to provide immediate access to emergency and similar life-safety facilities after an earthquake. The Critical designation is typically reserved for high-cost projects where WSDOT intends to protect the investment or for projects that would be especially costly to repair if they were damaged during an earthquake.
• Recovery Bridges Recovery bridges serve as vital links for rebuilding damaged areas and provide access to the public shortly after an earthquake.
• Ordinary Bridges All bridges not designated as either Critical or Recovery shall be designated as Ordinary.

Expected Post-earthquake Service Levels
• No Service – Bridge is closed for repair or replacement.
• Limited Service – Bridge is open for emergency vehicle traffic: A reduced number of lanes for Ordinary traffic is available within three months of the earthquake; Vehicle weight restriction may be imposed until repairs are completed. It is expected that within three months (Recovery Bridges) or within three days (Critical Bridges) of the earthquake, repair works on a damaged bridge would have reached the stage that would permit Ordinary traffic on at least some portion of the bridge.
• Full Service – Full access to Ordinary traffic is available almost immediately after the earthquake. The expected post-earthquake damage states and service levels of Critical bridges are included in Table 4.1-2 to provide an indication of their expected performance relative to Ordinary bridge categories.

Expected Post-earthquake Damage States
• Significant – “imminent failure,” i.e., onset of compressive failure of core concrete. Bridge replacement is likely. All plastic hinges within the structure have formed with ductility demand values approaching the limits specified in Table 4.1-2.
• Moderate – “extensive cracks and spalling, and visible lateral and/or longitudinal reinforcing bars”. Bridge repair is likely but bridge replacement is unlikely
• Minimal – “flexural cracks and minor spalling and possible shear cracks”. Essentially elastic performance
• None – No damage The Design Spectrum for Safety Evaluation Earthquake (SEE) shall be taken as a spectrum based on a 7% probability of exceedance in 75 years (or 975-year return period). BDM Section 4.2.3 provides the ground motion software tool SPECTRA to develop spectral response parameters. The Design Spectrum for Functional Evaluation Earthquake (FEE) shall be taken as a spectrum based on a 30% probability of exceedance in 75 years (or 210-year return period). The Geotechnical Engineer shall provide final design spectrum recommendations. The FEE may be obtained using the USGS Interactive website (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/interactive). Ordinary and Recovery bridges subjected to the seismic hazard levels specified in Table 1 shall satisfy the displacement criteria specified in LRFD-SGS as applicable and the maximum displacement ductility demand, μD values as specified in Table 4.1-2.

WSDOT Additions and Modifications to AASHTO Guide Specifications for LRFD Seismic Bridge Design (SEISMIC) WSDOT amendments to the AASHTO SEISMIC are as follows:
4.2.1
Definitions Guide Specifications Article 2.1 – Add the following definitions:
• Oversized Pile Shaft – A drilled shaft foundation that is larger in diameter than the supported column and has a reinforcing cage larger than and independent of the columns. The size of the shaft shall be in accordance with Section 7.8.2.
• Owner – Person or agency having jurisdiction over the bridge. For WSDOT projects, regardless of delivery method, the term “Owner” in these Guide Specifications shall be the WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer or/and the WSDOT State Geotechnical Engineer.
4.2.2
Earthquake Resisting Systems (ERS) Requirements for Seismic Design Categories (SDCs) C and D Guide Specifications Article 3.3 – WSDOT Global Seismic Design Strategies:
• Type 1 – Ductile Substructure with Essentially Elastic Superstructure. This category is permissible.
• Type 2 – Essentially Elastic Substructure with a Ductile Superstructure. This category is not permissible.
• Type 3 – Elastic Superstructure and Substructure with a Fusing Mechanism between the two. This category is permissible with WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer’s approval. With the approval of the State Bridge Design Engineer, for Type 1 ERS for SDC C or D, if columns or pier walls are considered an integral part of the energy dissipating system but remain elastic at the demand displacement, the forces to use for capacity design of other components are to be a minimum of 1.2 times the elastic forces resulting from the demand displacement in lieu of the forces obtained from overstrength plastic hinging analysis. Because maximum limiting inertial forces provided by yielding elements acting at a plastic mechanism level is not effective in the case of elastic design, the following constraints are imposed. These may be relaxed on a case by case basis with the approval of the State Bridge Design Engineer.
Page 4-4
1.
Unless an analysis that considers redistribution of internal structure forces due to inelastic action is performed, all substructure units of the frame under consideration and of any adjacent frames that may transfer inertial forces to the frame in question must remain elastic at the design ground motion demand.
2.
Effective member section properties must be consistent with the force levels expected within the bridge system. Reinforced concrete columns and pier walls should be analyzed using cracked section properties. For this purpose, in absence of better information or estimated by Figure 5.6.2-1, a moment of inertia equal to one half that of the un-cracked section shall be used.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Chapter 4
3.
Foundation modeling must be established such that uncertainties in modeling will not cause the internal forces of any elements under consideration to increase by more than 10 percent.
4.
When site specific ground response analysis is performed, the response spectrum ordinates must be selected such that uncertainties will not cause the internal forces of any elements under consideration to increase by more than 10 percent.
5.
Thermal, shrinkage, prestress or other forces that may be present in the structure at the time of an earthquake must be considered to act in a sense that is least favorable to the seismic load combination under investigation.
6.
P-Delta effects must be assessed using the resistance of the frame in question at the deflection caused by the design ground motion.
7.
Joint shear effects must be assessed with a minimum of the calculated elastic internal forces applied to the joint.
8.
Detailing as normally required in either SDC C or D, as appropriate, must be provided.
It is permitted to use expected material strengths for the determination of member strengths except shear for elastic response of members. The use of elastic design in lieu of overstrength plastic hinging forces for capacity protection described above shall only be considered if designer demonstrates that capacity design of Article 4.11 of the AASHTO Guide Specifications for LRFD Bridge Seismic Design is not feasible due to geotechnical or structural reasons. If the columns or pier walls remain elastic at the demand displacement, shear design of columns or pier walls shall be based on 1.2 times elastic shear force resulting from the demand displacement and normal material strength shall be used for capacities. The minimum detailing according to the bridge seismic design category shall be provided. Type 3 ERS may be considered only if Type 1 strategy is not suitable and Type 3 strategy has been deemed necessary for accommodating seismic loads. Use of isolation bearings needs the approval of WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer. Isolation bearings shall be designed per the requirement specified in Section 9.3 Limitations on the use of ERS and ERE are shown in Figures 3.3-1a, 3.3-1b, 3.3-2, and 3.3-3.
• Figure 3.3-1b Type 6, connection with moment reducing detail should only be used at column base if proved necessary for foundation design. Fixed connection at base of column remains the preferred option for WSDOT bridges.
• The design criteria for column base with moment reducing detail shall consider all applicable loads at service, strength, and extreme event limit states.
• Figure 3.3-2 Types 6 and 8 are not permissible for non-liquefied configuration and permissible with WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer’s approval for liquefied configuration. For ERSs and EREs requiring approval, the WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer’s approval is required regardless of contracting method (i.e., approval authority is not transferred to other entities).

In cases where the site coefficients used to adjust mapped values of design ground motion for local conditions are inappropriate to determine the design spectra in accordance with general procedure of Article 3.4.1 (such as the period at the end of constant design spectral acceleration plateau (Ts) is greater than 1.0 second or the period at the beginning of constant design spectral acceleration plateau (To) is less than 0.2 second), a site-specific ground motion response analysis shall be performed. In the general procedure, the spectral response parameters shall be determined using the USGS 2014 Seismic Hazard Maps with Seven Percent Probability of Exceedance in 75 yr (1000-yr Return Period). The Design Spectrum for Functional Evaluation Earthquake (FEE) shall be taken as a spectrum based on a 30% probability of exceedance in 75 years (or 210-year return period).

Damage to backwalls and wingwalls during earthquakes may be considered acceptable when considering no collapse criteria, provided that unseating or other damage to the superstructure does not occur. Abutment participation in the overall dynamic response of the bridge system shall reflect the

structural configuration, the load transfer mechanism from the bridge to the abutment system, the effective stiffness and force capacity of the wall-soil system, and the level of acceptable abutment damage. The capacity of the abutments to resist the bridge inertial loads shall be compatible with the soil resistance that can be reliably mobilized, the structural design of the abutment wall, and whether the wall is permitted to be damaged by the design earthquake. The lateral load capacity of walls shall be evaluated on the basis of a rational passive earth-pressure theory. The participation of the bridge approach slab in the overall dynamic response of bridge systems to earthquake loading and in providing resistance to seismically induced inertial loads may be considered permissible upon approval from both the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer and the WSDOT Geotechnical Engineer. The participation of the abutment in the ERS should be carefully evaluated with the Geotechnical Engineer and the Owner when the presence of the abutment backfill may be uncertain, as in the case of slumping or settlement due to liquefaction below or near the abutment. 4.2.11.2 - Longitudinal Direction Under earthquake loading, the earth pressure action on abutment walls changes from a static condition to one of two possible conditions:
• The dynamic active pressure condition as the wall moves away from the backfill, or
• The passive pressure condition as the inertial load of the bridge pushes the wall into the backfill. The governing earth pressure condition depends on the magnitude of seismically induced movement of the abutment walls, the bridge superstructure, and the bridge/abutment configuration. For semi-integral (Figure 4.2.11-1a), L-shape abutment with backwall fuse (Figure 4.2.11-1b), or without backwall fuse (Figure 4.2.11-1c), for which the expansion joint is sufficiently large to accommodate both the cyclic movement between the abutment wall and the bridge superstructure (i.e., superstructure does not push against abutment wall), the seismically induced earth pressure on the abutment wall shall be considered to be the dynamic active pressure condition. However, when the gap at the expansion joint is not sufficient to accommodate the cyclic wall/bridge seismic movements, a transfer of forces will occur from the superstructure to the abutment wall. As a result, the active earth pressure condition will not be valid and the earth pressure approaches a much larger passive pressure load condition behind the backwall. This larger load condition is the main cause for abutment damage, as demonstrated in past earthquakes. For semi-integral or L-shape abutments, the abutment stiffness and capacity under passive pressure loading are primary design concerns.

4.2.11.2.2 - Calculation of Best Estimate Passive Pressure Pp If the strength characteristics of compacted or natural soils in the "passive pressure zone" are known, then the passive force for a given height, Hw, may be calculated using accepted analysis procedures. These procedures should account for the interface friction between the wall and the soil. The properties used shall be those indicative of the entire "passive pressure zone" as indicated in Figure 1. Therefore, the properties of backfill present immediately adjacent to the wall in the active pressure zone may not be appropriate as a weaker failure surface can develop elsewhere in the embankment. For L-shape abutments where the backwall is not designed to fuse, Hw shall conservatively be taken as the depth of the superstructure, unless a more rational soilstructure interaction analysis is performed. If presumptive passive pressures are to be used for design, then the following criteria shall apply:
• Soil in the "passive pressure zone" shall be compacted in accordance with Standard 5.2.2.3Calculation of Passive Stiffness Specifications Section 2-03.3(14)I, which Soil requires compaction to 95 percent maximum density for all “Bridge Approach Embankments”.

4.2.11.2.4 - Modeling Passive Pressure Stiffness in the Longitudinal Direction In the longitudinal direction, when the bridge is moving toward the soil, the full passive resistance of the soil may be mobilized, but when the bridge moves away from the soil no soil resistance is mobilized. Since passive pressure acts at only one abutment at a time, linear elastic dynamic models and frame pushover models should only include a passive pressure spring at one abutment in any given model. Secant stiffness values for passive pressure shall be developed independently for each abutment. As an alternative, for straight or with horizontal curves up to 30 degrees single frame bridges, and compression models in straight multi-frame bridges where the passive pressure stiffness is similar between abutments, a spring may be used at each abutment concurrently. In this case, the assigned spring values at each end need to be reduced by half because they act in simultaneously, whereas the actual backfill passive resistance acts only in one direction and at one time. Correspondingly, the actual peak passive resistance force at either abutment will be equal to the sum of the peak forces developed in two springs. In this case, secant stiffness values for passive pressure shall be developed based on the sum of peak forces developed in each spring. If computed abutment forces exceed the soil capacity, the stiffness should be softened iteratively until abutment displacements are consistent (within 30 percent) with the assumed stiffness. 4.2.11.3 - Transverse Direction Transverse stiffness of abutments may be considered in the overall dynamic response of bridge systems on a case by case basis upon State Bridge Design Engineer approval. Upon approval, the transverse abutment stiffness used in the elastic demand models may be taken as 50 percent of the elastic transverse stiffness of the adjacent bent. Girder stops are typically designed to transmit the lateral shear forces generated by small to moderate earthquakes and service loads and are expected to fuse at the design event earthquake level of acceleration to limit the demand and control the damage in the abutments and supporting piles/shafts. Linear elastic analysis cannot capture the inelastic response of the girder stops, wingwalls or piles/shafts. Therefore, the forces generated with elastic demand assessment models should not be used to size the abutment girder stops. Girder stops for abutments supported on a spread footing shall be designed to sustain the lesser of the acceleration coefficient, As, times the superstructure dead load reaction at the abutment plus the weight of abutment and its footing or sliding friction forces of spread footings. Girder stops for pile/shaft supported foundations shall be designed to sustain the sum of 75 percent total lateral capacity of the piles/shafts and shear capacity of one wingwall. The elastic resistance may be taken to include the use of bearings designed to accommodate the design displacements, soil frictional resistance acting against the base of a spread footing supported abutment, or pile resistance provided by piles acting in their elastic range. The stiffness of fusing or breakaway abutment elements such as wingwalls (yielding or non-yielding), elastomeric bearings, and sliding footings shall not be relied upon to reduce displacement demands at intermediate piers. Unless fixed bearings are used, girder stops shall be provided between all girders regardless of the elastic seismic demand. The design of girder stops should consider that unequal forces that may develop in each stop. Page 4-16

Chapter 4
When fusing girder stops, transverse shear keys, or other elements that potentially release the restraint of the superstructure are used, then adequate support length meeting the requirements of Article 4.12 of the AASHTO SEISMIC must be provided. Additionally, the expected redistribution of internal forces in the superstructure and other bridge system element must be considered. Bounding analyses considering incremental release of transverse restraint at each end of the bridge should also be considered. 4.2.11.4 - Curved and Skewed Bridges Passive earth pressure at abutments may be considered as a key element of the ERS of straight and curved bridges with abutment skews up to 20 degrees. For larger skews, due to a combination of longitudinal and transverse response, the span has a tendency to rotate in the direction of decreasing skew. Such motion will tend to cause binding in the obtuse corner and generate uneven passive earth pressure forces on the abutment, exceeding the passive pressure near one end of the backwall, and providing little or no resistance at other end. This requires a more refined analysis to determine the amount of expected movement. The passive pressure resistance in soils behind semi-integral or L-shape abutments shall be based on the projected width of the abutment wall normal to the centerline of the bridge. Abutment springs shall be included in the local coordinate system of the abutment wall.

Seismic Resiliency using Innovative Materials and Construction Innovative materials and bridge construction are ideas that encourage engineers to consider principles that will enhance bridge performance, speed up construction, or add any other benefit to the industry. BDM Section 14.4 describes the self-centering columns that are designed restore much of their original shape after a seismic event. They’re intended to improve the serviceability of a bridge after an earthquake. Self-centering columns are constructed with a precast concrete column segment with a duct running through it longitudinally. They rest on footings with post-tensioning (PT) strand developed into them. Once the precast column piece is set on the footing, the PT strand threads through the duct and gets anchored into the crossbeam above the column. The PT strand is unbonded to the column segment. As a column experiences a lateral load, the PT strand elastically stretches to absorb the seismic energy and returns to its original tension load after the seismic event. The expectation is the column would rotate as a rigid body and the PT strand would almost spring the column back to its original orientation. Self-centering in bridge columns can be achieved using Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) and Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC). These products are introduced into bridge design as a means to improve ductility, seismic resiliency, and serviceability of a bridge after an earthquake. SMA is a class of alloys that are manufactured from either a combination of nickel and titanium or copper, magnesium and aluminum. The alloy is shaped into round bars in sizes similar to conventional steel reinforcement. When stressed, the SMA can undergo large deformations and return to original shape.

Seismic analysis is required in accordance with Section 4.3.3 and is not required for single span bridges and bridges in SDC A. However, existing elements of single span bridges shall meet the requirements of AASHTO SEISMIC as applicable.
4.3.2
Bridge Widening Project Classification Bridge widening projects are classified according to the scope of work as either minor or major widening projects. 4.3.2.A
Minor Modification and Widening Projects
A bridge widening project is classified as a minor widening project if all of the following conditions are met:
• Substructure bents are not modified and no new columns or piers are added, while abutments may be widened to accommodate the increase of bridge deck width.
• The net superstructure mass increase is equal or less than 10 percent of the original superstructure mass.
• Fixity conditions of the foundations are unchanged.
• There are no major changes of the seismicity of the bridge site that can increase seismic hazard levels or reduce seismic performance of the structure since the initial screening or most recent seismic retrofit.
• No change in live load use of the bridge

Major Modifications and Widening Projects
A bridge widening project is classified as a major widening project if any of the following conditions are met:
• Substructure bents are modified and new columns or piers are added, excepting abutments, which may be widened to accommodate the increase of bridge deck width.
• The net superstructure mass increase is more than 20 percent of the original superstructure mass.
• Fixity conditions of the foundations are changed.
• There are major changes of the seismicity of the bridge site that can increase seismic hazard levels or reduce seismic performance of the structure since the initial screening or most recent seismic retrofit.
• Change in live load use of the bridge Major changes in seismicity include, but are not limited to, the following: near fault effect, significant liquefaction potential, or lateral spreading. If there are concerns about changes to the Seismic Design Response Spectrum at the bridge site, about a previous retrofit to the existing bridge, or an unusual imbalance of mass distribution resulting from the structure widening, the designer should consult the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office.
4.3.3
Seismic Design Requirements Bridge Widening Projects The Seismic Design requirements for Bridge Modifications and Widening are as follows and as illustrated in BDM Figure 4.3-1: 1.
Ordinary bridge modification or widening projects classified as Minor Modification or Widening do not require either a seismic evaluation or a retrofit of the structure. If the conditions for Minor Modification or Widening project are met, it is anticipated that the modified or widened structure will not draw enough additional seismic demand to significantly affect the existing sub-structure elements.
2.
Seismic analysis is required for all Major Modifications and Widening projects at project scoping level in accordance with Section 4.1. A complete seismic analysis is required for Ordinary bridges in Seismic Design Category (SDC) B, C, and D for major modifications and widening projects as described below. A project geotechnical report (including any unstable soil or liquefaction issues) shall be available to the structural engineer for seismic analysis. Seismic analysis shall be performed for both existing and widened structures. Capacity/Demand (C/D) ratios are required for existing bridge elements including foundation.
3.
The widening portion of the structure shall be designed for liquefiable soils condition in accordance to the AASHTO Seismic, and WSDOT BDM, unless soils improvement is provided to eliminate liquefaction.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 4-23
Chapter 4
Seismic Design and Retrofit
4.
Procedure for Ordinary Bridges: Seismic improvement of existing columns and crossbeams to C/D > 1.0 is required. The cost of seismic improvement shall be paid for with widening project funding (not from the Retrofit Program). The seismic retrofit of the existing Ordinary structure shall conform to the BDM, while the newly widened portions of the bridge shall comply with the AASHTO Seismic, except for balanced stiffness criteria, which may be difficult to meet due to the existing bridge configuration. However, the designer should strive for the best balanced frame stiffness for the entire widened structure that is attainable in a cost effective manner. Major Modification and Widening Projects require the designer to determine the seismic C/D ratios of the existing bridge elements in the final widened condition. If the C/D ratios of columns and crossbeam of existing structure are less than 1.0, the improvement of seismically deficient elements is mandatory and the widening project shall include the improvement of existing seismically deficient bridge elements to C/D ratio of above 1.0. The C/D ratio of 1.0 is required to prevent the collapse of the bridge during the seismic event as required for life safety. Seismic improvement of the existing foundation elements (footings, pile caps, piles, and shafts to C/D ratios > 1.0) could be deferred to the Bridge Seismic Retrofit Program.
5.
Procedure for Recovery/Critical Bridges: The initial goal is to conduct the seismic design effort so the composite structure (existing bridge and widening) meet requirements of the two-level seismic design (FEE and SEE) de-scribed in BDM Section 4.1. This includes the superstructure, substructure and foundation elements of the composite structure. Retrofitting or strengthening of the existing structure may be necessary to achieve this. Depending on the year the bridge was constructed, type of foundation and capacity of the soils during a seismic event, it may become expensive to meet this goal. If the Engineer determines it is cost prohibitive to meet the two-level design criteria, the State Bridge Design Engineer may approve deviations. Examples of potential deviations include: A. Meeting two-level design criteria for the widened portion, but only achieving Ordinary bridge criteria for the existing bridge. B.
Meeting two-level design criteria for the above-ground portions of the composite structure, but not achieving this for the below-ground portions (foundations).
C.
Performing a two-level design, but requiring deviations from the displacement ductility demand limits identified in BDM Section 4.1.
D. Only achieving Ordinary (no collapse) criteria for the composite structure.

Scoping for Bridge Widening and Liquefaction Mitigation The Region project manager should contact the Bridge Office for bridge widening and retaining wall scoping assistance before project funding commitments are made to the legislature and the public. The WSDOT Bridge and Structures office will work with the WSDOT Geotechnical Office to assess the potential for liquefaction or other seismic hazards that could affect the cost of the proposed structures. The initial evaluation design time and associated costs for the WSDOT Geotechnical and WSDOT Bridge and Structures offices shall be considered at the scoping phase.

Seismic Design and Retrofit
Design and Detailing Considerations Support Length – The support length at existing abutments, piers, in-span hinges, and pavement seats shall be checked. If there is a need for longitudinal restrainers, transverse restrainers, or additional support length on the existing structure, they shall be included in the widening design. Connections Between Existing and New Elements – Connections between the new elements and existing elements should be designed for maximum over-strength forces. Where yielding is expected in the crossbeam connection at the extreme event limit state, the new structure shall be designed to carry live loads independently at the Strength I limit state. In cases where large differential settlement and/or a liquefaction-induced loss of bearing strength are expected, the connections may be designed to deflect or hinge in order to isolate the two parts of the structure. Elements subject to inelastic behavior shall be designed and detailed to sustain the expected deformations. Longitudinal joints between the existing and new structure are not permitted. Differential Settlement – The geotechnical designer should evaluate the potential for differential settlement between the existing structure and widening structure. Additional geotechnical measures may be required to limit differential settlements to tolerable levels for both static and seismic conditions. The bridge designer shall evaluate, design, and detail all elements of new and existing portions of the widened structure for the differential settlement warranted by the WSDOT State Geotechnical Engineer. Angular distortions between adjacent foundations greater than 0.008 (RAD) in simple spans and 0.004 (RAD) in continuous spans should not be permitted in settlement criteria. The horizontal displacement of pile and shaft foundations shall be estimated using procedures that consider soil-structure interaction (see Geotechnical Design Manual Section 8.12.2.3). Horizontal movement criteria should be established at the top of the foundation based on the tolerance of the structure to lateral movement with consideration of the column length and stiffness. Tolerance of the superstructure to lateral movement will depend on bridge seat widths, bearing type(s), structure type, and load distribution effects. Foundation Types – The foundation type of the new structure should match that of the existing structure. However, a different type of foundation may be used for the new structure due to geotechnical recommendations or the limited space available between existing and new structures. For example, a shaft foundation may be used in lieu of spread footing. Existing Strutted Columns – The horizontal strut between existing columns may be removed. The existing columns shall then be analyzed with the new unbraced length and retrofitted if necessary. Non Structural Element Stiffness – Median barrier and other potentially stiffening elements shall be isolated from the columns to avoid any additional stiffness to the system. Deformation capacities of existing bridge members that do not meet current detailing standards shall be determined using the provisions of Section 7.8 of the Retrofitting Manual for Highway Structures: Part 1 – Bridges, FHWA-HRT-06-032. Deformation capacities of existing bridge members that meet current detailing standards shall be determined using the latest edition of the AASHTO SEISMIC.

with the requirements of the Seismic Retrofitting Manual. Displacement capacities shall be determined by the Method D2 – Structure Capacity/Demand (Pushover) Method of Section 5.6.
4.4.2
Seismic Retrofit Design Once seismically deficient bridge elements have been identified, appropriate retrofit measures shall be selected and designed. Table 1‑11, Chapters 8, 9, 10, 11, and Appendices D thru F of the Seismic Retrofitting Manual shall be used in selecting and designing the seismic retrofit measures. The WSDOT Bridge and Structure Office Seismic Specialist will be consulted in the selection and design of the retrofit measures.
4.4.3
Computer Analysis Verification The computer results will be verified to ensure accuracy and correctness. The designer should use the following procedures for model verification:
• Using graphics to check the orientation of all nodes, members, supports, joint, and member releases. Make sure that all the structural components and connections correctly model the actual structure.
• Check dead load reactions with hand calculations. The difference should be less than 5 percent.
• Calculate fundamental and subsequent modes by hand and compare results with computer results.
• Check the mode shapes and verify that structure movements are reasonable.
• Increase the number of modes to obtain 90 percent or more mass participation in each direction. GTSTRUDL/SAP2000 directly calculates the percentage of mass participation.
• Check the distribution of lateral forces. Are they consistent with column stiffness? Do small changes in stiffness of certain columns give predictable results?
4.4.4
Earthquake Restrainers Longitudinal restrainers shall be high strength steel rods conform to ASTM F 1554 Grade 105, including Supplement Requirements S2, S3 and S5. Nuts, and couplers if required, shall conform to ASTM A 563 Grade DH. Washers shall conform to AASHTO M 293. High strength steel rods and associated couplers, nuts and washers shall be galvanized after fabrication in accordance with AASHTO M 232. The length of longitudinal restrainers shall be less than 24 feet.
4.4.5
Isolation Bearings Isolation bearings may be used for seismic retrofit projects to reduce the demands through modification of the dynamic properties of the bridge as a viable alternative to strengthening weak elements of non-ductile bridge substructure members of existing bridge. Use of isolation bearings needs the approval of WSDOT State Bridge Design Engineer. Isolation bearings shall be designed per the requirements specified in Section 9.3.

Design of concrete structures shall be based on the requirements and guidance cited herein and in the current AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications (LRFD), AASHTO Guide Specifications for LRFD Seismic Bridge Design (SEISMIC), AASHTO Guide Specification for Accelerated Bridge Construction (ABC), Special Provisions and the Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction (Standard Specifications) M 41-10.

Strength of Concrete
Pacific NW aggregates have consistently resulted in concrete strengths, which may exceed 10,000 psi in 28 days. Specified concrete strengths should be rounded to the next highest 100 psi. 5.1.1.A.1
CIP Concrete Bridges
Since conditions for placing and curing concrete for CIP components are not as controlled as they are for precast bridge components, Class 4000 concrete is typically used. Where significant economy can be gained or structural requirements dictate, Class 5000 concrete may be used with the approvals of the State Bridge Design Engineer, State Bridge Construction Office, and WSDOT Materials Lab. 5.1.1.A.2
Prestressed Concrete Girders
The recommended specified 28-day concrete compressive strength (ƒ'c) is 7.0 ksi. Where higher strengths would eliminate a line of girders, a maximum of 10.0 ksi can be specified. Slab girders should be limited to 8.0 ksi. The minimum specified concrete compressive strength at release (ƒ'ci) is 5.0 ksi for prestressed concrete slab girders and 6.0 ksi for all other prestressed girders. Where higher strengths would eliminate a line of girders, the compressive strength at release may be increased up to 7.5 ksi. Release strengths as high as 8.5 ksi can be achieved with extended curing for special circumstances. Specified concrete strengths should generally be rounded to the nearest 0.1 ksi above what is required for design and constructability. 5.1.1.B

Class 5000 or Higher
Used in CIP post-tensioned concrete box girder construction, deep bridge foundations, or in other special structural applications if significant economy can be gained or structural requirements dictate. Class 5000 or higher concrete is generally available near large urban centers. Designers shall confirm availability at the project site before specifying Class 5000 or higher concrete (such as with WACA). The specified 28-day compressive strengths (ƒ'c) are equal to the numerical class of concrete. The compressive strengths for design are shown in Table 5.1.1-1. Table 5.1.1-1

5.1.1.C
Relative Compressive Concrete Strength
1.
During design or construction of a bridge, it is necessary to determine the strength of concrete at various stages of construction. For instance, Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(17)J discusses the time at which falsework and forms can be removed to various percentages of the concrete design strength. Occasionally, construction problems will arise which require a knowledge of the relative strengths of concrete at various ages. Table 5.1.1-2 shows the approximate values of the minimum compressive strengths of different classes of concrete at various ages. If the concrete has been cured under continuous moist curing at an average temperature, it can be assumed that these values have been developed.
2.
Curing of the concrete (especially in the first 24 hours) has a very important influence on the strength development of concrete at all ages. Temperature affects the rate at which the chemical reaction between cement and water takes place. Loss of moisture can seriously impair the concrete strength.
3.
If test strength is above or below that shown in Table 5.1.1-2, the age at which the design strength will be reached can be determined by direct proportion. For example, if the relative strength at 10 days is 64 percent instead of the minimum 70 percent shown in Table 5.1.1-2, the time it takes to reach the design strength can be determined using equation 5.1.1-1 below. Let x = relative strength to determine the age at which the concrete will reach the design strength

Modulus of Elasticity
The modulus of elasticity shall be determined as specified in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.4.2.4. For calculation of the modulus of elasticity, the unit weight of plain concrete (wc) shall be taken as 0.155 kcf for prestressed concrete girders and 0.150 kcf for normalweight concrete. The correction factor (K1) shall normally be taken as 1.0. 5.1.1.E

Shrinkage and CreepBridge & Structures Branch
Shrinkage and creep shall be calculated in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.4.2.3. The relative humidity, H, may be taken as 75 percent for standard conditions. The maturity of concrete, t, may be taken as 2,000 days for standard conditions. The volume-to-surface ratio, V/S, is given in Table 5.6.1‑1 for standard WSDOT prestressed concrete girders. In determining the maturity of concrete at initial loading, ti, one day of accelerated curing by steam or radiant heat may be taken as equal to seven days of normal curing.

Mass concrete is any volume of concrete with dimensions large enough to require that measures be taken to cope with the generation of heat from hydration of the cement and attendant volume change to minimize cracking. Temperature-related cracking may be experienced in thick-section concrete structures, including spread footings, pile caps, bridge piers, crossbeams, thick walls, and other structures as applicable. Concrete placements with least dimension greater than 6 feet should be considered mass concrete, although smaller placements with least dimension greater than 3 feet WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-5
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
may also have problems with heat generation effects. Shafts need not be considered mass concrete. The temperature of mass concrete shall not exceed 160°F. The temperature difference between the geometric center of the concrete and the center of nearby exterior surfaces shall not exceed 35°F. Designers could mitigate heat generation effects by specifying construction joints and placement intervals. Designers should consider requiring the Contractor to submit a thermal control plan, which may include such things as: 1.
Temperature monitors and equipment.
2.
Insulation.
3.
Concrete cooling before placement.
4.
Concrete cooling after placement, such as by means of internal cooling pipes.
5.
Use of smaller, less frequent placements.
6.
Other methods proposed by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer of Record.
Concrete mix design optimization, such as using low-heat cement, fly ash or slag cement, low-water/cement ratio, low cementitious materials content, larger aggregate, etc. is acceptable as long as the concrete mix meets the requirements of the Standard Specifications for the specified concrete class. The ACI Manual of Concrete Practice Publication 207 and specifications used for the Tacoma Narrows Bridge Project suspension cable anchorages (2003-2006) can be used as references. 5.1.1.I
Self-Consolidating Concrete (SCC) Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) may be used in structural members such as precast prestressed concrete girders, precast noise wall panels, barriers, three-sided structures, etc. as described in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(27). SCC may be specified for cast-in-place applications where the use of conventional concrete could be challenging and problematic. Examples are where new concrete is being cast up against an existing soffit, or in members with very dense/congested reinforcing steel. Use of SCC for primary structural components such as columns, crossbeams, slabs, etc., requires the approval of the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer.
5.1.1.J
Shotcrete
Shotcrete could be used as specified in WSDOT Standard Plans. Shotcrete may not be suitable for some critical applications unless approved by the Engineer of Record. Substitution of CIP conventional concrete in the contract document with shotcrete requires the approval of the Engineer of Record. Some potential shortfalls of shotcrete as compared to conventional CIP concrete include:
• Durability – Conventional concrete is placed in forms and vibrated for consolidation. Shotcrete, whether placed by wet or dry material feed, is pneumatically applied to the surface and is not consolidated as conventional concrete. Due to the difference in consolidation, permeability can be affected. If the permeability is not low enough, the service life of the shotcrete will be affected and may not meet the minimum of 75 years specified for conventional concretes. Page 5-6
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
Observation of some projects indicates the inadequate performance of shotcrete to properly hold back water. This results in leaking and potential freezing, seemingly at a higher rate than conventional concrete. Due to the method of placement of shotcrete, air entrainment is difficult to control. This leads to less resistance of freeze/thaw cycles.
• Cracking – There is more cracking observed in shotcrete surfaces compared to conventional concrete. Excessive cracking in shotcrete could be attributed to its higher shrinkage, method of curing, and lesser resistance to freeze/thaw cycles. The shotcrete cracking is more evident when structure is subjected to differential shrinkage.
• Corrosion Protection – The higher permeability of shotcrete places the steel reinforcement (whether mesh or bars) at a higher risk of corrosion than conventional concrete applications. Consideration for corrosion protection may be necessary for some critical shotcrete applications.
• Safety – Carved shotcrete and shotcrete that needs a high degree of relief to accent architectural features lead to areas of 4″-6″ of unreinforced shotcrete. These areas can be prone to an accelerated rate of deterioration. This, in turn, places pedestrians, bicyclists, and traffic next to the wall at risk of falling debris.
• Visual Quality and Corridor Continuity – As shotcrete is finished by hand, standard architectural design, as defined in the Design Manual M 22-01, typically cannot be met. This can create conflicts with the architectural guidelines developed for the corridor. Many times the guidelines are developed with public input. If the guidelines are not met, the public develops a distrust of the process. In other cases, the use of faux rock finishes, more commonly used by the private sector, can create the perception of the misuse of public funds. 5.1.1.K
Lightweight Aggregate Concrete
Lightweight aggregate concrete shall not be used on bridge decks or other components exposed to traffic wheel loads in service. 5.1.1.L
Concrete Cover to Reinforcement
Concrete cover to reinforcement shall conform to AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.1. 5.1.1.L.1
Precast Prestressed Concrete Girders
Cover to prestressing strands in precast prestressed concrete girders may be measured to the center of the strand. Cover to mild steel reinforcement in precast prestressed concrete girders shall conform to AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.1. However, cover to ties and stirrups may be reduced to 1.0 inch in “Exterior other than above” applications. See Section 5.6.7.A for additional cover requirements for deck girders. 5.1.1.L.2
Concrete Exposed to Salt/Seawater
Salt/sea water can be an aggressive corrosive environment that significantly shortens the service life of reinforced concrete structures. ACI 201.2R 7.2.1 provides some guidance on severity of exposure: “The severity of marine exposures can vary greatly within a given concrete structure. In general, continuous submersion is the least aggressive exposure. Areas where capillary suction and evaporation are prevalent are the most aggressive WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-7
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
because these processes tend to increase the concentration of salts. Examples of such exposures include reclaimed coastal areas with foundations below saline groundwater level, intertidal zones, and splash zones. ”Corrosive water or soil contains greater or equal to 500 part per million (ppm) of chlorides. Sites that are considered corrosive due soley to sulfate content greater than or equal to 2,000 ppm and/or a pH of less than or equal to 5.5 should be considered non-corrosive in determining minimum cover. Designers shall provide the minimum cover specified in AASHTO LRFD Table 5.12.3-1 to concrete structures with direct exposure to salt/sea water such as the Pacific Ocean and the Puget Sound. However, use of other corrosion mitigation strategies described in ACI 201.2R 7.2.3 and ACI 357.3R could be used to reduce this cover or provide additional protection such as minimizing concrete permeability, using corrosion resistant reinforcement, cathodic protection, treatments that penetrate or are applied on the surface of the concrete to slow the entry of chloride ions, etc. 5.1.1.M
Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC)
Ultra-high performance concrete is allowed for field cast-connections between precast elements. It may be used for repairs, overlays or other uses with State Bridge Design Engineer approval. WSDOT has funded two research projects with the Washington State University and the University of Washington studying the connection of wide flange deck girders using UHPC. The material studied is a high strength, high bond, fiber reinforced, flowable concrete capable of developing non-contact lap splices in a short distance. The material studied does not provide the same properties as common prepackaged commercial UHPC products, but it is capable of developing compact field connections between precast elements using locally available materials.
5.1.2
Reinforcing Steel 5.1.2.A
Types and Grades
Steel reinforcement conforming to ASTM A 706 provides controlled ductility and enhanced weldability. Steel reinforcement for cast-in-place components and precast substructure components of bridges shall conform to ASTM A 706 unless noted otherwise. Steel reinforcement for precast bridge superstructure components, precast buried structures, retaining walls, barriers and other structures not designed for ductile seismic behavior shall conform to either ASTM A 706 or AASHTO M31 (ASTM A615). Steel reinforcement that is welded shall conform to ASTM A 706. Grade 60 is the preferred grade for most components and structures. Grade 80 highstrength reinforcing steel may be used selectively to reduce congestion, reduce weight, speed up installation and/or reduce cost where its use is permitted and economical. Bridge decks, crossbeams, spread footings and foundation caps are components where Grade 80 longitudinal reinforcement could be economical. See Section 4.2.20 for additional seismic design requirements. Designers should consider the need for additional development length when using high strength reinforcing steel. For improved economy, designers should minimize the number of different bar sizes on a job which use high-strength reinforcement. Where high-strength steel reinforcement is used in combination with Grade 60 reinforcement, designers should avoid specifying higher grades for bar sizes that Grade 60 is specified. This practice prevents confusion and improper installation on site. Mechanical couplers

are available for high-strength reinforcement, but splices should be staggered and located in regions of low stress. Transverse steel reinforcement for shear and torsion with a yield strength, fy, in excess of 75 ksi shall use 75 ksi for resistance calculations. The limit of 75 ksi is intended to maintain the concrete’s effectiveness in resisting shear by limiting the size of diagonal cracks that develop. 5.1.2.A.1
Corrosion Resistant Reinforcement
Corrosion resistant reinforcing such as stainless steel, chromium steel, galvanized steel or epoxy-coated steel may be used where added corrosion protection is needed. Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars may be used with State Bridge Design Engineer approval. Epoxy-coated reinforcing is a preferred and economical method of enhanced corrosion protection compared to uncoated steel reinforcing. See Section 5.7.4 for use in Bridge Deck Protection Systems. Plans shall designate bar marks with “E”. Galvanized steel reinforcing shall conform to either ASTM A767 Class 1 or ASTM A1094. Chromate treatment of galvanized steel shall be left as optional for the contractor. Plans shall designate bar marks with “G”. Stainless steel reinforcing shall conform to ASTM A955, UNS S24100, UNS S31653 or UNS31803. Plans shall designate bar marks with "SS". Corrosion resistant chromium alloyed reinforcing such as ChromX® (alternatively MMFX) shall conform to ASTM A1035 Type CM or CS. Type CS (with 9% chromium and a higher level of corrosion resistance) should be used where corrosion resistance beyond that of epoxy-coated reinforcing is desired. This reinforcement may be used in the design of bridge decks, substructure and foundation members where rebar congestion is a concern or where corrosion protection is needed. Contract documents should avoid referring to reinforcement by trade names, such as ChromX® or MMFX. Plans shall designate bar marks with “CR”. GFRP reinforcing shall conform to the requirements of ASTM D7957. This type of reinforcing bar may be used in bridge decks in any Seismic Design Category, and in crossbeams and foundations in Seismic Design Category A. Design shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Guide Specifications for GRFP-Reinforced Concrete, 2nd Edition. Plans shall designate bar marks with "GF". Engineers shall minimize the potential for dissimilar metal corrosion when combining different types of reinforcing steel in a structure. Where corrosion resistant steel is used, specifications shall be provided to require industry standard best-practices for fabrication, handling, placing and protection. 5.1.2.B
Sizes
Reinforcing bars are referred to in the contract plans and specifications by number and vary in size from #3 to #18. For bars up to and including #8, the number of the bar coincides with the bar diameter in eighths of an inch. The #9, #10, and #11 bars have diameters that provide areas equal to 1″ × 1″ square bars, 1⅛″ × 1⅛″ square bars and 1¼″ × 1¼″ square bars respectively. Similarly, the #14 and #18 bars correspond to 1½″ × 1½″ and 2″ × 2″ square bars, respectively. Appendix 5.1-A3 shows the sizes, number, and various properties of the types of bars used in Washington State.

Development
5.1.2.C.1
Tension Development Length
Development length or anchorage of reinforcement is required on both sides of a point of maximum stress at any section of a reinforced concrete member. Development of reinforcement in tension shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.8.2.1. Appendix 5.1-A4 shows the tension development length for both uncoated and epoxy coated Grade 60 bars for normal weight concrete with specified strengths of 4.0 to 6.0 ksi. 5.1.2.C.2
Compression Development Length
Development of reinforcement in compression shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.8.2.2. The basic development lengths for deformed bars in compression are shown in Appendix 5.1-A5. These values may be modified as described in AASHTO. However, the minimum development length shall be 1′-0″. 5.1.2.C.3
Tension Development Length of Standard Hooks
Standard hooks are used to develop bars in tension where space limitations restrict the use of straight bars. Development of standard hooks in tension shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.8.2.4. Tension development lengths of 90° & 180° standard hooks are shown in Appendix 5.1-A6. 5.1.2.D
Splices
The Contract Plans shall clearly show the locations and lengths of splices. Splices shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.8.4. Lap splices, for either tension or compression bars, shall not be less than 2′-0″. 5.1.2.D.1
Tension Lap Splices
Many of the same factors which affect development length affect splices. Consequently, tension lap splices are a function of the bar’s development length, ld. There are two classes of tension lap splices: Class A and B. Designers are encouraged to splice bars at points of minimum stress and to stagger lap splices along the length of the bars. Appendix 5.1-A7 shows tension lap splices for both uncoated and epoxy coated Grade 60 bars for normal weight concrete with specified strengths of 4.0 to 6.0 ksi. 5.1.2.D.2
Compression Lap Splices
Compression lap splice lengths are shown in Appendix 5.1-A5 for concrete strengths greater than or equal to 3.0 ksi. 5.1.2.D.3
Mechanical Splices
Mechanical splices are proprietary splicing mechanisms. The requirements for mechanical splices are found in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(24)F and in AASHTO LRFD Sections 5.5.3.4 and 5.10.8.4.2b.

AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.8.4.2c describes the requirements for welded splices. On modifications to existing structures, welding of reinforcing bars may not be possible because of the non‑weldability of some steels. 5.1.2.E
Hooks and Bends
For hook and bend requirements, see AASHTO LRFD Section 5.10.2. Standard hooks and bend radii are shown in Appendix 5.1-A1 for steel reinforcing bars with yield strengths up to 100 ksi. Additional tie reinforcement may be required to anchor hooked bars when the yield strength exceeds 75 ksi. When specifying and detailing galvanized reinforcing, designers should consider that larger bend diameters will be provided if the contractor elects to galvanize bars after fabrication. These diameters (see ASTM A 767) differ from standard CRSI requirements for 180 degree hooks on #7 and #8 bars and all stirrup/tie hooks. When using GFRP bars, detailed bends should be avoided where possible. If bent bars are necessary, they should be coordinated with suppliers during design. Headed bar may be an acceptable alternative. 5.1.2.F
Fabrication Lengths
Reinforcing bars are available in standard mill lengths of 40′ for bar sizes #3 and #4 and 60′ for bar sizes of #5 and greater. Designers shall limit reinforcing bar lengths to the standard mill lengths. Because of placement considerations, designers should consider limiting the overall lengths of bar size #3 to 30′ and bar size #5 to 40′. Spirals of bar sizes #4 through #6 are available on 5,000 lb coils. Spirals should be limited to a maximum bar size of #6. Straight galvanized reinforcing bars should be limited to a 40’ maximum length. Straight stainless steel reinforcing bars should be limited to a 40’ maximum length for #3#18 bar. Corrosion resistant reinforcing (ASTM A 1035) is available in 60’ lengths for #4-#18 bar. GFRP reinforcing bars should be limited to a 40’ maximum length. For some materials, longer bars are possible. But the designer should coordinate with suppliers during design prior to specifying them. Longer bars can increase lead time and/ or limit suppliers. Optional lap splices should be provided at the recommended maximum bar length where possible. 5.1.2.G
Placement
Placement of reinforcing bars can be a challenge during construction. If reinforcement is congested, as is common in column joints, additional details are recommended in the contract plans showing how each bar is placed. Appendix 5.1-A2 shows the minimum clearance and spacing of reinforcement for beams and columns. High-strength reinforcement is one possible method to reduce congestion.

If not properly reinforced, the resisting corner moment may be less than the applied moment. Reinforced as shown in Figure 5.1.2-3, but without the diagonal reinforcing steel across the corner, the section will develop 85 percent of the ultimate moment capacity of the wall. If the bends were rotated 180°, only 30 percent of the wall capacity would be developed.

Adding diagonal reinforcing steel across the corner, approximately equal to 50 percent of the main reinforcing steel, will develop the corner strength to fully resist the applied moment. Extend the diagonal reinforcement past the corner each direction for anchorage. Since this bar arrangement will fully develop the resisting moment, a fillet in the corner is normally unnecessary.

Welded Wire Reinforcement Welded wire reinforcement may be used to replace steel reinforcing bars in prestressed concrete girders, precast buried structures walls, barriers, and precast deck panels. Welded wire shall be deformed and shall conform to the requirements of AASHTO M336/ ASTM A 1064. Epoxy-coated wire and welded wire reinforcement shall conform to Standard Specifications Section 9-07.3 with the exception that ASTM A884 Class A Type I shall be used instead of ASTM A775. Galvanized welded wire reinforcement shall conform to the requirements of ASTM A1060. Stainless steel welded wire reinforcement shall conform to the requirements of ASTM A1022. Welded wire reinforcement shall be deformed. The specified minimum yield strength shall be limited to a maximum of 75 ksi. Longitudinal wires and welds shall be excluded from regions with high shear demands, including girder webs, and are limited to the flange areas as described in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.8.2.8. Longitudinal wires for anchorage of welded wire reinforcement shall have an area of 40 percent or more of the area of the wire being anchored as described in ASTM A497 but shall not be less than D4.
5.1.2.J
Headed Steel Reinforcing Bars
Headed steel reinforcing bars conforming to ASTM A970 Class HA may be used to develop reinforcement in tension. Use and development length shall be in accordance with ACI 318 (see Section 25.4.4 for development length). Minimum concrete cover and clearances to headed steel reinforcing bars shall also be provided to the outermost part of the head of the bar. Designers shall provide main bar (unheaded portion) location requirements in contract documents and verify that cover and clearance requirements to the head of the bar can be satisfied. ASTM A970 Class HA requires that the net bearing area of the head shall not be less than four times the nominal cross-sectional area of the bar. However, the head shape and an upper limit to the head net bearing area are not specified. A gross head area of ten times the bar area (a net bearing area of the head of nine times the bar area) could be used as an estimate of the upper limit of the head area.

Prestressing Steel 5.1.3.A
General
Three types of high-tensile steel used for prestressing steel are: 1.
Strands AASHTO M 203 Grade 270, low relaxation
2.
Bars AASHTO M 275 Type II
3.
Parallel Wires AASHTO M 204 Type WA
All WSDOT designs are based on low relaxation strands using either 0.5″ or 0.6″ diameter strands for girders, and ⅜″ or 7/16″ diameter strands for stay-in-place precast deck panels. Properties of uncoated and epoxy-coated prestressing stands are shown in Appendix 5.1-A8. 0.62″ and 0.7″ diameter strands may be used for top temporary strands in prestressed concrete girders when 10 0.6” diameter temporary top strands are not sufficient for temporary handling cases. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
Provide adequate concrete cover and consider use of epoxy coated prestressing reinforcement in coastal areas or where members are directly exposed to salt water. 5.1.3.B
Stress Limits
Stress limits for prestressing steel are as listed in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.9.2.2. 5.1.3.C
Prestressing Strands
Standard strand patterns for all types of WSDOT prestressed concrete girders are shown on the Bridge Standard Drawings website (www.wsdot.wa.gov/Bridge/Structures/ StandardDrawings.htm). 5.1.3.C.1
Straight Strands
The position of the straight strands in the bottom flange is standardized for each girder type. 5.1.3.C.2
Harped Strands
The harped strands are bundled between the harping points (the 0.4 and 0.6 points of the girder length). The girder fabricator shall select a bundle configuration that meets plan centroid requirements. There are practical limitations to how close the centroid of harped strands can be to the bottom of a girder. The minimum design value for this shall be determined using the following guide: Up to 12 harped strands are placed in a single bundle with the centroid 4″ above the bottom of the girder. Additional strands are placed in twelve-strand bundles with centroids at 3″ spacing vertically upwards. At the girder ends, the strands are splayed to a normal pattern. The centroid of strands at both the girder end and the harping point may be varied to suit girder stress requirements. The slope of any individual harped strands shall not be steeper than 8 horizontal to 1 vertical for 0.6″ diameter strands, and 6 horizontal to 1 vertical for 0.5″ diameter strands. The harped strand exit location at the girder ends shall be held as low as possible while maintaining the concrete stresses within allowable limits. 5.1.3.C.3
Temporary Strands
Temporary strands in the top flanges of prestressed concrete girders may be required for stability (see Section 5.6.3). These strands shall be considered to be pretensioned for design purposes, but may be post-tensioned at the manufacturer's discretion depending on pretensioning bed capacity. If the strands are post-tensioned, calculations shall be provided by the manufacturer considering the timing of post-tensioning (before or after lifting from the form). It is more efficient to post-tension the strands after removal of the girder from the form if they are not needed for stability during lifting. The calculations shall consider the effects on camber from any revisions to the concrete strength at transfer and timing of post-tensioning. In no case shall the temporary top strands be posttensioned more than 48 hours after transfer of permanent pretensioning. These strands can be considered in design to reduce the required strength at release, to provide stability during handling and shipping, and to reduce the “A” dimension. These strands must be cut before the CIP intermediate diaphragms are placed.

Development of Prestressing Strand
5.1.3.D.1
General
Development of prestressing strand shall be as described in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.9.4.3. The development length of bonded uncoated & coated prestressing strands are shown in Appendix 5.1-A8. 5.1.3.D.2
Partially Debonded Strands
Where it is necessary to prevent a strand from actively supplying prestress force near the end of a girder, it shall be debonded. This can be accomplished by taping a close fitting PVC tube to the stressed strand from the end of the girder to some point where the strand can be allowed to develop its load. Since this is not a common procedure, it shall be carefully detailed on the plans. It is important when this method is used in construction that the taping of the tube is done in such a manner that concrete cannot leak into the tube and provide an undesirable bond of the strand. Partially debonded strands shall meet the requirements of AASHTO LRFD Section 5.9.4.3.3. 5.1.3.D.3
Strand Development Outside of Prestressed Concrete Girders

Anchorage of extended strands is essential for all prestressed concrete girder bridges with fixed diaphragms at intermediate piers. Extended strand anchorage may be achieved by directly overlapping extended strands, by use of strand, by the use of the crossbeam ties along with strand ties, or by a combination of all three methods. The following methods in order of hierarchy shall be used for all prestressed concrete girders for creating continuity of extended strands: Method 1 – Direct extended strands overlapping shall be used at intermediate piers without any angle point due to horizontal curvature and for any crossbeam width. This is the preferred method of achieving extended strand continuity. Congestion of reinforcement and girder setting constructability shall be considered when large numbers of extended strands are required. In these cases, strand ties may be used in conjunction with extended strands. See Figure 5.1.3-3 Figure 5.1.3-3

Method 2 – Strand ties shall be used at intermediate piers with a girder angle point due to horizontal curvature where extended strands are not parallel and would cross during girder placement. Crossbeam widths shall be greater than or equal to 6 feet measured along the skew. It is preferable that strand ties be used for all extended strands, however if the region becomes too congested for rebar placement and concrete consolidation, additional forces may be carried by crossbeam ties up to a ¢ GIR 8D maximum limit as specified in equation 5.1.3-6.

ANCHOR (TYP.) (TYP.) Method 3 – For STRAND crossbeams with widths less than 6′ and a girder angle point due to horizontal curvature, strand ties shall be used if a minimum of 8″ of lap can be STRAND GEOMETRY provided between the extended strandTIE and strand tie. In this case the strand ties shall be considered fully effective. For cases where less than 8″ of lap is provided, the effectiveness of the strand tie shall be reduced proportional to the reduction in lap. All additional forces not taken by strand ties must be carried by crossbeam ties up to the maximum limit as specified in equation 5.1.3-6. If this limit is exceeded, the geometry of the width of the crossbeam shall be increased to provide sufficient lap for the strand ties. See Figure 5.1.3-5.

Concrete Structures
The elastic gain due to slab shrinkage, ΔfpSS, shall be computed in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.9.3.4.3d. Deck shrinkage shall be considered as an external force applied to the composite section for the Service I, Service III, and Fatigue I limit states. This force is applied at the center of the deck with an eccentricity from the center of the deck to the center of gravity of the composite section. This force causes compression in the top of the girder, tension in the bottom of the girder, and an increase in the effective prestress force (an elastic gain). The deck shrinkage strain shall be computed as 50 percent of the strain determined by AASHTO LRFD Equation 5.4.2.3.3-1. 5.1.4.E
Temporary Losses
For checking stresses during release, lifting, transportation, and erection of prestressed concrete girders, the elastic and time-dependent losses may be computed based on the following assumptions. 5.1.4.E.1
Lifting of Girders From Casting Beds
For normal construction, forms are stripped and girders are lifted from the casting bed within one day. 5.1.4.E.2
Transportation
Girders are most difficult to transport at a young age. The hauling configuration causes reduced dead load moments in the girder and the potential for overstress between the harping points. Overstress may also occur at the support points depending on the prestressing and the trucking configuration. This is compounded by the magnitude of the prestress force not having been reduced by losses. For an aggressive construction schedule girders are typically transported to the job site around day 10. When losses are estimated by the Approximate Estimate of AASHTO LRFD Section 5.9.3.3, the losses at the time of hauling may be estimated by: (5 .1 .4-8) (5 .1 .4-8)

Erection
During construction, the non-composite girders must carry the full weight of the deck slab and interior diaphragms. This loading typically occurs around 120 days for a normal construction schedule. 5.1.4.E.4
Final Configuration
The composite slab and girder section must carry all conceivable loads including superimposed dead loads such as traffic barriers, overlays, and live loads. It is assumed that superimposed dead loads are placed at 120 days and final losses occur at 2,000 days.

Prestressing Anchorage Systems Multistrand grouted tendons with steel strand are the preferred system for posttensioned concrete bridge superstructures, spliced girders, and bridge components. For post-tensioned concrete bridge decks, unbonded single strand post tensioning systems may be used. The use of other post-tensioning systems and materials shall require the approval of the Bridge Design Engineer. Multistrand and grouted post-tensioning systems for permanent construction shall be designed and constructed in accordance with Protection Level 2 (PL-2) practices, as defined by the requirements of PTI/ASBI M50.3-19 Specification for Multistrand and Grouted Post-Tensioning and PTI M55.1-19 Specification for Grouting of Post-Tensioned Structures. Unbonded single strand post-tensioning systems shall be designed and constructed in accordance with PTI M10.2-17 Specification for Unbonded Single Strand Tendons. Designers should consult post-tensioning system supplier product guides to ensure that multiple suppliers can satisfy the design. Corrugated plastic duct shall be used and shall conform to standard sizes where possible. Common post-tensioning system component sizes and combinations are shown in Table 5.1.5-1. The nominal diameter for plastic duct may be used when interpreting code provisions that reference duct size or diameter without further clarification (i.e. inside diameter, outside diameter, etc.).

Design Considerations
5.2.1
Service and Fatigue Limit States 5.2.1.A
General
Service limit state is used to satisfy stress limit, deflection, and control of cracking requirements. Design aids for tensile stress in reinforcement at the service limit state, ƒss, are provided in Appendices 5.2-A1, 5.2-A2, and 5.2‑A3. 5.2.1.B
Control of Cracking
Reinforcement shall be provided and spaced to meet the requirements in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.6.7 “Control of Cracking by Distribution of Reinforcement.” The exposure factor shall be based upon a Class 2 exposure condition. 5.2.1.C
Stress Limits in Prestressed Concrete Members
Allowable concrete stresses for the service and fatigue limit states are shown in Table 5.2.1-1. For prestressed concrete girders, the concrete stress limits shall be satisfied at all pre-service stages of girder construction and in service in accordance with Section 5.6.2.C. The tensile stress in the precompressed tensile zone for the final service load condition (Service III) is limited to zero. This prevents cracking of the concrete during the service life of the structure and provides additional stress and strength capacity for overloads. The controlling locations for temporary compressive stress with and without lateral bending are shown in Figure 5.2.1-1. For tensile stress limits that require bonded reinforcement sufficient to resist the tensile force in the concrete, the tensile force shall be computed using the procedure illustrated in Figure 5.2.1-2 assuming an uncracked section. The bonded reinforcement is proportioned using a stress of 0.5fy, not to exceed 30 ksi. Individual reinforcing bars are only considered if they are fully developed and are located within the tensile stress region of the member. The variable λ is the concrete density modification factor calculated in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.4.2.8. For precast prestressed segments that are continuous over supports, such as in spliced girders, the tensile stress limits at service limit states shall apply for the precast segment, but need not be applied to a CIP bridge deck.

Flexure
Design for flexural force effects shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.6. For prestressed concrete girders, the approximate methods of AASHTO LRFD Section 5.6.3 underestimate the flexural strength of the composite deck-girder system2, 23. Strain compatibility approaches such as the PCI Bridge Design Manual3 method (PCI BDM Section 8.2.2.5) and the Nonlinear Strain Compatibility Analysis method in the PCI Journal23 are recommended. In addition to the effective area of the deck, the top flange of the girder and the mild reinforcement in the deck and the top flange of the girder may be included in the analysis. The typical section for computation of prestressed concrete girder composite section properties is shown in Figure 5.6.2-1.

AASHTO LRFD Section 5.7 addresses shear design of concrete members. 1.
The shear design of prestressed members shall be based on the general procedure of AASHTO LRFD Section 5.7.3.4.2.

The strut-and-tie model shall be employed as required by AASHTO LRFD Sections 5.7.1.1 and 2 for regions adjacent to abrupt changes in cross-section, openings, draped ends, deep beams, corbels, integral bent caps, c-bent caps, outrigger bents, deep footings, pile caps, etc.
4.
The maximum spacing of transverse reinforcement is limited to 18 inches.
For prestressed concrete girders, shear for the critical section at dv from the internal face of the support and at the harping point are of particular interest. 5.2.2.C
Interface Shear
Interface shear transfer (shear friction) design is to be performed in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.7.4. If a roughened surface is required for shear transfer at construction joints in new construction, they shall be identified in the plans. See Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(12)A. When designing for shear transfer between new and existing concrete, the designer shall consider the high construction cost associated with roughening existing concrete surfaces. Whenever practical, the design for placing new concrete against existing concrete shall be completed such that roughening of the existing concrete surfaces is not required (i.e. use cohesion and friction factors for a surface that is not intentionally roughened).

Chapter 5
Interface shear in prestressed concrete girder design is critical at the interface connection between deck slab and girder, and at the end connection of the girder to a diaphragm or crossbeam. Shear in these areas is resisted by roughened or saw-tooth shear keyed concrete as well as reinforcement extending from the girder. 5.2.2.C.1
Interface Shear Between Deck Slab and Girder
The top surfaces of prestressed concrete girders with cast-in-place decks shall be roughened as described in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25)H. The interface shear is resisted by the girder stirrups which extend up into the deck slab as well as the roughened top surface of the girder top flange. It is conservative to compute the interface shear force using the full factored loading applied to the composite deck slab and girder. However, the interface shear force need only be computed from factored loads applied to the composite section after the deck slab is placed such as superimposed dead loads and live loads. For Stay-in-Place (SIP) deck systems, only the roughened top flange surface between SIP panel supports (and the portion of the permanent net compressive force Pc on that section) is considered engaged in interface shear transfer. 5.2.2.C.2
Interface Shear Friction at Girder End
A prestressed concrete girder may be required to carry shears at the end surface of the girder. An end condition at an intermediate pier crossbeam is shown in Figure 5.2.2-2. The shear which must be carried along the interface A-A is the actual factored shear acting on the section. The portion of the girder end that is roughened with saw-toothed shear keys shown on the standard girder plans may be considered as a “surface intentionally roughened to an amplitude of 0.25 inches”. Shear resistance must be developed using interface shear theory assuming the longitudinal bars and the extended strands are actively participating. The main longitudinal deck slab reinforcement is already fully stressed by negative bending moments and thus cannot be considered for shear requirements. All bars, including the extended strands, must be properly anchored in order to be considered effective. This anchorage requirement must be clearly shown on the plans. Similar requirements exist for connecting the end diaphragm at bridge ends where the diaphragm is cast on the girders (girder End Type A). In this case, however, loads consist only of the factored diaphragm dead load, approach slab dead load, and those wheel loads which can distribute to the interface. Longitudinal reinforcement provided at girder ends shall be identical in both ends of the girder for construction simplicity. The program PGSuper does not check interface shear friction at girder ends. Standard girder plan details are adequate for girder End Types A and B. Standard girder plan details shall be checked for adequacy for girder End Types C and D.

5.2.2.D
Shear and Torsion
The design for shear and torsion is based on ACI 318-02 Building Code4 Requirements for Structural Concrete and Commentary (318F‑02) and is satisfactory for bridge members with dimensions similar to those normally used in buildings. AASHTO LRFD Section 5.7.3.6 may also be used for design. According to Hsu5, utilizing ACI 318-02 is awkward and overly conservative when applied to large-size hollow members. Collins and Mitchell6 propose a rational design method for shear and torsion based on the compression field theory or strut-and-tie method for both prestressed and non-prestressed concrete beams. These methods assume that diagonal compressive stresses can be transmitted through cracked concrete. Also, shear stresses are transmitted from one face of the crack to the other by a combination of aggregate interlock and dowel action of the stirrups. E

Deflection and Camber 5.2.4.A
General
Flexural members are designed to have adequate stiffness to limit deflections or any deformations which may adversely affect the strength or serviceability of the structure at service load plus impact. The minimum superstructure depths are specified in AASHTO LRFD Table 2.5.2.6.3-1 and deflections shall be computed in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.6.3.5.2. Accurate predictions of deflections are difficult to determine, since modulus of elasticity of concrete, Ec, varies with stress and age of concrete. Also, the effects of creep on deflections are difficult to estimate. For practical purposes, an accuracy of 10 to 20 percent is often sufficient. Prestressing can be used advantageously to control deflections; however, there are cases where excessive camber due to prestress has caused problems. 5.2.4.B
Deflection Calculation for Prestressed Concrete Girders
The “D” dimension is the computed girder deflection at midspan (positive upward) immediately prior to deck slab placement. Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25)K defines two levels of girder camber at the time the deck concrete is placed, denoted D @ 40 Days and D @ 120 Days. They shall be shown in the plans to provide the contractor with lower and upper bounds of camber that can be anticipated in the field. PGSuper calculates estimated cambers at 40 days (D40) and 120 days (D120). Due to variations in observed camber, these estimated cambers are generally considered to be upper bounds at their respective times. This is based on measured girder cambers of prestressed concrete girders compared with the estimated cambers from PGSuper. D @ 120 Days is the upper bound of expected camber range at a girder age of 120 days after the release of prestress and is primarily intended to mitigate interference between the top of the cambered girder and the placement of concrete deck reinforcement. It is also used to calculate the “A” dimension at the girder ends. The age of 120 days was chosen because data has shown that additional camber growth after this age is negligible. D @ 120 Days may be taken as D120, the estimated camber at 120 days reported by PGSuper. D @ 40 Days is the lower bound of expected camber range at a girder age of 40 days (30 days after the earliest allowable girder shipping age of 10 days). To match the profile grade, girders with too little camber require an increased volume of haunch concrete along the girder length. For girders with large flange widths, such as the WF series, this can add up to significant quantities of additional concrete for a large deck placement. Thus, the lower bound of camber allows the contractor to assess the risk of increased concrete quantities and mitigates claims for additional material. D @ 40 Days shall be taken as 50 percent of D40, the estimated camber at 40 days reported by PGSuper. Figure 5.2.4-1 shows a typical pattern of girder deflection with time at centerline span. Portions of this characteristic curve are described below. The subparagraph numbers correspond to circled numbers on the curve.

5.2.4.B.1
Elastic Deflection Due to Release of Prestress
The prestress force produces moments in the girder tending to bow the girder upward. Resisting these moments are girder section dead load moments. The result is a net upward deflection. 5.2.4.B.2
Creep Deflection Before Cutting Temporary Strands
The girder continues to deflect upward due to the effect of creep. This effect is computed using the equation stated in Section 5.1.1E. 5.2.4.B.3
Deflection Due to Cutting of Temporary Strands
Cutting of temporary strands results in an elastic upward deflection. The default time interval for creep calculations for release of top temporary strands is 90 days after the release of prestress during girder fabrication for D120 (10 days for D40). 5.2.4.B.4
Diaphragm Load Deflection
The load of diaphragm is applied to the girder section resulting in an elastic downward deflection. The default time interval for creep calculations for placing diaphragms is 90 days after the release of prestress during girder fabrication for D120 (10 days for D40). 5.2.4.B.5
Creep Deflection After Casting Diaphragms
The girder continues to deflect upward for any time delay between diaphragms and deck slab casting. 5.2.4.B.6
Deck Slab Load Deflection
The load of the deck slab is applied to the girder section resulting in an elastic downward deflection. The default time interval for creep calculations for placing the deck slab is 120 days after the release of prestress during girder fabrication for D120 (40 days for D40). 5.2.4.B.7
Superimposed Dead Load Deflection
The load of the traffic barriers, sidewalk, overlay, etc. is applied to the composite girder section resulting in an elastic downward deflection. 5.2.4.B.8
Final Camber
It might be expected that the above deck slab dead load deflection would be accompanied by a continuing downward deflection due to creep. However, many measurements of actual structure deflections have shown that once the deck slab is poured, the girder tends to act as though it is locked in position. To obtain a smooth riding surface on the deck, the deflection indicated on Figure 5.2.4-1 as “Screed Camber” (known as “C”) is added to the profile grade elevation of the deck screeds. The “C” dimension and the “Screed Setting Dimensions” detail shall be given in the plans. 5.2.4.C
Pre-camber
Prestressed concrete girders may be precambered to compensate for the natural camber and for the effect of the roadway geometry.

Reinforced Concrete Box Girder Bridges Post-tensioning shall be required for all new CIP reinforced concrete single-span or multispan box girder bridges. The use of CIP reinforced concrete (RC) box girder bridges without post-tensioning shall be restricted to widening existing RC box girder bridges. RC box girder bridges may also be used for bridges with tight curvatures or irregular geometry upon the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer’s approval. Partial prestressing shall not be considered for design of RC box girders. The performance and longevity of RC box girder bridges have been a major concern. Cracking in RC box girders are flexural in nature and are an inherent part of reinforced concrete design. RC box girders are designed for ultimate strength and checked for distribution of reinforcement for service conditions and control of cracking. This means that the concrete cracks under applied loads but the cracks are under control. Open cracks in RC box girders result in rebar corrosion and concrete deterioration, affecting the bridge longevity. Post-tensioning RC box girders eliminates cracks, limits corrosion, and improves structural performance. The above requirements apply equally to RC T-beam and slab bridges. However, these types of superstructures are not encouraged. See also Sections 2.4.1.C and 2.4.1.D.
5.3.1
Box Girder Basic Geometries 5.3.1.A
Web Spacing
The most economical web spacing for ordinary box girder bridges varies from about 8 to 12 feet. Greater girder spacing requires some increase in both top and bottom slab thickness, but the cost of the additional concrete can be offset by decreasing the total number of girder stems. Fewer girder stems reduces the amount of form work required and can lower costs. The number of girder stems can be reduced by cantilevering the top slab beyond the exterior girders. A deck overhang of approximately one-half the girder spacing generally gives satisfactory results. This procedure usually results in a more aesthetic as well as a more economical bridge. For girder stem spacing in excess of 12 feet or cantilever overhang in excess of 6 feet, transverse post-tensioning shall be used. 5.3.1.B
Basic Dimensions
The basic dimensions for concrete box girders with vertical and sloped exterior webs are shown in Figures 5.3.1-1 and 5.3.1-2, respectively. 5.3.1.B.1

Construction Considerations
Review the following construction considerations to minimize constructability problems: 1.
Construction joints at slab/stem interface or fillet/stem interface at top slab are appropriate.
2.
All construction joints to have roughened surfaces.
3.
Bottom slab is parallel to top slab (constant depth).
4.
Girder stems are vertical.
5.
Dead load deflection and camber to nearest ⅛″.
6.
Skew and curvature effects have been considered.
7.
Thermal effects have been considered.
8.
The potential for falsework settlement is acceptable. This always requires added stirrup reinforcement in sloped outer webs.
5.3.1.D
Load Distribution
5.3.1.D.1
Unit Design
According to the AASHTO LRFD, the entire slab width shall be assumed effective for compression. It is both economical and desirable to design the entire superstructure as a unit rather than as individual girders. When a reinforced box girder bridge is designed as an individual girder with a deck overhang, the positive reinforcement is congested in the exterior cells. The unit design method permits distributing all girder reinforcement uniformly throughout the width of the structure. 5.3.1.D.2
Dead Loads
Include additional D.L. for top deck forms: 5 pounds per square foot of the area. 10 pounds per square foot if web spacing > 10′-0″. 5.3.1.D.3
Live Load
See Section 3.9.4 for live load distribution to superstructure and substructure.

Such reinforcement may be included in strength computations if a strain compatibility analysis is made to determine stresses in the individual bars or wires. The total area of longitudinal skin reinforcement in both faces need not exceed one half of the required flexural tensile reinforcement. For CIP sloped outer webs, increase inside stirrup reinforcement and bottom slab top transverse reinforcement as required for the web moment locked-in during construction of the top slab.

Notes: 1. The diagonal brace supports web forms during web pour. After cure, the web is stiffer than the brace, and the web attracts load from subsequent concrete placements. 2. The tributary load includes half the overhang because the outer web form remains tied to and transfers load to the web which is considerably stiffer than the formwork. 3. Increase web reinforcement for locked-in construction load due to top slab forming for sloped web box girders. Page 5-50

Crossbeam 5.3.3.A
General
Crossbeam shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of strength limit state design of AASHTO LRFD and shall satisfy the serviceability requirements for crack control. 5.3.3.B
Basic Geometry
For aesthetic purposes, it is preferable to keep the crossbeam within the superstructure so that the bottom slab of the entire bridge is a continuous plane surface interrupted only by the columns. Although the depth of the crossbeam may be limited, the width can be made as wide as necessary to satisfy design requirements. Normally, it varies from 3 feet to the depth of box but is not less than the column size plus 1′-0″ to allow placement of the column reinforcement as shown in see Figures 5.3.3-1 and 5.3.3-2. Crossbeams on box girder type of construction shall be designed as a T beam utilizing the flange in compression, assuming the deck slab acts as a flange for positive moment and bottom slab a flange for negative moment. The effective overhang of the flange on a cantilever beam shall be limited to six times the flange thickness. The bottom slab thickness is frequently increased near the crossbeam in order to keep the main box girder compressive stresses to a desirable level for negative girder moments as shown in Figures 5.3.3-1 and 5.3.3-2. This bottom slab flare also helps resist negative crossbeam moments. Consideration should be given to flaring the bottom slab at the crossbeam for designing the cap even if it is not required for resisting main girder moments. 5.3.3.C
Loads
For concrete box girders the superstructure dead load shall be considered as uniformly distributed over the crossbeam. For concrete box girders the live load shall be considered as the truck load directly to the crossbeam from the wheel axles. Truck axles shall be moved transversely over the crossbeam to obtain the maximum design forces for the crossbeam and supporting columns. 5.3.3.D
Reinforcement Design and Details
The crossbeam section consists of rectangular section with overhanging deck and bottom slab if applicable. The effective width of the crossbeam flange overhang shall be taken as the lesser of:
• 6 times slab thickness,
• 1/10 of column spacing, or
• 1/20 of crossbeam cantilever as shown in Figure 5.3.3-3. The crossbeam shall have a minimum width of column dimension plus 6″. Crossbeam is usually cast to the fillet below the top slab. To avoid cracking of concrete on top of the crossbeam, construction reinforcement shall be provided at approximately 3″ below the construction joint. The design moment for construction reinforcement shall be the factored negative dead load moment due to the weight of crossbeam and adjacent 10′ of superstructure each side. The total amount of construction reinforcement shall be adequate to develop an ultimate moment at the critical section at least 1.2 times the cracking moment Mcr.

Top Reinforcement
The negative moment critical section shall be at the ¼ point of the square or equivalent square columns. 1.
When Skew Angle ≤ 25° If the bridge is tangent or slightly skewed deck transverse reinforcement is normal or radial to centerline bridge, the negative cap reinforcement can be placed either in contact with top deck negative reinforcement (see Figure 5.3.3-1) or directly under the main deck reinforcement.
2.
When Skew Angle > 25° When the structure is on a greater skew and the deck steel is normal or radial to the longitudinal centerline of the bridge, the negative cap reinforcement should be lowered to below the main deck reinforcement (see Figure 5.3.3-2).
3.
To avoid cracking of concrete Interim reinforcement is required below the construction joint in crossbeams.

Skin Reinforcement
Longitudinal skin reinforcement shall be provided in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.6.7.

End Diaphragm 5.3.4.A
Basic Geometry
Bearings at the end diaphragms are usually located under the girder stems to transfer loads directly to the pier as shown in Figure 5.3.4-1. In this case, the diaphragm width shall be equal to or greater than bearing grout pads as shown Figure 5.3.4-2. Designer shall provide access space for maintenance and inspection of bearings. Allowance shall be provided to remove and replace the bearings. Lift point locations, jack capacity, number of jacks, and maximum permitted lift shall be shown in the plan details. Figure 5.3.4-1

Dead Load Deflection and Camber Camber is the adjustment made to the vertical alignment to compensate for the anticipated dead load deflection and the long-term deflection caused by shrinkage and creep. Estimating long-term deflection and camber for reinforced concrete flexural members shall be based on the creep coefficient given in Section 5.1.1E. Alternatively, Table 5.3.5-1 may be used for long-term camber multipliers. Table 5.3.5-1
Long-term Camber Multipliers Multiplier Coefficient
Girder Adjacent to Existing/Stage Construction Deflection (downward) — apply to the elastic deflection due to the weight of member Deflection (downward) — apply to the elastic deflection due to superimposed dead load only Girder Away From Existing/Stage Construction Deflection (downward) — apply to the elastic deflection due to the weight of member Deflection (downward) — apply to the elastic deflection due to superimposed dead load only
1.90 2.20
2.70 3.00
In addition to dead load deflection, forms and falsework tend to settle and compress under the weight of freshly placed concrete. The amount of this take-up is dependent upon the type and design of the falsework, workmanship, type and quality of materials and support conditions. The camber shall be modified to account for anticipated take-up in the falsework.

Chapter 5
Thermal Effects Concrete box girder bridges are subjected to stresses and/or movements resulting from temperature variation. Temperature effects result from time-dependent variations in the effective bridge temperature and from temperature differentials within the bridge superstructure. 5.3.6.A
Effective Bridge Temperature and Movement
Proper temperature expansion provisions are essential in order to ensure that the structure will not be damaged by thermal movements. These movements, in turn, induce stresses in supporting elements such as columns or piers, and result in horizontal movement of the expansion joints and bearings. For more details see Chapter 8. 5.3.6.B
Differential Temperature
Although time-dependent variations in the effective temperature have caused problems in both reinforced and prestressed concrete bridges, detrimental effects caused by temperature differential within the superstructure have occurred only in prestressed bridges. Therefore, computation of stresses and movements resulting from the vertical temperature gradients is not included in this chapter. For more details, see AASHTO Guide Specifications, Thermal Effects on Concrete Bridge Superstructures dated 1989.
5.3.7
Hinges Hinges are one of the weakest links of box girder bridges subject to earthquake forces and it is desirable to eliminate hinges or reduce the number of hinges. For more details on the design of hinges, see Section 5.4. Designer shall provide access space or pockets for maintenance and inspection of bearings. Allowance shall be provided to remove and replace the bearings. Lift point locations, maximum lift permitted, jack capacity, and number of jacks shall be shown in the hinge plan details.
5.3.8
Drain Holes Drain holes shall be placed in the bottom slab at the low point of each cell to drain curing water during construction and any rain water that leaks through the deck slab. Additional drains shall be provided as a safeguard against water accumulation in the cell (especially when waterlines are carried by the bridge). In some instances, drainage through the bottom slab is difficult and other means shall be provided (i.e., cells over large piers and where a sloping exterior web intersects a vertical web). In this case, a horizontal drain shall be provided through the vertical web. Figure 5.3.8-1 shows drainage details for the bottom slab of concrete box girder bridges with steel wire screen.

Hinges and Inverted T-Beam Pier Caps Hinges and inverted T-beam pier caps require special design and detailing considerations. Continuous hinge shelves (both top and bottom projecting shelves) and continuous ledges of inverted T-beam pier caps, which support girders, are shown in Figure 5.4-1. In each case, vertical tensile forces (hanger tension) act at the intersection of the web and the horizontal hinge shelf or ledge. In the ledges of inverted T-beam pier caps, passage of live loads may also cause reversing torsional stresses which together with conventional longitudinal shear and bending produce complex stress distributions in the ledges7, 8. Figure 5.4-2 provides minimum shelf or ledge support lengths (N) and provides positive longitudinal linkage (e.g., earthquake restrainers) in accordance with the current AASHTO LRFD Guide Specifications for Seismic Design requirements. Design considerations for beam ledges, inverted T-beam and hinges are given in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.8.4.3. Inverted T-beam pier caps shall not be used for prestressed concrete girder bridges unless approved by the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer. Figure 5.4-1

Bridge Widenings This section provides general guidance for the design of bridge widenings. Included are additions to the substructure and the superstructure of reinforced concrete box girder, flat slab, T-beam, and prestressed concrete girder bridges. For additional information, see ACI Committee Report, Guide for Widening Highway Bridges9.
5.5.1
Review of Existing Structures 5.5.1.A
General
Obtain the following documents from existing records for preliminary review, design, and plan preparation: 1.
The “As-Built” contract plans, usually available from the ”Bridge Engineering Information System” on the Bridge and Structures Office website.
2.
The original contract plans and special provisions, which can be obtained from Engineering Records (Plans Vault), Records Control or the ”Bridge Engineering Information System” on the Bridge and Structures Office website.
3.
Check with the WSDOT Bridge Preservation Office for records of any unusual movements/rotations and other structural information.
4.
Original design calculations, which are stored in State Archives.
5.
Current field measurements. Current field measurements of existing pier crossbeam locations are recommended so that new prestressed concrete girders are not fabricated too short or too long. This is particularly important if piers have been constructed with different skews.
6.
Original and current Foundation Reports from the Materials Lab or from the Plans Vault.
7.
Change Order files to the original bridge contract Bridge Archive Engineer.
5.5.1.B
Original Contract Plans and Special Provisions
Location and size of reinforcement, member sizes and geometry, location of construction joints, details, allowable design soil pressure, and test hole data are given on the plans. Original contract plans can be more legible than the microfilm copies. The special provisions may include pertinent information that is not covered on the plans or in the AASHTO LRFD Specifications. 5.5.1.C
Original Calculations
The original calculations should be reviewed for any “special assumptions” or office criteria used in the original design. The actual stresses in the structural members, which will be affected by the widening, should be reviewed. This may affect the structure type selected for the widening. 5.5.1.D
Final Records
For major widening/renovation projects, the Final Records should be reviewed particularly for information about the existing foundations and piles. Sometimes the piles indicated on the original plans were omitted, revised, or required preboring. Final Records are available from Records Control or Bridge Records (Final Records on some older bridges may be in storage at the Materials Lab). WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Concrete Structures
Analysis and Design Criteria 5.5.2.A
General
Each widening represents a unique situation and construction operations may vary between widening projects. The guidelines in this section are based on years of WSDOT design experience with bridge widenings. 5.5.2.A.1
Appearance
The widening of a structure should be accomplished in such a manner that the existing structure does not look “added on to.” When this is not possible, consideration should be given to enclosure walls, cover panels, paint, or other aesthetic treatments. Where possible and appropriate, the structure’s appearance should be improved by the widening. 5.5.2.A.2
Materials
Preferably, materials used in the construction of the widening shall have the same thermal and elastic properties as the materials in the original structure. 5.5.2.A.3
Load Distribution and Construction Sequence
The members of the widening should be proportioned to provide similar longitudinal and transverse load distribution characteristics as the existing structure. Normally this can be achieved by using the same cross sections and member lengths that were used in the existing structure. The construction sequence and degree of interaction between the widening and the existing structure, after completion, shall be fully considered in determining the distribution of the dead load for design of the widening and stress checks for the existing structure. A suggested construction sequence or stage construction shall be clearly shown in the plans to avoid confusion and misinterpretation during construction. A typical construction sequence may involve placing the deck concrete, removing the falsework, placing the concrete for the closure strip, and placing the concrete for the traffic barrier. 5.5.2.A.4
Specifications
The design of the widening shall conform to the current AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications and the Standard Specifications. 5.5.2.A.5
Geometrical Constraints
The overall appearance and geometrical dimensions of the superstructure and columns of the widening should be the same or as close as possible to those of the existing structure. This is to ensure that the widening will have the same appearance and similar structural stiffness as the original structure. 5.5.2.A.6
Overlay
It should be established at the preliminary plan stage if an overlay is required as part of the widening.

5.5.2.A.7
Strength of the Existing Structure
A review of the strength of the main members of the existing structure shall be made for construction conditions utilizing AASHTO LRFD Specifications. A check of the existing main members after attachment of the widening shall be made for the final design loading condition. If the existing structural elements do not have adequate strength, consult your Design Unit Manager or in the case of consultants, contact the Consultant Liaison Engineer for appropriate guidance. If significant demolition is required on the existing bridge, consideration should be given to requesting concrete strength testing for the existing bridge and including this information in the contract documents. 5.5.2.A.8
Special Considerations
1.
For structures that were originally designed for HS-20 loading, HL-93 shall be used to design the widening. For structures that were originally designed for less than HS-20, consideration should be given to replacing the structure instead of widening it.
2.
Longitudinal joints are not permitted in order to eliminate potentially hazardous vehicle control problems.
3.
The Standard Specifications do not permit falsework to be supported from the existing structure unless the Plans and Specifications state otherwise. This requirement eliminates the transmission of vibration from the existing structure to the widening during construction. The existing structure may still be in service.
4.
For narrow widenings where the Plans and Specifications require that the falsework be supported from the original structure (e.g., there are no additional girders, columns, crossbeams, or closure strips), there shall be no external rigid supports such as posts or falsework from the ground. Supports from the ground do not permit the widening to deflect with the existing structure when traffic is on the existing structure. This causes the uncured concrete of the widening to crack where it joins the existing structure. Differential dead load deflection during construction shall be given consideration.
5.
Precast members may be used to widen existing CIP structures. This method is useful when the horizontal or vertical clearances during construction are insufficient to build CIP members.
6.
The alignment for diaphragms for the widening shall generally coincide with the existing diaphragms.
7.
When using battered piles, estimate the pile tip elevations and ensure that they will have ample clearance from all existing piles, utilities, or other obstructions. Also check that there is sufficient clearance between the existing structure and the pile driving equipment.
5.5.2.B
Seismic Design Criteria for Bridge Widenings
Seismic design of bridge widenings shall be in accordance with Section 4.3.

5.5.2.C
Substructure
5.5.2.C.1
Selection of Foundation
1.
The type of foundation to be used to support the widening shall generally be the same as that of the existing structure unless otherwise recommended by the Geotechnical Engineer. The effects of possible differential settlement between the new and the existing foundations shall be considered.
2.
Consider present bridge site conditions when determining new foundation locations. The conditions include: overhead clearance for pile driving equipment, horizontal clearance requirements, working room, pile batters, channel changes, utility locations, existing embankments, and other similar conditions.
5.5.2.C.2
Scour and Drift
Added piles and columns for widenings at water crossings may alter stream flow characteristics at the bridge site. This may result in pier scouring to a greater depth than experienced with the existing configuration. Added substructure elements may also increase the possibility of trapping drift. The Hydraulics Engineer shall be consulted concerning potential problems related to scour and drift on all widenings at water crossings. 5.5.2.D
Superstructure
5.5.2.D.1
Camber
Accurate prediction of dead load deflection is more important for widenings than for new bridges, since it is essential that the deck grades match. To obtain a smooth transition in transverse direction of the bridge deck, the camber of the girder adjacent to the existing structure shall be adjusted for the difference in camber between new and existing structure. A linear interpolation may be used to adjust the camber of the girders located away from the existing structure. The multipliers for estimating camber of new structure may be taken as shown in Table 5.3.5-1. 5.5.2.D.2
Closure Strip
Except for narrow deck slab widenings a closure strip is required for all widenings. The width shall be the minimum required to accommodate the necessary reinforcement and for form removal. Reinforcement which extends through the closure strip shall be investigated. Shear shall be transferred across the closure strip by shear friction and/or shear keys. All falsework supporting the widening shall be released and formwork supporting the closure strip shall be supported from the existing and newly widened structures prior to placing concrete in the closure strip. Because of deck slab cracking experienced in widened concrete decks, closure strips are required unless the mid-span dead load camber is ½″ or less. In prestressed concrete girder bridge widenings, the closure shall extend through the intermediate and end diaphragms. The diaphragms shall be made continuous with existing diaphragms.

Chapter 5
5.5.2.D.3
Stress Levels and Deflections in Existing Structures
Caution is necessary in determining the cumulative stress levels, deflections, and the need for shoring in existing structural members during rehabilitation projects. The designer shall investigate the adequacy of the existing structure adjacent to the widening for any additional loads, taking into account the loss of removed components. For example, a T-beam bridge was originally constructed on falsework and the falsework was released after the deck slab concrete gained strength. As part of a major rehabilitation project, the bridge was closed to traffic and the entire deck slab was removed and replaced without shoring. Without the deck slab, the stems behave as rectangular sections with a reduced depth and width. The existing stem reinforcement was not originally designed to support the weight of the deck slab without shoring. After the new deck slab was placed, wide cracks from the bottom of the stem opened, indicating that the reinforcement was overstressed. This overstress resulted in a lower load rating for the newly rehabilitated bridge. This example shows the need to shore up the remaining T-beam stems prior to placing the new deck slab so that excessive deflections do not occur and overstress in the existing reinforcing steel is prevented. It is necessary to understand how the original structure was constructed, how the rehabilitated structure is to be constructed, and the cumulative stress levels and deflections in the structure from the time of original construction through rehabilitation. 5.5.2.E
Stability of Widening
For relatively narrow box girder and T-beam widenings, symmetry about the vertical axis should be maintained because lateral loads are critical during construction. When symmetry is not possible, use pile cap connections, lateral connections, or special falsework. A minimum of two webs is generally recommended for box girder widenings. For T-beam widenings that require only one additional web, the web should be centered at the axis of symmetry of the deck slab. Often the width of the closure strip can be adjusted to accomplish this.
5.5.3
Removing Portions of the Existing Structure Portions of the existing structure to be removed shall be clearly indicated on the plans. Where a clean break line is required, a ¾″ deep saw cut shall be specified for a deck slab with normal wear and a ½″ deep saw cut for worn deck slabs. In no case, however, shall the saw blade cut or nick the main transverse top slab reinforcement. The special provisions shall state that care will be taken not to damage any reinforcement which is to be saved. Hydromilling is preferred where reinforcing bar cover is shallow and can effectively remove delaminated decks because of the good depth control it offers. When greater depths of slab are to be removed, special consideration should be given to securing exposed reinforcing bars to prevent undue vibration and subsequent fatigue cracks from occurring in the reinforcing bars. The current General Special Provisions should be reviewed for other specific requirements on deck slab removal. Removal of any portion of the main structural members should be held to a minimum. Careful consideration shall be given to the construction conditions, particularly when the removal affects the existing frame system. In extreme situations, preloading by jacking is acceptable to control stresses and deflections during the various stages of removal and construction. Removal of the main longitudinal deck slab reinforcement should be
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-65
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
kept to a minimum. See “Slab Removal Detail” Figure 5.5.4-1 for the limiting case for the maximum allowable removal. The plans shall include a note that critical dimensions and elevations are to be verified in the field prior to the fabrication of precast units or expansion joint assemblies. In cases where an existing sidewalk is to be removed but the supporting slab under the sidewalk is to be retained, Region personnel should check the feasibility of removing the sidewalk. Prior to design, Region personnel should make recommendations on acceptable removal methods and required construction equipment. The plans and specifications shall then be prepared to accommodate these recommendations. This will ensure the constructibility of plan details and the adequacy of the specifications.
5.5.4
Attachment of Widening to Existing Structure 5.5.4.A
General
5.5.4.A.1
Lap and Mechanical Splices
To attach a widening to an existing structure, the first choice is to utilize existing reinforcing bars by splicing new bars to existing. Lap splices or mechanical splices should be used. However, it may not always be possible to splice to existing reinforcing bars and spacing limitations may make it difficult to use mechanical splices. 5.5.4.A.2
Welding Reinforcement
Existing reinforcing steel may not be readily weldable. Mechanical splices should be used wherever possible. If welding is the only feasible means, the chemistry of the reinforcing steel must be analyzed and acceptable welding procedures developed. 5.5.4.A.3
Drilling Into Existing Structure
It may be necessary to drill holes and set dowels in epoxy resin in order to attach the widening to the existing structure. When drilling into heavily reinforced areas, chipping should be specified to expose the main reinforcing bars. If it is necessary to drill through reinforcing bars or if the holes are within 4 inches of an existing concrete edge, core drilling shall be specified. Core drilled holes shall be roughened before resin is applied. If this is not done, a dried residue, which acts as a bond breaker and reduces the load capacity of the dowel, will remain. Generally, the drilled holes are ⅛″ in diameter larger than the dowel diameter for #5 and smaller dowels and ¼″ in diameter larger than the dowel diameter for #6 and larger dowels. In special applications requiring drilled holes greater than 1½″ diameter or deeper than 2′, core drilling shall be specified. These holes shall also be intentionally roughened prior to applying epoxy resin. Core drilled holes shall have a minimum clearance of 3″ from the edge of the concrete and 1″ clearance from existing reinforcing bars in the existing structure. These clearances shall be noted in the plans. 5.5.4.A.4 1.
Page 5-66
Dowelling Reinforcing Bars Into the Existing Structure
Dowel bars shall be set with an approved epoxy resin. The existing structural element shall be checked for its adequacy to transmit the load transferred to it from the dowel bars. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
2.
Dowel spacing and edge distance affect the allowable tensile dowel loads. Allowable tensile loads, dowel bar embedment, and drilled hole sizes for reinforcing bars (Grade 60) used as dowels and set with an approved epoxy resin are shown in Table 5.5.4-1. These values are based on an edge clearance greater than 3″, a dowel spacing greater than 6″, and are shown for both uncoated and epoxy coated dowels. Table 5.5.4-2 lists dowel embedment lengths when the dowel spacing is less than 6″. Note that in Table 5.5.4-2 the edge clearance is equal to or greater than 3″, because this is the minimum edge clearance for a drilled hole from a concrete edge. If it is not possible to obtain these embedments, such as for traffic railing dowels into existing deck slabs, the allowable load on the dowel shall be reduced by the ratio of the actual embedment divided by the required embedment.
3.
The embedments shown in Table 5.5.4-1 and Table 5.5.4-2 are based on dowels embedded in concrete with ƒ′c=4,000 psi. Table 5.5.4-1

5.5.4.A.5
Shear Transfer Across a Dowelled Joint
Shear shall be carried across the joint by shear friction. The existing concrete surface shall be intentionally roughened. Both the concrete and dowels shall be considered effective in transmitting the shear force. Chipping shear keys in the existing concrete can also be used to transfer shear across a dowelled joint, but is expensive. 5.5.4.A.6
Preparation of Existing Surfaces for Concreting
See “Removing Portions of Existing Concrete” in the General Special Provisions and Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(12) for requirements. Unsound, damaged, dirty, porous, or otherwise undesirable old concrete shall be removed, and the remaining concrete surface shall be clean, free of laitance, and intentionally roughened to ensure proper bond between the old and new concrete surfaces. 5.5.4.A.7
Control of Shrinkage and Deflection on Connecting Reinforcement
Dowels that are fixed in the existing structure may be subject to shear as a result of longitudinal shrinkage and vertical deflection when the falsework is removed. These shear forces may result in a reduced tensile capacity of the connection. When connecting the transverse reinforcing bars across the closure strip is unavoidable, the interaction between shear and tension in the dowel or reinforcing bar shall be checked. The use of wire rope or sleeved reinforcement may be acceptable, subject to approval by your Bridge Design Unit Manager. Where possible, transverse reinforcing bars shall be spliced to the existing reinforcing bars in a blocked-out area which can be included in the closure strip. Nominal, shear friction, temperature and shrinkage, and distribution reinforcing bars shall be bent into the closure strip. Rock bolts may be used to transfer connection loads deep into the existing structure, subject to the approval of your Bridge Design Unit Manager. 5.5.4.A.8
Post-tensioning
Post-tensioning of existing crossbeams may be utilized to increase the moment capacity and to eliminate the need for additional substructure. Generally, an existing crossbeam can be core drilled for post-tensioning if it is less than 30′ long. The amount of drift in the holes alignment may be approximately 1″ in 20′. For crossbeams longer than 30′, external post‑tensioning should be considered. For an example of this application, refer to Contract 3846, Bellevue Transit Access – Stage 1.

Box Girder Bridges
Figures 5.5.4-1 through 5.5.4-6 show typical details for widening box girder bridges. Welding or mechanical butt splice are preferred over dowelling for the main reinforcement in crossbeams and columns when it can be done in the horizontal or flat position. It shall be allowed only when the bars to be welded are free from restraint at one end during the welding process. Figure 5.5.4-1

Flat Slab Bridges
It is not necessary to remove any portion of the existing slab to expose the existing transverse reinforcing bars for splicing purposes, because the transverse slab reinforcement is only distribution reinforcement.

Expansion Joints The designer should determine if existing expansion joints can be eliminated. It will be necessary to determine what modifications to the structure are required to provide an adequate functional system when existing joints are eliminated. For expansion joint design, see Section 9.1 Expansion Joints. Very often on widening projects it is necessary to chip out the existing concrete deck and rebuild the joint. Figures 5.5.5-1 and 5.5.5-2 show details for rebuilding joint openings for compression seal expansion joints.

Bridge Widening Falsework For widenings which do not have additional girders, columns, crossbeams, or closure pours, falsework should be supported by the existing bridge. There should be no external support from the ground. The reason is that the ground support will not allow the widening to deflect the existing bridge when traffic is on the bridge. This will cause the Expansion Joint Detail Shown for Compression “green” concrete to crack where it joins the existing bridge. The designer should contact Seal with New Reinforcing Steel Added the Bridge Construction Support Unit regarding Figurefalsework 5.5.5-2 associated with widenings.

Existing Bridge Widenings Appendix 5-B3 lists bridge widenings projects that may be used as design aids for the designers.

Prestressed Concrete Girder Superstructures The prestressed concrete girder bridge is an economical and rapid type of bridge construction and often preferred for WSDOT bridges. Precast sections are generally fabricated in plant or somewhere near the construction site and then erected. Precasting permits better material quality control and is often more economical than CIP concrete.
5.6.1
WSDOT Standard Prestressed Concrete Girder Types A girder type consists of a series of girder cross sections sharing a common shape. The numbers within girder series generally refer to the depth of the section in inches. Refer to Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25) for a comprehensive list of Standard WSDOT girder types. Standard WSDOT girder types include: Prestressed Concrete I Girders – Washington State Standard I Girders were adopted in the mid-1950s. The original series was graduated in 10 foot increments from 30 feet to 100 feet. In 1990, revisions were made incorporating the results of the research done at Washington State University on girders without end blocks. The revisions included three major changes: a thicker web; end blocks were eliminated; and strand spacing was increased. The current Series of this type include W42G, W50G, W58G, and W74G. Prestressed Concrete Wide Flange (WF) I Girders and Spliced Prestressed Concrete Girders – In 1999, deeper girders, commonly called “Supergirders” were added to the WSDOT standard concrete girders. These new supergirders may be pre-tensioned or post-tensioned. The pre-tensioned Series are designated as WF74G, WF83G and WF95G and the post-tensioned (spliced) Series are designated as WF74PTG, WF83PTG and WF95PTG. In 2004 Series WF42G, WF50G, and WF58G were added to the prestressed concrete girder standards. In 2008, Series WF66G, WF100G, and WF100PTG were added to the prestressed concrete girder standards. In 2009, Series WF36G was added to the prestressed concrete girder standards. Prestressed Concrete Wide Flange Deck Girders – In 2015, the top flanges of Wide Flange I Girders were widened and thickened to support traffic loads without a CIP concrete deck. The top flanges are either spliced using ultra high performance concrete or mechanically connected at the flange edges to adjacent girders. This Series includes the WF39DG through the WF103DG. Prestressed Concrete Wide Flange Thin Deck Girders – In 2015, the top flanges of wide flange I girders were widened to create a girder which would support a CIP concrete deck placement without formwork. This Series includes the WF36TDG through the WF100TDG. Deck Bulb Tee Girders – This type of girder has a top flange designed to support traffic loads and are mechanically connected at the flange edges to adjacent girders. They include Series W35DG, W41DG, W53DG and W65DG. Prestressed Concrete Slab Girders – Prestressed concrete slab girders are available in heights ranging from 12 inches to 30 inches.

Chapter 5
Prestressed Concrete Tub Girders – In 2004 prestressed concrete tub girders were added as standard girders. All WSDOT prestressed concrete girders are high performance high strength concrete girders. They generally rely on high strength concrete to be effective for the spans expected as a single piece. The approximate ranges of maximum span lengths are as shown in Table 5.6.1-1 and Appendices 5.6-A1-1 to 5.6-A1-9. Standard drawings for WSDOT prestressed concrete girders are shown in the Bridge Standard Drawings website (www.wsdot.wa.gov/Bridge/Structures/ StandardDrawings.htm).

Design Criteria WSDOT design criteria for prestressed concrete girder superstructures are given in Table 5.6.2-1. AASHTO LRFD Section 5.12.3.3 “Bridges Composed of Simple Span Precast Girders Made Continuous” allows for some degree of continuity for loads applied on the bridge after the continuity diaphragms have been cast and cured. This assumption is based on the age of the girder when continuity is established, and degree of continuity at various limit states. Both degree of continuity and time of continuity diaphragm casting may result in contractual and design issues. Designing these types of bridges for the envelope of simple span and continuous spans for applicable permanent and transient loads is the approach used by WSDOT as it has yielded good results.
Table 5.6.2-1 Design Specifications
Design Criteria for Prestressed Concrete Girders AASHTO LRFD Specifications and WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50
Design Method Prestressed concrete members shall be designed for service limit state for stress limits and checked for strength limit state for ultimate capacity. Superstructure Continuity
Prestressed concrete girder superstructures shall be designed for the envelope of simple span and continuous span loadings for all permanent and transient loads. Loads applied before establishing continuity (typically before placement of continuity diaphragms) need only be applied as a simple span loading. Continuity reinforcement shall be provided at supports for loads applied after establishing continuity.
Loads and Load Service, Strength, Fatigue, and Extreme Event Limit State loads and load combinations shall be Factors in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Specifications Stress Limits

Section 5.6.3
Continuous Structure Configuration
Girder type, depth and number of lines shall be identical in adjacent spans. Girder type, depth and number of lines may be changed at expansion piers.
Girder End Skew Angle
Girder end skew angles for prestressed concrete slabs, deck bulb-tees, WFDG girders, WFTDG girders and tubs shall be limited to 30°. Girder end skew angles for all other prestressed concrete girders shall be limited to 45°.
Intermediate Diaphragms
Except for Prestressed Concrete Wide Flange Deck Girder and Prestressed Concrete Slab Girder bridges, CIP concrete intermediate diaphragms shall be provided for prestressed concrete girder bridge spans in the following situations:
• Spans crossing a roadway with a minimum vertical clearance of 20'-0" or less.
• Spans crossing a railway with a minimum vertical clearance of 23'-4" or less from the top of rail.
• Spans crossing a water body or waterway with a minimum vertical clearance of 6'-0" of less from the 100-year MRI water surface level.
• Spans that will possibly or likely have vehicular traffic under the span in the future with a minimum vertical clearance of 20'-0" or less. Intermediate diaphragms shall be equally spaced between bearing centerlines at a spacing not to exceed 50'. Intermediate diaphragms shall be either partial or full depth as described in Section 5.6.4.C.4.

Concrete Structures
5.6.2.A
Support Conditions
The prestressed concrete girders are assumed to be supported on rigid permanent simple supports. These supports can be either bearing seats or elastomeric pads. The design span length is the distance center to center of bearings for simple spans. For continuous spans erected on falsework (raised crossbeam), the effective point of support for girder design is assumed to be the face of the crossbeam. For continuous spans on crossbeams (dropped or semi-dropped crossbeam), the design span length is usually the distance center to center of temporary bearings. 5.6.2.B
Composite Action
5.6.2.B.1
General
The sequence of construction and loading is extremely important in the design of prestressed concrete girders. The composite section has a much larger capacity than the basic girder section but it cannot take loads until the deck slab has obtained adequate strength. Assumptions used in computing composite section properties are shown in Figure 5.6.2-1. 5.6.2.B.2
Load Application
The following sequence and method of applying loads is typically used in girder analysis: 1.
Girder dead load is applied to the girder section.
2.
Diaphragm dead load is applied to the girder section.
3.
Deck slab dead load is applied to the girder section.
4.
Superimposed dead loads (such as barriers, sidewalks and overlays) and live loads are applied to the composite section.
5.6.2.B.3
Composite Section Properties
A CIP concrete bridge deck forms the top flange of the composite girder in prestressed concrete girder bridge construction. 1.
Effective and Transformed Flange Width The effective flange width of a concrete bridge deck for computing composite section properties shall be in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 4.6.2.6. The effective flange width shall be reduced by the ratio Eslab/Egirder to obtain the transformed flange width. The effective modulus of the composite section with the transformed flange width is then Egirder.
2.
Effective Flange Thickness The effective flange thickness of a concrete bridge deck for computing composite section properties shall be the deck thickness reduced by ½″ to account for wearing. Where a bridge will have an overlay applied prior to traffic being allowed on the bridge, the full deck thickness may be used as effective flange thickness.

5.6.2.B.4
Slenderness Ratio
The lateral slenderness ratio of WF girders l/r, where l is the girder length and r is the radius of gyration about the weak axis, shall not exceed 310. WF100G girders reach this limit at a length of 210 ft. The top flange width of WF100G girders can be increased to 5’-1” for spans greater than 210 ft. Figure 5.6.2-1

1.
Flange Position An increased dimension from top of girder to top of bridge deck at centerline of bearing at centerline of girder shall be shown in the Plans. This is called the “A” dimension. It accounts for the effects of girder camber, vertical curve, deck cross slope, etc. See Appendix 5-B1 for method of computing. For purposes of calculating composite section properties for negative moments, the pad/haunch height between bottom of deck and top of girder shall be taken as the “A” dimension minus the flange thickness “T” at intermediate pier supports and shall be reduced by girder camber as appropriate at other locations. For purposes of calculating composite section properties for positive moments, the bottom of the bridge deck shall be assumed to be directly on the top of the girder. This assumption may prove to be true at center of span where excess girder camber occurs.
2.
Section Dead Load The bridge deck dead load to be applied to the girder shall be based on the full bridge deck thickness. The full effective pad/haunch weight shall be added to that load over the full length of the girder. The full effective pad or haunch height is typically the “A” dimension minus the flange thickness “T”, but may be higher at midspan for a crest vertical curve.

The angle of inclination shall be the equilibrium tilt angle computed for lateral stability with a roadway superelevation of 2 percent. This check shall be done in accordance with Section 5.6.3.D.6. This condition represents the girder traveling along a straight road at a typical 2% superelevation with dynamic load effects.

This condition represents the girder going slowly through a corner with a 6 percent superelevation.

Girder End Types
There are four typical end types for prestressed concrete girders. Due to the extreme depth of the WF83G, WF95G, and WF100G girders, and possible end of girder tilt at the piers for profile grades, the designer will need to pay particular attention to details to assure the girders will fit and perform as intended. The end types designs may require modification for bridge security. The space between girders at the abutment may require omission by extending the diaphragm to the face of the abutment stem. Coordinate with the WSDOT State Bridge and Structures Architect during final design where required. The four end types are shown as follows: 5.6.2.E.1
End Type A
End Type A as shown in Figure 5.6.2-3 is for cantilever end piers with an end diaphragm cast on the end of the girders. End Type A has a recess at the bottom of the girder near the end for an elastomeric bearing pad. See Bridge Standard Drawings 5.6-A4-12 and 5.6-A9-9 for bearing pad details. The recess at the centerline of bearing is 0.5″ deep. This recess is to be used for profile grades up to and including 4 percent. The recess is to be replaced by an embedded steel plate flush with the bottom of the girder for grades over 4 percent. A tapered bearing plate, with stops at the edges to contain the elastomeric pad, can be welded or bolted to the embedded plate to provide a level bearing surface. Reinforcing bars and pre-tensioned strands project from the end of the girder. The designer shall assure that these bars and strands fit into the end diaphragm. Extended prestressing strands should be capable of developing seismic connection forces, but at least 4 strands should be extended. Embedment of the girder end into the end diaphragm shall be a minimum of 3″ and a maximum of 6″. For girder ends where the tilt would exceed 6″ of embedment, the girder ends shall be tilted to attain a plumb surface when the girder is erected to the profile grade. The gap between the end diaphragm and the stem wall shall be a minimum of 1½″ or ½″ greater than required for longitudinal bridge movement.

End Type C
End Type C as shown in Figure 5.6.2-5 is for continuous spans and an intermediate hinge diaphragm at an intermediate pier. There is no bearing recess and the girder is temporarily supported on oak blocks. This detail may be used to reduce the seismic demand at an intermediate pier by allowing rotation about the axis parallel to the crossbeam. The reduced pier stiffness will lower the plastic overstrength shear demand (Vpo), allow for shorter columns and eliminate the plastic hinge at the top of each column. While the diaphragm hinge is intended to act as a pin, there may be some residual stiffness at the connection that shall be determined by the designer. This stiffness will move the point of inflection down the pier, inducing some plastic overstrength shear demand. The hinge connection should be assumed pinned to determine the pier displacement and ductility demand for seismic analysis. The designer shall check the edge distance and provide a dimension that prevents edge failure, or spalling, at the top corner of the supporting cross beam for load from the oak block including dead loads from girder, deck slab, and construction loads. For prestressed concrete girders with intermediate hinge diaphragms, designers shall: 1.
Check size and minimum embedment in crossbeam and diaphragm for hinge bars. Bars shall be sized based on interface shear due to calculated plastic overstrength shear force (Vpo) from the column while ignoring the concrete cohesion and axial load contributions.
2.
Design the width of the shear key to take the factored vertical bearing force per AASHTO LRFD Section 5.6.5 at the Strength limit state. The maximum shear key width shall be limited to 0.3d, where d is the width of the diaphragm.
3.
Confinement reinforcement shall be added to the diaphragm between the girders over a vertical distance equal to or greater than the diaphragm width. Confinement shall be no less than #4 ties bars spaced at 12 inches longitudinally and staggered 6 inches vertically.
4.
The throat of the hinge gap shall be no larger than 0.75 inches The bottom of diaphragm may taper up to 5 degrees maximum to allow for 1.5 times the elastic service, strength or extreme rotation. The material used to form the gap shall be strong enough to support the wet concrete condition and shall be removed after concrete placement.
5.
Check interface shear friction at girder end (see Section 5.2.2.C.2).
Design of the pier in the transverse direction (parallel to the crossbeam axis) shall be performed per the AASHTO Seismic Guide Specifications.

The splitting resistance of pre-tensioned anchorage zones shall be as described in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.9.4.4.1. For pre-tensioned I-girders or bulb tees, the end vertical reinforcement shall not be larger than #5 bars and spacing shall not be less than 2½″. For pre-tensioned tub girders, the end vertical reinforcement shall not be larger than #5 bars and spacing shall not be less than 3″. Any remaining splitting reinforcement not fitting within the h/4 zone may be placed beyond the h/4 zone at the minimum spacing allowed. 5.6.2.G

Confinement reinforcement in accordance with AASHTO LRFD Section 5.9.4.4.2 shall be provided. 5.6.2.H
Girder Stirrups
Except as otherwise permitted, for girders with CIP deck slabs, girder stirrups shall be field bent over the top mat of reinforcement in the bridge deck. Stirrups for slab and wide flange thin deck girders which shall be bent at the heigh shown in the standard girder plans. I-girder stirrups may be prebent, but the extended hook shall be within the core of the slab (the inside edge of the hook shall terminate above the bottom mat deck slab bars). For I-girders with a 7½” minimum thickness cast-in-place bridge deck, girder stirrups no larger than #5 bars, and with or without permanent precast prestressed concrete stay-inplace deck panels, prebent stirrups may be used with “hat bar” stirrup extensions. Details shall conform to Figure 5.6.2-7 and the following requirements (see reference 27):
• Girder stirrups shall all extend at least 5” from the top of the girder, but typically no more than the deck thickness minus 2.5”.
• Hat bars shall be epoxy coated and shall be the same bar size as the girder stirrups 5.6.2.I
Section Properties Gross section properties (including the gross deck area transformed by the girder/deck modular ratio if applicable) shall be used for design of precast concrete girders including prestress losses, camber, and flexural capacity. Transformed sections (transforming reinforcement to an equivalent concrete area) may be used in special cases with the approval of the WSDOT Bridge Design Engineer.

Fabrication and Handling 5.6.3.A
Shop Plans
Fabricators of prestressed concrete girders are required to submit shop plans which show specific details for each girder. These shop plans are reviewed for conformance with the Contract Plans and specifications. 5.6.3.B
Special Problems for Fabricators
5.6.3.B.1
Strand Tensioning
The method selected for strand tensioning may affect the design of the girders. The strand arrangements shown in the office standard plans and included in the PGSuper computer program are satisfactory for tensioning methods used by fabricators in this state. Harped strands are normally tensioned by pulling them as straight strands to a partial tension. The strands are then deflected vertically as necessary to give the required harping angle and strand stress. In order to avoid overtensioning the harped strands by this procedure, the slope of the strands is limited to a maximum of 6:1 for 0.5″ φ strands and 8:1 for 0.6″φ strands. The straight strands are tensioned by straight jacking. 5.6.3.B.2
Hold Down Forces
Forces on the hold-down units are developed as the harped strands are raised. The holddown device provided by the fabricator must be able to hold the vertical component of the harping forces. Normally a two or more hold-down unit is required. Standard commercial hold-down units have been preapproved for use with particular strand groups. 5.6.3.B.3
Numbers of Strands
Since the prestressing beds used by the girder fabricators can carry several girders in a line, it is desirable that girders have the same number of strands where practical. This allows several girders to be set up and cast at one time. For pre-tensioned concrete girders, the number of permanent prestressing strands (straight and harped) shall be limited to 100 total 0.6″f strands. 5.6.3.C
Handling of Prestressed Concrete Girders
5.6.3.C.1
In-Plant Handling
The maximum weight that can be handled by precasting plants in the Pacific Northwest is 262 kips. It is possible that products heavier than 262 kips can be manufactured if they will be shipped directly to the jobsite by barge, but special plant lifting arrangements must be investigated. Headroom is also not generally a concern for the deeper sections. 5.6.3.C.2
Lateral Stability During Handling
In order to ensure constructability, the designer shall specify the lifting embedment locations (centroid 3′ minimum from ends - see Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25) L), maximum midspan vertical deflection and the corresponding concrete strength at release that satisfies the stress limits from Section 5.2.1.C and provides an adequate factor of safety for lateral stability. The calculations shall conform to methods as described in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25) and reference 26. Factors of safety of 1.0 against cracking and 1.5 against failure shall be used. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-97
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
Biaxial stresses due to lateral bending at the girder tilt equilibrium condition shall consider the assumed lifting embedment transverse placement tolerance and the girder sweep tolerance. Stresses shall be evaluated for the girder tilt equilibrium condition for a hanging girder as described in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25) and reference 26. Lateral stability can be a concern when handling long, slender girders. Lateral bending failures are sudden, catastrophic, costly, pose a serious threat to workers and surroundings, and therefore shall be considered by designers. When the girder forms are stripped from the girder, the prestressing level is higher and the concrete strength is lower than at any other point in the life of the member. Lifting embedment/support misalignment, horizontal girder sweep and other girder imperfections can cause the girder to roll when handling, causing a component of the girder weight to be resisted by the weak axis. Lateral stability may be improved using the following methods: 1.
Move the lifting embedments away from the ends. This may increase the required concrete release strength, because decreasing the distance between lifting devices increases the concrete stresses at the harp point. Stresses at the support may also govern, depending on the exit location of the harped strands.
2.
Select a girder section that is relatively wide and stiff about its vertical (weak) axis.
3.
Add temporary prestressing in the top flange.
4.
Brace the girder.
5.
Raise the roll axis of the girder with a rigid yoke.
5.6.3.D
Shipping Prestressed Concrete Girders
5.6.3.D.1
General
The ability to ship girders can be influenced by a large number of variables, including mode of transportation, weight, length, height, and lateral stability. The ability to ship girders is also strongly site-dependent. For large or heavy girders, routes to the site shall be investigated during the preliminary design phase. To this end, on projects using large or heavy girders, WSDOT can place an advisory in their special provisions including shipping routes, estimated permit fees, escort vehicle requirements, Washington State Patrol requirements, and permit approval time. 5.6.3.D.2
Mode of Transportation
Three modes of transportation are commonly used in the industry: truck, rail, and barge. In Washington State, an overwhelming percentage of girders are transported by truck, so discussion in subsequent sections will be confined to this mode. However, on specific projects, it may be appropriate to consider rail or barge transportation. Standard rail cars can usually accommodate larger loads than a standard truck. Rail cars range in capacity from approximately 120 to 200 kips. However, unless the rail system runs directly from the precasting plant to the jobsite, members must be trucked for at least some of the route, and weight may be restricted by the trucking limitations. For a project where a large number of girders are required, barge transportation may be the most economical. Product weights and dimensions are generally not limited by barge delivery, but by the handling equipment on either end. In most cases, if a product can be made and handled in the plant, it can be shipped by barge. Page 5-98
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
5.6.3.D.3
Chapter 5
Weight Limitations
The net weight limitation with trucking equipment currently available in Washington State is approximately 180 kips, if a reasonable delivery rate (number of pieces per day) is to be maintained. Product weights of up to 262 kips can be hauled with currently available equipment at a limited rate. The hauling of heavier girders may be possible with coordination with hauling subcontractors. Hauling subcontractors should be consulted on the feasibility of shipping large or heavy girders on specific projects. 5.6.3.D.4
Support Locations
The designer shall provide shipping support locations in the plans to ensure adequate girder stability. Shipping support locations shall be no closer than the girder depth to the ends of the girder at the girder centerline. The overhangs at the leading and trailing ends of the girders should be minimized and equal if possible. Generally, the leading end overhang should not exceed 15′ to avoid interference with trucking equipment. Local carriers should be consulted if a larger leading end overhang is required. Shipping support locations shall maintain the concrete stresses within allowable limits. Length between shipping support locations may be governed by turning radii on the route to the jobsite. Potential problems can be circumvented by moving the support points closer together (away from the ends of the girder), or by selecting alternate routes. Up to 130′ between supports is typically acceptable for most projects. 5.6.3.D.5
Height Limitations
The height of a deep girder section sitting on a jeep and steerable trailer is of concern when considering overhead obstructions on the route to the jobsite. The height of the support is approximately 6′ above the roadway surface. When adding the depth of the girder, including camber, the overall height from the roadway surface to the top of concrete can rapidly approach 14′. Overhead obstructions along the route should be investigated for adequate clearance in the preliminary design phase. Obstructions without adequate clearance must be bypassed by selecting alternate routes. Expectations are that, in some cases, overhead clearance will not accommodate the vertical stirrup projection on deeper WSDOT standard girder sections. Alternate stirrup configurations can be used to attain adequate clearance, depending on the route from the plant to the jobsite. 5.6.3.D.6
Lateral Stability During Shipping
In order to ensure constructability, the designer shall specify concrete strengths, shipping support locations, minimum shipping support rotational spring constants, shipping support center-to-center wheel spacing, maximum midspan vertical deflection at shipping and temporary top strand configurations in the Plans that satisfy the stress limits from Section 5.2.1.C and provide adequate factors of safety for lateral stability during shipping. The calculations shall conform to methods described in Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25) and reference 26. Factors of safety of 1.0 against cracking and 1.5 against failure and rollover shall be used. The maximum midspan vertical deflection at shipping used to evaluate stability shall be shown in the plans. In order to minimize the need for re-analysis under contract, this value may be conservatively determined using losses at 10 days, camber at 90 days, and a span length equal to the girder length.

Page 5-99

Concrete Structures
The rotational stiffness and center-to-center wheel spacing used in design shall be taken from Table 5.6.3-1. Design the girder for transportation with the least stiff support system as possible while achieving recommended factors of safety. Table 5.6.3-1

Design for shipping should not preclude the contractor from making modifications under contract that consider actual conditions, such as fabrication tolerances and the haul route, but the Engineer should confirm that any proposed changes are structurally acceptable in the final in-service structure. 5.6.3.E
Erection and Bridge Deck Construction
A variety of methods are used to erect prestressed concrete girders, depending on the weight, length, available crane capacity, and site access. Generally, lifting girders during erection is not as critical as when they are stripped from the forms, particularly when the same lifting devices are used for both. However, if appurtenances such as deck overhang formwork brackets are attached to the girder, the lifting slings are at an angle other than 90° ± 10° from the top surface of the girder, wind loads are present, the girder is erected in such a manner that one end is supported at the top by a lifting device while the other end is seated on a girder transport vehicle or bearing, or a separate set of erection devices are used, the girder shall be checked for stresses and lateral stability as part of the contractor’s erection plan. In addition, once the girder is set in place, the free span between supports is usually increased. Wind can also pose a problem. Consequently, when girders are erected, they shall immediately be braced. The temporary bracing of the girders is the contractor’s responsibility. For tub girders, designers should consider web out-of-plane bending forces that will develop during construction. Examples of these loads include forces developed by lift rigging and loading due to the deck finishing machine. These cases may require temporary struts and govern the design of web stirrups. 5.6.3.F
Construction Sequence for Multi-Span Prestressed Concrete Girder Bridges
For multi-span prestressed concrete girder bridges, the sequence and timing of the superstructure construction has a significant impact on the performance and durability of the bridge. In order to maximize the performance and durability, the “construction sequence” details shown on the Bridge Standard Drawings website (www.wsdot.wa.gov/ Bridge/Structures/StandardDrawings.htm) shall be followed for all new WSDOT multispan prestressed concrete girder bridges. Particular attention shall be paid to the timing of casting the lower portion of the pier diaphragms/crossbeams (30 days minimum after girder fabrication) and the upper portion of the diaphragms/crossbeams (10 days minimum after placement of the deck slab). The requirements apply to multi-span prestressed concrete girder bridges with monolithic and hinge diaphragms/crossbeams.

Chapter 5
Superstructure Optimization 5.6.4.A
Girder Selection
Cost of the girders is a major portion of the cost of prestressed concrete girder bridges. Much care is therefore warranted in the selection of girders and in optimizing their position within the structure. The following general guidelines should be considered. 5.6.4.A.1
Girder Series Selection
All girders in a bridge shall be of the same series unless approved otherwise by the Bridge and Structures Engineer. If vertical clearance is no problem, a larger girder series, utilizing fewer girder lines, may be a desirable solution. Fewer girder lines may result in extra reinforcement and concrete but less forming cost. These items must also be considered. 5.6.4.A.2
Girder Concrete Strength
Higher girder concrete strengths should be specified where that strength can be effectively used to reduce the number of girder lines, see Section 5.1.1.A.2. When the bridge consists of a large number of spans, consideration should be given to using a more exact analysis than the usual design program in an attempt to reduce the number of girder lines. This analysis shall take into account actual live load, creep, and shrinkage stresses in the girders. 5.6.4.A.3
Girder Spacing
Consideration must be given to the deck slab cantilever length to determine the most economical girder spacing. This matter is discussed in Section 5.6.4.B. The deck slab cantilever length should be made a maximum if a line of girders can be saved. It is recommended that the overhang length, from edge of slab to center line of exterior girder, be less than 40 percent of girder spacing; then the exterior girder can use the same design as that of the interior girder. The following guidance is suggested. 1.
Tapered Spans On tapered roadways, the minimum number of girder lines should be determined as if all girder spaces were to be equally flared. As many girders as possible, within the limitations of girder capacity should be placed. Deck slab thickness may have to be increased in some locations in order to accomplish this.
2.
Curved Spans On curved roadways, normally all girders will be parallel to each other. It is critical that the exterior girders are positioned properly in this case, as described in Section 5.6.4.B.
3.
Geometrically Complex Spans Spans which are combinations of taper and curves will require especially careful consideration in order to develop the most effective and economical girder arrangement. Where possible, girder lengths and numbers of straight and harped strands should be made the same for as many girders as possible in each span.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-101
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
4.
Number of Girders in a Span Usually all spans will have the same number of girders. Where aesthetics of the underside of the bridge is not a factor and where a girder can be saved in a short side span, consideration should be given to using unequal numbers of girders. It should be noted that this will complicate crossbeam design by introducing torsion effects and that additional reinforcement will be required in the crossbeam.
5.6.4.B
Bridge Deck Cantilevers
The exterior girder location is established by setting the dimension from centerline of the exterior girder to the adjacent curb line. For straight bridges this dimension will normally be no less than 2′-6″ for W42G, W50G, and W58G; 3′-0″ for W74G; and 3′-6″ for WF74G, WF83G, WF95G and WF100G. Some considerations which affect this are noted below. 5.6.4.B.1
Appearance
Normally, for best appearance, the largest bridge deck overhang which is practical should be used. 5.6.4.B.2
Economy
Fortunately, the condition tending toward best appearance is also that which will normally give maximum economy. Larger curb distances may mean that a line of girders can be eliminated, especially when combined with higher girder concrete strengths. 5.6.4.B.3
Bridge Deck Strength
It must be noted that for larger overhangs, the bridge deck section between the exterior and the first interior girder may be critical and may require thickening. 5.6.4.B.4
Drainage
Where drainage for the bridge is required, water from bridge drains is normally piped across the top of the girder and dropped inside of the exterior girder line. A large bridge deck cantilever length may severely affect this arrangement and it must be considered when determining exterior girder location. 5.6.4.B.5
Bridge Curvature
When straight prestressed concrete girders are used to support curved roadways, the curb distance must vary. Normally, the maximum bridge deck overhang at the centerline of the long span will be made approximately equal to the overhang at the piers on the inside of the curve. At the point of minimum curb distance, however, the edge of the girder top flange should be no closer than 1′-0″ from the bridge deck edge. Where curvature is extreme, other types of bridges should be considered. Straight girder bridges on highly curved alignments have a poor appearance and also tend to become structurally less efficient.

Diaphragm Requirements
5.6.4.C.1
General
Intermediate diaphragms provide girder stability for the bridge deck placement and improve the bridge resistance to over-height impact loads. Diaphragms for prestressed concrete girder bridges shall be cast-in-place concrete. For large girder spacings or other unusual conditions, special diaphragm designs shall be performed. Inserts may be used to accommodate the construction of intermediate diaphragms for connections between the diaphragm and the web of prestressed concrete girders. The designer shall investigate the adequacy of the insert and the connection to develop the tensile capacity of diaphragm reinforcement. The designer shall also investigate the interface shear capacity of the diaphragm-to-web connections for construction and deck placement loads. Vertical reinforcement for intermediate diaphragms may be terminated at the top of top flange if SIP deck panels are used for the bridge deck. 5.6.4.C.2
Design
Diaphragms shall be designed as transverse beam elements carrying both dead load and live load. 5.6.4.C.3
Geometry
Diaphragms shall normally be oriented parallel to skew (as opposed to normal to girder centerlines). This procedure has the following advantages: 1.
The build-up of higher stresses at the obtuse corners of a skewed span is minimized. This build-up has often been ignored in design.
2.
Skewed diaphragms are connected at points of approximately equal girder deflections and thus tend to distribute load to the girders in a manner that more closely meets design assumptions.
3.
The diaphragms have more capacity as tension ties and compression struts are continuous. Relatively weak inserts are only required at the exterior girder.
On curved bridges, diaphragms shall normally be placed on radial lines. 5.6.4.C.4
Full or Partial Depth Intermediate Diaphragms
Based on research done by Washington State University (WSU) on damage by over-height loads24, the type of intermediate diaphragms for prestressed concrete girder bridges (including widenings) shall be as follows: 1.
Full depth intermediate diaphragms as shown in the office standard plans shall be used for bridges crossing over roads of ADT > 50,000.
2.
Either full depth or partial depth intermediate diaphragms as shown in the office standard plans may be used for all bridges not included in item a.

Concrete Structures
5.6.4.C.5
Tub Girder Intermediate Diaphragms
Where required, intermediate diaphragms shall be provided both inside and between prestressed concrete tub girders. The diaphragms inside the tub may be cast in the field or at the fabrication plant. The bottom of the diaphragm inside the tub shall be at least 3 inches above the top of the bottom flange. The diaphragms between the tubs shall be cast in the field. For diaphragms between the tubs, the roughened surface or shear keys on the sloped web faces may not be effective in resisting interface shear. All diaphragm and construction loads on the diaphragm before the deck cures and gains strength will then be resisted by the reinforcement or inserts alone. 5.6.4.D
Skew Effects
Skew in prestressed concrete girder bridges affects structural behavior and member analysis and complicates construction. 5.6.4.D.1
Analysis
Normally, the effect of skew on girder analysis is ignored. It is assumed that skew has little structural effect on normal spans and normal skews. For short, wide spans and for extreme skews (values over 30°), the effect of the skew on structural action shall be investigated. All trapezoidal tub, slab, wide flange deck, wide flange thin deck and deck bulb-tee girders have a skew restriction of 30°. Skews at ends of prestressed concrete girders cause prestressing strand force transfer to be unbalanced about the girder centerline at girder ends. In some cases, this has caused bottom flange cracking. Recent projects where this cracking occurred are Contract 8128 (Bridge Number 522/142N has W74G girders with 55 degree skew and 8 bottom flange straight strands) and Contract 8670 (Bridge Number 5/456E has WF100G girders with 56 degree skew and 40 bottom flange straight strands). Details shown in Figure 5.6.4-1 could be used to minimize bottom flange cracking for girders with large skews.

Grade and Cross Slope Effects
Large cross slopes require an increased amount of the girder pad dimension (‘A’ Skewed Girder End Details dimension) necessary to ensure that the structure can be built. This effect is especially To Prevent Cracking pronounced if the bridge is on a horizontal or vertical curve. Care must be taken that deck Figure 5.6.4-1 drainage details reflect the cross slope effect. Girder lengths shall be modified for added length along grade slope.

Curve Effect and Flare Effect
Curves and tapered roadways each tend to complicate the design of straight girders. The designer must determine what girder spacing to use for dead load and live load design and whether or not a refined analysis, that considers actual load application, is warranted. Normally, the girder spacing at centerline of span can be used for girder design, especially in view of the conservative assumptions made for the design of continuous girders. B

Repair of Damaged Prestressed Concrete Girders at Fabrication When girders suffer defects during fabrication or damage before becoming part of a final structure, the girder repairs shall be addressed with pre-approved repair procedures from the current Annual Plant Approval document for the fabricator (see Standard Specifications Section 6-02.3(25)A). If the repairs cannot be addressed by this document, the fabricator shall initiate the Fax Resolution process from the current Annual Plant Approval document to address contract specific repairs with the Project Office and HQ Bridge Construction. Normally, no designer action is required. When evaluating repairs for unusual situations not covered, the designer must ensure that the required strength and appearance of the girder can be maintained. If stressing will occur after the repair is made, normally no test loading is required; however, such a test should be considered. See reference 14 for guidance.

Chapter 5
Repair of Damaged Prestressed Concrete Girders in Existing Bridges 5.6.6.A
General
This section is intended to cover repair of damaged girders on existing bridges. For repair of newly constructed girders, see Section 5.6.5. Over-height loads are a fairly common source of damage to prestressed concrete girder bridges. The damage may range from spalling and minor cracking of the lower flange of the girder to loss of a major portion of a girder section. Occasionally, one or more strands may be broken. The damage is most often inflicted on the exterior or first interior girder. 5.6.6.B
Repair Procedure
The determination of the degree of damage to a prestressed concrete girder is largely a matter of judgment. Where the flange area has been reduced or strands lost, calculations can aid in making this judgment decision. The following are general categories of damage and suggested repair procedures (see references 15, 16). 5.6.6.B.1
Minor Damage
If the damage is slight and concerns only spalling of small areas of the outside surface of the concrete, repair may be accomplished by replacing damaged concrete areas with concrete grout. The area where new concrete is to be applied shall first be thoroughly cleaned of loose material, dried, and then coated with epoxy. 5.6.6.B.2
Moderate Damage
If damage is moderate, (damage does not exceed replacement criteria in Item 4 below), a repair procedure shall be developed using the following guidelines. It is probable that some prestress will have been lost in the damaged area due to reduction in section and consequent strand shortening or through loss of strands. The following steps shall be part of any proposed repair procedure: 1.
Determine Condition Sketch the remaining cross section of the girder and compute its reduced section properties. Determine the stress in the damaged girder due to the remaining prestress and loads in the damaged state. If severe overstresses are found, action must be taken to restrict loads on the structure until the repair has been completed. If the strand loss is so great that AASHTO prestress requirements cannot be met with the remaining strands, consideration should be given to replacing the girder.
2.
Restore Prestress If Needed Prestress in damaged/severed strands can sometimes be restored with mechanical strand couplers. Damaged girders with broken 0.6” diameter strands may need to be repaired with 0.5” diameter strands and additional post-tensioning as needed. Current commercially-available couplers are capable of restoring full prestressing force in strands of up to ½” diameter. Verify that the restoration of full prestress force will not cause overstress in the damaged girder section.
3.
Prepare a Repair Plan Draw a sketch to show the area of concrete removal required for replacement of damaged concrete, and for installation of any mechanical strand couplers required. The damaged area is to be thoroughly prepared, coated with epoxy, and repaired with grout equal in strength to the original concrete.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-107
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
5.6.6.B.3
Severe Damage
Where the damage to the girder is considered to be irreparable due to loss of many strands, extreme cracking, etc., the girder shall be replaced. This has been done several times, but involves some care in determining a proper replacement sequence. In general, the procedure consists of cutting through the existing deck slab and diaphragms and removing the damaged girder. Adequate exposed reinforcement steel must remain to allow splicing of the new bars. The new girder and new reinforcement is placed and previously cut concrete surfaces are cleaned and coated with epoxy. New deck slab and diaphragm portions are then poured. It is important that the camber of the new girder be matched with that in the old girders. Excessive camber in the new girder can result in inadequate deck slab thickness. Girder camber can be controlled by prestress, curing time, or dimensional changes. Casting the new bridge deck and diaphragms simultaneously in order to avoid overloading the existing girders in the structure should be considered. Extra bracing of the girder at the time of casting the bridge deck will be required. Methods of construction shall be specified in the plans that will minimize inconvenience and dangers to the public while achieving a satisfactory structural result. High early strength grouts and concretes should be considered. In case of replacement of a damaged girder, the intermediate diaphragms adjacent to the damaged girder shall be replaced with full depth diaphragms as shown in Figure 5.6.6-1. In case of replacement of a damaged girder, the replacement girder should be of the same type or the same depth as the original damaged girder. In case of repair of a damaged girder with broken or damaged prestressing strands, the original damaged strands shall be replaced with similar diameter strands. Restoration of the prestress force as outlined in Section 5.6.6 B-2b shall be considered. Existing bridges with pigmented sealer shall have replacement girders sealed. Those existing bridges without pigmented sealer need not be sealed.

Repair vs. Replacement of Damaged Girder
Several factors need to be considered when evaluating whether to repair or to replace a damaged girder. Among them are the level of concrete damage, number of broken strands, location and magnitude of web damage, permanent offset of the original girder alignment, and overall structural integrity. Other considerations include fresh damage to previously damaged girders, damage to adjacent girders, and cost of repair versus replacement. Ultimately, the evaluation hinges on whether the girder can be restored to its original capacity and whether the girder can be repaired sufficiently to carry its share of the original load. The following guidelines describe damaged girder conditions which require replacement:
• Strand Damage – More than 25 percent of prestressing strands are damaged/severed. If over 25 percent of the strands have been severed, replacement is required. Splicing is routinely done to repair severed strands. However, there are practical limits as to the number of couplers that can be installed in the damaged area.
• Girder Displacements – The bottom flange is displaced from the horizontal position more than ½″ per 10′ of girder length. If the alignment of the girder has been permanently altered by the impact, replacement is required. Examples of nonrepairable girder displacement include cracks at the web/flange interface that remain open. Abrupt lateral offsets may indicate that stirrups have yielded. A girder that is permanently offset may not be restorable to its original geometric tolerance by practical and cost-effective means.
• Concrete Damage at Harping Point – Concrete damage at harping point resulting in permanent loss of prestress. Extreme cracking or major loss of concrete near the harping point may indicate a change in strand geometry and loss in prestress force. Such loss of prestress force in the existing damaged girder cannot be restored by practical and cost effective means, and requires girder replacement.
• Concrete Damage at Girder Ends – Severe concrete damage at girder ends resulting in permanent loss of prestress or loss of shear capacity. Extreme cracking or major loss of concrete near the end of a girder may indicate unbonding of strands and loss in prestress force or a loss of shear capacity. Such loss of prestress force or shear capacity in the existing damaged girder cannot be restored by practical and costeffective means, and requires girder replacement.
• Significant Concrete Loss from the Web – Significant damage of concrete in the web that results in loss of shear capacity shall require girder replacement. The web damage shall be considered significant when more than 25 percent of web section is damaged or when shear reinforcement has yielded. Damaged girders shall be replaced in accordance with current WSDOT design criteria and with current girder series. There are other situations as listed below which do not automatically trigger replacement, but require further consideration and analysis.
• Significant Concrete Loss from the Bottom Flange – For girder damage involving significant loss of concrete from the bottom flange, consideration should be given to verifying the level of stress remaining in the exposed prestressing strands. Residual strand stress values will be required for any subsequent repair procedures.
• Adjacent Girders – Capacity of adjacent undamaged girders. Consideration must be given as to whether dead load from the damaged girder has been shed to the adjacent girders and whether the adjacent girders can accommodate the additional load. Page 5-110
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
• Previously Damaged Girders – Damage to a previously damaged girder. An impact to a girder that has been previously repaired may not be able to be restored to sufficient capacity.
• Cost – Cost of repair versus replacement. Replacement may be warranted if the cost of repair reaches 70 percent of the replacement project cost.
• Continuous Girders – Continuous girders with or without raised crossbeam that requires supporting falsework in the adjacent spans.
• Superstructure Replacement – Superstructure replacement shall be considered if more that 50 percent of all girders in the span are damaged or if there is a high risk of future impacts from over-height loads. 5.6.6.C

Deck Girders 5.6.7.A
General
The term “deck girder” refers to a girder whose top flange or surface is the driving surface, with or without an overlay or CIP topping. They include slab, double-tee, ribbed, deck bulb-tee, wide flange deck and wide flange thin deck girders. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-111
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
Unless noted otherwise deck girders that are not connected to adjacent girders shall use a Type 1 deck protection system; girders that only have shear connections with adjacent girders shall use a Type 3 or Type 4 deck protection system; and girders that have moment connections with adjacent girders shall use Type 2 or Type 3 deck protection systems. The requirements for bridge deck protection systems are covered in Section 5.7.4. Deck girders without a composite CIP concrete deck or topping shall have a minimum concrete cover of 2″ over the top mat. The top mat of reinforcement in the deck girder (top flange) shall be epoxy-coated. 5.6.7.B
Slab Girders
Slab girder spans between centerlines of bearing shall be limited to the prestressed concrete girder height multiplied by 30 due to unexpected variations from traditional beam camber calculations. Standard configurations of slab girders are shown in the girder standard plans. The width of slab girders should not exceed 8′-0″. Designers should minimize the number of different widths of slabs on projects in order simplify fabrication. For slab girders bearing on reinforced soil, standard details shall be modified per Section 7.5.2.A. Slab girder spans shall use a Type 4 deck protection system. The longitudinal reinforcement shall #5 bars be spaced at 12 inches maximum and the transverse reinforcement shall be #5 bars spaced at 6 inches maximum. The AASHTO LRFD criteria for deflection shall be satisfied for slab girders. A minimum of two permanent top strands shall be provided for slab girders, one adjacent to each edge. Additional permanent top strands can be used if required to control girder end tensile stresses as well as concrete stresses due to plant handling, shipping and erection. In some cases it may be necessary to use temporary top strands to control girder end tensile stresses as well as concrete stresses due to plant handling, shipping and erection. These strands shall be bonded for 10′ at both ends of the girder, and unbonded for the remainder of the girder length. Temporary strands shall be cut prior to equalizing girders and placing the CIP bridge deck. Designers may also consider other methods to control girder stresses including debonding permanent strands at girder ends and adding mild steel reinforcement. Girder equalization, shear keys and weld ties are not required when a minimum 5″ composite CIP bridge deck is placed over slab girders. Differential camber is expected to be small but the designer should ensure it can be accommodated by the CIP deck. Designers should ensure that the cross slope of girder supports are the same at both ends of each girder in order to prevent girder torsion, point loads, and gaps between the girder and the bearings. Lateral restraint of slab girder superstructures with end type A at abutments shall be provided by external girder stops, one on each side of the bridge. 5.6.7.C
Double-Tee and Ribbed Deck Girders
Double-tee and ribbed deck girders shall be limited to widening existing similar structures. A hot mix asphalt (HMA) overlay with membrane shall be specified. These sections are capable of spanning up to 60′. Page 5-112

Deck Bulb-Tee Girders
Deck bulb-tee girders have standard girder depths of 35, 41, 53, and 65 inches. The top flange/deck may vary from 4-feet 1-inch to 6-feet wide. They are capable of spanning up to 155 feet. Deck bulb-tee girders shall be limited to pedestrian bridges, temporary bridges and to widening existing similar structures. Deck bulb-tee girders shall be installed with girder webs plumb. Bridge deck superelevation shall be accommodated by varying the top flange thickness. Superelevation should be limited so that lifting embedments can be located at the center of gravity of the girder to prevent complications with lifting, hauling and erection. Use of deck bulb-tee girders should be avoided when superelevation transitions occur within the span. Girder size and weight shall be evaluated for shipping and hauling to the project site. 5.6.7.E
Wide Flange Deck Girders
Wide flange deck girders have standard girder depths ranging from 39 inches to 103 inches. The top flange/deck may vary from 5-feet to 8-feet wide. Bridge deck superelevation shall be accommodated by varying the top flange thickness. Superelevation should be limited so that lifting embedments can be located at the center of gravity of the girder to prevent complications with lifting, hauling and erection. Use of wide flange deck girders should be avoided on roadways with superelevation transitions or sharp horizontal curvature. They shall be limited to spans where the pier skew angles are within 10° of each other. Designers should balance weight, prestress and camber between adjacent girders to improve fit-up. Biaxial bending stress and the effect of an eccentric shear center shall be considered when roadway cross-slopes exceed 0.04 ft/ft. Girder size and weight shall be evaluated for shipping and hauling to the project site. 1.
Wide Flange Deck Girders with Mechanical Connections These girders rely on weld ties and a grouted keyway to connect adjacent girders. These girders shall be limited to pedestrian bridges, temporary bridges and to widening existing similar structures.
2.
Wide Flange Deck Girders with UHPC Connections These girders rely on a short non-contact lap splice between extended transverse reinforcement in cast-in-place closures of ultra high performance concrete. A nonstructural overlay shall be used on these bridges to protect the deck girders as well as accommodate differential girder camber. A polyester concrete overlay can be used. An HMA overlay can be used where the approach roadways are HMA. Modified concrete overlays may be considered, but special consideration is required to prevent debonding of the overlay from UHPC. These girders shall be limited to simple span bridges with roadway with cross- slopes of 0.04 ft/ft or less. WF39DG, WF45DG, and WF53DG girders may be erected with the web plumb or perpendicular to the roadway surface. Erect all other girders with the web plumb.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
Due to the risk of over height impacts and the difficulty of repairing UHPC connections, these bridges shall be limited to spans with at least 16’-6” of vertical clearance above roadways below. Precise fit-up between the top flanges of adjacent girders is necessary for a quality UHPC connection joint. When the ends of girders are skewed, top flange edges are vertically offset relative to one another due to camber. This is commonly known as the “saw tooth” effect. The “saw tooth” effect can be accommodated by negating the effects of camber with longitudinal top flange thickening or precamber or adjusting the bearing elevations so that adjacent top flanges align. Adjustments typically consist of raising one end of the girder and lowering the other to match the profile of the adjacent girder. This approach is only viable if the roadway profile is made to match the camber. 5.6.7.F
Wide Flange Thin Deck Girders Wide flange thin deck girders have standard girder depths ranging from 36 inches to 100 inches. The top flange may vary from 5-feet to 8-feet wide. Welded ties and grouted keys at flange edges are not required. The CIP bridge deck thickness shall be capable of accommodating expected girder camber variations and tolerances using a Type 1 Deck Protection System. The deck shall be assumed to be 7” minimum in preliminary design, but may be reduced to as thin as 6” in final design. Two mats of transverse reinforcement in the CIP bridge deck shall be designed to resist live loads and superimposed dead loads. The cover to the bottom of the bottom mat shall be 1” minimum. Bottom mat longitudinal bars are not required. Wide flange thin deck girders shall be installed with girder webs plumb. Bridge deck superelevation shall be accommodated by varying the CIP bridge deck thickness. Use of wide flange thin deck girders should be avoided with large superelevations in order to limit CIP bridge deck thickness.
5.6.8
Prestressed Concrete Tub Girders 5.6.8.A
General
Prestressed concrete tub girders (U and UF sections) are an option for moderate bridge spans. The standard tub girders (U sections) have 4′-0″ or 5′-0″ bottom flange widths and are 4′-6″, 5′-6″ or 6′-6″ deep. A 6″ deep top flange can be added to tub girders (UF sections) to improve structural efficiency and to accommodate placement of formwork and stay-inplace precast deck panels. Drain holes shall be provided at the low point of the tub girders at the centerline of the bottom flange.

Curved Tub Girders
Curved tub girders may be considered for bridges with moderate horizontal radiuses. Curved tub girders can either be designed in one piece or in segments depending on span configurations and shipping limitations. Curved tub girders are post-tensioned at the fabrication plant and shipped to the jobsite. Additional jobsite post-tensioning may be required if segment assembly is necessary, or if continuity over intermediate piers is desired. Closure joints at segment splices shall meet the requirements of Section 5.9.4.C. The following limitations shall be considered for curved tub girders:
5.6.9
1.
The overall width of curved segments for shipment shall not exceed 16 feet.
2.
The location of the shipping supports shall be carefully studied so that the segment is stable during shipping. The difference in dead load reactions of the shipping supports within the same axle shall not exceed 5 percent.
3.
The maximum shipping weight of segments may be different depending on the size of the segments. The shipping weight shall meet the legal axle load limits set by the RCW, but in no case shall the maximum shipping weight exceed 275 kips.
4.
The minimum web thickness shall be 10″. Other cross-sectional dimensions of WSDOT standard tub girders are applicable to curved tub girders.
5.
Effects of curved tendons shall be considered in accordance with Section 5.8.1.F.
6.
The clear spacing between the outside diameter of ducts shall be 2″ min. The duct diameter shall not exceed 4½″.
Prestressed Concrete Girder Checking Requirement 1.
Shear reinforcing size and spacing shall be determined by the designer.
2.
Determine lifting location and required concrete strength at release to provide adequate stability during handling. Generally temporary strands provide additional stability for lifting and transportation, and reduce the camber. Less camber allows for less “A” dimension and concrete pad dead weight on the structure. Temporary strands are cut after the girders are erected and braced and before the intermediate diaphragms are cast.
3.
Due to the extreme depth of the WF83G, WF95G, and WF100G girders, and possible tilt at the piers for profile grades, the designer will need to pay particular attention to details to assure the girders will fit and perform as intended.
4.
Check edge distance of supporting cross beam.

Bridge Decks Concrete bridge decks shall be designed using the Traditional Design of AASHTO LRFD Section 9.7.3 as modified by this section. The following information is intended to provide guidance for bridge deck thickness and transverse and longitudinal reinforcement of bridge decks. Information on deck protection systems is given in Section 5.7.4.
5.7.1
Bridge Deck Requirements 5.7.1.A
Minimum Bridge Deck Thickness
The minimum bridge deck thickness (including 0.5″ wearing surface) shall be 7.5″ for concrete girder bridges, 8.0″ for steel girder bridges, and 8.5″ for concrete girder bridges with SIP deck panels. This minimum bridge deck thickness may be reduced by 0.5″ for bridges with Deck Protection Systems 2, 3 and 5. The minimum CIP bridge deck thickness for prestressed concrete slab girders is 5″. For bridge deck overhangs that support traffic barriers, the minimum thickness shall be 8”. This minimum is intended to satisfy crashworthiness requirements as well as provide clearance for hooked transverse bars in the deck. Minimum bridge deck thicknesses are established in order to ensure that overloads will not result in premature bridge deck cracking. The minimum clearance between top and bottom reinforcing mats shall be 1″. 5.7.1.B
Computation of Bridge Deck Strength
The design thickness for usual bridge decks are shown in Figures 5.7.1-1 and 2. The thickness of the bridge deck and reinforcement in the area of the cantilever may be governed by traffic barrier loading. Wheel loads plus dead load shall be resisted by the sections shown in Figure 5.7.1-2. Design of the cantilever is normally based on the expected depth of the bridge deck at centerline of girder span. This is usually less than the dimensions at the girder ends. Figure 5.7.1-1

Computation of “A” Dimension
The distance from the top of the bridge deck to the top of the girder at centerline bearing at centerline of girder is represented by the “A” Dimension. It is calculated in accordance with the guidance of Appendix 5-B1. This ensures that adequate allowance will be made for excess camber, transverse deck slopes, vertical and horizontal curvatures. Where temporary prestress strands at top of girder are used to control the girder stresses due to shipping and handling, the “A” dimension must be adjusted accordingly. The note in the left margin of the layout sheet shall read: “A” Dimension = X” (not for design).
5.7.2
Bridge Deck Reinforcement 5.7.2.A
Transverse Reinforcement
The size and spacing of transverse reinforcement may be governed by interior bridge deck span design and cantilever design. Where cantilever design governs, short hooked bars may be added at the bridge deck edge to increase the reinforcement available in that area. Top transverse reinforcement is always hooked at the bridge deck edge unless a traffic barrier is not used. Top transverse reinforcement is preferably spliced at some point between girders in order to allow the clearance of the hooks to the bridge deck edge forms to be properly adjusted in the field. Usually, the bridge deck edge hooks will need to be tilted in order to place them. On larger bars, the clearance for the longitudinal bar through the hooks shall be checked. Appendices 5.3‑A5 through 5.3-A8 can be used to aid in selection of bar size and spacing. For skewed spans, the transverse bars are placed normal to bridge centerline and the areas near the expansion joints and bridge ends are reinforced by partial length bars. For raised crossbeam bridges, the bottom transverse bridge deck reinforcement is discontinued at the crossbeam. The spacing of bars over the crossbeam must be detailed to be large enough to allow concrete to be poured into the crossbeam. For typical requirements, see Section 5.3.3.D. For bridge decks with a crowned roadway, the bottom surface and rebar shall be flat, as shown in Figure 5.7.2-1. Page 5-118

Longitudinal Reinforcement
This section discusses reinforcement requirements for resistance of longitudinal moments in continuous multi-span prestressed concrete girder bridges and is limited to reinforcement in the bridge deck since capacity for resisting positive moment is provided by the girder reinforcement. For longitudinal reinforcement requirements for decks on steel girder bridges, see Chapter 6. 5.7.2.B.1
Simple Spans
For simple span bridges, longitudinal bridge deck reinforcement is not required to resist negative moments and therefore the reinforcement requirements are nominal. Figure 5.7.2-2 defines longitudinal reinforcement requirements for these decks. The bottom longitudinal reinforcement is defined by AASHTO LRFD Section 9.7.3.2 requirements for distribution reinforcement. The top longitudinal reinforcement is based on current office practice.

Continuous Spans
Continuity reinforcement shall be provided at supports for loads applied after establishing continuity. The longitudinal reinforcement in the bridge deck at intermediate piers is dominated by the negative moment requirement. Where these bars are cut off, they are lapped by the nominal top longitudinal reinforcement described in Section 5.7.2.D. The required bridge deck thickness for various bar combinations is shown in Table 5.7.2-1. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21

Normally, no more than 33 percent of the total area of main reinforcing bars at a support (negative moment) or at midspan (positive moment) shall be cut off at one point. Where limiting this value to 33 percent leads to severe restrictions on the reinforcement pattern, an increase in figure may be considered. Two reinforcement bars shall be used as stirrup hangers.

Concrete Bridge Deck Design and Detailing
These requirements are primarily for beam-slab bridges with main reinforcement perpendicular to traffic:
• Minimum cover over the top layer of reinforcement shall be 2.5″ including 0.5″ wearing surface (Deck Protection Systems 1 and 4). The minimum cover over the bottom layer reinforcement shall be 1.0″.
• The minimum clearance between top and bottom reinforcing mats shall be 1″.
• A maximum bar size of #5 is preferred for longitudinal and transverse reinforcement in the bridge deck except that a maximum bar size of #7 is preferred for longitudinal reinforcement at intermediate piers. #6 bars may be used for transverse reinforcement, but designers should be aware that they may not be fully developed at overhang curblines for all traffic barriers.
• The minimum amount of reinforcement in each direction shall be 0.18 in2/ft for the top layer and 0.27 in2/ft for the bottom layer. The amount of longitudinal reinforcement reinforcementin inthe thebottom bottomof ofbridge bridgedecks decksshall shallnot notbe beless lessthan than 220 ≤67 percent of √S the positive moment as specified in AASHTO LRFD Section 9.7.3.2.
• Top and bottom reinforcement in longitudinal direction of bridge deck shall be staggered to allow better flow of concrete between the reinforcing bars.

• The maximum bar spacing in transverse and longitudinal directions for the top mat, and transverse direction of the bottom mat shall not exceed 12″. The maximum bar spacing for bottom longitudinal within the effective length, as specified in AASHTO LRFD Section 9.7.2.3, shall not exceed the deck thickness.
• Allow the Contractor the option of either a roughened surface or a shear key at the intermediate pier diaphragm construction joint.
• Both top and bottom layer reinforcement shall be considered when designing for negative moment at the intermediate piers.
• Reduce lap splices if possible. Use staggered lap splices for both top and bottom in longitudinal and transverse directions.
5.7.3
Stay-In-Place Deck Panels 5.7.3.A
General
The use of precast, prestressed stay-in-place (SIP) deck panels for bridge decks may be investigated at the preliminary design stage. The acceptance evaluation will consider such items as extra weight for seismic design and the resulting substructure impacts. The composite deck system consisting of precast prestressed concrete deck panels with a CIP topping has advantages in minimizing traffic disruption, speeding up construction and solving constructability issues on certain projects. Contractors, in most cases, prefer this composite deck panel system for bridge decks in traffic congested areas and other specific cases. Precast prestressed stay-in-place deck panels typically do not require air-entrained concrete because they are protected from saturation under service. SIP deck panels may be used on WSDOT bridges with WSDOT State Bridge and Structures Engineer approval. Details for SIP deck panels are shown on the Bridge Standard Drawings website (www.wsdot.wa.gov/Bridge/Structures/ StandardDrawings.htm). Steel deck forms are not permitted in order to allow inspection of deck soffits and to avoid maintenance of a corrosion protection system. 5.7.3.B
Design Criteria
The design of SIP deck panels follows the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications and the PCI Bridge Design Manual. The design philosophy of SIP deck panels is identical to simple span prestressed concrete girders. They are designed for Service Limit State and checked for Strength Limit State. The precast panels support the dead load of deck panels and CIP topping, and the composite SIP deck panel and CIP cross-section resists the live load and superimposed dead loads. The tensile stress at the bottom of the panel is limited to zero per WSDOT design practice. 5.7.3.C
Limitations on SIP Deck Panels
The conventional full-depth CIP bridge deck shall be used for most applications. However, the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office may allow the use of SIP deck panels with the following limitations: 1.
Page 5-122
SIP deck panels shall not be used in negative moment regions of continuous conventionally reinforced bridges. SIP deck panels may be used in post-tensioned continuous bridges. WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
5.7.4
Chapter 5
2.
Bridge widening. SIP deck panels are not allowed in the bay adjacent to the existing structure because it is difficult to set the panels properly on the existing structure, and the requirement for a CIP closure. SIP deck panels can be used on the other girders when the widening involves multiple girders.
3.
Phased construction. SIP deck panels are not allowed in the bay adjacent to the previously placed deck because of the requirement for a CIP closure.
4.
Prestressed concrete girders with narrow flanges. Placement of SIP deck panels on girders with flanges less than 12″ wide is difficult.
5.
A minimum bridge deck thickness of 8.5″, including 3.5″ precast deck panel and 5″ CIP concrete topping shall be specified.
6.
SIP deck panels are not allowed for steel girder bridges.
Bridge Deck Protection Systems The roadway surface for all bridge structures shall conform to one of the listed deck protection systems. Special conditions (i.e. a widening) where it may be desirable to deviate from the standard deck protection systems require approval of the WSDOT Bridge Asset Management Unit. Preliminary plans shall indicate the protection system in the left margin in accordance with Section 2.3.8. Saw cutting or grinding pavement items are not allowed on the bridge decks. Rumble strips and recessed pavement markers shall not be placed on bridge decks, or approach slab surfaces whether they are concrete or asphalted as stated in Standard Specifications Section 8-08 and 8-09, respectively. Traffic detection loops shall not be located in an existing bridge surface. They may be installed during the construction of bridge decks prior to placing the deck concrete in accordance with Standard Plan J-50.16. 5.7.4.A
Deck Protection Systems
The following paragraphs describe five WSDOT protective systems used to protect a concrete bridge deck design. 5.7.4.A.1
Type 1 Protection System
This is the default deck protection system for cases where a deck protection system has not been specified. Type 1 protection system shall be used for cast-in-place bridge decks with two layers of reinforcement, see Figure 5.7.4-1. This also applies to CIP slab bridges, deck replacements and the widening of existing decks. System 1 consists of the following: 1.
A minimum 2½″ of concrete cover over top bars of deck reinforcing for cast-in-place decks. The cover includes a ½″ wearing surface and ¼″ tolerance for the placement of the reinforcing steel. Bottom cover shall be 1” minimum.
2.
Both the top and bottom mat of deck reinforcing shall be epoxy-coated or equivalent corrosion protection system as specified in BDM 5.1.2.
3.
Girder stirrups and horizontal shear reinforcement do not require epoxy-coating or equivalent corrosion protection system as specified in BDM 5.1.2..

5.7.4.A.2
Type 2 Protection System
This protection system consists of cementitious and polymer-based overlays on new and existing bridge decks, see Figure 5.7.4-2 for an example of a modified concrete overlay on a deck rehabilitation project. For new bridges, a 1½″ modified concrete overlay shall be used. For rehabilitation projects, the WSDOT Bridge Asset Management Unit will recommend the type of overlay. The common overlays are as follows. 1.
1½″ Modified Concrete Overlay Concrete overlays are generally described as a 1.5″ minimum unreinforced layer of modified concrete. Overlay concrete is modified to provide a low permeability that slows or prevents the penetration of chlorides into the bridge deck, but also has a high resistance to rutting. Ideally, the concrete cover to the top layer of reinforcement should be 2.5″. For new structures, the deck reinforcement shall be epoxy coated or equivalent corrosion protection system as specified in BDM 5.1.2. These overlays were first used by WSDOT in 1979 and have an expected life between 20-40 years. There are more than 600 bridges with concrete overlays as of 2010. This is the preferred overlay system for deck rehabilitation that provides longterm deck protection and a durable wearing surface. In construction, the existing bridge deck is hydromilled ½″ prior to placing the 1.5″ overlay. This requires the grade to be raised 1″.
Page 5-124
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
The modified concrete overlay specifications allow a contractor to choose between a latex, microsilica or fly ash modified mix design. Construction requires a deck temperature between 45°F–75°F with a wind speed less than 10 mph. Traffic control can be significant since the time to cure the concrete overlay alone is 42 hours. 2.
¾″ Polyester Modified Concrete Overlay These overlays were first used by WSDOT in 1989 and have an expected life between 20-40 years with more than 20 overlay as of 2010. This type of overlay uses specialized polyester equipment and materials. Construction requires dry weather with temperatures above 50°F and normally cures in 4 hours. A polyester concrete overlay may be specified in special cases when rapid construction is needed.
3.
3″ Concrete Class 4000D Overlay These are nominally 3” thick concrete overlays placed after the existing bridge deck is scarified down to the top mat of bridge deck reinforcement. The minimum thickness shall be 2” to accommodate the larger aggregate in Concrete Class 4000D. These overlays were first used in the mid 2010’s on bridges that had previously received a modified concrete overlay. Second generation modified concrete overlays were seen to suffer from debonding, which may have been caused by microcracks in the substrate concrete caused by rotary milling machines and other percussive equipment used to scarify bridge decks in the past. The increased depth of removal using hydromilling equipment ensures the removal of bruised/microcracked concrete in the existing bridge deck.
4.
Historical Overlay Systems A rapid set latex modified concrete (RSLMC) overlay uses special cement manufactured by the CTS Company based in California. RSLMC is mixed in a mobile mixing truck and applied like a regular concrete overlay. The first RSLMC overlay was applied to bridge 162/20 South Prairie Creek in 2002 under Contract No. 016395. Like polyester, this overlay cures in 4 hours and may be specified in special cases when rapid construction is needed. Thin polymer overlays are built up layers of a polymer material with aggregate broad cast by hand. The first thin overlay was placed in 1986 and after placing 25 overlays, they were discontinued in the late 1998 due to poor performance. Figure 5.7.4-2

Concrete Structures
5.7.4.A.3
Type 3 Protection System
This protection system consists of a Hot Mixed Asphalt (HMA) overlay wearing surface and requires the use of a waterproofing membrane, see Figure 5.7.4-3. HMA overlays should be applied over decks with 2” of concrete cover and epoxy-coated or other corrosion resistant reinforcing. HMA overlays provide a lower level of deck protection and introduce the risk of damage by planing equipment during resurfacing. Asphalt overlays with a membrane were first used on a WSDOT bridges in 1971 and about ⅓ of WSDOT structures have HMA. The bridge HMA has an expected life equal to the roadway HMA when properly constructed. Waterproof membranes are required with the HMA overlay. Unlike roadway surfaces, the HMA material collects and traps water carrying salts and oxygen at the concrete surface deck. This is additional stress to an epoxy protection system or a bare deck and requires a membrane to mitigate the penetration of salts and oxygen to the structural reinforcement and cement paste. See Standard Specifications for more information on waterproof membranes. HMA overlays may be used in addition to the Type 1 Protection System for new bridges where it is desired to match roadway pavement materials or for simple span WFDG girder bridges connected with UHPC. New bridge designs using HMA shall have a minimum depth of overlay of 0.25' (3″) to allow future resurfacing contracts to remove and replace 0.15′ HMA without damaging the concrete cover or the waterproof membrane. Plan sheet references to the depth of HMA shall be in feet, since this is customary for the paving industry. Existing structures may apply an HMA overlay in accordance with the Bridge Paving Policies, Section 5.7.5. Standard Plan A-40.20.00, Bridge Transverse Joints Seals for HMA provides some standard details for saw cutting small relief joints in HMA paving. Saw cut joints can have a longer life, better ride, and help seal the joint at a location known to crack and may be used for small bridge expansion joints less than 1 inch. Figure 5.7.4-3

Type 4 Protection System
This system is a minimum 5″ cast-in-place (CIP) topping with at least one mat of epoxy coated reinforcement, see Figure 5.7.4-4. This system eliminates girder wheel distribution problems, provides a quality protection system and provides a durable wearing surface. It is commonly used on slab girder bridges that transfer shear forces between girders with minimal flexure. 1.

Deck Protection System 4
Type 5 Protection System
This system requires a layered, 3″ concrete cover for double protection, see Figure 5.7.4-5. All segmentally constructed bridges shall use this system to protect construction joints and provide minor grade adjustments during construction. Segmental bridges and bridge decks with transverse post-tensioning in the deck shall use this system since deck rehabilitation due to premature deterioration is very costly. The 3″ cover consists of the following: 1.
Both the top and bottom mat of deck reinforcing are epoxy-coated or equivalent corrosion protection system as specified in BDM Section 5.1.2. Girder/web stirrups and horizontal shear reinforcement does not require epoxy-coating.
2.
The deck is constructed with a 1¾″ concrete cover.
3.
The deck is then scarified ¼″ prior to the placement of a modified concrete overlay. Scarification shall be diamond grinding to preserve the integrity of the segmental deck and joints.
4.
A 1½″ modified concrete overlay is placed as a wearing surface.

Existing Bridge Deck Widening
New deck rebar shall match the existing top layer. This provides steel at a uniform depth which is important when removing concrete during future rehab work. Bridges prior to the mid 1980’s used 1½″ concrete cover. New and widened decks using a Type 1 Protection System shall have 2½″ cover. When an existing bridge is widened, the existing concrete or asphalt deck may require resurfacing. WSDOT is forced to rehab concrete decks based on the condition of the existing deck or concrete overlay. If a deck or overlay warrants rehabilitation, then the existing structure shall be resurfaced and included in the widening project. By applying the stated design criteria, the following policies shall apply to bridge widening projects which may require special traffic closures for the bridge work. 5.7.4.B.1
Rebar
The deck or cast-in-place slab of the new widened portion shall use the Type 1 Protection System, even though the existing structure has bare rebar. The top mat of new rebar shall match the height of existing rebar. Variations in deck thickness are to be obtained by lowering the bottom of the deck or slab. 5.7.4.B.2
Concrete Decks
If the existing deck is original concrete without a concrete overlay, the new deck shall have a Type 1 Protection System and the existing deck shall have a 1½″ concrete overlay or Type 2 Protection System. This matches the rebar height and provides a concrete cover of 2.5″ on both the new and old structure. If the existing deck has a concrete overlay, the new deck shall have a Type 1 Protection System and the existing overlay shall be replaced if the deck deterioration is greater than 1 percent of the deck area. 5.7.4.B.3
Concrete Overlays
It is preferred to place a concrete overlay from curb to curb. If this is problematic for traffic control, then Plans shall provide at least a 6″ offset lap where the overlay construction joint will not match the deck construction joint.
Page 5-128
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
Chapter 5
5.7.4.B.4
HMA Overlays
The depth of existing asphalt must be field measured and shown on the bridge plans. This mitigates damage of the existing structure due to removal operations and reveals other design problems such as: improper joint height, buried construction problems, excessive weight, or roadway grade transitions adjustments due to drainage. The new deck must meet the rebar and cover criteria stated above for Concrete Decks and deck tinning is not required. Type 3 Protection system shall be used and HMA shall be placed to provide a minimum 0.15′ or the optimum 0.25′. 5.7.4.B.5
Small Width Widening
With approval of the WSDOT Bridge Management Unit, smaller width widening design that has traffic on the new construction can match existing 1½″ concrete cover for the widened portion, if the existing deck deterioration is less than 1 percent of the deck area. 5.7.4.B.6
Expansion Joints
All joints shall be in good condition and water tight for the existing bridge and the newly constructed widened portion. The following joint criteria applies: 1.
The existing expansion joint shall be replaced if:
• More than 10 percent of the length of a joint has repairs within 1′-0″ of the joint.
• Part of a joint is missing.
• The joint is a non-standard joint system placed by maintenance.
5.7.5
2.
All existing joint seals shall be replaced.
3.
When existing steel joints are not replaced in the project, the new joint shall be the same type and manufacturer as the existing steel joint.
4.
Steel joints shall have no more than one splice and the splice shall be at a lane line. Modular joints shall not have any splices.
HMA Paving on Bridge Decks 5.7.5.A
Design Responsibilities
Bridge paving design options are bridge specific based on the existing conditions and previous paving. All designers, whether WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office, Region PEO, or outside consultants, shall have the following documents in-hand before beginning any bridge deck paving design: 1.
Bridge Condition Report (BCR) as developed by the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office for each bridge within the project limits. The BCR specifies the known bridge deck paving conditions present at the bridge, and specifies the paving depths and bridge deck repair requirements as determined by the WSDOT State Bridge Asset Management unit.
2.
Project Resurfacing Report as developed by the Region Materials Laboratory. The Region PEO is responsible for field evaluation of the current surfacing condition and the current depth of surfacing as confirmed by cores taken by the Region Materials Laboratory. Surfacing depths vary from bridge to bridge and vary within the same bridge deck, so multiple cores at a bridge are necessary to establish a valid current baseline.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Page 5-129
Chapter 5
Concrete Structures
Discrepancies in paving depths specified at each bridge between the Project Resurfacing Report and the BCR shall be discussed by the Region PEO and the Bridge Asset Management unit to reach a consensus prior to continuing with bridge deck paving design. Bridge deck paving PS&E for bridges in HMA paving projects may be prepared in the Region by the Design PEO provided all of the following conditions are satisfied: 1.
A minimum of 0.25 feet of competent HMA is present on the bridge deck. Milling operations will leave a minimum of 0.10 feet of HMA on the bridge deck. Filling operations will not add more than 0.15 feet of HMA. Bridge deck repair and a waterproof membrane are not planned.
2.
No bridge expansion joint or header repair or replacement work is required.
3.
The bridges have an operating load rating equal or greater than 45 tons. Operating ratings are shown on the Bridge Engineering Information System (BEIST) summary sheet: http://beist/InventoryAndRepair/Inventory/BRIDGE
4.
The BCR indicates paving weight restrictions are not required for the structure.
Bridge deck paving PS&E for bridges not conforming to all of the criteria above will be prepared by the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office. Region is responsible for field evaluation of paving condition and the depth of asphalt provided by the last paving contract. Asphalt depths can vary on the concrete deck and from bridge to bridge. In most cases, asphalt depth measurements at the fog line on the four corners of the deck are sufficient to establish a design depth for contracts. The Bridge Asset Manager shall be informed of the measurements. Paving shown in the Plans would use an approximate or averaged value of the measurements. Some situations may require a Plan Detail showing how the depth varies to assist the planing operations. 5.7.5.B
Design Considerations
An HMA wearing surface is a recognized method to manage concrete rutting, improve the ride on HMA roadways, and is a form of deck protection. Bridges may or may not have the capacity to carry the additional dead load of an asphalt wearing surface. The following bridge paving policies have been developed with the concurrence of WSDOT Pavement Managers to establish bridge HMA Design options available for state managed structures. 5.7.5.B.1
HMA Depth
HMA thickness shall be 0.25′ or 3″. A greater depth may be allowed if structurally acceptable, such as structures with ballast or as approved by the WSDOT Load Rating Engineer. The thickness of HMA shall not reduce the exposed barrier height below minimum requirements. Paving designs that increase the HMA more than 3″ require a new Load Rating analysis and shall be submitted to the WSDOT Bridge Preservation office Load Rating Engineer.
Page 5-130
1.
Concrete bridge decks with more than 0.21′ HMA may be exempted from paving restrictions for mill/fill HMA design.
2.
Prestressed concrete deck girders and slabs with less than 0.25′ HMA require paving restrictions to avoid planing the supporting structure.
WSDOT Bridge Design Manual M 23-50.21 
Concrete Structures
3.
Chapter 5
A paving grade change will be required when more than 0.25′ of asphalt exists on a structure in order to reduce the weight on the structure and meet acceptable rail height standards.
5.7.5.B.2
Grade Controlled Structures
For bridge decks with an HMA thickness less than 0.25′ and the grade is limited by bridge joint height or other considerations, resurfacing must provide full depth removal of HMA or mill/fill the minimum 0.12′. 5.7.5.B.3
Grade Transitions
When raising or lowering the HMA grade profile on/off or under the bridge, the maximum rate of change or slope shall be 1″/40′ (1′/500′) as shown in Standard Plan A-60.30-00, even if this means extending the project limits. Incorrect transitions are the cause of many “bumps at the bridge” and create an undesired increase in truck loading. The following items should be considered when transitioning a roadway grade: 1.
Previous HMA overlays that raised the grade can significantly increase the minimum transition length.
2.
Drainage considerations may require longer transitions or should plane to existing catch basins.
3.
Mainline paving that raises the grade under a bridge must verify Vertical Clearance remains in conformance to current Vertical Clearance requirements. Mill/Fill of the roadway at the bridge is generally desired unless lowering the grade is required. See Design Manual Section 720.04 Bridge Site Design Elements, (5) Vertical Clearances, (c) Minimum Clearance for Existing Structures, 1. Bridge Over a Roadway.
5.7.5.B.4
Full Removal
Full depth removal and replacement of the HMA is always an alternate resurfacing design option. Full depth removal may be required by the Region Pavement Manager or the Bridge Office due to poor condition of the HMA or bridge deck. Bridge Deck Repair and Membrane Waterproofing (Deck Seal) standard pay items are required for this option and the Bridge Office will provide engineering estimates of the quantity (SF) and cost for both. 1.
Bridge deck repair will be required when the HMA is removed and the concrete is exposed for deck inspection. Chain drag testing is completed and based on the results, the contractor is directed to fix the quantity of deck repairs. The chain drag results are sent to the WSDOT State Bridge Asset Manager and used by the WSDOT Bridge Office to monitor the condition of the concrete deck and determine when the deck needs rehabilitation or replacement.
2.
Membrane Waterproofing (Deck Seal) is Standard Item 4455 and will be required for all HMA bridge decks, except when the following conditions are met. A. HMA placed on a deck that has a Modified Concrete Overlay which acts like a membrane. B.
The bridge is on the P2 replacement list or deck rehabilitation scheduled within the next 4 years or two bienniums.

Bare Deck HMA
Paving projects may place HMA on a bare concrete deck, with concurrence of the WSDOT Bridge Asset Manager, if the bridge is on an HMA route and one of the following conditions apply. 1.
Rutting on the concrete deck is ½″ or more.

The Region prefers to simplify paving construction or improve the smoothness at the bridge.
When the concrete bridge deck does not have asphalt on the surface, Region Design should contact the Region Materials lab and have a Chain Drag Report completed and forwarded to the Bridge Asset Manager during design to establish the Bridge Deck Repair quantities for the project. Pavement Design should then contact Region Bridge Maintenance to request the repairs be completed prior to contract; or the repairs may be included in the paving contract. Small amounts of Bridge Deck Repair have an expensive unit cost by contract during paving operations. 5.7.5.B.6
Bridge Transverse Joint Seals
Saw cut pavement joints shown in Standard Plan A-40.20-04 perform better and help prevent water problems at the abutment or in the roadway. Typical cracking locations where pavement joint seals are required: End of the bridge; End of the approach slab; or joints on the deck. However, if Pavement Designers do not see cracking at the ends of the bridge, then sawcut joints may be omitted for these locations. HQ Program Management has determined this work is “incidental” to P1 by definition and should be included in a P1 paving project and use Standard Item 6517. The following summarizes the intended application of the Details in Standard Plan A-40.20-04. 1.

BSTs are generally not a problem if the structure is not grade limited for structural reasons. BCRs will specify a ½″ chip seal paving depth of 0.03′ for BST Design to be consistent with Washington State Pavement Management System. Plans should indicate ½″ chip seal to be consistent with Standard Specifications and standard pay items. 5.7.5.B.8
Culverts and Other Structures
Culverts or structures with significant fill and do not have rail posts attached to the structure generally will not have paving limitations. Culverts and structures with HMA pavement applied directly to the structure have bridge paving design limits. 5.7.5.B.9
Paving Equipment Load Restrictions
All structures shall be evaluated for their ability to carry the weight of HMA removal and HMA paving equipment. Modern HMA roadway paving equipment can be quite heavy, and typically does not conform to legal vehicle axle patterns. This is particularly true for material transfer vehicles (MTV’s). Each plan set shall include one plan sheet for HMA removal equipment load restrictions and one plan sheet for HMA paving equipment load restrictions. These limits should be selected to give the paving contractor the most flexibility to select equipment and achieve HMA compaction. In special cases for short span bridges where only one piece of equipment can occupy a span, piece weight limits may be specified by plan note. Specified paving loads and configurations shall have an operating load rating factor greater than 1.0. An impact factor of 0.1 or greater shall be used. Vibratory methods of compaction shall not be allowed on bridges or other structures. 5.7.5.B.10
Plans Preparation
All WSDOT structures within the defined project limits must be evaluated for paving or Bituminous Surface Treatment (BST or chip seal). All bridges shall be identified in the Plans as “INCLUDED IN PROJECT” or “NOT INCLUDED” in accordance with Plan Preparation Manual Section 4 “Vicinity Map”, paragraph (n). This applies to all state bridges including but not limited to: 1.
Off the main line. Typical locations include bridges on ramps, frontage roads, or bridges out of right-of-way.
2.
Bridges where the main line route crosses under the structure.
3.
Bridges at the beginning and ending stations of the project. It is not necessary to include the bridge when it was recently resurfaced, but it should be included if incidental joint maintenance repairs are necessary.
A standard Microstation detail is available to simplify detailing of bridge paving in the Plans, see “SH_DT_RDSECBridgeDeckOverlay_Detail”. The table format is copied from the BCR and allows the bridge paving design requirements to be listed in the table. All bridges within the limits of the project must be listed in the table to clarify which structures do not have paving and facilitate data logging for the Washington State Pavement Management System and the Bridge Office.

Cast-in-place Post-Tensioned Bridges
5.8.1
Design Parameters 5.8.1.A
General
Post-tensioning is generally used for CIP construction and spliced prestressed concrete girders since pretensioning is generally practical only for fabricator-produced structural members. The FHWA Post-tensioned Box Girder Bridge Manual17 is recommended as the guide for design. This manual discusses longitudinal post-tensioning of box girder webs and transverse post-tensioning of box girder slabs, but the methods apply equally well to other types of bridges. The following recommendations are intended to augment the FHWA Manual and the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications and point out where current WSDOT practice departs from practices followed elsewhere. Post-tensioning consists of installing steel tendons into a hollow duct in a structure after the concrete sections are cast. These tendons are usually anchored at each end of the structure and stressed to a design strength using a hydraulic jacking system. After the tendon has been stressed, the duct is typically filled with grout which bonds the tendon to the concrete section and prevents corrosion of the strand. The anchor heads are then encased in concrete to provide corrosion protection. 5.8.1.B
Bridge Types
Post-tensioning has been used in various types of CIP bridges in Washington State with box girders predominating. See Appendix 5-B4 for a comprehensive list of box girder designs. The following are some examples of other bridge types: Kitsap County, Contract 9788, Multi-Span Slab Peninsula Drive, Contract 5898, Two- Span Box Girder Covington Way to 180th Avenue SE, Contract 4919, Two-Span Box Girder Longitudinal Post‑tensioning Snohomish River Bridge, Contract 4444, Multi-Span Box Girder Longitudinal Post-tensioning See Section 2.4.1 for structure type comparison of post-tensioned concrete box girder bridges to other structures. In general, a post-tensioned CIP bridge can have a smaller depth-to-span ratio than the same bridge with conventional reinforcement. This is an important advantage where minimum structure depth is desirable. However, structure depth must be deep enough to accommodate anchorages. 5.8.1.B.1
Slab Bridge
Structure depth can be quite shallow in the positive moment region when post-tensioning is combined with haunching in the negative moment region. However, post-tensioned CIP slabs are usually more expensive than when reinforced conventionally. Designers should proceed with caution when considering post-tensioned slab bridges because severe cracking in the decks of bridges of this type has occurred 21, 22, 23. The Olalla Bridge (Contract 9202) could be reviewed as an example. This bridge has spans of 41.5′–50′–41.5′, a midspan structure depth of 15 inches, and some haunching at the piers.

Chapter 5
T-Beam Bridge
This type of bridge, combined with tapered columns, can be structurally efficient and aesthetically pleasing, particularly when the spacing of the beams and the columns are the same. A T-Beam bridge can also be a good choice for a single-span simply-supported structure. When equally spaced beams and columns are used in the design, the width of beam webs should generally be equal to the width of the supporting columns. See SR 16, Union Avenue O’Xings, for an example. Since longitudinal structural frame action predominates in this type of design, crossbeams at intermediate piers can be relatively small and the post-tensioning tendons can be placed side-by-side in the webs, resulting in an efficient center of gravity of steel line throughout. For other types of T-Beam bridges, the preferred solution may be smaller, more closely spaced beams and fewer, but larger pier elements. If this type of construction is used in a multispan, continuous bridge, the beam crosssection properties in the negative moment regions need to be considerably larger than the properties in the positive moment regions to resist compression. Larger section properties can be obtained by gradually increasing the web thickness in the vicinity of intermediate piers or, if possible, by adding a fillet or haunch. The deck slab overhang over exterior webs should be roughly half the web spacing. 5.8.1.B.3
Box Girder Bridge
This type of bridge has been a popular choice in this state. The cost of a prestressed box girder bridge is practically the same as a conventionally-reinforced box girder bridge, however, longer spans and shallower depths are possible with prestressing. The superstructure of multi-cell box girders shall be designed as a unit. The entire superstructure section (traffic barrier excluded) shall be considered when computing the section properties. For criteria on distribution of live loads, see Section 3.9.4. All slender members subjected to compression must satisfy buckling criteria. Web spacing should normally be 8 to 11 feet and the top slab overhang over exterior girders should be approximately half the girder spacing unless transverse post-tensioning is used. The apparent visual depth of box girder bridges can be reduced by sloping all or the lower portion of the exterior web. If the latter is done, the overall structure depth may have to be increased. Web thickness should be 12 inches minimum, but not less than required for shear, horizontal and vertical reinforcing, duct placement, and for concrete placing clearance. Providing 2½″ of clear cover expedites concrete placement and consolidation in the heavily congested regions adjacent to the post-tensioning ducts. Webs should be flared at anchorages. Top and bottom slab thickness should normally meet the requirements of Section 5.3.1.B, but not less than required by stress and specifications. Generally, the bottom slab would require thickening at the interior piers of continuous spans. This thickening should be accomplished by raising the top surface of the bottom slab at the maximum rate of ½″ per foot.

5.8.1.C
Strand and Tendon Arrangements
The total number of strands selected should be at least the minimum required to meet the strength and service limit state requirements at all points. Check PT supplier literature for duct sizes and strand capacity. The most economical tendon selection will generally be the maximum duct size within the range than can be fit within the web. Commonlystocked anchorages for ½″ diameter strands include 9, 12, 19, 27, 31, and 37 strands. Commonly-stocked anchorages for 0.6″ diameter strands include 4, 7, 12, 19, 22, and 27 strands. The design should utilize commonly-stocked items. For example, a design requiring 66 strands per web would be most economically satisfied by three 22-strand tendons. A less economical choice would be four 17-strand tendons with 19-strand anchorages. The interior cross-sectional area of duct area shall be at least 2.5 times the net cross-sectional area of the prestressing steel. In the regions away from the end anchorages, the duct placement patterns indicated in Figures 5.8.1-1 through 5.8.1-3 shall be used. Although post-tensioning steel normally takes precedence in a member, sufficient room must be provided for other essential mild steel and placement of concrete, in particular near diaphragms and cross-beams. More prestress may be needed in certain portions of a continuous superstructure than elsewhere, and the designer may consider using separate short tendons in those portions of the spans only. However, the savings on prestressing steel possible with such an arrangement should be balanced against the difficulty involved in providing suitable anchoring points and sufficient room for jacking equipment at intermediate locations in the structure. For example, torsion in continuous, multigirder bridges on a curve can be counter-balanced by applying more prestress in the girders on the outside of the curve than in those on the inside of the curve. Some systems offer couplers which make possible stage construction of long bridges. With such systems, forms can be constructed and concrete cast and stressed in a number of spans during stage 1, as determined by the designer. After stage 1 stressing, couplers can be added, steel installed, concrete cast and stressed in additional spans. To avoid local crushing of concrete and/or grout, the stress existing in the steel at the coupled end after stage 1 stressing shall not be exceeded during stage 2 stressing.

Layout of Anchorages and End Blocks
Consult industry brochures and shop plans for recent bridges before laying out end blocks. To encourage bids from a wider range of suppliers, try to accommodate the large square bearing plate sizes common to several systems. Sufficient room must be allowed inside the member for mild steel and concrete placement and outside the member for jacking equipment. The size of the anchorage block in the plane of the anchor plates shall be large enough to provide a minimum of 1″ clearance from the plates to any free edge. The end block dimensions shall meet the requirements of the AASHTO LRFD Specifications. Note that in long-span box girder superstructures requiring large bearing pads, the end block should be somewhat wider than the bearing pad beneath to avoid subjecting the relatively thin bottom slab to high bearing stresses. When the piers of box girder or T-beam bridges are severely skewed, the layout of end blocks, bearing pads, and curtain walls at exterior girders become extremely difficult as shown in Figure 5.8.1-4. Note that if the exterior face of the exterior girder is in the same plane throughout its entire length, all the end block widening must be on the inside. To lessen the risk of tendon break-out through the side of a thin web, the end block shall be long enough to accommodate a horizontal tendon curve of 200 feet minimum radius. The radial component of force in a curved tendon is discussed in AASHTO LRFD Section 5.9.5.4.3.

To prevent excessive friction loss and damage to the prestressing sheathings, adherence to the minimum tendon radii is required. Table 5.8.1-1 and Figure 5.8.1-5 present the required minimum radius of curvature along with the required minimum tangent lengths at stressing anchorages.

Superstructure Shortening
Whenever members such as columns, crossbeams, and diaphragms are appreciably affected by post-tensioning of the main girders, those effects shall be included in the design. This will generally be true in structures containing rigid frame elements. For further discussion, see Section 2.6 of reference 17. Past practice in the state of Washington regarding control of superstructure shortening in post-tensioned bridges with rigid piers can be illustrated by a few examples. Single-span bridges have been provided with a hinge at one pier and longitudinal slide bearings at the other pier. Two-span bridges have been detailed with longitudinal slide bearings at the end piers and a monolithic middle pier. On the six-span Evergreen Parkway Undercrossing (Bridge Number 101/510), the center pier (pier 4) was built monolithic with the superstructure, and all the other piers were constructed with slide bearings. After posttensioning, the bearings at piers 3 and 5 were converted into fixed bearings to help resist large horizontal loads such as earthquakes. Superstructures which are allowed to move longitudinally at certain piers are typically restrained against motion in the transverse direction at those piers. This can be accomplished with suitable transverse shear corbels or bearings allowing motion parallel to the bridge only. The casting length for box girder bridges shall be slightly longer than the actual bridge layout length to account for the elastic shortening of the concrete due to prestress.

Analysis 5.8.2.A
General
The procedures outlined in Section 2.1 through 2.5 of reference 17 for computation of stress in single and multispan box girders can be followed for the analysis of T-beams and slab bridges as well. STRUDL or CSIBridge is recommended for complex structures which are more accurately idealized as space frames. Examples are bridges with sharp curvature, varying superstructure width, severe skew, or slope-leg intermediate piers. An analysis method in Chapter 10 of reference18 for continuous prestressed beams is particularly well adapted to the loading input format in STRUDL. In the method, the forces exerted by cables of parabolic or other configurations are converted into equivalent vertical linear or concentrated loads applied to members and joints of the superstructure. The vertical loads are considered positive when acting up toward the center of tendon curvature and negative when acting down toward the center of tendon curvature. Forces exerted by anchor plates at the cable ends are coded in as axial and vertical concentrated forces combined with a concentrated moment if the anchor plate group is eccentric. Since the prestress force varies along the spans due to the effects of friction, the difference between the external forces applied at the end anchors at opposite ends of the bridge must be coded in at various points along the spans in order for the summation of horizontal forces to equal zero. With correct input, the effects of elastic shortening and secondary moments are properly reflected in all output, and the prestress moments printed out are the actual resultant (total) moments acting on the structure. For examples of the application of STRUDL to post-tensioning design, see the calculations for I-90 West Sunset Way Ramp and the STRUDL/CSI Bridge manuals. 5.8.2.B
Section Properties
As in other types of bridges, the design normally begins with a preliminary estimate of the superstructure cross-section and the amount of prestress needed at points of maximum stress and at points of cross-section change. For box girders, see Figures 2-0 through 2-5 of Reference17. For T-beam and slab bridges, previous designs are a useful guide in making a good first choice. For frame analysis, use the properties of the entire superstructure regardless of the type of bridge being designed. For stress analysis of slab bridges, calculate loads and steel requirements for a 1′ wide strip. For stress analysis of T-beam bridges, use the procedures outlined in the AASHTO LRFD Specifications. Note that when different concrete strengths are used in different portions of the same member, the equivalent section properties shall be calculated in terms of either the stronger or weaker material. In general, the concrete strength shall be limited to the values indicated in Section 5.1.1.

Chapter 5
Preliminary Stress Check
In accordance with AASHTO, flexural stresses in prestressed members are calculated at service load levels. Shear stresses, stirrups, moment capacities vs. applied moments are calculated at ultimate load levels. During preliminary design, the first objective should be to satisfy the stress limits in the concrete at the critical points in the structure with the chosen cross-section and amount of prestressing steel, then the requirements for shear stress, stirrups, and ultimate moment capacity can be readily met with minor or no modifications in the cross-section. For example, girder webs can be thickened locally near piers to reduce excessive shear stress. In the AASHTO formulas for tensile stress limits in concrete, bonded reinforcement should be interpreted to mean bonded auxiliary (nonprestressed) reinforcement in conformity with Article 8.6 of the 2002 ACI Code for Analysis and Design of Reinforced Concrete Bridge Structures. The refined estimate for computing time-dependent losses in steel stress given in the code shall be used. To minimize concrete cracking and protect reinforcing steel against corrosion for bridges, the concrete stress limits under final conditions in the precompressed tensile zone shall be limited to zero in the top and bottom fibers as shown in Figure 5.8.2-1. In all cases where tension is allowed in the concrete under initial or final conditions, extra mild steel (auxiliary reinforcement) shall be added to carry the total tension present. This steel can be computed as described in Section 9-5 of Reference18. Figure 5.8.2-1
Box Girder Stresses
In case of overstress, try one or more of the following remedies: adjust tendon profiles, add or subtract prestress steel, thicken slabs, revise strength of concrete of top slab, add more short tendons locally, etc.

The initial offset shown is intended to result in minimal bearing eccentricity for the majority of the life of the structure. The bearing shall be designed for the full range of anticipated movements: ES+CR+SH+TEMP including load factors specified in AASHTO for deflections.
5.8.3
Post-tensioning 5.8.3.A
Tendon Layout
After a preliminary estimate has been made of the concrete section and the amount of prestressing needed at points of maximum applied load, it may be advantageous in multispan bridges to draw a tendon profile to a convenient scale superimposed on a plot of the center of gravity of concrete (c.g.c.) line. The most efficient tendon profile from the standpoint of steel stress loss will normally be a series of rather long interconnected parabolas, but other configurations are possible. For continuous bridges with unequal span lengths, the tendon profile (eccentricity) shall be based on the span requirement. This results in an efficient post-tensioning design. The tendon profile and c.g.c. line plot is strongly recommended for superstructures of variable cross-section and/or multiple unsymmetrical span arrangements, but is not necessary for superstructures having constant cross- section and symmetrical spans. The main advantages of the tendon profile and c.g.c. plot are: 1.
The primary prestress moment curves (prestress force times distance from c.g.c. line to center of gravity of steel (c.g.s.) lines) at all points throughout all spans are quickly obtained from this plot and will be used to develop the secondary moment curves (if present) and, ultimately, to develop the resultant total prestress moment curve.
2.
Possible conflicts between prestressing steel and mild steel near end regions, crossbeams, and diaphragms may become apparent.
3.
Possible design revisions may be indicated. For example, camber in bridges with unequal spans can be balanced by adjusting tendon profiles. The tendon profile and c.g.c. line diagram shall also contain a sketch of how the end bearing plates or anchors are to be arranged at the ends of the bridge. Such a sketch can be useful in determining how large the end block in a girder bridge will have to be and how much space will be required for mild steel in the end region. In general, the arrangement of anchor plates should be the same as the arrangement of the ducts to which they belong to avoid problems with duct cross-overs and to keep end blocks of reasonable width.
