Foreword The Design Manual is for use by Washington State Department of Transportation personnel, consultants and contractors engaged in transportation design. It provides policies, procedures, and methods for developing and documenting the design of improvements to the transportation network in Washington. It has been developed for state facilities and may not be appropriate for all county roads or city streets that are not state highways. The Federal Highway Administration has agreed to approve designs that follow the guidance in the Design Manual; therefore, following the guidance is mandatory for state highway projects. When proposed designs meet the requirements contained in the Design Manual, little additional documentation is required. The Design Manual supplements the engineering analyses and judgment inherent with practical design and provides uniform procedures for documenting and implementing design decisions. The Design Manual emphasizes practical design as a means to produce environmentally conscious, sustainable, context-based designs that achieve the purpose and need for the lowest cost. Practical design considers the needs of all users, fostering livable communities and modally integrated transportation system. The Design Manual also embraces Complete Streets as an approach to planning, designing, building, operating, and maintaining the transportation system that enables safe and convenient access to destinations for all people, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists and transit riders. The complexity of transportation design requires designers to make fundamental trade-off decisions and sometimes incremental approaches to balance competing spatial considerations with available resources. Although this adds to the complexity of design, it acknowledges the unique needs of specific projects and the relative priorities of various projects and programs. Updating the Design Manual is an ongoing process and revisions are issued regularly. The addition of new or modified design criteria to the Design Manual through the revision process does not imply that existing features are deficient in any way, nor does it suggest or mandate immediate engineering review or initiation of new projects. Comments, questions, and improvement ideas are welcomed. Use the WSDOT Design Manual – Comments and Revision Suggestions form or simply email the Manual Manager.

100.01 Overview The Design Manual sets the policy, procedures, and criteria to develop projects on state highways. The Design Manual facilitates the development of a highway system consistent with the needs of the multimodal traveling public. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has found the procedures and guidance in the Design Manual to be acceptable for use on federal aid projects. Deviations from the Design Manual must be approved following the procedures outlined herein. The information, guidance, and references contained herein are not intended as a substitute for sound engineering judgment. The Design Manual is not a comprehensive textbook on highway engineering, nor does it attempt to cover all the possible scenarios Washington’s highways present. It is recognized that some situations encountered are beyond the scope of this presentation. The Headquarters (HQ) Design Office occasionally issues Project Delivery Memorandums (PDM), which represent interim updates that supersede policy in this manual. The HQ Design Office also issues Design Bulletins (DB), which do not change policy, but are intended to provide clarifications about the interpretation of existing policy and guidance for manual users. Check for active PDMs and DBs on a regular basis – they are posted at https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/all-manuals-and-standards/manuals/design-manual. Note that both PDM’s and DB’s are eventually retired, once their content is incorporated in the Design Manual, or they become no longer relevant. If you have design questions not answered by the Design Manual, contact the Headquarters (HQ) Design Office.
100.02 Presentation and Revisions The Design Manual is available on the Internet. It can be accessed through the:

100.03 Practical Solutions WSDOT deploys Practical Solutions to enable incremental, flexible and sustainable transportation investment decisions as outlined in Executive Order (EO) E 1090.01, Advancing Practical Solutions. This data-driven approach uses tools, data analytics, performance measures, and stakeholder input to (1) seek lower-cost approaches and efficiencies in expanding and operating the multimodal transportation system to reduce travel demand and the need for building costly new infrastructure, (2) identify, evaluate, analyze, and manage risk to WSDOT’s strategic objectives, and (3) identify and implement agency efficiencies. The goal is to identify and solve needs as quickly and cost-effectively as possible. WSDOT uses practical solutions throughout the project development process, from planning through operation and maintenance. Examples of Practical Solutions strategies used in design include Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO), off-system solutions, transportation demand management, and incremental strategic capital solutions. (See Chapter 1100 for more information.)
100.04 Manual Applications The Design Manual incorporates and interprets the FHWA adopted design requirements found in 23 CFR 625 and 49 CFR 37.9 that apply to projects on the NHS and provides guidance for uniform application of design details under normal conditions. It also guides users through the project development process used by WSDOT. The Design Manual is used by the department to:
•
•
•
•
Interpret current design principles, including American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and other appropriate policy sources, findings, and federal and state laws. Develop projects that address modal and community performance needs. Balance the competing performance needs of highway construction projects. Design for low-cost solutions.
The Design Manual allows for flexibility in design for specific and unusual situations. For unusual circumstances, the manual provides mechanisms for documenting the reasons for the choices made. The Design Manual is developed for use on Interstate and state highways and may not be suitable for projects on county roads or city streets.
100.05 Manual Use The WSDOT Design Manual is intended to be used for design of department-owned facilities, especially the transportation facilities associated with state highways as designated by RCW 47.17. For state highway routes, projects are designed using the Design Manual practical design approach (see Chapter 1100 and Division 11). If WSDOT guidance is not used on a project, appropriate documentation and approvals are required (see Chapter 300 and Chapter 1100). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Manual Description
When WSDOT designs facilities that will be turned over to local jurisdictions, those facilities are to be designed using appropriate local geometric design criteria. When local jurisdictions design any element of state highway facilities, the Design Manual must be used. Local jurisdictions are free to adopt this manual for their local criteria or to develop their own specialized guidance for facilities not on state highway routes.

Design-Build Projects Exhibit 110-1 Design Documentation Sequence for a Typical Design-Build Project
110.01 General This chapter emphasizes that the Design Manual applies to the delivery methods of all Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) capital projects, including design-build projects. Certain terms are defined to coincide with WSDOT design-build project delivery; however, it is beyond the scope of this manual to extensively define design-build projects. Design-build projects are based on their own contractual documents (such as a Request for Proposal), which present directive language intended to legally define the project and identify requirements and controls, roles and responsibilities, and procedures and outcomes. See WSDOT Design-Build Manual M3126.06 for processes and procedures for procuring design-build contracts. www.wsdot.wa.gov/projects/delivery/designbuild/ Design-build is a method of project delivery in which WSDOT executes a single contract with one entity (the design-builder) for design and construction services to provide a finished product. In a traditional WSDOT design-bid-build contract, the design process is completed independent of the construction contract. Under WSDOT policy, the Basis of Design (see Chapter 1100 and Chapter 300) is approved prior to issuing an RFP. Delivering a project using design-build contracting eliminates very few steps when compared to the typical WSDOT design-bid-build process. The same project work tasks and products are normally required whether performed by WSDOT or the design-builder. The timing, order, and level of task detail performed are what make design-build contracting different than design-bid-build. The design-build process may shift many tasks and responsibilities from WSDOT to the design-builder depending on the project’s scope/risk analysis. The shift changes the order and development detail of the tasks and thus must be reflected in the process through contractual documents. According to state law, preservation projects with an overall project cost of $10 million and over, and all other projects with an overall project cost of $2 million and over, are required to go through the Project Delivery Method Selection process (see Section 300.02(1) Project Delivery Method).
110.02 Terminology and Language Used 110.02(1) Application of Terminology Several terms are encountered throughout the Design Manual that are not normally applicable to design-build project delivery. They are expanded in this chapter to provide appropriate meaning for design-build projects and design-build personnel. It is intended that design-build personnel acknowledge these expanded meanings and apply them throughout the manual, which will eliminate the need to restate them each time they are encountered. design-builder The firm, partnership, joint venture, or organization that contracts with WSDOT to perform the work. designer This term applies to WSDOT design personnel. Wherever “designer” appears in this manual, designbuild personnel shall deem it to mean: Engineer of Record, Design Quality Assurance Manager, design-builder, WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 110-1
Chapter 110
Design-Build Projects
or any other term used in the design-build contract to indicate design-build personnel responsible for the design elements of a design-build project, depending on the context of information being conveyed. Project Engineer This term applies to WSDOT personnel. Wherever “Project Engineer” appears in this manual, the design-builder shall deem it to mean “Engineer of Record.” Request for Proposal (RFP) The document package issued by WSDOT requesting submittal of proposals for the project and providing information relevant to the preparation and submittal of proposals, including the instructions to proposers, contract documents, bidding procedures, and reference documents. Additional terms are presented in the Design Manual Glossary of Terms.
110.02(2) Language Used for Design Flexibility The Design Manual is primarily written for WSDOT engineering personnel; however, design-builders, local agencies, and developers also use it for state and local agency projects. Under WSDOT practical design, flexibility is encouraged to develop independent designs tailored to context and identified performance need. (See chapters in the 1100 series for more information about practical design policy and guidance.) With the exclusion of this chapter, the Design Manual is intentionally written to avoid or minimize the use of directive words like “shall” and “should” in order to retain this important flexibility for the larger set of users. In the case of design-build projects, design flexibility applies to the extent allowed by the contract. The designbuilder shall refer to the project-specific RFP for design guidance. The RFP will identify design decisions and provide technical specifications relating to the project’s design.
110.03 Design and Documentation Responsibility In the traditional design-bid-build format, WSDOT bears the entire responsibility and risk for any design-related issues. As the owner, all responsibility for design decisions and conformance to standards rests with WSDOT. For design-build projects, many design responsibilities shift to the design-builder once the Notice to Proceed is issued. WSDOT is still responsible for establishing the scope, performance measurements, and existing conditions of the site as part of preliminary design. Any preliminary design done by WSDOT would be filed and documented in the Design Documentation Package (DDP) and/or the Project File (PF), which are provided to the selected design-builder to maintain throughout the design-build project design phase and then returned to WSDOT for retention. It is important to note that the design content presented in this manual has valid application based not on delivery method, but on practical design procedures and specified needs such as roadway and land use context, traffic volumes, and identified performance needs, as presented in Chapter 1100 (and other chapters). It is also important to specify that design documentation is a requirement for WSDOT projects, regardless of delivery method. WSDOT still holds the valid requirement to have an organized design documentation file and as-constructed plans for future reference after the project is built. Plan accuracy, conformance with established design guidelines, and constructability of the project rests with the design-builder.

Chapter 110
Design-Build Projects
The DDP and the PF include all the elements identified in the project RFP. The RFP specifies various DDP and PF submittals to WSDOT, identifying how each item will be submitted (report, plan sheet element, Basis of Design and design parameter element, and so on) and who is responsible for the development status (such as complete, in progress, or not started) of each item. The RFP also indicates that some of the DDP and PF items have components that were started by WSDOT and that the design-builder shall complete or update those item(s). It is the design-builder’s responsibility to obtain copies of the information from WSDOT for use in completing the DDP and PF items. The DDP and the PF require retention of original, signed documents—not copies. The RFP typically specifies that the design-builder shall provide WSDOT with updates to the DDP and PF items throughout construction of the project. For further guidance on design documentation and WSDOT acceptance thereof, see Chapter 300, the project RFP, and the Design Documentation Checklist.

Notes: The Design Documentation Package (DDP) is started by WSDOT during scoping/pre-RFP design. The designbuilder completes the DDP as the project proceeds. The design-builder shall refer to the RFP for specific review and approval processes. The RFP will specify procedures for design submittals, including notifications to WSDOT and the time allowed for reviews. WSDOT will review design submittals for conformance with requirements of the contract. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

210.01 General The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) strives to keep the public informed about transportation issues, understand the needs of all impacted communities, involve all affected communities in the transportation decision making process, and make transportation and possible mitigation decisions based on the public’s best interests. This includes identifying and engaging with overburdened communities and vulnerable populations to ensure fair treatment and access to meaningful involvement in the transportation decision-making process. One of the best ways to achieve WSDOT’s goals is to collaborate with the public, community groups, and various agencies. These participants often have differing, and sometimes conflicting, perspectives and interests. In addition, many participants and organizations are not able to spend the time and effort required to fully engage in transportation decision making. Despite these challenges, active collaboration:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Gives WSDOT access to important information and new ideas. Helps WSDOT understand the historic and generational impacts of past transportation decisions on communities. Puts us in a position to help solve problems and resolve conflicts. Creates a sense of community. Helps the public and affected communities understand how their input shape and inform decisions. Fosters greater acceptance of projects. Helps us build and sustain a credible and trusting relationship with the public. Ultimately leads to transportation improvements that better meet the public’s needs and desires.
When collaborating with the public about transportation projects or issues, WSDOT uses more formal techniques like public hearings, direct mail, and presentations to city councils and legislators; as well as less formal but equally important techniques, such as discussions via telephone, e-mail, virtual and in-person meetings with community groups, media relations, and project Internet pages. Law requires that many types of capital transportation projects go through a formal public hearing process; thus, the legal procedures necessary for public hearings is the primary focus of this chapter. Community engagement plans are briefly discussed, and referrals to WSDOT’s communications resources are included to further guide their development and implementation.

(See Section 210.06 and the Environmental Manual.)
210.04 Community Engagement Developing and implementing an effective plan for collaboration with the public:
•
•
Is critical to the success of WSDOT’s project delivery effort. Provides an opportunity to understand and achieve diverse community and transportation goals.
Effective community engagement must begin with clearly defined, project-related goals that focus on specific issues, specific kinds of input needed, and specific people, communities or groups that need to be involved. The more detailed a community engagement plan, the greater its chances of providing all, including overburdened communities and vulnerable populations, fair treatment and access to equitable and meaningful involvement, and for the project to obtain information WSDOT can use in decision making. Transportation projects with high visibility, community issues and/or effects often attract the attention of a broad range of interested people. These types of projects will best benefit from early community engagement, which can influence the project’s success and community acceptance. Developing a profile (through demographic analysis) of the affected community is critical to achieving successful community engagement and should be the first order of business when developing a community engagement plan. The profile will enable the department to tailor its outreach efforts toward the abilities and needs of the community. Overburdened communities and vulnerable populations, who are traditionally underserved by the transportation system and have historically experienced disproportionate environmental and health impacts resulting from past transportation actions, often find access to meaningful participation difficult. While these groups form a growing portion of the population, particularly in urban areas, historically they have experienced barriers to participation in the public decision-making process and are therefore underrepresented. These barriers arise from both the historical nature of the community engagement process and from cultural, linguistic, and economic differences. For example, a community made up of largely senior citizens (with limited mobility/automobile usage) may mean:
•
•
Meetings/open houses are planned in locations easily accessible to them, such as senior centers and neighborhood community centers. Meetings are scheduled in the mornings or midday to accommodate individuals who prefer not to leave home after dark.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 210-5
Chapter 210
•
Community Engagement and Hearings
Community engagement events are scheduled in the evenings to accommodate persons who work during the day.
A project’s affected area might consist of a population with limited English proficiency. This may entail:
•
•
Developing/disseminating materials in other languages, as appropriate. Having a certified translator on hand at the meetings.
Extra effort may be needed to elicit involvement from people unaccustomed to participating in the community engagement process. Their community may have been subject to historic discrimination or negatively impacted by transportation decisions. They often have different needs and perspectives than those who traditionally participate in transportation decision making, and they may have important, unspoken issues that should be heard. They not only may have greater difficulty getting to jobs, schools, recreation, and shopping than the population at large, but also they are often unaware of transportation proposals that could dramatically change their lives. A Project may negatively impact, or benefit overburdened communities and vulnerable populations. Meaningful engagement may require:
•
Prioritization of continuous engagement with communities who face environmental injustices and continue to be underinvested and underserved.
•
Recognition that people and communities hold identities that have been subject to systemic oppression, including but not limited to gender, ethnicity, and disability status.
•
Focus on engagement that builds long-term, trust-based relationships with cultural humility.
•
Adequately funding opportunities for meaningful community engagement by supporting and providing opportunities for civic voice and community capacity building that builds on existing community priorities.
NEPA and SEPA environmental policies and procedures are intended to provide relevant environmental information to public officials, agencies, and citizens, and allow public input to be considered before decisions are made. There are also various other laws, regulations, and policies that emphasize community engagement, including 23 CFR, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Washington State HEAL Act per RCW 70A.02, and Executive Orders 12898 and 13166. Some projects are required to conduct an Environmental Justice Assessment for decisions or activities that may have the potential to negatively impact, or benefit overburdened communities and vulnerable populations (contact the Region Environmental Services Office for more information). WSDOT’s collaborative process with the public should be open, honest, strategic, consistent, inclusive, and continual. Initiating a project in an atmosphere of collaboration and partnership can go a long way toward providing equal opportunities for all parties (local, state, tribal, private, nonprofit, or federal) to participate in a project vision. This collaboration requires an intensive communications effort that is initiated during project visioning and extends through construction and eventual operation of the facility. Department specialists in public communications, environmental procedures, traffic engineering, real estate services, and limited access control are routinely involved with public outreach efforts and project hearings. Depending on the scale and complexity of a project, the region is encouraged to engage the participation of interdisciplinary experts when developing a community engagement plan and communicating project details.

Community Engagement and Hearings
210.04(1) Community Engagement Plan The region develops a regional community engagement plan and/or project-specific community engagement plan(s) for its own use and guidance. For additional information, see the agency-wide Community Engagement Plan. To engage the public, share the decision-making process, identify issues, and resolve concerns, the region communicates with potentially affected community through group presentations, open house meetings, newspaper articles, fliers, and other methods. The agency-wide Community Engagement Plan includes methods that will elicit the best participation from the community, including traditionally underrepresented groups. Developing an effective community engagement plan is a strategic effort. WSDOT must identify audiences, messages, strategies, and techniques that will meet the unique needs of a proposed transportation project, as well as the needs of the public. The community engagement plan promotes participation and decision-making processes that are equitable, accessible, and relevant to the public while being culturally and linguistically grounded. The community engagement plan establishes the process that will allow all members of the public equitable opportunities throughout the project development and delivery process to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Learn about the transportation needs WSDOT has identified. Share the needs/experiences of their community. Receive information and options (e.g., design alternatives, possible mitigation strategies, etc.) from WSDOT. Collaborate. Provide input intended to inform and influence WSDOT decisions. Understand how their input shaped and informed decisions.
The plan will outline ways to identify and involve the communities potentially affected by the project; provide them with accessible information through culturally and linguistically appropriate, reader-friendly documents, graphics, plans, and summaries; and involve them in decision making. An effective community engagement plan:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
is tailored to the project and impacted community; encourages interactive communication; demonstrates to residents that their input is valued and utilized; includes all potentially affected communities; identifies and resolves community and transportation issues early in the needs identification and project development process; is conducted often throughout the project development and delivery process (i.e., planning, scoping, design and construction); ensures meaningful public access to relevant, comprehensible, and culturally grounded information; informs the public of the purpose, need for, potential impacts and benefits of the proposed action; informs the public about the process that will be used to make decisions; gains public support; and provides equitable opportunity, regardless of disability, race, national origin, color, gender, or income.
The region Communications and Environmental offices can provide expertise in developing a community engagement plan tailored to a specific project. The HQ Access and Hearings Section specializes in procedures for public hearings.

Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
Real Estate Services personnel can provide expertise regarding acquisition, relocation assistance, and other related programs. Enlisting the support of these groups is essential to the success of WSDOT projects. WSDOT recognizes local, state, federal, and tribal staff and elected officials as active stakeholders of proposed projects. Those officials might help develop and implement the community engagement plan. Early and continued contact with these resources is key to the success of a project. The community engagement plan might include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Objectives Strategies Tactics (or a list of proposed activities) Proposed time schedule to accomplish each project Methods to track public comments Methods used to consider comments during the decision-making process, including follow-up procedures Personnel, time, and funds needed to carry out the plan Identification of the project partners and stakeholders
Early use of demographics can help identify the public to be involved. After identification, a variety of methods can be chosen to encourage the most effective community engagement. This might include (directly or indirectly) any or all of the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Adjacent property owners and tenants Indian tribes Overburdened Communities Vulnerable populations Low-income groups Minority groups Cooperating and participating agencies Local, state, and federal government staff and elected officials
•
•
•
•
•
•
Community groups such as clubs, civic groups, business groups, environmental groups, labor unions, disability advocacy groups, and churches Commuters and the traveling public Emergency and utility service providers Adjacent billboard owners and clients The general public and others known to be affected Others expressing interest
The following are examples of common outreach methods:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Public and open house meetings Drop-in information centers or booths Advisory committee meetings Design workshops Meetings with public officials Individual (one-on-one) meetings Meetings with community groups Project Internet pages WSDOT project e-mail alert lists

Community Engagement and Hearings
210.04(1)(a) Public Meetings and Open Houses Public meetings range from large informational workshops to small groups using one-on-one meetings with individuals. They are less formal than hearings. The region evaluates the desired outcome from a meeting, decides how the input will be tracked, and then plans accordingly.
•
•
•
Open house meetings can be effective for introducing a project to the public and stimulating an exchange of ideas. Small meetings are useful for gaining information from community groups, underrepresented groups, neighborhood groups, and advisory committees. Workshop formats, where large groups are organized into small discussion groups, serve to maximize the participation of all attendees while discouraging domination by a few groups or individuals.
210.04(1)(b) Follow-Up Procedures Effective community engagement is an ongoing collaborative exchange, and it is necessary to provide follow-up information several times during a large project to maintain a continuing exchange of information. At significant stages, the region provides information about the project. Follow-up information conveys, as accurately as possible, how public input was considered during development of the project. It may become necessary to revise the community engagement plan as the project evolves, conditions change, oppositional groups emerge, or new issues arise. Sometimes innovative methods must be used to ensure the inclusion of affected community members. This is especially important for underrepresented groups, such as minority and low-income groups, and in communities where a significant percentage of the affected population does not speak English or have limited English proficiency. Consider the need for translators, interpreters, and providing written information in languages other than English. Reference information on limited English proficiency is provided in Section 210.04(2)(d). A resident advisory committee can often help identify community issues and concerns as well as recommend effective methods for community engagement.
210.04(2) Community Engagement References Following are a number of recommended publications, references, and training courses available to assist regions in developing community engagement plans for their projects.
210.04(2)(a) WSDOT Project Management Guide A project’s community engagement plan is an essential element of the overall project management plan. The WSDOT Project Management Guide is an Internet resource intended to support delivery of transportation projects through effective project management and task planning. The guide includes best practices, tools, templates, and examples to enhance the internal and external communication processes: Project management guide | WSDOT (wa.gov)
210.04(2)(b) WSDOT Communications Intranet Page The WSDOT Communications Intranet page provides guidance for effective communications.

210.04(2)(c) Context Sensitive Solutions and Community Involvement A proposed transportation project must consider both its physical aspects as a facility serving specific transportation objectives and its effects on the aesthetic, social, economic, and environmental values within a larger community setting. Context sensitive solutions is a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach that involves the community in the development of a project. WSDOT’s philosophy encourages collaboration and consensusbuilding as highly advantageous to all parties to help avoid delays and other costly obstacles to project implementation. WSDOT endorses the context sensitive solutions approach for all projects, large and small, from early planning through construction and eventual operation of the facility. For further information, see WSDOT Executive Order E 1028 on context sensitive solutions.

210.04(3) Legal Compliance Statements All public announcements shall include the required statements relative to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Title VI legislation. The region Communications Office and the HQ Communications Office Intranet page can provide the current version of both of these statements for legal compliance.
210.04(3)(a) ADA Compliance The ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act require WSDOT to inform the general public of its obligation to ensure programs and activities are accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. For publications, the notice must provide a way to obtain the materials in alternative formats (such as Braille or taped). For public meetings and hearings, the notice must inform the public that reasonable accommodations can be made for a variety of needs. The public meeting/hearing facility must always meet minimum ADA accessibility standards (such as ramps for wheelchair access, wide corridors, and accessible rest rooms). Additionally, WSDOT must provide, upon request, reasonable accommodations to afford equal access for persons with disabilities to information, meetings, and so on. Reasonable accommodations can include services and auxiliary aids such as qualified interpreters, transcription services, assistive listening devices for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing, or additional lighting for persons with visual impairments. The WSDOT Office of Equal Opportunity can provide assistance for reasonable accommodation provisions.

Community Engagement and Hearings
210.04(3)(b) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: Environmental Justice Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 requires that WSDOT inform the general public of its obligation to ensure that no person shall, on the grounds of race, color, and/or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise discriminated against under any of its federally funded programs and activities. See Environmental Manual Chapter 460.
210.05 Public Hearings By state and federal law, certain capital transportation projects propose actions that require a public hearing. The remainder of this chapter provides guidance on public hearing procedures. The common types of public hearings associated with WSDOT projects include environmental, design, corridor, and limited access hearings, which are discussed in subsequent sections. The guidance in this chapter covers project actions that trigger a hearing and the procedures for effectively planning, conducting, and completing the hearing process. The different types of public hearings follow similar steps for planning and preparation of project materials and information. These steps facilitate efficient reviews and approvals required for the hearing to proceed as planned. Special attention to the scheduling of deliverables and notifications leading up to the hearing help the process progress smoothly. Public hearing formats are either formal or informal. Limited access hearings are always conducted as formal hearings. An informal process can be used for most other hearings. Hearings are often conducted in accordance with NEPA/SEPA procedures for Community Engagement during the environmental documentation phase of the project. The region reviews the requirements for hearings during the early stages of project development and before completion of the draft environmental documents.
210.05(1) Coordinating the Hearing Preparing for and conducting a successful public hearing requires considerable coordination and effort. The best way to do this is by establishing a support team to identify and carry out the tasks and arrangements. It is crucial to identify and schedule tasks and deliverables well in advance of a public hearing. A project team might enlist the support of region specialists from Communications, Environmental, Government Relations, Right of Way, Real Estate, and Traffic offices, as well as the HQ Hearing Coordinator, HQ NEPA Policy staff, Office of Equal Opportunity, and others involved with the project. The following exhibits and narrative help identify whether a public hearing is required and how to prepare.
210.05(2) Selecting the Hearing Type By law, certain project actions or proposed conditions require that specific types of public hearings are conducted. Exhibit 210-1 identifies project conditions and their associated hearing requirements. If one or more of the conditions in Exhibit 210-1 occurs, a notice of opportunity for a hearing is required by federal and state law (USC Title 23 §771.111 and RCW 47.52) and by WSDOT policy. Consult the Hearing Coordinator in the HQ Access and Hearings Section, as well as project environmental specialists, for hearing requirements.

Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
210.05(3) Selecting the Hearing Format The types of public hearing formats used by WSDOT are known as formal and informal. Hearing formats are different than hearing types. In some cases, the hearing type will dictate the required format, such as with limited access hearings. The following text and Exhibit 210-2 provide guidance on formats.
210.05(3)(a) Formal Hearings A formal hearing is conducted by a moderator using a formal agenda, overseen by a hearing examiner, and recorded by a court reporter, as required by law. Limited access hearings and administrative appeal hearings require the use of the formal hearing format. For projects that require a formal public hearing, it is common for WSDOT to hold a public open house preceding the hearing. The following are required for all formal hearings:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Hearing notice with a fixed time and date (see Sections 210.05(5) and 210.05(6)) Fixed agenda and script Hearing examiner Hearing moderator (may be the hearing examiner) Court reporter Specified comment period Hearing summary (see Section 210.05(10))
In addition to providing oral comments, people can write opinions on the comment forms available at or after the hearing and submit them before the announced deadline.
210.05(3)(b) Informal Hearings An informal hearing is also known as an open format hearing. Individual oral comments are recorded by a court reporter. The presence of a hearing examiner and a formal agenda are optional. These events are typically scheduled for substantial portions of an afternoon or evening so people can drop by at their convenience and fully participate. Activities usually include attending a presentation, viewing exhibits, talking to project staff, and submitting written or oral comments. The following items are features of an open format (or informal) hearing:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
They can be scheduled to accommodate people’s work schedules. Brief presentations about the project and hearing process are advertised at preset times in the hearing notice. Presentations can be live, videotaped, or computerized. Agency or technical staff is present to answer questions and provide details of the project. Information is presented buffet-style, allowing participants access to specific information. Graphics, maps, photos, models, videos, and related documents are frequently used. People have the opportunity to clarify their comments by reviewing materials and asking questions before commenting. People can comment formally before a court reporter, or they can write opinions on comment forms and submit them before the announced deadline.
210.05(4) Hearing Preparation When region staff have determined that a formal or informal public hearing will be held, they should contact the HQ Hearing Coordinator to discuss preliminary details. The HQ Hearing Coordinator specializes in assisting with preparations for the hearing and will usually attend. Other WSDOT groups involved with the project and tasked WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Community Engagement and Hearings
with developing and implementing the Community Engagement plan can assist with hearing preparations and provide assistance at the hearing. The exhibits in this chapter can be used as checklists to identify important milestones and work products needed. Important elements include setting an initial target date for the hearing and agreeing on staff roles and responsibilities at the hearing.
210.05(4)(a) Setting the Hearing Date and Other Arrangements The Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, sets the hearing date at the recommendation of the HQ Hearing Coordinator. This is known as the order of hearing. Final arrangements for the hearing date can be handled by telephone or brief check-in meetings between the HQ Hearing Coordinator and the region. The region proposes a hearing date based on the following considerations:
•
•
•
Convenient for community participation. Contact local community and government representatives to avoid possible conflict with local activities. Consider times and locations that are most appropriate for the community. For corridor and design hearings, at least 30 days after circulation of the draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) or the published notice of availability of any other environmental document. In most cases, more than 45 days after submittal of the prehearing packet.
The region makes other arrangements as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Reviews the location of the hearing hall to ensure it is easily accessed by public transportation (whenever possible), convenient for community participation, and ADA accessible. Arranges for a court reporter. Requests that the HQ Hearing Coordinator provide a hearing examiner for all limited access hearings and for other hearings, if desired. Develops a hearing agenda for all limited access hearings and for other types of hearings, if desired. If requested in response to the hearing notice, provides communication auxiliary aids and other reasonable accommodations required for persons with disabilities. Examples include interpreters for persons who are deaf; audio equipment for persons who are hard of hearing; language interpreters; and the use of guide animals and Braille or taped information for persons with visual impairments. All public hearings and meetings require the development of procedures for the collection of statistical data (race, color, sex, and national origin) on state highway program participants and beneficiaries such as relocatees, impacted citizens, and affected communities. Community Engagement Forms should be available for meeting attendees to complete. This form requests attendees to provide information on their race, ethnicity, national origin, and gender. It is available in English, Spanish, Korean, Russian, Vietnamese, and Traditional and Simplified Chinese at: https://wsdot.wa.gov/about/title-vi-limitedenglish-proficiency If demographics indicate that 5% or 1000 persons or more in the affected project area speak a language other than English, vital documents, advertisements, notices, newspapers, mailing notices, and other written and verbal media and informational materials may need to be translated into other languages to ensure social impacts to communities and people are recognized and considered throughout the transportation planning and decision-making process. In addition, language interpreters may need to be present during the hearings or public meetings to ensure individuals and minority communities are included throughout the process.

210.05(4)(b) Developing the Prehearing Packet The region prepares a prehearing packet, which contains an organized grouping of project information to be used at the hearing. The project team members and specialists enlisted to support the Community Engagement and hearing processes typically coordinate to produce the prehearing packet elements. Much of the information needed in the prehearing packet will come from the project’s Community Engagement plan. The following information is included in the prehearing packet:
i Project Background Information and Exhibits A project vicinity map and pertinent plans and exhibits for the hearing. The prehearing packet also contains a brief written narrative of the project. Usually, this narrative is already prepared and available in Project File documents, Community Engagement plans, or on a project Internet page.
ii Proposed Hearing Type, Format, and Logistics The prehearing packet identifies the type of hearing required. A hearing support team provides various planning details and helps with arrangements (date, time, place, and announcements). A public open house is often scheduled on the same day, preceding a formal hearing, to provide opportunity for community involvement.
iii News Release The region Communications Office can assist in preparing announcements for the hearing and other public events.
iv Legal Hearing Notice Notices must contain certain legal statements provided by the HQ Access and Hearings Section. (See Sections 210.05(5) and 210.05(6) for guidance on notices.)
v List of Newspapers and Other Media Sources These are the media sources used to announce the hearing. The region Communications Office has developed relations with reporters and media outlets, including minority publications and media, and is accustomed to working these issues. Enlist the office’s support for hearing preparations.
vi List of Legislators and Government Agencies Involved Special notice is sent to local officials and legislators announcing public hearings. At formal hearings, the moderator and agenda typically identify those officials so they can interact with the public. The HQ Government Relations Office can assist with identifying and notifying legislators and key legislative staff within the project area.
vii The Hearing Agenda and Script These are required for formal hearings and are prepared by the region. The HQ Access and Hearings Section can provide sample agendas and scripts to support the region in its hearing preparations. Exhibit 210-3 provides a checklist of prehearing packet contents, including additional items needed for limited access hearings.

Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
210.05(4)(c) Preparing and Sending a Prehearing Packet You should prepare a prehearing packet at least 45 days in advance of the public hearing and send it to the HQ Access and Hearings Section. The HQ Hearing Coordinator reviews and concurs with the region’s plans and recommends the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division’s approval of the hearing date. Headquarters concurrence with the prehearing packet typically requires two weeks after receipt of the information.
210.05(5) Public Hearing Notices: Purpose and Content There are two types of public notices for hearings: notice of hearing and notice of opportunity for a hearing. Consult the HQ Hearing Coordinator for specific project hearing requirements and implementation strategies.
210.05(5)(a) Notice of Hearing A notice of hearing is prepared and published when a hearing is required by law and cannot be waived.
210.05(5)(b) Notice of Opportunity for a Hearing In select cases, a notice of opportunity for a hearing is prepared and published in order to gauge the public’s interest in having a particular hearing. This kind of notice is only used if the requirements for a hearing can be legally waived. In these cases, documentation is required as set forth in Section 210.05(7).
210.05(5)(c) Content Requirements The HQ Access and Hearings Section provides sample notices to the region upon request. Public notices include statements that are required by state and federal statutes. Some important elements of a notice include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
A map or graphic identifying project location and limits. For a notice of opportunity for a hearing, include the procedures for requesting a hearing and the deadline, and note the existence of the relocation assistance program for persons or businesses displaced by the project. For an environmental, corridor, design, or combined corridor-design hearing, or for a notice of opportunity for a hearing, announce the availability of the environmental document and accessible locations. Project impacts to wetlands; flood plains; prime and unique farmlands; Section 4(f), 6(f), or 106 properties; endangered species or related habitats; or affected communities. Information on any associated prehearing presentation(s). Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VI legislation statements.
210.05(6) Publishing Hearing Notices: Procedure To advertise a legal notice of hearing or a notice of opportunity for a hearing, use the following procedure for appropriate media coverage and timing requirements: (A) Headquarters Concurrence As part of the prehearing packet, the region transmits the proposed notice and a list of the newspapers in which the notice will appear to the HQ Hearing Coordinator for concurrence prior to advertisement.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 210-15
Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
(B) Region Distribution of Hearing Notice Upon receiving Headquarters concurrence, the region distributes copies of the hearing notice and news release as follows: o Send a copy of the hearing notice and a summary project description to appropriate legislators and local officials one week before the first publication of a hearing notice. Provide the HQ Government Relations Office with a copy of all materials that will be distributed to legislators, along with a list of legislative recipients. o Advertise the hearing notice in the appropriate newspapers within one week following the mailing to legislators. The advertisement must be published in a newspaper with general circulation in the vicinity of the proposed project or with a substantial circulation in the area concerned, such as foreign language and local newspapers. If affected limited-Englishproficient populations have been identified, other foreign language newspapers may be appropriate as well. The legal notices section may be used or, preferably, a paid display advertisement in a prominent section of the newspaper, such as the local news section. With either type of advertisement, request that the newspaper provide an affidavit of publication. o Distribute the project news release to all appropriate news media about three days before the first publication of a hearing notice, using newspapers publishing the formal advertisement of the notice. o Additional methods may also be used to better reach interested or affected groups or individuals, including notifications distributed via project e-mail lists, ads in local community news media, direct mail, fliers, posters, and telephone calls. o For corridor and design hearings, the first notice publication must occur at least 30 days before the date of the hearing. The second publication must be 5 to 12 days before the date of the hearing (see Exhibit 210-4). The first notice for a corridor or design hearing shall not be advertised prior to public availability of the draft environmental document. o For limited access and environmental hearings, the notice must be published at least 15 days prior to the hearing. The timing of additional publications is optional (see Exhibit 210-5). o For a notice of opportunity for a hearing, the notice must be published once each week for two consecutive weeks. The deadline for requesting a hearing must be at least 21 days after the first date of publication and at least 14 days after the second date of publication. o A copy of the published hearing notice is sent to the HQ Hearing Coordinator at the time of publication. (C) Headquarters Distribution of Hearing Notice The HQ Hearing Coordinator sends a copy of the notice of hearing to the Transportation Commission, Attorney General’s Office, HQ Communications Office, and FHWA (if applicable). For a summary of the procedure and timing requirements, see Exhibit 210-4 (for environmental, corridor, and design hearings) or Exhibit 210-5 (for limited access hearings).

Community Engagement and Hearings
210.05(7) No Hearing Interest: Procedure and Documentation As described in Section 210.05(5), in select cases the region can satisfy certain project hearing requirements by advertising a notice of opportunity for a hearing. This procedure can be beneficial, particularly with limited access hearings in cases where very few abutting property owners are affected. If no hearing requests are received after issuing the notice of opportunity, the following procedures and documentation are required to waive a hearing.
210.05(7)(a) Corridor or Design Hearing If no requests are received for a corridor or design hearing, the region transmits a package, which includes the notice of opportunity for a hearing, the affidavit of publication of the notice, and a letter stating that there were no requests for a hearing, to the HQ Access and Hearings Section.
210.05(7)(b) Limited Access Hearing When a notice of opportunity for a hearing is used to fulfill the requirements for a limited access hearing and there are no requests for a hearing, the following steps are taken:
•
•
•
The region must secure signed hearing waivers from every abutting property owner whose access rights will be affected by the project, as well as the affected local agency. The HQ Access and Hearings Section can supply a sample waiver to the region. The Project Engineer must contact every affected property owner of record (not tenant) and the local agency to explain the proposed project. This explanation must include information on access features, right of way acquisition (if any), and the right to a hearing. Property owners must also be advised that signing the waiver will not affect their right to fair compensation for their property, nor will it affect their access rights or relocation benefits. The region transmits the original signed waivers to the HQ Access and Hearings Section, along with the affidavit of publication of the notice of opportunity for a limited access hearing and a recommendation for approval of the right of way plan. Once the completed package is received by the HQ Access and Hearings Section, it is submitted to the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, for review and approval.
210.05(7)(c) Environmental Hearing Environmental hearings cannot use the process of waivers to satisfy project hearing requirements.
210.05(8) Prehearing Briefs and Readiness After publication of a hearing notice, the region should expect to receive public requests for information and project briefings, including requests for information in languages other than English.
210.05(8)(a) Presentation of Material for Inspection and Copying The information outlined in the hearing notice and other engineering and environmental studies, as well as information intended to be presented at the hearing, must be made available for public review and copying throughout the period between the first advertisement and the approval of the hearing summary or findings and order. The information may also need to be available in languages other than English if indicated by demographics. The information need not be in final form, but it must include every item currently included in the hearing presentation. The environmental documents must also be available for public review.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 210-17
Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
These materials are made available in the general locality of the project. The region reviews the variables (the locations of the Project Office and project site; the interested individuals; and the probability of requests for review) and selects a mutually convenient site for the presentation of the information. In accordance with RCW 42.56, a record should be kept for future evidence, stating who came in, when, and what data they reviewed and copied.
210.05(8)(b) Hearing Briefing On controversial projects, the HQ Hearing Coordinator arranges for a briefing (held before the hearing) for those interested in the project. Attendants typically include appropriate Headquarters, region, and FHWA personnel, with special notice to the Secretary of Transportation. Region personnel present the briefing.
210.05(8)(c) Prehearing Presentation The region is encouraged to give an informal presentation to the public for discussion of the project prior to the hearing. A prehearing presentation is informal, with ample opportunity for exchange of information between WSDOT and the public. Providing community members with opportunities to talk about their concerns in advance of the hearing promotes positive public relationships and can make the actual hearing proceed more smoothly. Prehearing presentations can be open house meetings, drop-in centers, workshops, or other formats identified in the Community Engagement plan. The prehearing presentation is usually held about one week before the hearing for more controversial projects, modified as needed. Include the date, time, and place in the hearing notice and ensure it is mailed in time to give adequate notice of the prehearing presentation.
210.05(9) Conducting the Hearing The hearing is facilitated by the Regional Administrator or a designee. Normally, a hearing examiner is used when significant controversy or considerable Community Engagement is anticipated. A hearing examiner is required for limited access hearings. A verbatim transcript of the proceedings is made by a court reporter. Hearings are generally more informative and gain more public participation when an informal format is used, where people’s views and opinions are openly sought in a casual and personal way. The informal hearing format may be used for all hearings except limited access hearings. At least one court reporter is required to take individual testimony. Use displays, exhibits, maps, and tables, and have knowledgeable staff available to answer specific questions about the proposed project. It is the responsibility of the hearing moderator and other department representatives to be responsive to all reasonable and appropriate questions. If a question or proposal is presented at the limited access hearing that can only be answered at a later date, the region shall reserve an exhibit to respond to the comment in the findings and order. The hearing moderator must not allow any person to be harassed or subjected to unreasonable cross-examination.
210.05(9)(a) Hearing Agenda Items For all limited access hearings, and for other formal hearings, the region prepares a hearing agenda to ensure all significant items are addressed. A hearing agenda includes the following:

Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
i Opening Statement
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Highway and project name. Purpose of hearing. Description of how the hearing will be conducted. Introduction of elected officials. Federal/State/County/City relationship. Statutory requirements being fulfilled by the hearing. Status of the project with regard to NEPA/SEPA documents. Description of information available for review and copying. For environmental, corridor, or design hearings, notice that written statements and other exhibits can be submitted during the open record period following the hearing. Statement that all who want to receive written notification of WSDOT’s action as a result of the hearing may add their names to the interest list or file a notice of appearance for limited access hearings.
ii Project History Present a brief project history, including purpose and need for the project, Community Engagement program, future hearing opportunities, and hearings held.
iii Presentation of Plans Develop alternatives that include comparable levels of detail and present them equally. Include the noaction alternative. Refer to any supporting studies that are available to the public. Identify a preliminary preferred alternative, if selected by WSDOT, for more detailed development. When a preliminary preferred alternative has been identified, stress that it is subject to revision and reevaluation based on public comments, additional studies, and other information that may become available.
iv Environmental, Social, and Economic Discussion Discuss all positive and negative environmental, social, and economic effects (or summarize the major effects) and refer to the environmental documentation.
v Statements, Plans, or Counterproposals from the Public Accept public views or statements regarding the proposal presented, the alternatives, and the social, economic, and environmental effects identified. Avoid evaluating the views presented while conducting the hearing.
vi Relocation Assistance Program Explain the relocation assistance program and relocation assistance payments available. At all hearings, the relocation assistance brochure must be available for free distribution, including (if appropriate) brochures in languages other than English. Real Estate Services personnel should be available. If the project does not require any relocations, the relocation assistance discussion may be omitted. Make a simple statement to the effect that relocation assistance is provided, but currently no relocations have been identified for the project. The relocation brochure and personnel should still be available to the public at the hearing.

Community Engagement and Hearings
vii Acquisition Discuss right of way acquisition, estimated cost, and currently proposed construction schedules and critical activities that may involve or affect the public.
viii Closing Summarize the hearing and announce proposed future actions.
ix Adjournment Adjourn the hearing with sincere gratitude for the public’s valuable participation.
210.05(10) Hearing Summary and Adoption Upon completion of a public hearing, a documentation and approval procedure leads to official adoption of the hearing proceedings. After the hearing, a summary is prepared by the region. There are two types of summary documents used, depending on the type of hearing. For environmental, corridor, and design hearings, a hearing summary is produced. Following a limited access hearing, a findings and order document is prepared. Each of these packages is comprised of documentation assembled by the region and approved by Headquarters.
210.05(10)(a) Hearing Summary Contents The hearing summary includes the following elements: 1. Hearing transcript. 2. Copy of the affidavit of publication of the hearing notice. 3. Hearing material: o Copies of the letters received before and after the hearing. o Copies or photographs of, or references to, every exhibit used in the hearing. 4. Summary and analyses of all oral and written comments. Include consideration of the positive and negative social, economic, and environmental aspects of these comments.
210.05(10)(b) Limited Access Hearing Findings and Order Following a limited access hearing, the “summary” document is labeled the findings and order. Refer to Section 210.09(12) for the process description and required documentation for findings and order documents.
210.05(10)(c) Adoption and Approval For specific hearing types, see subsequent sections in this chapter related to adoption procedures. Exhibit 210-6 identifies the Headquarters approval authority for hearing summary and findings and order documents.
210.06 Environmental Hearing Early coordination with appropriate agencies and the public may help to determine the appropriate level of environmental documentation, the scope of the document, the level of analysis, and related environmental disciplines to be analyzed. Environmental documents address the positive and negative social, economic, and environmental project effects, as described in Chapter 225 and the Environmental Manual. The project environmental documentation is the first step in the environmental hearing procedure. Each step of the hearing procedure is dovetailed into the environmental process and is important in achieving the appropriate project documentation. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 210-20
Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
Corridor and design hearings are not normally required for Environmental Assessments, SEPA Checklists, and categorically excluded projects. However, the opportunity for an environmental hearing might be required or advisable for controversial proposals. When an environmental hearing is not required, an informational meeting may serve as a useful forum for Community Engagement in the environmental process. Consult with region environmental staff and the HQ Hearing Coordinator for specific project requirements. Projects requiring an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) must use an evaluation process called scoping in the NEPA and SEPA requirements. This process helps the project proponents identify the significant issues and possible alternatives analyzed and documented in the Draft EIS, and it must follow the Community Engagement plan included in the environmental study plan for the project. After the project has been thoroughly analyzed through the environmental evaluation process and discussed within the community using informal Community Engagement methods, a hearing is held to present and gather testimony. The hearing is timed to fall within the comment period for the Draft EIS. For an environmental hearing, the hearing notice must be published at least 15 days prior to the hearing. The timing of additional publications is optional (see Exhibit 210-4). Responses to comments on the Draft EIS must be addressed in the Final EIS.
210.06(1) Environmental Hearing Summary The environmental hearing summary includes the items outlined in Section 210.05(10).
210.06(2) Adoption of Environmental Hearing Chapter 225 and the Environmental Manual provide guidance on NEPA and SEPA procedures, documentation requirements, and approvals.
210.07 Corridor Hearing A corridor hearing is a public hearing that:
•
•
•
Is held before WSDOT is committed to a preferred alternative establishing the final route corridor. Is held to ensure opportunity is afforded for effective participation by interested persons in the process of determining the need for and location of a state highway. Provides the public an opportunity to present views on the social, economic, and environmental effects of the proposed alternative highway corridors.
A corridor hearing is required if any of the following project actions would occur:
•
•
•
Proposed route on new location. Substantial social, economic, or environmental impacts. Significant change in layout or function of connecting roads or streets.
When a corridor hearing is held, the region must provide enough design detail on the proposed alignment(s) within the corridor(s) that an informed presentation can be made at the hearing. Justification to abandon an existing corridor must also be presented. For general procedures and notification requirements, see Section 210.05 and Exhibit 210-4.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 210-21
Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
210.07(1) Corridor Hearing Summary After the hearing, the region:
•
•
•
•
Reviews the hearing transcript. Responds to all questions or proposals submitted at or subsequent to the hearing. Compiles a corridor hearing summary. Transmits three copies (four copies for Interstate projects) to the HQ Access and Hearings Section.
When appropriate, the hearing summary may be included in the FEIS. If not included, submit the complete corridor hearing summary to the HQ Access and Hearings Section within approximately two months following the hearing. The corridor hearing summary includes the items outlined in Section 210.05(10).
210.07(2) Adoption of Corridor Hearing Summary The HQ Access and Hearings Section prepares a package that contains the corridor hearing summary and a formal description of the project and forwards it to the Assistant Secretary, Engineering & Regional Operations, for adoption. The HQ Hearing Coordinator notifies the region when adoption has occurred and returns an approved copy to the region.
210.08 Design Hearing A design hearing is a public hearing that:
•
•
Is held after a route corridor is established and approved, but before final design of a highway is engineered. Is held to ensure an opportunity is afforded for the public to present its views on each proposed design alternative, including the social, economic, and environmental effects of those designs.
A design hearing is required if any of the following project actions will occur:
•
•
•
Substantial social, economic, or environmental impacts. Significant change in layout or function of connecting roads or streets. Acquisition of a significant amount of right of way results in relocation of individuals, groups, or institutions.
For general procedures and notification requirements, see Section 210.05 and Exhibit 210-4.
210.08(1) Design Hearing Summary The design hearing summary includes the elements outlined in Section 210.05(10). Submit the complete hearing summary to the HQ Access and Hearings Section within approximately two months following the hearing. If new studies or additional data are required subsequent to the hearing, the region compiles the information in coordination with the HQ Design Office.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 210-22
Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
210.08(2) Adoption of Design Hearing Summary After the hearing, the region reviews the hearing transcript, responds to all questions or proposals submitted at or subsequent to the hearing, compiles a hearing summary, and transmits three copies (four copies for Interstate projects) to the HQ Access and Hearings Section. When appropriate, the design hearing summary may be included in the final environmental document. The HQ Access and Hearings Section prepares a formal document that identifies and describes the project and submits it to the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, for approval. One approved copy is returned to the region. The HQ Hearing Coordinator notifies the region that adoption has occurred. On Interstate projects, the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, (or designee) submits the approved design hearing summary to the FHWA for federal approval. If possible, this submittal is timed to coincide with the submittal of the Design Decision Summary to the FHWA.
210.08(3) Public Notification of Action Taken The region prepares a formal response to individuals who had unresolved questions at the hearing. The region keeps the public advised regarding the result(s) of the hearing process, such as project adoption or revision to the plan. A project newsletter sent to those on the interest list is an effective method of notification. Project news items can be sent via e-mail or by more traditional methods.
210.09 Limited Access Hearing Limited access hearings are required by law (per RCW 47.52) whenever limited access is established or revised on new or existing highways. Decisions concerning limited access hearings are made on a project-by-project basis by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, based on information that includes the recommendations submitted by the region (see Chapter 510, Chapter 520, Chapter 530, and Chapter 540). Limited access hearing procedures generally follow those identified in Section 210.05; however, several unique products and notifications are also prepared. These include limited access hearing plans and notifications sent to abutting property owners and local jurisdictions. (See Section 210.09(4) and Exhibit 210-3 for a listing of these products.) Exhibit 210-5 presents a summary of the limited access hearing procedures. Prior to the limited access hearing (RCW 47.52.131), discussions with the local jurisdictions shall be held on the merits of the limited access report and the limited access hearing plan(s). These are required exhibits for the limited access hearing. (See Chapter 530 for guidance on limited access reports.) The following information applies only to limited access hearings and procedures for approval of the findings and order.
210.09(1) Hearing Examiner The HQ Access and Hearings Section hires an administrative law judge from the Office of Administrative Hearings to conduct the limited access hearing.
210.09(2) Order of Hearing The order of hearing officially establishes the hearing date. The Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, approves the order of hearing. The HQ Hearing Coordinator then notifies the region, the Attorney General’s Office, and the hearing examiner of the official hearing date.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
210.09(3) Limited Access Hearing Plan The region prepares a limited access hearing plan to be used as an exhibit at the formal hearing and forwards it to the HQ Plans Engineer for review and approval approximately 45 days before the hearing. This is a Phase 2 Plan (see Chapter 510). The HQ Plans Engineer schedules the approval of the limited access hearing plan on the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division’s calendar.
210.09(4) Limited Access Hearing Information to Abutters The region prepares an information packet that must be mailed to abutters, and other entities as specified below, at least 15 days prior to the hearing and concurrent with advertisement of the hearing notice. These items are elements of the prehearing packet as described in Section 210.05(4)(b) and in Exhibit 210-3. If some of the limited access hearing packets are returned as undeliverable, the region must make every effort to communicate with the property owners. The limited access hearing packet for abutters contains the following:
•
•
•
Limited access hearing plan Limited access hearing notice Notice of appearance
The region also sends the limited access hearing packet to:
•
•
•
•
The county and/or city. The owners of property listed on the county tax rolls as abutting the section of highway, road, or street being considered at the hearing as a limited access facility. Local agencies and public officials who have requested a notice of hearing or who, by the nature of their functions, objectives, or responsibilities, are interested in or affected by the proposal. Every agency, organization, official, or individual on the interest list.
The limited access hearing packet is also sent, when applicable, to:
•
•
•
•
•
State resource, recreation, and planning agencies. Tribal governments. Appropriate representatives of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Other federal agencies. Public advisory groups.
210.09(5) Affidavit of Service by Mailing The region prepares an affidavit of service by mailing. This affidavit states that the limited access hearing packet was mailed at least 15 days prior to the hearing and that it will be entered into the record at the hearing.
210.09(6) Limited Access Hearing Plan Revisions The limited access hearing plan cannot be revised after the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division (or designee), approves the plan without rescheduling the hearing. If significant revisions to the plan become necessary during the period between the approval and the hearing, the revisions can be made and must be entered into the record as a revised (red and green) plan at the hearing. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 210-24
Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
210.09(7) Limited Access Hearing Notice The limited access hearing notice must be published at least 15 calendar days before the hearing. This is a legal requirement, and the hearing must be rescheduled if the advertising deadline is not met. Publication and notice requirements are the same as those required in Section 210.05, except that the statutory abutter mailing must be mailed after notification to the appropriate legislators.
210.09(8) Notice of Appearance The HQ Hearing Coordinator transmits the notice of appearance form to the region. Anyone wanting to receive a copy of the findings and order and the adopted right of way and limited access plan must complete a notice of appearance form and return it to WSDOT either at the hearing or by mail.
210.09(9) Reproduction of Plans The HQ Hearing Coordinator submits the hearing plans for reproduction at least 24 days prior to the hearing. The reproduced plans are sent to the region at least 17 days before the hearing, for mailing to the abutters at least 15 days before the hearing.
210.09(10) Limited Access Hearing Exhibits The region retains the limited access hearing exhibits until preparation of the draft findings and order is complete. The region then submits all the original hearing exhibits and three copies to the HQ Access and Hearings Section as part of the findings and order package. Any exhibits submitted directly to Headquarters are sent to the region for inclusion with the region’s submittal.
210.09(11) Limited Access Hearing Transcript The court reporter furnishes the original limited access hearing transcript to the region. The region forwards the transcript to the hearing examiner, or presiding authority, for signature certifying that the transcript is complete. The signed original and three copies are returned to the region for inclusion in the findings and order package.
210.09(12) Findings and Order The findings and order is a document containing the findings and conclusions of a limited access hearing, based entirely on the evidence in the hearing record. The region reviews a copy of the transcript from the court reporter and prepares a findings and order package. The package is sent to the HQ Access and Hearings Section. The findings and order package contains:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The draft findings and order. Draft responses to comments (reserved exhibits). A draft findings and order Plan as modified from the hearing plan. All limited access hearing exhibits: originals and three copies. The limited access hearing transcript: original and three copies. The notice of appearance forms. Estimate of the number of copies of the final findings and order plan and text the region will need for the mailing.

Chapter 210
Community Engagement and Hearings
210.09(13) Adoption of Findings and Order The Assistant Secretary, Engineering & Regional Operations, adopts the findings and order based on the evidence introduced at the hearing and any supplemental exhibits. Following adoption of the findings and order, the HQ Plans Section makes the necessary revisions to the limited access hearing plan, which then becomes the findings and order plan. The HQ Access and Hearings Section arranges for reproduction of the findings and order plan and the findings and order text and transmits them to the region. The region mails a copy of the findings and order plan and the findings and order text to all parties that filed a notice of appearance and to all local governmental agencies involved. Subsequent to this mailing, the region prepares an affidavit of service by mailing and transmits it to the HQ Access and Hearings Section. At the time of mailing, but before publication of the résumé, the region notifies the appropriate legislators of WSDOT’s action.
210.09(14) Résumé The résumé is an official notification of action taken by WSDOT following adoption of a findings and order. The HQ Access and Hearings Section provides the résumé to the region. The region must publish the résumé once each week for two consecutive weeks, not to begin until at least ten days after the mailing of the findings and order.
210.09(15) Final Establishment of Access Control When the findings and order is adopted, the findings and order plan becomes a Phase 4 Plan (see Chapter 510). The establishment of access control becomes final 30 days from the date the findings and order is mailed by the region, as documented by the affidavit of service by mailing.
210.09(16) Appeal Process An appeal from the county or city must be in the form of a written disapproval, submitted to the Secretary of Transportation, requesting a hearing before a board of review. An appeal from abutting property owners must be filed in the Superior Court of the state of Washington, in the county where the limited access facility is to be located and shall affect only those specific ownerships. The plan is final for all other ownerships.
210.10 Combined Hearings A combined hearing often alleviates the need to schedule separate hearings to discuss similar information. A combined hearing is desirable when the timing for circulation of the draft environmental document is simultaneous with the timing for corridor and design hearings and when all alternative designs are available for each alternative corridor. When deciding whether to combine hearings, consider:
•
•
•
•
Whether there is controversy. Whether alternative corridors are proposed. The nature of the environmental concerns. The benefits to the public of a combined hearing.

Community Engagement and Hearings
210.11 Administrative Appeal Hearing Administrative appeal hearings apply only to managed access highways, are conducted as formal hearings, and are initiated by a property owner seeking to appeal a decision made to restrict or remove an access connection. This is also known as an adjudicative proceeding, and the procedure is presented in Chapter 540.
210.12 Follow-Up Hearing A new hearing or the opportunity for a hearing is required for any previously held hearing when any one of the following occurs (USC 23, §771.111):
•
•
•
•
Major actions (such as adoption of findings and order and approval of hearing summaries) did not occur within three years following the date the last hearing was held or the opportunity for a hearing was afforded. A substantial change occurs in the area affected by the proposal (due to unanticipated development, for example). A substantial change occurs in a proposal for which an opportunity for a hearing was previously advertised or a hearing was held. A significant social, economic, or environmental effect is identified that was not considered at earlier hearings.

225.01 General The term “environmental documentation” refers to the documents produced for a project to satisfy the requirements contained in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). The Environmental Manual and supporting web pages provide detailed instructions on how to determine what level of documentation is required and how to prepare the documents. This chapter provides a summary of the relevant provisions in the Environmental Manual. The purpose of the environmental document is to provide decision makers, agencies, and the public with information on a project’s environmental impacts, alternatives to the proposed action, and mitigation measures to reduce unavoidable impacts. Final environmental documents identify and evaluate the project to be constructed. Because projects vary in their level of environmental impacts, the rules on environmental documentation allow for different levels of documentation. As a project’s impacts increase, so does the level of documentation. The region Environmental Office and the NEPA/SEPA Compliance Section of the Headquarters Environmental Services Office routinely provide environmental documentation assistance to designers and project engineers.
225.02 Determining the Environmental Documentation The Environmental Review Summary (ERS) provides the first indication of what form the environmental documentation will take. The ERS is developed as part of the Project Summary, which is prepared during the scoping or pre-design phase of all projects in the construction program. The Project Summary (see Chapter 300 for additional information) includes three components:
•
•
•
Project Profile Basis of Design Environmental Review Summary
The ERS is part of the Project Summary database. The ERS describes the potential environmental impacts, proposed mitigation, and necessary permits for a project. It establishes the initial environmental classification and identifies the key environmental elements to be addressed in the NEPA/SEPA process. The ERS database includes fully integrated “Help” screens. Contact your region Program Management Office to get set up to work in the database. Completing an ERS to determine the level of environmental documentation may begin once the project has been identified and basic environmental impacts to both physical and human environment can be assessed using preliminary project details. The region completes the ERS based best available information at the scoping or pre-design phase of development. The region Environmental Manager then approves the ERS, which enables the completed form to be included in the Project Summary package.

Chapter 225
Environmental Coordination
For many projects, the WSDOT Geographic Information System (GIS) Workbench coupled with a potential site visit provides sufficient information to fill out the ERS (see the GIS Workbench online Help).
225.02(1) Environmental Justice (New Section 2023) Environmental Justice (EJ), as obligated in Presidential Executive Order 12898, seeks to eradicate, mitigate, and avoid disproportionately high and adverse effects to low income and minorities, and Indian tribes during the NEPA process. Projects subject to NEPA that may adversely impact low income and minority populations may be required to conduct an EJ analysis. At the state level, the Healthy Environment for All Act (HEAL Act) addresses disproportionate environmental and health impacts in all laws, rules, and policies by prioritizing vulnerable populations and overburdened communities, the equitable distribution of resources and benefits, and eliminating harm. The federal definition of EJ means the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, rules, and policies. The HEAL Act broadens the definition of environmental justice, focuses attention on environmental health impacts and requires WSDOT to conduct an environmental justice assessment for significant actions (i.e., a project with a budget equal to or greater than $15M). Conduct an EJ assessment1 for WSDOT projects when the combined budget for all phases (PE, RW, and CN) are equal to or greater than $15 Million and when starting planning, or pre-design on or after July 1, 2023, regardless of whether the project’s impacts are expected to have adverse environmental impacts on overburdened communities and vulnerable populations. Evaluate ongoing projects with a combined budget equal to or greater than $15 Million that initiate a NEPA Re-Evaluation to determine whether an EJ assessment is required (contact Region Environmental Office for more information). A major component of EJ compliance is community engagement with the public and all communities potentially affected by the project. All projects are encouraged to have meaningful and inclusive project-specific community engagement with all members of the community potentially affected to better provide access to our decisionmaking processes (see Chapter 210 for more information). For more information about EJ compliance and obligations associated with the HEAL Act, see WSDOT Environmental Manual: Chapter 460 or contact the region’s environmental office.

Note: An EJ assessment as required by the HEAL Act is different from an EJ analysis required for federally funded projects under NEPA. A project may be required to conduct both. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 225
Environmental Coordination
225.02(2) Other Environmental Documentation Requirements (NEW Section 2023) As part of a project’s environmental documentation, there are other documents that may be required to demonstrate compliance with applicable federal and state laws. These may include Section 106 of the National Historical Preservation Act, Endangered Species Act, etc. Contact the region Environmental Office and Environmental Manual for more information.
225.03 Identifying the Project Classification Based on the environmental considerations identified during preparation of the ERS, WSDOT projects are classified for NEPA/SEPA purposes to determine the type of environmental documentation required. Projects with a federal nexus (i.e., using federal funds, involving federal lands, or requiring federal approvals or permits) are subject to NEPA and SEPA. Projects that are state funded only, with no federal nexus, follow SEPA guidelines. Since many WSDOT projects are prepared with the intent of obtaining federal funding, NEPA guidelines are usually followed. (Environmental Manual Chapters 300 and 400 and the Federal Nexus Requirements table on the NEPA & SEPA webpage provide more information on federal nexus and NEPA class of.) For most WSDOT projects, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is the lead agency for NEPA. Depending on the action, other federal agencies that may serve as NEPA lead are the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, and Federal Transit Administration. WSDOT follows the NEPA and associated documentation process required by the federal lead agency. If a project has been determined to be an FHWA Categorical Exclusion (CE), the Environmental Classification Summary (ECS) is completed by the Environmental office. The NEPA environmental review process is considered complete when the region Environmental Manager approves the ECS package and provides it to the PE Office. If it is determined that an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required, the region evaluates the project schedule and arranges for preparation of the appropriate document. Environmental Manual Chapter 400 provides additional information on completing NEPA documentation. For SEPA, WSDOT’s procedures align NEPA and SEPA so that WSDOT’s NEPA documentation meets the requirements of SEPA. If a project does not trigger NEPA, then WSDOT will still need to comply with SEPA requirements. The SEPA process is complete when the appropriate categorical exemption is identified, or the appropriate public comment period has ended and SEPA decision has been adopted. Environmental Manual Chapter 400 provides additional information on completing SEPA documentation.
225.04 Environmental Commitment File As an initial part of project development, the region establishes a project commitment file. It is WSDOT policy that a project commitment file be established as soon as the preparation of environmental documentation begins. The file consists of proposed mitigation measures; commitments made to regulatory agencies, tribes, and other stakeholders; and other documented commitments made on the project. Further commitment types (right of way, maintenance, and so on) may be added at the region’s discretion. The Region/Mode/Megaprograms Environmental Office is responsible for creating and maintaining the commitment file as a project progresses through its development process. Whenever commitments are made, they are incorporated into project documents and added to the environmental commitment file once they are finalized.

WSDOT has a Commitment Tracking System (CTS) to organize and track commitments from the commitment file. Refer to the Environmental Manual (Chapter 490) for policies associated with tracking commitments.
225.05 Environmental Permits and Approvals WSDOT projects are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental permits and approvals. Performing field work in support of the project design may also require environmental permits or approvals. Understanding and anticipating what permits and approvals may be required for a particular project type will assist the designer in project delivery. Thehttps://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/designtopics/environment/environmental-permits-approvals Environmental Guidance webpage provides guidance on the applicability of permits and approvals by environmental discipline. Because the facts of each project vary and the environmental regulations are complex, reliance on either the Design Manual or the Environmental Manual is insufficient. Consult region/mode/megaprograms environmental staff. The Environmental Review Summary (ERS), which is prepared as part of the Project Summary, identifies some of the most common environmental permits that might be required based on the information known at that stage. As the project design develops, additional permits and approvals can be identified. Conducting project site visits for engineering and environmental features may reduce project delays caused by late discoveries. Coordinate with and communicate any project changes to region environmental staff. The permit process begins well in advance of the actual permit application. For some permits, WSDOT has already negotiated permit conditions through the use of programmatic and general permits. These permits typically apply to repetitive, relatively simple projects, and the permit conditions apply regardless of the actual facts of the project type. For complex projects, the negotiations with permit agencies often begin during the environmental documentation phase for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA). The mitigation measures developed for the NEPA/SEPA documents are captured as permit conditions on the subsequent permits.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 225-4
Chapter 225
Environmental Coordination
Environmental permits require information prepared during the design phase to demonstrate compliance with environmental rules, regulations, and policies. To avoid delays in project delivery, it is necessary for the designer to understand and anticipate this exchange of information. The timing of this exchange often affects design schedules, while the permit requirements can affect the design itself. In complex cases, the negotiations over permit conditions can result in iterative designs as issues are raised and resolved. Continuously consult region /mode/megaprograms environmental staff to help avoid delays in project delivery. The Project Engineer is encouraged to meet with and discuss expectations with support groups so that preliminary field investigations are conducted in compliance with environmental permits, agreements, laws, or regulations. At a minimum, the support groups should know how to access the environmental commitments for the project and determine which ones apply to their work. If a non-compliance event occurs, coordinate with support groups so that they know to initiate the Environmental Compliance Assurance Procedure (see Section 225.05(1) for details).
225.05(1) Environmental Compliance During Design Phase The purpose of the Environmental Compliance Assurance Procedure (ECAP) is to recognize and rectify environmental non-compliance events during all phases of the project development process including the Design phase. The ECAP provides prompt notification to WSDOT management and regulatory agencies. For purposes of ECAP, non-compliance events are defined as actions that violate environmental permits, agreements, laws, or regulations. Responsibilities for field work during design phase. 1. PE or designee: o Step A - Takes the necessary actions so that appropriate environmental documentation and permits are obtained for field work during the PE phase o Step B - Provides permits and communicates permit conditions to support groups performing field work (Geotechnical, Utilities, Environmental, etc.) 2. The Environmental Manager or designee will help generate or make accessible the appropriate environmental documentation and permits. 3. Support Group / Field Crew is responsible for permit compliance, including the following: o Confirming they have all the permits, and understanding of the permit conditions prior to beginning work o Evaluating field operations, including access to specific locations, and developing work plans so that permit conditions are met (Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control (TESC), etc.) o Recognizing and identifying non-compliance issues. o Notifying the PE and Environmental Manager when non-compliance issues/events happen. When non-compliance is suspected or known, it is the Project Engineer’s (PE) responsibility to initiate the Notification and Resolution Process below. The Regional Environmental Manager will serve as a resource to the PE and give priority to addressing the non-compliance event. The PE and Environmental Manager shall work together on an appropriate response to avoid or minimize environmental damage.

225.05(1)(a) Notification and Resolution Process When non-compliance occurs or is suspected, the following steps are taken: 1. The person/support group who discovers an event shall immediately notify the PE. 2. The PE or designee shall:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Step A – Inform the field crew to suspend all work that is causing non-compliance. Step B – Immediately contact the Environmental Manager or designee to help determine if it is or is not a non-compliance event. (Note: if event is compliant; stop the notification process and resume work activity). Step C - If non-compliant, collaborate with the Environmental Manager to determine the regulatory agencies with jurisdiction. Notify all regulatory agencies with jurisdiction. Step D – Consult with the Environmental Manager regarding response actions taken so far and any additional remediation actions that may be necessary. Step E– Notify the appropriate Assistant Region Administrator or Engineering Manager for Design and the Assistant State Design Engineer assigned to that Region or Project. Step F – Additional notifications (see F.1 and F.2 below) from the PE are necessary when the non-compliance event: o Results in a formal written/verbal enforcement action from a regulatory agency or o Presents significant risk to public health or o Presents significant risk to the environment or o Creates a public controversy. (The Region decides what “public controversy” means.) Step F.1 – Region Highway Projects: Notify the Region Administrator (give a courtesy notification to the Assistant State Design Engineer assigned to the project). Step F.2 – Mega Projects Highway Projects: Notify the Mega Project’s Program Administrator (give a courtesy notification to the Assistant State Design Engineer assigned to the project).
3. The Region Administrator, Assistant State Design Engineer, and/or Mega Projects Program Administrator shall notify the appropriate agency executives as warranted by the situation. 4. The Environmental Manager or designee shall:
•
•
•
Step A – Notify the Director of the Environmental Services Office (ESO) when the noncompliance event: o results in a formal written/verbal enforcement action from a regulatory agency; o presents significant risk to public health or o presents significant risk to the environment or o creates a public controversy. (The Region decides what “public controversy” means) Step B - Assist the PE in determining and recognizing the underlying root cause(s) that resulted in the non-compliant event and determining how to prevent a reoccurrence of the event. Step C - In consultation with the PE, identify and obtain new or modified permits, approvals, or agreements as needed to rectify the non-compliance event.
5. The Director of the ESO shall notify the ESO Compliance Solutions Branch Manager.

This chapter presents critical information for design teams, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
WSDOT’s Project Development process. Design documentation tools, procedures, and records retention policy. Major Project approvals including Design Approval, Project Development Approval, Basis of Design, Design Analysis, and other specific project documents for design-bid-build and for design-build delivery methods. FHWA oversight and approvals. Information about conducting project process reviews. Additional references and resources.
For local agency and developer projects on state highways, design documentation is also needed. It is retained by the region office responsible for the project oversight, in accordance with the WSDOT records retention policy. All participants in the design process are to provide the appropriate documentation for their decisions. See Section 300.04(3) for information about the approval process and authority. For more information about these types of projects, see Chapter 1130 and the Local Agency Guidelines.
300.02 WSDOT Project Delivery A project is developed in accordance with all applicable procedures, Executive Orders, Directives, Instructional Letters, Supplements, manuals, and the FHWA/WSDOT Stewardship and Oversight Agreement. A project can be influenced by separate plans or studies such as the Washington State Highway System Plan, corridor sketches, planning studies, Field Assessments, and scoping phase documentation.
300.02(1) Project Delivery Method The project delivery method pertains to WSDOT projects and may vary depending on project type and cost. Preservation projects with an overall project cost of $10 million and over, and all other projects with an overall project cost of $2 million and over, are required to go through the Project Delivery Method Selection process. The overall project cost is the total of the Preliminary Engineering, Right of Way, and Construction costs. Project Delivery Method Selection, described below, applies only to WSDOT projects and is not meant to be applied to local agency or developer projects that occur within WSDOT’s jurisdiction. Project Delivery Method Selection also does not apply to projects that WSDOT is asked to design and/or construct on behalf of another funding entity. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 300-1
Chapter 300
Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
WSDOT primarily uses two delivery methods: Design-bid-build (DBB) and design-build (DB). DBB is considered the traditional project delivery method where a project office puts together a complete set of plans, specifications, and estimate (PS&E) that is advertised for contractors to bid on. The project is constructed by a contractor in accordance with the PS&E and WSDOT provides construction oversight. For DB projects, the WSDOT develops a request for proposal (RFP) that includes a basic configuration for the project and a Conceptual Design Approval. The RFP is published, and a contractor is selected. The contractor is responsible for the design, project construction, and final Design Documentation Package. Design-build’s typical application is for improvement projects in the mobility, economic initiatives, or environmental subprograms where there are opportunities for innovation, greater efficiencies, or significant savings in project delivery time. For all projects, the delivery method is determined using WSDOT Project Delivery Method Selection Guidance (PDMSG) with the following exceptions:
•
•
Projects under $2 million are programmatically exempt from PDMSG, do not require a Project Delivery Method Selection Checklist, and will be DBB. Preservation Paving projects under $10 million are programmatically exempt from PDMSG, do not require a Project Delivery Method Selection Checklist, and will be DBB.
300.02(2) Environmental Requirements WSDOT uses the Environmental Review Summary (ERS) portion of the Project Summary to scope environmental impacts associated with the proposed project and document the anticipated environmental class of action (Environmental Impact Statement/Environmental Assessment/Categorical Exclusion). Projects that have only state funds must have State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) documentation. Projects involving a federal action in any phase of the project require National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation. On National Highway System (NHS) routes, a Design Analysis involving one of the controlling criteria (see Section 300.05(2)) is a federal action. Upon receipt of the ERS approval for projects requiring an Environmental Assessment or Environmental Impact Statement under NEPA, the region proceeds with environmental documentation, including Community Engagement, appropriate for the magnitude and type of the project. The environmental approval levels are shown in Exhibit 301-3. Refer to your Region Environmental Office and Chapter 225 for more information.
300.02(3) Real Estate Acquisition Design Approval and approval of right of way plans are required prior to acquiring property. A temporary construction easement may be acquired prior to Design Approval for State funded projects and with completion of NEPA for Federally funded projects. For early acquisition of right of way, consult the Real Estate Services Office, the April 2, 2013 memorandum on early acquisition policy, and Right of Way Manual Chapter 6-3.
300.02(4) Low-Cost Enhancements (Moved from General and Rewritten 2023) For operational changes identified by the Traffic Office as part of the Low-Cost Enhancement or Field Assessment Program that are included in a project, the project documentation will be provided by the Region Traffic Office in the form of a QBOD (Q program Basis of Design) with the Region Traffic Engineer as the approval authority. The QBOD is included in the project documentation along with the project’s BOD and retained in accordance with the WSDOT records retention policy. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 300-2
Chapter 300
Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
Design elements requested by the Low-Cost Enhancement or Field Assessment programs that are outside of the range of values provided in the Design Manual will require a Design Analysis. The Region Traffic Office will prepare the Design Analysis and obtain approvals in accordance with Exhibit 300-2.
300.02(5) Emergency Projects (Moved from General and Added to 2023) For emergency projects, also refer to the Emergency Funding Manual. It provides the legal and procedural guidelines for WSDOT employees to prepare all necessary documentation to respond to, and recover from, emergencies and disasters that affect the operations of the department. Emergency projects are required to acquire Project Development Approval in accordance with this chapter. Since the scope of an emergency project can vary greatly, contact your ASDE to determine the scale of this effort.
300.03 Design Documentation 300.03(1) Purpose Design documentation records the evaluations and decisions by the various disciplines that result in design recommendations. Design assumptions and decisions made prior to and during the scoping phase are included. Changes that occur throughout project development are documented. Required justifications and approvals are also included. All original technical documents must bear the certification of the responsible licensee as listed in Executive Order E 1010
300.03(2) Design Decisions Throughout the Design Manual, the terms consider, document, justify, and Design Analysis are used. These terms indicate a scaled level of documenting a design decision. The lowest level of documentation is consider. “Consider” means to think carefully about a decision and the level of documentation is at the discretion of the engineer. “Document” means to place a short note in the Design Documentation Package (see Section 300.03(3)) that explains the decision. The actual form of this note is at the discretion of the engineer. “Justify” means to prepare a design decision memo to the DDP that identifies the reason for the decision with a comparison of the advantages and disadvantages. The format used to justify a decision is the same as a Design Analysis except it is only approved by the engineer of record. The highest level of documenting a decision is the Design Analysis. When a Design Analysis is required, how it is documented, and who approves it, is explained in the next section.
300.03(2)(a) Design Analysis A Design Analysis is a process and tool used to document important design decisions, summarizing information needed for an approving authority to understand and support the decision. Design Analyses must include a comparison of safety and operations performance. The approving authority is shown in Exhibit 300-2 or Exhibit 300-4. A Design Analysis is required where a dimension chosen for a design element that will be changed by the project is outside the range of values provided for that element in the Design Manual. A Design Analysis is also required where the need for one is specifically referenced in the Design Manual. A region approved Design Analysis is required if a dimension or design element meets current AASHTO guidance adopted by FHWA, but is outside the corresponding Design Manual criteria. Email a PDF copy of all region approved Design Analyses to the ASDE supporting your region. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
In the case of a shoulder width reduction at an existing bridge pier, bridge abutment, sign structure, or luminaire base in a run of median barrier, the Design Parameter Sheet may be used instead of a Design Analysis to document the dimensioning decision for the shoulder at that location. On National Highway System (NHS) routes, a Design Analysis involving one of the controlling criteria (see Section 305.05(3)) is a federal action. Projects involving a federal action in any phase of the project require additional documentation, such as NEPA, Section 4(f) of the USDOT Act, ESA, etc., for which a programmatic agreement may or may not be provided. Contact region Environmental staff for more information. A template is available for the development of the Design Analysis document here: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/design-tools-and-support#Tools.
300.03(3) Design Documentation Package and Project File The Design Documentation Package and Project File include documentation of project work. They are effectively two separate documentation products that have two separate retention processes.
The Design Documentation Package (DDP) consists of the Design Approval, Project Development Approval, and supporting documents that preserves the decision documents generated during the design process. The DDP documents and explains design decisions, design criteria, and the design process that was followed. The contents of the DDP are listed in the DDP checklist in seven sections as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Introductory Documents Project Summary Documents Core Documents Environmental Documents Supporting Documents Other Approvals and Justifications Other Items
Sections one through five of the checklist remain the same for all projects. Items in section 6 and 7 may vary depending on the project at the discretion of the engineer of record. Reference the instructions for the DDP checklist of further information. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 300-4
Chapter 300
Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
Any time after completion of the design efforts, the design team submits the DDP to the person in the region responsible for records retention (e.g., Region Plans Engineer). These people work with the WSDOT Records Department to place the DDP into the State Records Center. The DDP is retained in a State Records Center for a period of 75 years and then transferred to State Archives for permanent storage. The Project File (PF) contains the documentation that is important to the project design, but not included in the DDP. This includes items for planning, scoping, programming, design, contract assembly, utility relocation, needed right of way, advertisement, award, constructability, traffic management, and maintenance review comments for a project. A Project File is completed for all projects and is retained by the region office responsible for the project. Responsibility for the project may pass from one office to another during the life of a project, and the Project File follows the project as it moves from office to office. See the Project File checklist for documents that are contained in the Project File. The Project File checklist should be included at the beginning of the Project File as a table of contents. If an item on the checklist is not applicable to the project, you may simply state such in the comment column. The Project File may be purged 3 years after the Construction Office has issued the Final Contract Voucher Certification.
300.04 Project Approvals This section describes WSDOT’s project design milestones for design-bid-build (DBB) and design-build (DB) projects. Work with the ASDE for project approvals that will be required for other delivery methods. Exhibit 300-1 shows all the deliverables that are required for DB and DBB projects. Use information in this section, Exhibit 300-1, and the DDP checklist to understand what is necessary for each project approval and how they are assembled. Information pertaining to FHWA approvals and oversight is provided in Section 300.05. Documents for projects requiring FHWA review or approval are submitted through the ASDE.
300.04(1) Design-Bid-Build Projects The region develops and maintains documentation for DBB projects using this chapter and the checklist for the Project File and Design Documentation Package (see Section 300.03(3)). For an idea of when design documentation should be completed in the design process, consult the Deliverables Expectation Matrix in Section 305.03(2). For the purpose of documentation, DBB projects have two approval milestones: Design Approval and Project Development Approval (PDA). Design Approval can be achieved when a basic configuration of the project is known, which is around 30% design. Project Development Approval is achieved near the end of the design process prior to advertising the project for construction. Design Approval locks the version of the Design Manual that will be utilized for up to three years of the design process. When PDA is acquired, the design must conform to the version of the Design Manual as stated in the Design Approval. In essence, having a Design Approval allows the design team to continue through the remainder of the design process without having to reanalyze their project for updates to the Design Manual. The contents of the Design Approval and PDA are discussed in detail in Sections 300.04(1)(a) and 300.04(1)(b). Projects that have a short duration may combine the Design Approval and PDA into one document. This is called a Combined Design Approval/PDA and is discussed further in Section 300.04(1)(c).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 300
Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
DBB projects that are designed by one project office and then turned over to another office for construction must transfer the Project File (along with a copy of the DDP) to the construction office for their use. Exhibit 300-5 is an example checklist of recommended items to be turned over to the construction office at the time of project transition. If the construction office changes an item documented in the DDP, it is responsible for documenting the change in a supplement to the DDP.
300.04(1)(a) Design Approval Design Approval may occur prior to NEPA/SEPA approval and is required prior to acquiring property. Approval levels for design and PS&E documents are presented in Exhibit 300-2 through Exhibit 300-5. The Design Approval contains the introductory documents, project summary documents, and core documents as shown in Exhibit 300-1 and detailed in the DDP Checklist. Include other items from the DDP Checklist that are complete prior to Design Approval. Once complete, the Design Approval becomes part of the DDP. The portion of the DDP Checklist applicable to Design Approval is used as the table of contents. Design Approval is entered into the DDP and remains valid for three years or as approved by the ASDE. An extension must be documented and filed in the DDP.
300.04(1)(b) Project Development Approval When all project development documents are completed and approved, Project Development Approval (PDA) is granted by the approval authority designated in Exhibit 300-2. The PDA becomes part of the DDP. Refer to this chapter and the DDP checklist for design documents necessary for PDA. Exhibit 300-2 through Exhibit 300-4 provide approval levels for project design and PS&E documents. The PDA contains the same introductory documents and project summary documents as the Design Approval (see Exhibit 300-1). Any of the documents that are unchanged from the Design Approval may simply be referenced in the PDA. If they have changed, update the document and insert it in the PDA. If the plans for approval are conceptual in the Design Approval, they must be finalized for the PDA. The NEPA/SEPA process must be complete for PDA. Project Development Approval remains valid for three years.
300.04(1)(c) Combined Design Approval / Project Development Approval All projects require Design Approval and PDA, however many projects have a short timeline for design and the design offices do not find it beneficial to create two separate documents. If this is the case, both approvals may be combined into one approval. To do this, complete all the products as listed in Exhibit 300-1 and title the approval “Combined Design Approval / Project Development Approval”. Even though the products listed in Exhibit 300-1 are not required until design is complete, most of these products should be completed early as they set direction for the project. For an idea of when products should be delivered in the design process, consult the Deliverables Expectation Matrix in Section 305.03(2). A Combined Design Approval / Project Development Approval remains valid for three years.

Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
300.04(2) Design-Build Projects For design-build (DB) projects, WSDOT provides a preliminary design referred to as the conceptual design and the design-builder becomes the engineer of record responsible for completing the final design. For this reason, WSDOT obtains Conceptual Design Approval (CDA) for DB projects and the engineer applies a PE stamp without signature per WAC 196-23-020(2). See the WSDOT Design-Build Manual for additional information regarding the level of completeness required for the conceptual design and development of the request for proposal (RFP). Once a contract is executed, the design-builder is responsible for maintaining and completing all design documentation, including the PDA, DDP supporting documents, and Project File. Refer to the design-build DDP checklist for design documents necessary for CDA, PDA, and DDP supporting documents.
300.04(2)(a) Conceptual Design Approval Conceptual Design Approval (CDA) is entered into the DDP and locks the version of the Design Manual that will be utilized for three years or as approved by the ASDE (an extension to the CDA must be filed in the DDP). Check with the ASDE for any required Design Manual policy updates that need to be included in the RFP. Once the RFP is issued, the version of the Design Manual and any required Design Manual policy updates are locked throughout the duration of the contract. Assemble the CDA similar to the DBB Design Approval (see Section 300.04(1)(a) and Exhibit 300-1) with the most significant difference being that CDA is required prior to publishing the request for qualifications (RFQ), which is considered advertisement for design-build projects. With ASDE concurrence, an RFQ may be published without a CDA. Environmental documentation must be complete prior to publishing the RFP, except for rare cases (see Design Build Manual 1-2.4 Federal Regulations and the NEPA Process and 2-7.9.1 Environmental Considerations). In these cases, the approving authority (Exhibit 300-2) must provide their approval and the environmental documentation must be complete prior to executing the DB contract.
300.04(2)(b) Project Development Approval For DB projects, the design-builder undertakes full responsibility for delivery of the project, including developing the final design. The CDA package is transferred to the design-builder upon contract execution, and the designbuilder updates the files to reflect their design. The updated documents, and all other items shown in Exhibit 300-1, make up the PDA package. Refer to the project RFP for final and intermediate deliverables, the approval process, and final records for the project. PDA and the applicable DDP Supporting Documents are required prior to project completion. It is a prudent practice to start the compilation of design documentation early in a project and to acquire PDA before the completion of the project. At the start of a project, it is critical that WSDOT project administration staff recognize the importance of all required documentation and how it will be used in the DB project delivery process.
300.04(3) Local Agency and Development Services Approvals Other entities (e.g. local agencies, tribes, or developers) proposing projects within WSDOT jurisdiction are required to follow WSDOT design documentation policy as noted in this chapter. Documentation is submitted to WSDOT for review and approval according to Exhibit 300-4. Where FHWA approval is indicated, the ASDE will forward project documentation to FHWA for approval and transmit FHWA’s approval, comments, and/or questions back to the submitter.

Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
A Summary of Design (SOD) may replace the Basis of Design (BOD) in Exhibit 300-1 if agreed to by the region signing authority and the ASDE. All other documentation required by this chapter must be provided, however a non-WSDOT funded project may not have a Project Profile or an Environmental Review Summary. In cases where design decisions are imposed by WSDOT or FHWA as mitigation, the decision will be documented by WSDOT and included in the design documentation package. The requirement to submit a BOD/SOD for approval may be waived by the approving authority designated in Exhibit 300-4, based on the criterion in Section 1100.05(1)(a). When a region is the approval authority for the BOD/SOD and is considering an exemption, the region approving authority can assume the role of the ASDE to determine if an exemption is appropriate. For information on jurisdiction, consult Section 1230.04.
300.05 FHWA Oversight and Approvals The  Stewardship & Oversight (S&O) Agreement between WSDOT and FHWA Washington Division created new procedures and terminology associated with FHWA oversight and approvals. One such term, and new relevant procedure, is “Projects of Division Interest” (PoDI) described below. For all projects on the National Highway System (NHS), the level of FHWA oversight and approvals can vary for numerous reasons such as type of project, the agency doing the work, PoDI/non-PoDI designation, and funding sources. Oversight and funding do not affect the level of design documentation required for a project, but it may instigate FHWA approval as detailed in the following sections. Documents requiring FHWA review and approval are submitted through the HQ Design Office.
300.05(1) FHWA Projects of Division Interest Projects of Division Interest (PoDI) are projects for which FHWA determines the need to exercise oversight and approval authority. These projects have an elevated risk, contain elements of higher risk, or present a meaningful opportunity for FHWA involvement to enhance meeting program or project objectives. Collaborative identification of these projects allows FHWA Washington Division to concentrate resources on project stages or areas of interest. It also allows WSDOT to identify which projects are PoDIs and plan for the expected level of engagement with FHWA. The Stewardship & Oversight Agreement generally defines Projects of Division Interest as:
•
•
•
•
Major Projects (A federal aid project with total cost >$500M) Federal Discretionary Grant Projects NHS Projects that may require FHWA Project or Program Approvals Projects Selected by FHWA based on Risk or Opportunity
The S&O Agreement also states: Regardless of retained project approval actions, any Federal-aid Highway Project either on or off the NHS that the Division identifies as having an elevated level of risk can be selected for risk-based stewardship and oversight and would then be identified as a PoDI. For each project designated as a PoDI, FHWA and WSDOT prepare a Project-Specific PoDI Stewardship & Oversight Agreement that identifies project approvals and related responsibilities specific to the project.

300.05(2) FHWA-Approved Design Analysis FHWA approves Design Analysis on all Interstate projects (mainline and ramps) associated with the following ten controlling criteria:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Design Speed Lane Width Shoulder Width Horizontal Curve Radius Superelevation Rate Stopping Sight Distance: horizontal alignments and vertical alignments except for sag vertical curves Maximum Grade Cross Slope Vertical Clearance Design Loading Structural Capacity
Interstate Design Analysis not associated with the above ten controlling criteria have been delegated to HQ Design. Approval of Design Analyses on non-Interstate NHS routes has been delegated to HQ Design. However, a Design Analysis on a NHS route is a federal action and NEPA documentation is required in the following cases:
•
•
NHS route with a speed greater than or equal to 50 mph: Any Design Analysis associated with the above ten controlling criteria. NHS routes with a speed less than 50 mph: Only Design Analysis associated with the following two controlling criteria: o Design Loading Structural Capacity o Design Speed
No FHWA involvement is required for non-NHS routes.
300.06 Changes to Approved Documents There are four ways to revise an already approved design document: errata, supplement, amend, or supersede. The person revising the document must work with the approving authorities to determine which of the approaches will be taken. These four approaches apply to all design documents requiring approval signatures and are detailed in the following subsections.
300.06(1) Errata Errata are corrections to errors in the original document (e.g., misspelled word or mistyped numbers). The intent and conclusion of the original document is unchanged. The highest Region and HQ approval authority must agree that the clerical errors do not change the intent of the originals. Errata are listed on a separate document by page and line reference and included in the DDP or PF in the same section as the original document. Errata are not circulated for approval signatures.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 300-9
Chapter 300
Design Documentation, Approval, and Process Review
300.06(2) Supplement Supplements provide new or additional information while leaving the original document intact. These are noted as supplements on the title page and an introductory paragraph/section is included in the supplement that clearly indicates the parent document and why it is being supplemented. The supplement is filed in the DDP or PF in the same section as the original document. Supplements are circulated for approval similar to the original document.
300.06(3) Amend Amended documents are where an original is modified beyond the level of an errata. For amendments, the original document is modified by marking up the original document. An amendment should be limited to a section or specific pages of the original document. If the amendment is large and covers a significant amount of the document, consider superseding the original (see below). The amendment must include a cover document that explains the reasons for the modifications and how they impact the conclusion of the original document. Amendments must have a signature page and obtain approvals according to Exhibit 300-2 thru Exhibit 300-4. Amendments are a separate document from the original and the original and the amendment are filed in the DDP or PF in the same section.
300.06(4) Supersede Superseded documents replace the original document in its entirety. A watermark is applied to the original document indicating that it has been superseded. Treat the superseding document as a completely new document. The superseding document must have a section stating what document it supersedes, clearly indicating the title and approval date of the original document. Superseding documents must have a signature page and obtain approvals according to Exhibit 300-2 thru Exhibit 300-4. Both the superseded and superseding documents are retained in the DDP or PF in the same section.
300.07 Process Review The ASDEs conduct process reviews. The process review is done to provide reasonable assurance that projects are prepared in compliance with established policies and procedures and adequate records exist to show compliance. Projects are normally selected for a review after contract award, which allows the design team appropriate time to assemble the final project documentation. The process review will focus on the Design Documentation Package and the Project File, but may include other documents as requested. A process review usually involves the region’s project development leadership, project engineer, and the design team leader. The ASDE may invite others to participate such as FHWA, Traffic, Hydraulics, Public Transit, or Active Transportation. At the conclusion of a process review, findings may be issued that ask for corrections or additions to the DDP. The original DDP will remain intact and additions or corrections will be added via memorandum and/or supplements and filed with the original DDP.

301.01 Introduction Maintenance plays an important role in the Washington State Department of Transportation’s (WSDOT’s) asset management program by meeting the daily requirements of maintaining and operating over 18,000 lane miles, approximately 2,000 miles of ramps and special-use lanes, and over 3,700 bridge and culvert structures, as well as hundreds of other special-use sites vital to the state’s transportation system. Activities in the highway maintenance program protect the public infrastructure as well as provide services necessary for daily operation of the highway system. Typical maintenance activities include patching potholes, cleaning ditches, painting stripes on the roadway, repairing damage to guardrail, and controlling noxious weeds. In addition to maintaining assets, operational services are also provided. They include plowing snow, cleaning rest areas, responding to incidents, operating structures like draw bridges, and operating traffic signals, lighting, and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). This limited list of maintenance and operational activities highlights the significant undertaking of maintaining and operating the State Highway System as designed. Highway maintenance and operations staff are unique stakeholders, because they utilize, maintain, and operate the facilities’ engineering designs and constructs. Given the nature and cost of maintenance work, as well as the exposure inherent in maintenance and operational activities, it is important for designers to consider maintenance and operations staff as major stakeholders in every project. It is also important for maintenance and operations staff to understand the purpose of the project and to participate in determining the best method(s) to keep it functioning as designed while maintaining their responsibilities outside of the specific project limits. This chapter provides multiple options to help improve coordination with maintenance and operations staff during project design. These “best practices” are a culmination of responses from Design Manual user surveys, interviews with maintenance and operations superintendents, and various regional practices that have demonstrated potential improvement related to the coordination of design and maintenance efforts and personnel. Note: The concepts and methods presented herein do not replace any approved communication or documentation processes that may be currently required by a WSDOT region during the project development process.
301.02 Communication Communication is the most fundamental component of coordination. Executing communication is often oversimplified by the phrase “communicate early and often.” In reality, effective communication is significantly more complex. For example: Who are you communicating with, what methods of communication are being used, what is being communicated, how are you responding to communication, where is the communication taking place, and when does the communication need to occur to maximize effectiveness? The following sections highlight areas that may increase the necessary communication between design and maintenance staff.

Design and Maintenance Coordination
301.02(1) Maintenance Organizational Roles The most important component of communication is knowing who you are communicating with and what their role is within the organization. Just as engineering has multiple disciplines that cover specific areas within engineering, WSDOT’s maintenance organization is also divided into multiple discipline areas, each with focused expertise and specific needs that may be relevant to a particular project.
Access to maintain luminaire is provided through use of full shoulder
When asking for maintenance input, it is not sufficient to contact just the Area Maintenance Office that covers that physical geographic area. Depending on the scope of the project, engineering must consult with the appropriate maintenance discipline area. It is a project management responsibility to properly identify and communicate with the appropriate project stakeholders (see EO 1032 – Project Management). It should not be assumed that the Area Maintenance Office will coordinate with all other maintenance disciplines, unless agreed to organizationally or identified within a particular Project Management Plan (PMP). The PMP is the documentation mechanism for identifying the various contacts and their roles within the project. Each region maintenance organization is different, but in general, the following discipline areas are present:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

301.02(2) Communicating Expectations Project design is heavily influenced by the subprogram and scope of a particular project. While this becomes a learned experience within engineering design, maintenance staff does not routinely work within these types of funding and project constraints. It is important to identify the type of project and elements that can be addressed under the particular subprogram, in order to effectively manage expectations for maintenance stakeholders participating in the project. It is also important to redirect issues presented by maintenance staff that may not be appropriate for your project but may meet a future need. The project team should work together with maintenance to redirect identified issues to region Program Management to evaluate their relevance for other subprograms or future identified projects or determine if there are funding mechanisms to include the requested feature(s) on the project in question.
301.02(3) Communication Timing There are multiple constraints to consider when establishing the timing of maintenance stakeholder input. What is the project timeline, when will maintenance involvement be most effective, and which work season(s) are maintenance and operations staff involved with when you need to communicate with them? Each one of these questions needs to be understood to yield the most effective communication result.

This procession of snow plows clearing the roadway demonstrates the urgency of labor and equipment necessary to maintain operations on the highway during certain seasons
Maintenance staff has identified scoping through the 30% design phase as a critical period for their input. The scoping phase presents opportunities to identify maintenance concerns and adequately address them within the project scope and budget. The period between scoping and 30% design presents opportunities to evaluate and refine options, as well as gain more understanding of project constraints that may impact a previously identified or requested maintenance feature. As the constraints and design trade-offs become evident, it is necessary to review the impacts to maintenance needs and requests that were originally captured in the project scope and ensure they are not impacted by constraints or the options under evaluation. Maintenance staff are obligated to respond to immediate incidents and weather conditions. They are not often able to delay their work functions and activities to make time for a design project review. It is essential that designers understand this issue and plan for reviews through scheduling techniques (see Section 301.03(1)(a)). In general, the best time to involve maintenance staff is during their slower work seasons.

301.02(4) Communication Methods Maintenance has identified field reviews as the primary and most effective method of communication for their staff. Designers are strongly encouraged to perform multiple field reviews with the appropriate maintenance disciplines. Depending on the size, scope, and location of the project, it may be appropriate to first meet in the office and review the project scope and plans, confirm and endorse the Pre-Activity Safety Plan, then proceed with the field review. Field reviews are recommended at the following periods:
•
•
•
•
Scoping phase Prior to the 30% design milestone (may need multiple meetings to evaluate design options) Each time a previously agreed-to maintenance feature is impacted through design iterations, as appropriate Prior to other major design review milestones
Maintenance clearing highway from rockfall overburdening catchment area
A primary purpose for performing field reviews with maintenance is to assist with visualizing the project and to understand existing conditions. When performing the field review, it is important to emphasize the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Reiterate the purpose of the project and subprogram, and discuss maintenance expectations. Determine the deficiency being corrected and the understood contributing factors. It is important to gain an understanding from maintenance staff on any other contributing factors or physical conditions that engineers may not be aware of. Visualize the project with maintenance: What will be new? What will be removed? What will be replaced, and what is the replacement? Where will new features be located? How will project changes affect neighbors? Determine whether the project can be operated and maintained with existing equipment.

Design and Maintenance Coordination
It is necessary for design and maintenance staff to fully understand the impacts to both the maintenance and project budgets to analyze and balance the obligations for the investments as assets are identified on a project. For example, new lighting means maintenance will be billed for the utility costs. Generally, this increased cost has not resulted in increased funding. Will proprietary item requests be needed so maintenance can maintain the project items with the tools and equipment they currently have? Will new equipment be needed, and who will fund that equipment acquisition? What is the maintenance frequency for affected assets? Will this change? What are the environmental and permit restrictions related to the asset or feature? How might maintenance physically maintain features to understand safety and access needs for the asset or feature? Identify explicit action items for design and maintenance staff to follow up on as design iterations continue. Document the outcomes of the field meeting, and follow up to ensure maintenance needs are addressed, or provide specific explanations.
In order for maintenance to assist in brainstorming alternative options, engineering design must explain the reasons and constraints behind the previous design options considered and abandoned through the design iteration process.
•
•
•
Provide maintenance stakeholders the reasons and justification behind design decisions. Allow for the time and discussions necessary to brainstorm other options to provide the desired accommodations and features, given the constraints and conflicting performance outcomes identified. Before removing any previously discussed maintenance features, always discuss and work on the issue with maintenance staff first.

While independent reviews of plan sheets are meaningful for engineers, it may be an inappropriate expectation that maintenance staff will see the same value. The repeated familiarity of reviewing plan sheets is not necessarily present within the maintenance staff, and plan review training may or may not be feasible for a given regional maintenance organization based on staffing, workloads, and skill retention. In some larger regional maintenance organizations, a liaison position has been designated for designers to coordinate plan reviews. This approach has seen some success. However, this liaison cannot possibly be aware of all comments/concerns for every maintenance discipline. Don’t assume that coordinating plan reviews through the liaison meets the expectation for maintenance stakeholder input. Always check with the various maintenance disciplines for their preferred contacts and include those contacts within the PMP.
301.03 Incorporating Maintenance Considerations in Design The intent of this section is to provide some project management options and potential strategies or products to help manage the incorporation of maintenance considerations into a design project.
301.03(1) Project Management and Review Strategies Design iterations are necessary as information is gained throughout the design process. Designers are constantly forced to balance competing stakeholder needs, regulatory requirements, design criteria, performance outcomes, and physical and political constraints. The following subsections include some recommended strategies for designers throughout the course of a design project.
301.03(1)(a) Project Management and Schedules Include maintenance discipline representatives within the PMP, and identify their specific roles and responsibilities within the design project. This is important for team members, to ensure their inclusion on interdisciplinary decision making and brainstorming options for specific features that may affect only a single or all maintenance disciplines. Schedule the appropriate duration and timing within the project schedule to complete the necessary field reviews with maintenance staff. There are multiple scheduling techniques that may assist you, ensuring this will be well planned based on maintenance staff availability and changing work priorities. Contingency activities, providing more activities detailing the effort, or expanding the duration for single activities may all be appropriate. If uncertain how to best represent the needed time within the schedule, consult the Region Project Management and Reporting System (PMRS) Coordinator for options. As the project works toward constructability reviews, be sure to include appropriate durations for procuring materials. There have been reported instances where maintenance and operations staff has been contacted to temporarily provide equipment while awaiting procurement and acceptance. This creates additional work efforts for maintenance staff to install and remove their equipment to keep a project operational, because inadequate procurement timelines were identified during the design phase. Note: Some regions have an internal policy that prohibits use of maintenance equipment on a temporary basis due to poor execution and management of procurement timelines. Designers should verify what options exist if procurement timelines appear problematic in construction staging exercises.

Design and Maintenance Coordination
Whenever possible, design should avoid creating environments that might be desirable to the homeless, both for their safety and the safety of maintenance staff.
301.03(1)(b) Project Reviews The skill sets of individuals throughout the department vary with experience and training. Strictly utilizing independent plan reviews to gain maintenance stakeholder input may be inappropriate. While field reviews are an optimal means of communicating and visualizing the project with maintenance, it is not prudent to meet in the field for every change or design iteration of a specific feature. However, design engineers frequently engage multiple stakeholders on a project, and those stakeholders are generally provided visual aids and descriptions in addition to a set of plans.
The same effort can be applied to the maintenance stakeholders. Use pictures of completed products, or generate 3D PDFs and/or working drawings, to better illustrate and visualize the features under discussion. Take the time to understand what matters regarding a particular feature and how it will be maintained, and ensure the illustrations provided depict the worst case for their concerns, not the average. For example, if the steepness of side slopes matters regarding how the feature will be accessed or maintained, be sure to depict how the slope will vary, including the steepest portion, not the typical slope.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 301-8
Chapter 301
Design and Maintenance Coordination
Every effort should be made to ensure stakeholders understand the balancing act design is working through and how it affects the various maintenance features or assets. Maintenance staff should never be in a position to review project details from a plan sheet without a meeting/discussion, examples, or other means of communicating what feature or issues they are reviewing on the plan sheet. This effort will help ensure there are “no surprises” for maintenance and operations staff when the planned project enters construction.
301.03(2) Maintenance Design Considerations –Tips, Tools, and End Products There are multiple potential products that design teams should consider to effectively document maintenance considerations. Note that some options presented in the following subsections may be more effective if implemented on a regionwide basis; however, all options can be described as project procedures and should be identified and explained within the PMP.
301.03(2)(a) Establish Maintenance Performance Measures For a given corridor or project location, it may be advantageous to identify desired performance measures and their established goal(s). Providing a performance-based outcome provides something tangible for designers to evaluate when exploring options. These performance objectives should be specific and state the actual needed outcome, not necessarily a proposed solution (see annotated example in Exhibit 301-1).

301.03(2)(b) Evaluate Maintenance Lifecycle Cost Designers should work with maintenance to understand the full life cycle cost for maintaining a certain feature. Maintenance will need to provide and explain to design:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The frequency of maintaining the asset Labor costs Material costs Traffic control costs Utility costs Additional equipment costs (cost to repair if equipment owned, rental costs, or purchase cost of new equipment needed) Cost of procuring replacement parts for the asset
Additionally, maintenance and operations staff should identify some qualitative risks and opportunities associated with certain assets. Some opportunities, like the one presented in Exhibit 301-2, may not be possible depending on material availability or funding restrictions. It is important for designers to understand that some products may have a short shelf-life. Procuring new replacement parts in the future may not be possible, which may result in a search for used parts or the total replacement of the particular asset. These are future risks that need to be identified so design engineers will understand what options or special provisions may be required to help address the potential risks. Maintenance staff can help design understand the history of different assets and determine options that have been successful for a given maintenance location. Design engineers also need to communicate the requirements and disadvantages of proprietary items specifically requested by maintenance. While it may be the desired product that maintenance is familiar with, it may not be the best product for what is being designed.
It is necessary to both determine the life span for a particular asset and utilize discounted cash flow techniques to understand the present worth of the future expenditures. The discounting process can be complex; however, for the purposes of evaluating maintenance life cycle cost, it is acceptable to use a flat discount rate applied to the sum of all future maintenance expenditures. In Exhibit 301-2, the asset life span is 20 years, and the discount rate is approximately 80% (based on a 4% interest rate per year). If the asset life span is different, then the discount rate will also change.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 301-11
Chapter 301
Design and Maintenance Coordination
To determine the life span of a particular asset type and the approximate discount rate for that life span, contact the Asset Management Group within the Capital Program Development and Management Office. After analyzing the life cycle cost to maintain a particular asset, and demonstrating an understanding of the associated risks, design and maintenance staff can justify the best return on the construction investment. While the primary intent of this process is to document justification for an asset decision, it is important that region Maintenance is supplied with the information as well. Providing this information during the design process can inform maintenance budgetary scenarios. Allow sufficient time for maintenance to capture budget impacts and apply for the necessary funding in the bi-annual maintenance budgeting process.

301.03(2)(c) CAE Design Tools Projects create assets that need to be maintained. The various CADD and modeling programs used for engineering design allow for significant flexibility to show maintenance considerations related to the project. This is true even if a feature won’t be physically built by the project, but we want to ensure its visibility throughout the design. Indicate maintenance work zones and access routes within the working files. Refer to the Electronic Engineering Data Standards Manual for symbology requirements and standards.

Chapter 301
Design and Maintenance Coordination
301.03(2)(d) Maintenance Review and Quality Control Products There are a number of different ways to support design reviews and quality control for maintenance features associated with a project. Some regions use maintenance review checklists to remind designers and reviewers of common maintenance needs on projects (see example in Exhibit 301-3).
Worksheets for each asset are another means to document the discussion, options considered, and the decided outcome for a particular asset placed or retained within the project limits (see example in Exhibit 301-2). Even if these review and documentation options are not specifically required by region documentation and approval processes, a decision to utilize these tools can be made at the project level. The established quality control and quality assurance (QA/QC) procedure within each region provides an additional process for ensuring maintenance comments and concerns have been addressed and the agreed-on features are in place. This procedure becomes increasingly important at the 60%, 90%, and constructability review milestones, where design iterations may have neglected to account for impacts to previously agreed-on features or treatments specific to maintenance and operational needs. Discuss increasing the visibility of maintenance-related quality control within the project or region QA/QC plan and identify the assigned staff responsible for quality control and quality assurance.

301.03(2)(e) Asset Management and Maintenance Owner’s Manual Maintenance and operations staff will need to maintain the assets placed or retained within a project location. It is important to be aware of the various asset management systems:
•
•
•
•
•
Highway Activity Tracking System (HATS) Roadside Features Inventory Program (RFIP) Signal Maintenance Management System (SIMMS) Maintenance Productivity Enhancement Tool (MPET) Traffic Sign Management System (TSMS)
The asset management system reviews are necessary to confirm the assets present on a project, as well as any identification numbers associated with the assets to track and list those that will be removed, replaced, or remain. Work with the appropriate maintenance staff and confirm the assets identified during field reviews with maintenance staff. Post-construction, any new assets placed will need to be logged into the appropriate asset management system(s) by maintenance or construction staff, depending on region procedures.
Maintenance and operations personnel have experience maintaining a variety of products and features on state highways. However, not every asset is strictly typical for the maintenance discipline or area responsible for maintaining or operating it. Review the assets planned for placement within a project and understand what information maintenance crews may need to adequately maintain the asset or feature. This should include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
Recommended equipment Frequency of maintenance activities Limits or boundaries (particularly for stormwater BMPs) Access location and route Any other relevant information discussed with maintenance or supplied by the product provider, including information on brand, make, and model of the asset
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 301-18
Chapter 301
Design and Maintenance Coordination
Information about these assets should be compiled into an Owner’s Manual for maintenance to reference.
•
•
•
The Owner’s Manual will be provided in hard copy, an editable electronic copy, and static electronic versions. Electronic versions of the Owner’s Manual must be titled in the following format: [YYYYMMDD]_Owner’s Manual_[route]_[MP Limits]_[Contract Number]. Hard copies will be bound in a binder and labeled on the cover and binding with the same information provided in the required PDF title.
The Owner’s Manual versions will be supplied to both maintenance and the construction office, upon contract advertisement. Note: This may not be necessary if needed content is captured within the area’s Integrated Vegetation Management (IVM) Plan. If changes occur during post advertisement for a particular asset or feature listed in the Owner’s Manual, it is the responsibility of the construction office and maintenance to coordinate an update of the Owner’s Manual, as appropriate. As the construction phase ends, after punch list items are resolved, Maintenance staff should undergo a final review to ensure the Owner’s Manual is complete and accurate.
301.03(2)(f) Maintenance Agreements Some project locations may have multiple maintenance jurisdictions, at both the state and local levels. In these circumstances, involve all maintenance jurisdictions throughout the planning and design process. They can help you understand their capabilities and the reasonable accommodations necessary for frequent maintenance operations. To understand the likely split between local and state jurisdictions, refer to Chapter 1230 and the Conformed Agreement… for the Construction, Operations and Maintenance Responsibilities… www.wsdot.wa.gov/localprograms/lag/construction.htm Some maintenance and operations agreements between state and local agencies exist for streets that are also state highways, and are important to the success of these projects. These agreements may need to be created, updated, or replaced due to the nature of the project. The potential agreements need to identify the maintenance, operational, and jurisdictional boundaries, roles, and responsibilities of the parties entering into the agreement, including liability, indemnification, and insurance. The Conformed Agreement (above) lists the likely split of jurisdictional responsibilities. However, maintenance jurisdiction(s) may want to create an operational plan or agreement for the infrequent maintenance functions that designs may not be able to accommodate. It is also possible that one maintenance jurisdiction will be better equipped to handle certain maintenance elements than another. It will be necessary to document the split of maintenance responsibilities even if responsibilities remain the same as those listed within the Conformed Agreement. Agreements require a level of detail that will not be known early in project development, so it is important to document trade-offs, benefits, and impacts with the affected maintenance jurisdictions while early decisions are being made.

305.01 Introduction The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) embraces project management best practices to deliver quality projects within the project scope, on schedule, and within budget. WSDOT’s project management process provides an organized approach to building collaborative teams. Resources including methods, processes, tools, templates, and examples. This chapter serves as a reference and gives a brief overview of project management resources. It outlines the project management steps. Project management includes strategies to manage:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Teams – identify roles and responsibilities; align the teams’ project goals. Collaboration – engage internal and external stakeholders and participants. Deliverables – identify what will be produced. See the WSDOT Master Deliverables List and the Deliverables Expectations Matrix. Tasks – plan and organize the sequence, levels of effort, and persons responsible for producing deliverables. Schedules – determine durations, critical dates, task linkages, and critical path(s). Costs – plan and control the project budget at each project stage. Risks – determine the threats to and opportunities for the project and plan accordingly. Integration and coordination of processes – for efficiency and eliminating waste. Change – describe the reason for, make decisions during, approving, and reporting change. Quality – determine the metric and target; monitor to assure, control, and verify quality. Communication – Constant communication amongst and between the project team, stakeholders, and external parties based on roles, responsibilities, and agreed to project goals. Inform sponsors and decision-makers.
Effective project delivery includes a strong commitment to project management best practices and principles. Another major factor in successful project delivery is building trust through communication about the project within, and external to, the design team. Executive Orders 1032, 1038, 1053, and Policy Statement 2047 ensure a consistent process for practical design, project management, and risk management statewide.
305.02 Project Management The project management process provides the framework for project managers and team members to deliver quality projects on time and within the scope and budget. Project management resources are consistent with a practical design approach and offer structure for organizing and aligning collaborative teams to engage stakeholders and the community. Exhibit 305-1 shows the project management process used to deliver projects. Each of the five parts shown is briefly described in the following sections.

Project Management
Exhibit 305-1 WSDOT Project Management Process
1. 2. 3. 4. 5.
Initiating: Organize team for success Planning: Develop project management plan and work plan Executing: Take action – direct and manage work and communications Monitoring and Controlling: Monitor deliverables, due dates, costs, and quality Closing: Prepare organized cessation activities; transition work or staff
305.02(1) Initiate (and Align) Teams deliver projects, hence one of the first orders of business in project management is to initiate and align the team. Our projects are successful because of the effectiveness of the team delivering them. To that end, initiating and aligning the team is an important early accomplishment. Aligning the team establishes communications and responsibilities of the project manager and team. The Initiate and Align worksheet is a tool that can be helpful in this phase.
305.02(2) Plan the Work Plan the work is the portion of the project management process that produces the Project Management Plan (PMP). The PMP defines the project performance baseline—including deliverables, schedule and budget, and management methods. As the project manager and project team plan the work, they integrate and coordinate processes in a manner that optimizes resources and reduces waste. For example, if a project requires an Access Revision Report (ARR), National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) documentation, or a Value Engineering study (VE), the project manager and team coordinate and align these efforts. This way they make use of common information and subject matter experts. The performance baseline documents the team goals for project performance. The performance baseline includes:
•
•
•
•
Scope – the deliverables to be produced by the project team. Schedule – the logical sequence of work and related milestones. Budget – the amount of money programmed for the project. Risk – uncertainty that affects project objectives.
The PMP includes management plans for Risk, Change, Communication, Quality, Transition, and Closure. These plans align the team toward uniform goals. A complete PMP considers how the project will start, be executed, monitored, controlled, and close.
305.02(3) Executing (Working the Plan) During execution, the team, subject matter experts, and others are coordinated with as necessary to produce deliverables. The project manager and project team ensure the integration of various project development and design processes that are optimal for completing the required work and meeting the performance objectives.

Project Management
305.02(4) Monitoring and Controlling As the project team executes the work, progress is tracked and reported to the project manager. If changes or course corrections are required, the project manager takes appropriate action in a timely manner. As the team monitors progress, they may need to take action that includes: developing and implementing recovery strategies, updating the PMP, implementing risk response strategies and updating the risk assessment. Obtain change request approvals as necessary and ensure the quality plan is being implemented. Report on the performance of the team and communicate with management, staff and team.
305.02(5) Closing (the Project) At the end of the project, it is helpful to review lessons learned and reward and recognize the team for successes. Capturing lessons learned and recognize people occurs throughout the project; however, the closure phase provides an opportunity to finalize this and bring it to conclusion. As a project comes to an end it will either close or transition to a new phase. The project manager performs the closure or transition in an orderly and appropriate manner. This involves demobilizing and reassigning staff and transferring resources or facilities. Address the closure and transition phase of the project management process during creation of the PMP and the work plan. Project team planning and transitions can be aided by using the Deliverable Expectation Matrix which provides a range of project development deliverables and the general order in which they will occur (see Section 305.03(2). A project is complete after transition and closure is accomplished, and the project manager is released from responsibility for the project.
305.03 Project Management Tools For an overview of project management, with links to the WSDOT project management process and tools for delivering the WSDOT Capital Construction Program, see the following website: Project management | WSDOT (wa.gov)
305.03(1) WSDOT’s Master Deliverables List The Master Deliverables List (MDL) is a comprehensive list of project elements down to the deliverable level. This list serves as a starting point for creating the project’s Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) by adding or removing elements to match the specific project. This ensures:
•
•
Appropriate project deliverables are included in the PMP and schedule; and A common vocabulary and a map of the agreed to strategy that spans project teams and specialty/support groups in the region and Headquarters (HQ).
For additional information, see the MDL: MasterDeliverablesList.xlsx
305.03(2) Deliverables Expectations Matrix The Deliverables Expectation Matrix (DEM) communicates typical expectations for project deliverables and helps establish mutual understanding of these expectations. The DEM offers “at-a-glance” information about an extensive list of deliverables developed during the entire project development process from planning to design phase closure. Coordinate with appropriate support groups and other subject matter experts for deliverable details specific to the project.

Project Management
The DEM is intended to help scope, schedule, budget, and execute the work needed for each needed project deliverable along with the benefits of Quality Control, Quality Assurance, and Quality Verification. It also shows where the deliverable fit in the following project development milestones:
•

For additional information, see the DEM: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/design/demintro.pdf
305.03(3) Project Management and Reporting System The Project Management and Reporting System (PMRS) is a tool for effective and efficient management of design project schedules, resources, and costs. The following website provides tools for project planning, WBS development, scheduling, and resource and cost management: wwwi.wsdot.wa.gov/planning/cpdmo/pmrs.htm
305.04 Project Risk Management Project risk management is required for every WSDOT project. WSDOT has developed a world-renowned program for project risk management that is scalable and effective. Executive Order 1053 “Project Risk Management and Risk-Based Estimating” offers direction and general information about project risk management at WSDOT. Exhibit 305-2 summarizes project risk management requirements. Project managers may choose to use a higher level process than the required process.

* Project Managers can use a higher-level process if desired. Notes: [1] In some cases, it is acceptable to combine a Value Engineering Study with a Risk-Based Estimating Workshop. [2] Projects $25 million and over should use the self-modeling spreadsheet in the scoping phase of the risk-based estimating process, followed up by the more formal CRA or CEVP® process during the design phase. [3] An informal workshop is composed of the project team (or key project team members); other participants may be included as the Project Manager/project team deem necessary. Proactive risk management is an integral part of project management that monitors projects to determine, document, and, account for risks and uncertainty. Knowing the risk triggers, the risk probabilities and impacts allows a project team to develop risk strategies that benefit the efficiency of a project through the design and construction stages. For more information on risk planning and risk management, see: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/cevp/projectriskmanagement.pdf For more information on risk assessment, see: Cost risk assessment | WSDOT (wa.gov) Sound project risk management begins with a defined project scope, estimated cost, and schedule commensurate with the current level of development. To that end, there are several WSDOT sources for cost estimating guidance, including:

305.04(1) Risk Assessment Timing Timing matters. Risk analyses must be coordinated with other project development activities, especially Value Engineering. Optimizing the timing of the initial risk analysis maximizes the opportunity to identify and implement effective risk response actions. Subsequent updates to the risk assessment can be scheduled appropriately based on the specific needs of the project. 1. Planning / pre-scoping An early risk assessment helps refine expectations and evaluate alternatives. It also shows the importance of risk management through the life of the project. 2. Scoping Phase Early in preliminary engineering is a good time to consider project risks. At the conclusion of the risk assessment there are clearer expectations with regard to project cost and schedule and time to find innovative ways to respond to the risks. 3. Start of Design A risk assessment informs the project delivery method selection. It is conducted prior to final decision on delivery method (see the Project Delivery Method Selection Guide, PDMSG ). At the start of design, the project scope and preliminary costs have been established and major design decisions have been made. Some Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) activities may have begun, and coordination with support groups and subject matter experts is underway. At this stage, the project scope, costs, and schedule should be updated. This is a time to update the risk assessment as well. There is opportunity to focus on the technical issues of the design elements. 4. Design Approval After Design Approval, most of the important project decisions have been made and the opportunity to affect the design is limited. The risk analysis update can assess the risk profile of the project as it has evolved. The group may focus on constructability, construction sequencing, staging, traffic control, and significant design issues.
305.04(2) Risk Response and Value Engineering An effective tool to generate risk response actions is Value Engineering (VE). See Design Manual Chapter 310 and the Project Risk Management Guide. Section 305.04(2)(a) illustrates the natural complementary features of Project Management and VE.
305.04(2)(a) Project Management and Value Engineering Alignment of Value Engineering (VE) to PMBOK® The tools and techniques of VE align with, and can enhance, Project Management as defined in the PMBOK® Guide. Consider the following ways VE and Project Management work together: Initiate and Plan the work
Execute and Monitor
Close
Clarify vision and refine scope Identify/verify quality measures Promote innovation Enhance project function
Validate business case Implement value recommendations Coordinate with stakeholders Measure Quality
Validate benefits Lessons learned for quality

310.01 General Value engineering (VE) is a systematic review of a project by a multidisciplinary team. The VE process can include consideration of design; construction; maintenance; contractor; state, local, and federal partner agencies; other stakeholders; and the public. Value Engineering is one of the most effective techniques to identify and eliminate unnecessary costs in design, testing, manufacturing, construction, operations, maintenance, data, procedures, and practices. Value analyses are typically conducted early in project development to improve project value by identifying ideas that improve function, offer efficiencies, reduce cost and refine scope. Section 310.02(3) VE Analysis Timing, of this chapter offers additional information about timing. A VE analysis2 may be applied as a quick-response study to address a problem or as an integral part of an overall organizational effort to stimulate innovation and improve performance characteristics. Value Engineering (VE) is a critical part of good project management practices. Project managers are accountable for ensuring that, at a minimum, projects needing VE include VE activities in the project schedule. Project managers should carefully plan the timing of the VE analysis for optimum benefit. In addition, local programs projects are accountable for ensuring they comply with Local Agency Guidelines requirements. In all cases, when a VE study is completed, the project manager is accountable for completing, signing, and submitting the VE Recommendations Approval Form.
310.02 Statewide VE Program 310.02(1) Annual VE Plan The State VE Manager, located in the Development division, coordinates annually with the Capital Program Development & Management division and region VE Coordinators to prepare an annual VE Plan. The VE Plan is the basis for determining the projected VE program needs, including team members, team leaders, consultants, and training. The Statewide VE Plan is a working document that reflects coordination between Headquarters and the regions to keep it updated and projects on schedule.

310.02(2) Selecting Projects for VE Analysis 310.02(2)(a) Requirements WSDOT requires VE analyses for Design-Bid-Build (DBB) projects in accordance with FHWA requirements of 23 CFR Part 627 that meet the following thresholds:
•
•
•
•
A total estimated cost (includes project development, design, right of way, and construction costs) of $50 million or more. A bridge project located off of the federal-aid system with an estimated total project cost of $40 million or more. A Major Project with Federal-Aid Highway Program (FAHP) funding. In some cases, regardless of the amount of FAHP funding, a project team may be required to perform more than one VE analysis for a major project. Any other project the Secretary or FHWA determines to be appropriate.
After completing the required VE analysis, if the project is split into smaller projects in final design or is programmed to be completed by the advertisement of multiple construction contracts, an additional VE analysis is not required. However, splitting a project into smaller projects or multiple construction contracts is not an accepted method to avoid the requirements to conduct a VE analysis. Design-build projects are not required to perform Value Engineering. Even if a project is not required to conduct a VE study there may be benefits realized from the process.
310.02(2)(b) Recommendations Some projects that are not required to perform VE may find it beneficial—the following recommends considering a VE for projects having certain characteristics.
WSDOT strongly recommends a VE analysis for projects: 1. Bridge projects over $20 million and other projects over $25 million. 2. Projects of any size, having the potential for significant cost savings or improved project performance or quality. 3. Projects involving complex technical issues, challenging project constraints, unique requirements, or competing community and stakeholder objectives. 4. Encountering a three-year or longer delay prior to advertisement for construction, and a substantial change to the project’s scope or design is identified. Project Managers and teams should strongly consider value engineering for projects having a total estimated cost exceeding $5 million and one or more of the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Significant risks Alternative solutions that vary the scope and cost New alignment or bypass sections Capacity improvements that widen the existing highway Major structures Interchanges Social justice concerns and inclusion of underserved communities Possible or likely presence of cultural/archaeologic resources Geotechnical or geographical challenges

310.02(3) VE Analysis Timing 310.02(3)(a) Best time to Conduct a VE Analysis Timing is a key to the success of the VE analysis. A VE analysis must be coordinated with other project development activities. For example, a project requiring an Access Revision Report (ARR), NEPA and a VE must consider how to best integrate processes. Conducting VE analyses in conjunction with these efforts ensures VE outcomes are considered during environmental documentation and avoids the necessity to re-evaluate NEPA. Although VE is not required for design-build projects, in some cases there are benefits, including:
•
•
•
•
Enables WSDOT to be a better informed owner in procurement and selection of the design builder Allows focusing the VE analysis effort on response actions to identified risks and allocating risk ownership Promotes innovation in specific areas of interest or concern identified by the project manager or team Identifies possible improvements to procurement process documents, and in particular the request for proposal (RFP)
Optimizing the timing of a VE analysis minimizes impacts of approved recommendations on previous commitments (agency, community, or environmental) and project scope. VE analyses can also be coordinated with project risk assessments. Benefits can be realized by performing a VE analysis at any time during project development; however, the following typical windows of opportunity are identified for performing a VE analysis.
i Planning / pre-scoping An early Value Engineering study can be conducted to refine scope and evaluate alternative actions. VE analysis in planning and pre-scoping promotes identification of performance attributes that can be carried forward to future more focused and in-depth VE analysis during design. This early effort could be a Value Engineering / Practical Design peer review and used as a forum for community engagement with major stakeholders. Value Engineering in Planning can inform the project with respect to possible risks that need to be examined more fully at a future Cost Risk Assessment or Cost Estimate Validation Process workshop. Coordinate timing to complement NEPA and Access Revision Report activities. Optimize the VE process so that it integrates naturally with these processes and can utilize or inform project need statements.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 310-3
Chapter 310
Value Engineering
ii Scoping Phase Scoping is a good time for value analysis. This is a time to consider alternatives or design solutions. At the conclusion of the VE study, the project scope, preliminary costs, and major design decisions are informed by the recommendations. During the scoping phase the VE analysis focuses on project drivers. This stage often provides an opportunity for community engagement and building consent with stakeholders.
iii Start of Design During pre-design, or at the start of design, the project scope, and preliminary costs are being established and major design decisions have been made. Some Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) activities may have begun, and coordination with support groups and subject matter experts is underway. At this stage, the project scope, costs, and schedule define the limits of the VE analysis. There is opportunity to focus on the technical issues of design elements.
iv Design Approval After Design Approval, most of the important project decisions have been made and the opportunity to affect the design is limited. Provided there is time to incorporate VE recommendations, the VE analysis may likely focus on constructability, construction sequencing, staging, traffic control, and significant design issues. At this point “ease of implementation” may be a driving consideration for project managers as they consider VE recommendations to approve for implementation. A VE analysis late in the project development phase may be useful if the estimated cost of the project exceeds the project budget. The value engineering process can be applied to the project to lower the cost while maintaining the value and quality of the design.

310.02(4)(d) VE Team Leader The quality of a VE analysis relies on the skills of the VE team leader. The VE team leader guides the team’s efforts from preparation, through the VE job plan and any follow-up actions. The VE team leader should be knowledgeable and proficient in transportation design and construction and in the VE analysis process for transportation projects. The VE team leader’s responsibilities include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
Plans, leads, and facilitates the VE study. Ensures proper application of a value methodology and follows the job plan. Guides the team through pre-study activities, the VE study, and the post-study. Schedules a pre-workshop meeting with the project team and prepares the agenda for the VE study. Team leaders from within WSDOT are encouraged, but not required, to be certified by SAVE International as a Value Methodology Associate or Certified Value Specialist (CVS). Team leadership can be supplied from within the region, from another region, or from Headquarters. A statewide pool of qualified team leaders is maintained by the State VE Coordinator, who works with the Region VE Coordinator to select the team leader.
Consultants who lead VE teams are required to be a current SAVE International Certified Value Specialist.
310.02(4)(e) VE Team Members The VE teams are usually composed of six to ten people with diverse expertise relevant to the project under study. The team members may come from regions; Headquarters; other local, state, or federal agencies; or the private sector. VE team members are selected based on the expertise needed to address major issues and functions the project is to deliver. All team members must be committed to the time required for the study. It is desirable for team members to have attended Value Methodology Fundamentals 1 training before participating in a VE study. It is useful to have some team members who are not involved in the project.
310.03 VE Procedure The WSDOT VE analysis uses the Job Plan shown in Exhibit 310-1. A detailed discussion of how each phase is supposed to be conducted can be found in the document, Value Methodology Standard and Body of Knowledge, developed by SAVE International. This document can be downloaded at the SAVE website: https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.value-eng.org/resource/resmgr/standards_documents/vmstd.pdf
310.03(1) Pre-Analysis Preparation To initiate a VE study, the project manager completes the Request form and emails to the HQ Engineering Analysis Office, Region VE Coordinator, and Assistant State Design Engineer at least 10 to 12 weeks before the proposed study date. The Project Manager, Region VE Coordinator and State VE Coordinator collaborate to determine dates, VE team leader and team members for the VE study. The Request Form and Contacts are found at: Value engineering | WSDOT (wa.gov). The design team prepares project information for the VE team—see Exhibit 310-2. The State VE Coordinator for the best/most concise list of materials to send to the team members. If the package is provided via a network drive or FTP site, make sure the materials are organized. The VE team members should receive a link or the information at least one week prior to the study so they have time to review the material.

The project manager and state VE Coordinator determine if the VE study should be conducted virtually or inperson.
310.03(2) VE Analysis Requirements Value Engineering is a tool to serve the project, project manager and project team. Great flexibility is used to tailor the VE study to the needs of the project, project manager, and project team. Many project managers may desire to use VE, even if it is a smaller project and a VE study is not required. VE studies can be used to refine project scope, improve design, or engage stakeholders. VE is a process that can be easily adapted to such projects and may involve a brief one- or two-day event. For projects that require a VE analysis, the time required varies commensurate to project complexity and size, typical studies are three to five days. The VE team leader working with the project manager will determine the best length of time for the study. The VE analysis Final Report includes:

The Project Manager and Project team are responsible for: Implementation of approved recommendations. Documentation of reasons recommendations were not implemented.
310.03(3) Implementation Phase As soon as possible, preferably no more than two weeks following the VE analysis, the project manager reviews and evaluates the VE team’s recommendation(s). The project manager completes and signs the VE Recommendation Approval form and returns it to the Statewide VE Manager for inclusion in the final report. Recommendations not approved or modified by the project manager require a brief justification in the VE Recommendation Approval form. The project manager sends the completed VE Recommendation Approval form to the State VE Manager following receipt of the Final Report and not later than September 1 of each year, whichever comes first, so the results can be included in WSDOT’s annual VE Report to FHWA.

320.01 General This chapter is intended to address policy-related issues associated with WSDOT multimodal traffic analysis. It is not intended to address the specifics of demand forecasting; mesoscopic, analytical/deterministic, stochastic microsimulation; or safety performance analyses. For those items, see the latest versions of the Highway Capacity Manual and Highway Safety Manual (HSM). Traffic analysis is intended to produce information for decision makers; it is not intended as a stand-alone tool for making decisions. Consideration of empirical data, similar traffic situations, studies, local knowledge, and seasoned traffic engineering and planning experience can also add to a pool of traffic information that is provided to decision makers. Traffic analysis is either “operational” or “planning” in nature. Operational analysis is associated with engineering concepts focusing on near-term or existing/opening year, while planning analyses are generally focused on a horizon year or interim phase years. Planning-level analyses are also used to determine impacts for environmental documentation phases of Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) work. Much caution should be used when operational tools are used with planning-level future year projection data. Be aware that operational models were not primarily intended for use with planning-level future year projected volumes, but there is a need to understand the difference between proposed future scenarios. Therefore, operational models need to use data from forecasting models, but analysts need to do so with an understanding of the imperfections. Forecasting demand volumes 20 years into the future can be difficult to do well, so there should be little expectation that intersection turning movement projection-related traffic analyses by themselves will be sufficient to produce actionable designs. Consequently, some future year Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) such as turn lane queue length should not be considered accurate, but they may be useful when comparing various scenarios if the reported differences are substantial. With the aforementioned limitations, project-specific traffic volumes, forecasts, and system capacities are used to establish the extent of improvements needed for facilities to operate acceptably from year of opening or through interim phases and, eventually, through to the horizon year; for example:
•
•
•
•
•
Number of general purpose/ETL/HOV lanes Length and number of ramp or auxiliary lanes Intersection or interchange spacing Channelization Signal timing
•
•
•
•
•
Right of way needs Roundabout design parameters Width of sidewalks Extent of bike lanes Ferry holding lanes
Traffic analysis should examine multimodal access, mobility, and safety objectives; project benefits and costs; development impacts; and mitigation needs.

For projects that fall under FHWA approval, coordinate with the Headquarters (HQ) Traffic Office for concurrence on traffic analysis details. Other projects can be coordinated through region Traffic offices. (See Chapter 300 for FHWA oversight and approval policy.)
320.02 Design Year and Forecasting Considerations Project evaluation requirements can be (1) focused on near-term functionality, (2) contain interim phases, and/or (3) require a long-term focus. The project proponent can be the state (WSDOT or other state agencies) or developers (other public agencies or private concerns). For Access Revision Reports (AARs), the design year and multimodal travel demand forecasting methodologies are to be documented by the project stakeholders in the Methods and Assumptions (M&A) Documents. Guidance on the horizon year and interim design year(s) for projects is given in Chapter 1103, Design Controls. When selecting horizon year and interim design year phases, stakeholders need to consider the regional significance of a proposed project, how it functions within the existing system, and the expected lifespan. The traffic analysis for developer-related projects will typically focus on existing conditions and the build-out year of the proposed project. Some larger developer projects will need to be evaluated in multiple phases, as they have the potential to significantly impact the transportation system and will thus require a longer-term focus. Mitigation measures may also be phased with these projects. Project teams are encouraged to consider the strategic importance, economic potential, network constraints, and investment scale when determining the analysis methodologies for project phasing, design year, and forecasts. With acceptance/concurrence by the Traffic Office of purview3, the following are possible approaches to be used individually or in concert to develop future year demand volumes:

320.03 Traffic Analysis Software With acceptance by the Traffic Office of purview, use the least complex and data-intensive software deemed reasonable for any given project. Agreement for software and versions must be documented in the study’s M&A. Use the latest version sanctioned by WSDOT HQ Traffic.
•
•
•
For near-term analysis of locations that do not require an understanding of interactions between various transportation systems, Sidra, Rodel, Synchro, and HCS are the primary analytical tools. For systemwide multimodal complex forecasting, EMME3, TransCad, and Visum are the primary tools. For choosing between scenarios involving multimodal traffic and/or where various transportation system elements interact, CORSIM, Vissim, or Dynameq are the primary tools.
The software mentioned above may have version limitations due to WSDOT purchased rights and contract limitations. For details about these and other traffic analysis software used by WSDOT, contact the region or HQ Traffic Office.
320.04 Travel Demand Forecasting Designers, planners, and analysts need to be aware of the practical limitations of the selected method of multimodal traffic demand forecasting and should consider the impact of demand uncertainty when conducting analyses and drawing conclusions from those analyses. Special attention should be given to any post-processing efforts. Following are brief descriptions of the four main methods for demand forecasting.
320.04(1) Travel Demand Models For the vast majority of projects, this will be the proper approach for developing future year demand volumes. However, caution should be taken when using this approach to draw conclusions from operational model Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) that are based on such forecasts, because specific and accurate turning movement volumes are needed to produce credible MOEs. Forecast models are most commonly used to produce general volumes that can help traffic planners evaluate and compare the relative merits of potential solutions against each other.
320.04(2) Trend Line Projections Where travel demand models are not established or are otherwise considered inadequate, trend data can be used but must be constrained by system flow limitations. Trend line growth cannot account for peak spreading when traffic demand exceeds system supply. Use with caution and consult the HQ Transportation Data & GIS Office (TDGO) for further details about this method and any inherent limitations.
320.04(3) Cumulative Impacts This method is typically used to forecast volumes in areas that demonstrate uniform growth and exhibit only minor changes and marginal impacts to the region. It is also useful for analyzing growth in suburban areas that are experiencing rapid development, as other methods may not be as reliable. The basic concept is to add volumes for developments to the trending background traffic growth. The comprehensive plan for such areas should be consistent with the expected growth predicted by a project (and include other anticipated projects) in order to result in a reasonable estimate of cumulative impacts. Use with caution due to an inability to fully account for secondary impacts like future environmental issues, local network connectivity, public services, and multimodal demands.

Traffic Analysis
320.04(4) Limitations of the Surrounding Network For projects that contain infrastructure of particular importance, extraordinary expense, life span expectancy beyond 20 years, or where travel demand will likely always exceed transportation system capacity constraints, give consideration to the concept of facility capacity balancing within the context of the larger transportation system. This approach needs to demonstrate that the maximum amount of upstream traffic flowing into a project, as well as all project-area traffic flowing into downstream sections, can be handled acceptably. This does not require traditional travel demand forecasting, which has a limitation of about 20 years. Instead, it requires a sensitivity approach where maximum up- and downstream flows are used to right-size the project area’s proposed improvements. The simplest example is the SR 520 Floating Bridge: constraints on either end of the bridge limit the usefulness of adding more lanes on the bridge. TIAs and ARRs (see Chapter 550) shall clearly describe the methodology and process used to develop forecasts in support of a proposed project’s analysis. For example, include only those projects that:
•
•
•
Are on the six-year Transportation Improvement Plan. Are fully funded. Have entered the environmental review process.
320.05 Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) TIA is a term used for all analyses that are not structured ARRs (see Chapter 550) or planning-level efforts like corridor studies. The quality and level of service4 for state-owned and state-interest facilities shall be based upon MOEs that support the project purpose and need. They shall also be developed and presented in accordance with the latest versions of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), FHWA Traffic Analysis Toolbox, and WSDOT Vissim Protocol. For some example MOEs, see the FHWA MOE List, which describes measures typically used for analyzing state and local agency facilities such as freeway segments, signalized intersections, ramp terminals/junctions, sidewalks, and transit services. Depending on the facility and when HCM Level of Service MOE is used, WSDOT thresholds are “C” for rural and “D” for urban non-NHS facilities, unless a WSDOT region specifies otherwise for specific route segments. (See each WSDOT region for details.) Refer to the WSDOT State Highway Log for a determination of existing route segment definitions for urban or rural status. Depending on the project type and purpose, multimodal MOEs may be employed.
320.05(1) Updating an Existing TIA TIAs require either updating or a sensitivity analysis if they become more than 3 years old; however, a TIA will require updating sooner in rapidly developing areas. TIAs can avoid such update efforts in slowly developing areas. To determine if an update is required, an assessment of critical infrastructure functionality must be documented.

WSDOT sets level of service (LOS) standards for state highways and ferry routes of statewide significance (HSS) based on RCW 47.06.140(2). Regional transportation planning organizations (RTPOs) and WSDOT jointly develop and RTPOs establish LOS standards for regionally significant state highways and ferry routes (non-HSS) based on RCW 47.80.030(1)(c). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 320-4
Chapter 320
Traffic Analysis
If the amount or character of traffic in the study area is significantly different from an earlier analysis, an update will be required. The definition of significant is 10% (volume, flow rate, travel time, delay, density, or other key MOEs) where existing operations are currently acceptable. If they are not currently acceptable, the threshold is reduced to 5%. In cases where greater than 10% change or failed MOEs have been found, consultation and concurrence with WSDOT Traffic Office of purview is required to avoid a full ARRs or TIA update. Developer-initiated TIAs are typically valid for 5 or 6 years, as that is the window provided under the Growth Management Act for concurrency. The Development Services Office should be consulted regarding the need for updates to TIAs for developer, tribal, and local agency projects.
320.06 TIA Scope To establish the appropriate scope, consultation between the lead agency, WSDOT, and those preparing the TIA is encouraged before beginning work. A summary of typical TIA contents is listed in Section 320.10. Note: For developer-initiated TIAs, the local agency may prescribe the scope of the TIA per the local agency’s adopted standards.
320.06(1) TIA Boundaries The traffic impacts of local streets and roads can impact intersections on state highway facilities. In these cases, include in the TIA an analysis of adjacent local facilities (driveways, intersections, main lines, and interchanges) upstream and downstream of the intersection with the state highway. A “lesser analysis” may include obtaining traffic counts, preparing signal warrants, or a focused TIA. For developer projects, the boundaries of the analysis (such as the city limits) may be determined in consultation with local agencies and WSDOT.
320.06(2) Traffic Analysis Scenarios WSDOT must understand the effects of plan updates and amendments, as well as the effects of specific project elements (including site plans, conditional use permits, subdivisions, and rezoning) that have the potential to impact state facilities. Consultation between the lead agency, WSDOT, and those preparing the TIA is essential early in the process to help determine appropriate scenario analyses and goals. For further guidance, consult Chapter 1130. Depending on the type of work being analyzed, required TIA scenarios can range from simple “existing conditions with and without project,” to more complex analyses where TIA scenarios could include: existing; opening year with and without project; interim years with and without project; and design year with and without project. If developed with WSDOT, and if following ARR guidance, pre-ARR work such as Area Study TIAs can be used in future ARRs. The appropriate and necessary scenarios shall be agreed upon by the TIA study team and documented in the TIA Methods and Assumptions (M&A) Document. For existing networks, calibrate models to existing conditions. If a near-term baseline network is required, only funding-secured projects should be added to the existing network. This is typical of opening year models that are a few years beyond existing year. For interim scenario networks, include only projects or developments within the forecasting process that have the highest probability within the 10-year horizon. For example, include projects that are fully funded or have a construction phase in the six-year Transportation Improvement Plan. For scenarios with phases beyond 10 years, TIA or ARR teams should discuss and document the merits of including other potential projects. For example: WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

All other potential influences with lower probability should not be allowed to affect travel or trip demand forecast results—with one exception: TIAs and ARRs may include multiple scenarios for the design year. For example, if a major assumption for unfunded additional lanes “feeding traffic into” or “allowing traffic from” the project is desired for the design year to allow for a better understanding of expensive infrastructure sizing (such as ultimate bridge widths), ensure a constrained design year scenario is included so that proper funding-based phasing solutions are communicated.
320.07 TIA Methods and Assumptions Document The TIA M&A is similar to an ARR M&A in that it documents the “who, what, where, when, how, and why” items associated with the traffic analysis portion of a project. Prior to any substantial fieldwork or traffic/facility data collection, consultation between the lead agency, WSDOT, and those preparing the TIA is encouraged to help reach and document consensus on study data needs and assumptions. These and other items should be documented and the M&A signed by all lead staff that conduct work in association with the TIA M&A document. For further guidance, consult Chapter 1130.
320.08 TIA Methodologies The FHWA Traffic Analysis Toolbox, Volume 2, provides a methodology for selecting traffic analysis tools. However, in general, traffic analysis methodologies for those facility types indicated below are used by WSDOT and will be accepted if agreed upon by those who sign TIA or ARR M&A Documents.

Traffic Analysis
The procedures in the Highway Capacity Manual do not explicitly address operations of closely spaced signalized intersections, nor does WSDOT currently endorse microsimulation or roundabout guidance as noted in the HCM/S. Under such conditions, several unique characteristics must be considered, including spill-back potential from the downstream intersection to the upstream intersection; effects of downstream queues on upstream saturation flow rates; and unusual platoon dispersion or compression between intersections. An example of such closely spaced operations is signalized ramp terminals at urban interchanges. Queue interactions between closely spaced intersections can seriously distort the results of analyses that follow the procedures in the HCM. Other analysis methods may be accepted; however, consultation between the lead agency, region or HQ Traffic, and those preparing the TIA is encouraged to reach consensus on the data necessary for the analysis if meso- or microsimulation is employed. When a state highway has saturated flows, the use of a meso- or microsimulation models can provide additional understanding. Note, however, that the simulation model must be calibrated and validated for reliable results and is intended for near-term operational analyses. Operational MOEs for simulation models based on long-term forecasts should be used primarily to determine which scenarios are better than others. The models can only do so if the resultant MOEs demonstrate significant differentiation between scenarios. TIA or ARR teams will determine what is considered significant and will document those findings in the study. However, at a minimum, significant must be greater than the expected error band of the models used. For example, if Vissim is considered to be calibrated to a given MOE within 15% of existing conditions (a very wide band), the scenarios need to show greater than 15% differentiation between each other to be significant.
320.09 TIA Mitigation Measures Consultation between the lead agency, WSDOT, and the responsible parties preparing the TIA is recommended in order to reach consensus on the project mitigation measures. Mitigation measures, if applicable, need to be included in the TIA to determine whether a project’s impacts can be eliminated or reduced to a level of insignificance. Eliminating or reducing impacts to a level of insignificance is the standard pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The lead agency is responsible for administering the SEPA and/or NEPA review process. WSDOT is responsible for reviewing the TIA for impacts that pertain to state highway facilities. However, the authority vested in the lead agency under SEPA/ NEPA does not take precedence over other authorities in law. Development work in the state highway right of way requires a WSDOT permit or agreement. Normally, this work is coordinated by the region Development Services Office. Mitigation measures may take the following forms:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Channelization such as turn lanes or raised islands Installation of a roundabout or, if necessary, a traffic signal (signal warrant analysis per MUTCD is required) Frontage improvements Donation of right of way Addressing any design or operational deficiencies created by the proposal Possible restrictions of turning movements Sight distance enhancements Traffic mitigation payment (pro rata share contribution) to a programmed WSDOT project (consult Chapter 1130) Satisfaction of local agency guidelines and interlocal agreements

321.01 Sustainable Safety Related Policy The Washington State Strategic Highway Safety Plan, “Target Zero” has a vision to reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries to zero by 2030. WSDOT is pursuing this goal along with partners such as Washington State Patrol (WSP) and Washington Traffic Safety Commission (WTSC). WSDOT recognizes that risk exists in all modes of transportation. The universal objective is to reduce the number of fatal and serious injury crashes within the limits of available resources, science, technology, and legislatively mandated priorities. The Secretary’s Executive Order E 1085, Sustainable Highway Safety Program, sets the policy for the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) to embark on a targeted and scientifically-based Engineering approach for identifying and addressing crash risks that is multimodal and coordinated with the other three “E”s, Education, Enforcement, and Emergency Services. Sustainable Safety employs a “5th E”, Evaluation, this is the analysis and diagnosis of crashes and to target their contributing factors in addressing highway safety performance. Evaluation relies on quantifying safety performance using scientific tools and assessment techniques to determine appropriate safety countermeasures. Practical Solutions is an approach to making project decisions that focus on resolving the project need for the least cost without adversely impacting safety performance. Sustainable Safety is the approach for resolving safety performance within WSDOT’s Practical Solutions as directed in Secretary’s Executive Order E 1090, Moving Washington Forward: Practical Solutions. E 1085 directs engineers to base project-level decisions on safety analysis of specific locations and corridors and focus on proven lower-cost targeted countermeasures at specific locations that optimize the return on investment of safety dollars. These lower-cost investments allow for additional identified locations to be addressed. Sustainable Safety is therefore an essential part of successful Practical Design implementation. It provides the process and methods to incorporate safety performance assessment and peer-review into Performance-Based Practical Design. Sustainable Safety allows the planner, engineer, and decision maker, to identify and quantify the safety performance of alternatives during project development. Implementing Sustainable Safety improves WSDOT’s effectiveness in reducing the risk of fatal and serious injury crashes statewide. It focuses on the contributing factors and types of crashes through the use of state-of-the-art principles and analytical methods to diagnose, quantify, and predict safety performance. The Sustainable Highway Safety Policy directs WSDOT to use effective and efficient resources, like the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual (HSM) to achieve the goals of the Washington State Strategic Highway Safety Plan: Target Zero. This approach:
•
•
•
•
•
Optimizes the reduction in fatal and serious injury crash potential on Washington’s highways. Provides quantifiable assessment of crash potential. Identifies locations that have a higher potential for crash reduction. Provides reliable and accurate assessment of potential crash reduction benefits. Identifies and deploys solutions with optimal benefit/cost within the WSDOT safety priority programming process or through low cost operational improvements.

Sustainable Safety Analysis
Reduces waste by focusing on design elements that provide a reduction in crash potential. Addresses locations that will result in a higher crash risk reduction potential for a given investment level. Provides an accurate assessment of project and program performance. Provides scientific and engineering tools to continually improve and refine safety analyses.
Sustainable Safety is a critical, integral part of Practical Solutions that supports Washington in reaching its Target Zero goal.
321.02 HQ Safety Technical Group The HQ Safety Technical Group is comprised of experts in safety analysis. The team has several duties including maintaining the Safety Analysis Guide, safety analysis training, review of complex safety analysis, review of Crash Analysis Reports, and approve the use of crash modification factors. The team can also provide assistance to a project office as they conduct safety analysis.
321.03 Project Related Safety Analysis All projects are required to have a safety analysis for Design Approval (see Chapter 300). The safety analysis is intended to be scalable. The Safety Analysis Guide provides direction on the scope and scale of safety analysis for each funding subprogram (i.e. I-1, I-2, P-3) and each document needing a safety analysis (i.e. Design Analyses, Access Revision Reports (ARRs), Intersection Control Evaluations (ICEs)). Contact the HQ Safety Technical Group if your project is not covered by the Safety Analysis Guide or if you have questions regarding how to use the guide.
321.04 Safety Analysis The Safety Analysis Guide contains guidance on the content of stand-alone safety analyses for Design Analyses, Crash Analysis Reports (CAR), ICE, Transportation Management Plans, Road Safety Audits, Environmental Impact Statements, and ARRs. Use the procedures described in the WSDOT Safety Analysis Guide when performing a safety analysis. Contact the HQ Safety Technical Group if you have any questions or need to develop a standalone safety analysis that is not covered in the Safety Analysis Guide.
321.05 Reports and Documentation The CAR, ICE, and Basis of Design (BOD) utilize safety analysis. They are described in the following subsections. For approval requirements, refer to Chapter 300.
321.05(1) Crash Analysis Report A Crash Analysis Report (CAR) is developed during the scoping phase for I-2 Crash Reduction projects and is required for funding to be released. Contact Headquarters Traffic for a copy of the latest version of the CAR template. Projects with an approved CAR may, in some cases, be exempted from the requirement to prepare a Basis of Design (see Chapter 1100.)

Chapter 321
Sustainable Safety Analysis
321.05(2) Intersection Control Evaluation Projects that require an Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) need to do a safety analysis on the alternatives. If a project has a completed CAR, the ICE may reference this CAR. If not, the safety analysis for the ICE should have a scale and scope associated with its funding source as noted in the Safety Analysis Guide.
321.05(3) Basis of Design The Basis of Design (BOD) utilizes metrics and targets in the baseline and contextual needs. If the chosen metric is safety related utilize a safety analysis to determine the potential for crash reduction for various alternatives. The safety analysis may also be used as a component in the Alternative Comparison Table (ACT) to allow easier comparison across alternatives. The scale and scope of a safety analysis for a BOD is associated with its program type and is explained in the Safety Analysis Guide.

400.03(3) After Construction is Complete (a) Complete a post construction survey as described in the Highway Surveying Manual. (b) Have the DNR Completion Report signed and stamped by the appropriate professional in direct charge of the surveying work, then file with DNR as described in Chapter 410.
400.04 Datums A datum is a geometrical quantity (or set of quantities) that serves as a reference, forming the basis for computation of horizontal and vertical control surveys in which the curvature of the earth is considered. Adjusted positions of the datum, described in terms of latitude and longitude, may be transformed into State Plane Coordinates. All engineering work (mapping, planning, design, right of way, and construction) for WSDOT projects is based on a common datum.
400.04(1) Horizontal WAC 332-130-060 states, “The datum for the horizontal control network in Washington shall be NAD83 (1991) [the North American Datum of 1983] as officially adjusted and published by the National Geodetic Survey of the United States Department of Commerce and as established in accordance with Chapter 58.20 RCW. The datum adjustment shall be identified on all documents prepared; i.e., NAD83 (1991).” (See the Highway Surveying Manual for further information.)
400.04(2) Vertical The North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) as defined by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) is the official civilian datum for surveying and mapping activities in the United States. WSDOT has adopted this datum. (See the Highway Surveying Manual for further information.)
400.05 Global Positioning System A Global Positioning System (GPS) uses a constellation of satellites and earth stationed receivers to determine geodetic positions (latitude and longitude) on the surface of the earth. WSDOT personnel use this survey technology. (See the Highway Surveying Manual for more detailed discussions.) GPS technology is changing rapidly. The key point is for the designer and surveyor to select the best tool (GPS or conventional applications) for doing the survey fieldwork. Often, a combination of GPS and conventional (Total Station) surveying is appropriate.
400.06 WSDOT Survey Monument Database The WSDOT Survey Monument Database provides storage and retrieval capabilities for data associated with survey control monuments set by WSDOT. This database supports and tracks the Report of Survey Mark and aids in fulfilling WSDOT’s obligation to contribute to the body of public record, thereby minimizing the duplication of survey work. The Report of Survey Mark provides data on specific GPS stations. (See Exhibit 400-2 for an example of a Report of Survey Mark.) To access the WSDOT Survey Monument Database, see the following website: www.wsdot.wa.gov/monument/

Surveying and Mapping
400.07 Geographic Information System The Geographic Information System (GIS) is a compilation of information from many sources. Its purpose is to assemble data into a central database for the common good. The data is stored on many levels so the desired information can be selected and combined to achieve the desired product. Surveying and photogrammetric data are vital elements of this system.
400.08 Photogrammetric Surveys Photogrammetric surveys are performed to furnish topographic or planimetric maps and cross sections for use in the reconnaissance, location, and preliminary design phases of highway work. To use photogrammetric surveys for final design and construction requires that the ground be nearly bare to obtain the necessary accuracy. By using well-planned aerial photography in stereoscopic plotters, contours and other physical features are delineated on map sheets to a scale consistent with the accuracies or detail required. The usefulness of aerial photography is not limited to mapping. Taking the form of enlargements, mosaics, and digital images, it can be used as a visual communication tool (displays and exhibits) for planning, design, property acquisition, engineering, construction, litigation, and public relations. To obtain information on preparation, procedure, and programming of aerial photography and photogrammetric mapping and applications, contact the HQ GeoMetrix Office. When requesting a photogrammetric survey, specify the desired units and check the units of the product. Allow for the time required to communicate the complex and detailed work request, develop the service, and accomplish the product.
400.09 Documentation For documentation related to monuments, see Chapter 410. Primary and secondary survey control data are archived in the WSDOT Survey Monument Database and GIS when available. For the list of documents required to be preserved in the Design Documentation Package and the Project File, see the Design Documentation Checklist: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/designtools-and-support

410.01 General Proper monumentation is important in referencing a highway’s alignment, which is used to define its right of way. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) can contribute to the body of public records and minimize duplication of survey work by establishing and recording monuments that are tied to a state plane coordinate system and to a standard vertical datum. WSDOT is required by law to perpetuate existing recorded monuments (Chapter 58.09 RCW). The department provides monuments for realignments and new highway alignments and perpetuates existing monuments impacted by a project. The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) is designated as the official agency for surveys and maps. New monuments set to establish property corners, highway alignment, and so on, shall be recorded on a Record of Survey or Monumentation Map and filed with the DNR Public Land Survey Office and the appropriate county auditor or county engineer. Records of Survey and Monumentation Maps are retained at DNR. Geodetic monuments are established and the Headquarters (HQ) GeoMetrix Office retains their placement records. Geodetic monuments are recorded on a Report of Survey Mark. These records are made available to the public on the following website: www.wsdot.wa.gov/monument/ Existing monuments are not to be disturbed without first obtaining the DNR permits required by state law. DNR allows the temporary covering of a string of monuments under a single permit. State law requires replacement of land boundary monuments after temporary removal according to permit procedures. WSDOT control and alignment monuments may not be removed without replacement unless the location of the original position is perpetuated by reference and the appropriate document(s) prepared and filed with the county and the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. Other requirements pertaining to specific monuments are discussed below. Exhibit 410-1 summarizes the documentation requirements for new and existing monuments. The region is responsible for identifying and locating existing monuments, obtaining required permits before any existing monument is disturbed, and conducting the research to locate existing monuments as required by WAC 332-120-030, as follows: Any person, corporation, association, department, or subdivision of the state, county or municipality responsible for an activity that may cause a survey monument to be removed or destroyed shall be responsible for ensuring that the original survey point is perpetuated. It shall be the responsibility of the governmental agency or others performing construction work or other activity (including road or street resurfacing projects) to adequately search the records and the physical area of the proposed construction work or other activity for the purpose of locating and referencing any known or existing survey monuments.

410.03 Control Monuments Horizontal and vertical control monuments are permanent references required for the establishment of project coordinates tied to the Washington State plane system and elevations tied to a standard vertical datum. By establishing and recording permanent control monuments, WSDOT eliminates duplication of survey work and contributes to the body of public records. Provide the horizontal and vertical control monuments for highway projects that require the location of existing or proposed alignment or right of way limits. Monuments set by other agencies may be used if within 1 mile of the project and where the required datum and accuracy were used. When control monuments are required for a given project, show the existing and proposed control monuments on the contract plans. For horizontal control:
•
•
•
•
•
Use North American Datum 1983, revised 1991 (NAD83/91). Use a minimum of second order, Class II procedures as defined in the Highway Surveying Manual. Provide two monuments near the beginning of the project. Where possible, when setting horizontal control, set points to act as azimuth points. Place points so that line of sight is preserved between them and in an area that will not be disturbed by construction. Provide two monuments near the end of the project. Provide a pair of monuments at about 3-mile intervals throughout the length of the project.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 410-2
Chapter 410
Monumentation
For vertical control:
•
•
•
Use North American Vertical Datum 1988 (NAVD88). (See the Highway Surveying Manual for orders of accuracy required.) Use at least second order procedures for primary vertical control within project limits as defined in the Highway Surveying Manual. Use third order for secondary control throughout the project. Provide vertical control throughout the length of the project. Desirable spacing is at or near each milepost. Maximum spacing is 3 miles apart.
All control monuments that are established, reestablished, or reset must be filed with the county engineer and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR). Submit a Record of Survey or a Monumentation Map that has been signed by the supervising, licensed, professional engineer or licensed, professional land survey. If the monument is not used to reference right of way or land corners, submit a Report of Survey Mark. (See the Highway Surveying Manual for more detailed guidance on Control Monuments.)
410.04 Alignment Monuments Alignment monuments are permanent references required for the establishment or reestablishment of the highway and its right of way. Placing monuments at random points, in safe locations and tied to the Washington State plane coordinate system is recommended (see the Highway Surveying Manual). Establishment, reestablishment, or resetting of alignment monuments is required on the following highway projects:
•
•
•
New highway alignment projects. Highway realignment projects involving new right of way (monuments are only required for the realigned highway section). Highway projects where alignment monuments already exist.
Before an existing alignment monument is reestablished or reset, a DNR permit is required. All alignment monuments that are established, reestablished, or reset must be filed with the appropriate county auditor or county engineer. The Record of Survey is filed with the county auditor in the county in which the monument is located, and a recorded copy is sent to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. The original Monumentation Map is filed with the county engineer of the county in which the monument is located, and a recorded copy, with the filing signatures, is sent to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. The HQ Right of Way Plans Section will forward a copy to DNR for its records.
410.05 Property Corners A new property corner monument will be provided where an existing recorded monument, or an unrecorded monument set by a professional land surveyor (PLS) prior to the Recording Act of 1973 (RCW 58.09), has been invalidated as a direct result of a right of way purchase by the department. The property corner monument will be set on the new right of way line or at a point in reference thereto. Property corner monuments may also be set at the location of new acquisitions such as wetlands or stormwater mitigation sites or properties shown on Sundry Site Plans. The new property corner monument shall be set by or under the direct supervision of a licensed PLS. When any property corner monument is set, the licensed land surveyor shall file a Record of Survey with the county auditor. A copy of the recorded Record of Survey is sent to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section and HQ Real Estate Services.

Monumentation
410.06 Other Monuments A DNR permit is required before any monument may be removed or destroyed. Existing section corners and BLM or GLO monuments impacted by a project shall be reset to perpetuate their existence. After completing the work, a DNR Land Corner Record is required. Other permanent monuments established by any other governmental agency must not be disturbed until the agency has been contacted to determine specific requirements for the monument. If assistance is needed to identify a monument, contact the HQ GeoMetrix Office. Resetting monuments must be done by or under the direct supervision of a licensed professional engineer or a licensed professional land surveyor. If a Record of Survey is prepared, it will be filed with the county auditor in the county in which the monument is located. If a Monumentation Map is prepared, it is filed with the county engineer in the county in which the monument is located, and a recorded copy is sent to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. The HQ Right of Way Plans Section will forward a copy to DNR for its records.
410.07 Filing Requirements 410.07(1) DNR Permit When a DNR permit is required, use the application form shown in Exhibit 410-2. The completed application must be signed by a licensed professional engineer or a licensed professional land surveyor and submitted to DNR. The DNR permit applications can be downloaded in TIFF, PDF, or Word format at the following website: https://www.dnr.wa.gov/public-land-survey-office Monumentation work cannot be done until DNR has approved the permit. In extraordinary circumstances, verbal authorization may be granted by DNR pending the issuance of a written permit. After resetting the monument, the survey method used must be filed with DNR using the completion report form shown in Exhibit 410-3. The form is to be signed by a licensed professional engineer or a licensed professional land surveyor.
410.07(2) Monumentation Map When a Monumentation Map is required, a plan sheet is prepared. Generally, the plan sheet is based on a right of way plan obtained from the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. A Monumentation Map contains a description of all new and existing monuments indicating their kind, size, and location. In addition, it must contain the seal and signature of a licensed professional engineer or a licensed professional land surveyor (see the Plans Preparation Manual). A copy of a Monumentation Map is filed with the county engineer in the county in which the monument is located, and a recorded copy is sent to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. The HQ Right of Way Plans Section will forward a copy to DNR for its records.
410.07(3) Land Corner Record When a Land Corner Record is required, use the forms shown in Exhibit 410-4. The completed forms are to be signed and stamped by a licensed professional engineer or a licensed professional land surveyor and submitted to the county auditor for the county in which the monument is located.

510.01 General Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Real Estate Services personnel participate in the project definition phase of a project to assist in minimizing right of way costs, defining route locations and acquisition areas, and determining potential problems and possible solutions. Due to the variables in land acquisition, the categories of right of way costs considered in the project definition phase are:
•
•
•
Purchase costs (acquisition compensation). Relocation assistance benefits payments. Other Real Estate Services staff expenses (acquisition services, relocation services, and interim property management services).
Right of way cost estimates are made by Real Estate Services specialists. When the parcels from which additional right of way will be acquired are known, title reports (including assessors’ land areas) can be requested. Real Estate Services personnel also make project field inspections at appropriate times throughout the development of a project to ensure adequate consideration is given to significant right of way elements involved (including possible social, economic, and environmental effects) in accordance with the Right of Way Manual. During plan development:
•
•
•
•
•
Title reports are examined for easements or other encumbrances that would reveal the existence and location of water lines, conduits, drainage or irrigation lines, and so on, that must be provided for in construction. Easements that indicate other affected ownerships are added to the right of way and limited access plan. Arrangements are made to obtain utility, railroad, haul road, detour routes, or other essential agreements, as instructed in the Utilities Manual and the Agreements Manual (Consultants: Please contact your WSDOT Project Manager for access to the Agreements Manual). Right of way acquisition, disposal, and maintenance are planned. Easements and permits are planned (to accommodate activities outside of the right of way).
Engineering considerations for right of way are contained in many chapters in this manual. Examples include chapters in the 700 series related to bridges and walls and in Chapter 1230. (See Chapter 1102 as a recommended first read for discussion of right of way.) Preliminary right of way widths are developed and may be modified based on Real Estate Services’ input, but cannot be moved to coincide with property boundaries in anticipation of a total take. Jogs in the final widths of the right of way are held to a minimum. (See Right of Way Manual, Chapter 6, for discussion of remainders.)

All acquisition documents are processed through Headquarters (HQ) Real Estate Services except temporary permits that are not shown on right of way plans and are not needed for the project (such as for driveway connections).
510.01(1) Environmental Site Assessments (New Section 2023) Environmental site assessments are required before acquisition of real property required for transportation purposes can be accomplished. These assessments are described in Chapter 447 of the Environmental Manual and occur in different scales and levels of detail, starting with the lowest level of detail with 1) transaction screening, then moving to 2) Phase I Environmental Site Assessment, and 3) Phase II Environmental Site Assessment. The sequence and timing of these assessments is related to the type of property and/or property rights to be acquired and project activities envisioned, and state of progress in design. At a minimum, a project footprint needs to be established in order to estimate the scope of property acquisitions that are involved. Once a decision is made to acquire a permanent interest in a property, or to acquire a temporary interest where ground or water disturbance is anticipated as a result of project related actions, perform a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment and determine whether there is a finding of concern. In the case of a temporary acquisition in which there is no ground or water disturbance anticipated, perform a transaction screening instead. If an assessment does not result in a finding of concern, then the project may proceed to acquire the property and/or property rights. If any assessment results in a finding of concern, then perform the next level of environmental assessment (either Phase I or Phase II). When a Phase II Environmental Site Assessment is performed, and one of the results is that contamination is found, consult with the appropriate representatives from the Environmental Services Office, and Real Estate Services Office to do a risk assessment to fully understand the impact and consequences to the project from acquiring the property and/or property rights and available alternatives. The Environmental Services Office and Real Estate Services Office will consult with Attorney General’s Office as needed. Any decision to acquire the property and/or property rights after contamination is found is made by the Assistant Region Administrator.
510.02 Special Features 510.02(1) Road Approaches On managed access highways, the department will reconstruct legally existing road approaches that are removed or destroyed as part of the highway construction. New approaches required by new highway construction are negotiated by the region with the approval of the Regional Administrator. The negotiator coordinates with the region’s design section to ensure new approaches conform to the requirements of Chapter 1340 for road approaches. All new approaches will be by permit through the appropriate region office. On limited access highways, road approaches of any type must be approved by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, before there is legal basis for negotiation by Real Estate Services. When approved, approaches will be specifically reserved in the right of way transaction and will contain the identical limitations set by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, and as shown on the approved right of way and limited access plan.

Right of Way Considerations
510.02(2) Cattle Passes The desirability of or need for a cattle pass will be considered during the appraisal or negotiation process. A cattle pass will be approved only after complete studies of location, utilization, cost, and safety elements have proved its necessity. Upon approval, such an improvement and appurtenant rights will be established. Future right of access for maintenance is negotiated during acquisition. On limited access highways, approval by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, and the addition of a traffic movement note on the right of way and limited access plan (see the Plans Preparation Manual) are required.
510.02(3) Pit, Stockpile, and Waste Sites These sites are investigated and planned as outlined in the Plans Preparation Manual. Detour and haul road agreements, approved by the Regional Administrator, are necessary when the state proposes to use city streets or county roads for the purpose of detouring traffic or hauling certain materials. (See the Utilities Manual for detour and haul road agreement guidelines.)
510.02(4) International Boundaries Construction proposed “within a 20-foot strip, 10 feet on each side of the international boundary,” must be coordinated between the department and the British Columbia Ministry of Highways and Public Works. Permission of the International Boundary Commission is required to work “within 10 feet of an international boundary.” Their primary concern is monumentation of the boundary line and the line of sight between monuments. The Commission requires a written request stating what, when, and why construction will be done, sent to: International Boundary Commission United States and Canada 2000 L Street NW, Suite 615 Washington, DC 20036 (www.internationalboundarycommission.org)
510.03 Easements and Permits 510.03(1) General If others request rights within existing WSDOT ownership, they are to contact the region Real Estate Services Office. Easements and permits to accommodate WSDOT activities outside the right of way usually fall into one of the categories defined below. Easements and permits are processed in accordance with the requirements of the Right of Way Manual. The region Real Estate Services Office drafts the legal descriptions for all easements and permits for acquisition of property and property rights. HQ Real Estate Services drafts the legal description for all easements and permits for disposition of property or property rights. The region Real Estate Services Office either obtains or assists in obtaining easements and permits. The region is responsible for compliance with and appropriate retention of the final documents. Records of permanent property rights acquired are maintained by HQ Real Estate Services. Easements and permits are to be shown on the contract plans in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual.

Right of Way Considerations
510.03(2) Perpetual Easements Perpetual easements are shown on the right of way plans in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual.
510.03(2)(a) State Maintenance Easement Used when the state is to construct a facility and provide all maintenance. Examples are slope and drainage easements.
510.03(2)(b) Dual Maintenance Easement Used when the state is to construct and maintain a facility and the owner is to maintain the remainder. Examples include the surface area above a tunnel and the area behind a retaining wall or noise wall.
510.03(2)(c) Transfer Easement On occasion an easement must be acquired for transfer to another party. In these cases, contact the region Real Estate Services Office for early involvement. The right of way and limited access plan is modified to identify the party to whom the easement will be transferred. The department cannot obtain easements for transfer across lands under the jurisdiction of the Department of Natural Resources, and WSDOT cannot condemn for a transfer easement.
510.03(3) Temporary Easements Temporary easements are used when the state requires a temporary property right that involves either more than minor work or construction activities on privately owned property. In the cases where the rights required or the work to be performed is not beneficial to the property owner, just compensation must be paid. When WSDOT is paying for the rights or when the encroachment is significant, temporary easements are shown on the right of way plans, in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual. Consult the region Plans and Real Estate Services personnel for exceptions. If the easement is not mapped, mark and submit plans according to the following information.
•
•
•
•
•
•
The region provides a right of way plan with the required temporary easement(s) delineated in red to the region Real Estate Services Office. These plan sheets provide: Ownership boundaries. Confirmation of ownership and parcel boundaries may be completed by a search of county records and mapping; a formal title report is required for temporary easements. A parcel number assigned to each ownership. Sufficient engineering detail to write legal descriptions. A statement of the intended use of each temporary easement area. In limited access areas, contact the HQ Access and Hearings Office.
510.03(4) Construction Permits Construction permits are used for temporary rights during construction. They are not used when WSDOT needs a perpetual right. A construction permit is only valid with the current owner and must be renegotiated if property ownership changes before construction begins. For private ownerships, a temporary construction easement is recommended. A construction permit is recommended for rights of entry to publicly owned property. Local agencies might require the use of specific forms when applying for these rights of entry. Regardless of the form or its name, the region is responsible for appropriate central storage of the original document.

Right of Way Considerations
When there is a benefit to the property owner (for example, driveway or parking lot approach improvements) the construction permit is usually obtained without the payment of compensation (for example, donation or mutual benefits). Consult the region Plans and Real Estate Services offices for exceptions.
510.04 Programming for Funds For plan development, the phases in Exhibit 510-1 apply to the authorization of stage programming. When federal funds are involved, special attention must be given to Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) requirements. When federal participation in right of way costs is anticipated, specific authorization must be obtained from the FHWA. The rules and procedures provided in RCW 8.26, WAC 468-100, and the Right of Way Manual must be followed to ensure federal and state participation. In many cases, federal funds are contingent upon the department setting up a relocation advisory procedure for any owner or tenant who is displaced by a project and desires such assistance. Relocation advisory assistance is a function of HQ Real Estate Services.
510.05 Appraisal and Acquisition 510.05(1) All Highways Exhibit 510-1 shows plan development phases for both limited access highways and managed access highways; thus, it applies to the authorization of right of way acquisition for all state highways.
510.05(2) Exceptions Exceptions can be made to the requirements in Exhibit 510-1 if unusual hardships result for the individual or the state. The approval of right of way hardship action will be based on the individual parcel merit and is processed in accordance with hardship acquisition policy (see the Right of Way Manual).
510.06 Transactions 510.06(1) Private Ownerships Right of way is ordinarily acquired from private property owners by region-level negotiation between the owner and the right of way agent.
510.06(2) Utilities The region determines the ownership of all utilities and makes arrangements for necessary adjustment, including relocation of portions of the utility, if necessary. Provisions for relocation or adjustment are included in the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) when:
•
•
The items are normal construction items and the department is obligated for the moving expense. The utility requests that relocation be performed by the department and the department has approved the request.
Readjustment may require WSDOT to purchase substitute rights of way or easements for eventual transfer to the utility. Such rights of way or easements must be shown on the right of way plans with the same engineering detail as highway right of way. On limited access highways, if an approach is required for maintenance of a utility, the approach will be shown on the approach schedule. (See the Utilities Accommodation Policy regarding location of and access to utilities.) Negotiations with the utilities are often done by HQ Real Estate Services.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 510-5
Chapter 510
Right of Way Considerations
Because of the considerable time required to obtain approvals, processing of utility relocation agreements must begin as soon as possible.
510.06(3) Railways Right of way is generally not acquired in fee from a railroad company. Instead, the state acquires a perpetual easement for encroachment or crossing. A construction and maintenance agreement may also be required. The easement must be shown on the right of way plan and identified by both highway and railroad stationing. The HQ Design Office coordinates with the railroad design staff to determine a mutually agreeable location before the proposed easement is sent to Real Estate Services. The negotiations with the railroads are generally done by HQ Real Estate Services. Because of the considerable time required to obtain approvals, processing of railroad agreements must begin as soon as possible. The perpetual easement document is executed by the Real Estate Services Director.
510.06(4) Federal Agencies Acquisition of right of way from most federal agencies must be negotiated and processed through several federal offices. Allow at least one year for efficient and economical right of way acquisition. Depending upon the particular federal agency involved, special exhibit maps and other documentation may be required, and the right of way may be acquired as an easement rather than in fee. The negotiations with the federal agencies are generally done by HQ Real Estate Services.
510.06(5) Other State Agencies Acquisition from other state agencies must be negotiated and processed through the individual agencies or designees. Negotiations with other state agencies are generally handled by HQ Real Estate Services. As in the case of federal agencies, substantial time must be allowed for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations peculiar to the agency before right of way will be granted.
510.06(6) Condemnations Condemnation can result from a disagreement between the department and the owner regarding a fair settlement or a faulty title. Since several months might elapse between the filing of a condemnation case and a court decision, the region Real Estate Services Office can be requested to investigate the possibility of obtaining a negotiated possession and use agreement as in the case of an emergency project or when a sundry site is required immediately.

Access Control Exhibit 520-1 Access Control Vocabulary
520.01 General The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) controls access to the state’s highways (with a few exceptions) in order to preserve the safety and efficiency of these highways as well as the public investment. All Washington State highways are distinguished as being either limited access or managed access highways. Control of access is accomplished by either acquiring rights of access from abutting property owners (limited access control) or by regulating access connections to the highway (managed access control). Until limited access rights have been acquired from abutting property owners, the route is a managed access highway. Managed access permits are issued either by a local authority (city or town) or by WSDOT. Numerous studies have shown that controlling and limiting access to highways is a cost-effective way to help maintain the safety, capacity, and functional integrity of a highway. Adding more lanes to an existing highway is expensive and frequently not possible. Controlling access to our state highways by promoting the use of frontage roads or other existing county or city roads, and advocating the internal shared circulation within adjacent developments, is a proactive and cost-effective way to accomplish this objective. WSDOT has been purchasing access rights and implementing limited access control since 1951 (RCW 47.52). While this has been effective, it is an expensive way to control access to the state highway system. Adequate funding to accomplish the purchasing of access rights has not kept up with the state’s continual population growth and land use development over the years. As a result, state lawmakers introduced a bill in the early 1990s recognizing that controlling access to the state highway system by regulation was a cost-effective means to preserve the safety and capacity of our state highway system. In 1991, the Legislature passed and the Governor approved RCW 47.50, titled “Highway access management.” This new law directed WSDOT to develop new rules to be included in the Washington Administrative Code for those state highways not already limited access highways. The result was a new class of access control called managed access. Chapter 530 describes limited access highways in greater detail. Chapter 540 describes managed access highways in greater detail. The following references and definitions apply to Washington’s access control as presented in Chapter 530 and Chapter 540.

Access Control
520.03 Definitions Access: A means of entering or leaving a public road, street, or highway with respect to abutting property or another public road, street, or highway. Access Control: The limiting and regulating of public and private access to Washington State’s highways, as required by state law. Access Control Tracking System Limited Access and Managed Access Master Plan: A database list, related to highway route numbers and mileposts, that identifies either the level of limited access or the class of managed access: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-access-requests-training Access Connection: See Approach and Access Connection. Access Connection Permit: A written authorization issued by the permitting authority for a specifically designed access connection to a managed access highway at a specific location; for a specific type and intensity of property use; and for a specific volume of traffic for the access connection based on the final stage of the development of the applicant’s property. The actual form used for this authorization is determined by the permitting authority. Access Design Analysis: A design analysis (see Chapter 300) that authorizes deferring or staging acquisition of limited access control, falling short of a 300-foot requirement, or allowing an existing access point to stay within 130 feet of an intersection on a limited access highway. Approval by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, is required (see Chapter 530). Access Hearing Plan: A limited access plan prepared for presentation at an access hearing. Access Point: Any point that allows private or public entrance to or exit from the traveled way of a state highway, including “locked gate” access and maintenance access points. Access Point Spacing: On a managed access highway, the distance between two adjacent access points on one side of the highway, measured along the edge of the traveled way from one access point to the next (see also corner clearance). Access Report Plan: A limited access plan prepared for presentation to local governmental officials at preliminary meetings before preparation of the access hearing plan. Access Rights: Property rights that allow an abutting property owner to enter and leave the public roadway system. Allowed: Authorized. Application for an Access Connection: An application provided by the permitting authority to be completed by the applicant for access to a managed access highway. Approach and Access Connection: These terms are listed under the specific access section to which they apply. The first section below is for limited access highways and uses the term approach. The second section below is for managed access highways and uses the term access connection. Approaches and access connections include any ability to leave or enter a highway right of way other than at an intersection with another road or street. (a) Limited Access Highways: Approach: An access point, other than a public road/street, that allows access to or from a limited access highway on the state highway system. There are five types of approaches to limited access highways that are allowed:
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 520
•
•
•
•
•
•
Access Control
Type A An off and on approach in a legal manner, not to exceed 30 feet in width, for the sole purpose of serving a single-family residence. It may be reserved by the abutting owner for specified use at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed on partial and modified control limited access highways. Type B An off and on approach in a legal manner, not to exceed 50 feet in width, for use necessary to the normal operation of a farm, but not for retail marketing. It may be reserved by the abutting owner for specified use at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed on partial and modified control limited access highways. This approach type may be used for wind farms when use of the approach is limited to those vehicles necessary to construct and maintain the farm for use in harvesting wind energy. Type C An off and on approach in a legal manner, for a special purpose and width to be agreed upon. It may be specified at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed on partial and modified control limited access highways and on full control limited access highways where no other reasonable means of access exists, as solely determined by the department. Type D An off and on approach in a legal manner, not to exceed 50 feet in width, for use necessary to the normal operation of a commercial establishment. It may be specified at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed only on modified control limited access highways. Type E This type is no longer allowed to be constructed because of the requirements that there be only one access point per parcel on a limited access state highway. Type F An off and on approach in a legal manner, not to exceed 30 feet in width, for the sole purpose of serving a wireless communication site. It may be specified at a point satisfactory to the state at or between designated highway stations. This approach type is allowed only on partial control limited access highways. (See WAC 468-58-080(vi) for further restrictions.)
(b) Managed Access Highways: Access Connection: An access point, other than a public road/ street, that permits access to or from a managed access highway on the state highway system. There are five types of access connection permits:
•
•
•
•
•
Conforming Access Connection: A connection to a managed access highway that meets current WAC and WSDOT location, spacing, and design criteria. Grandfathered Access Connection: Any connection to the state highway system that was in existence and in active use on July 1, 1990, and has not had a significant change in use. Joint-use Access Connection: A single connection to a managed access highway that serves two or more properties. Nonconforming Access Connection: A connection to a managed access highway that does not meet current WSDOT location, spacing, or design criteria, pending availability of a future conforming access connection. Variance Access Connection: A connection to a managed access highway at a location not normally allowed by current WSDOT criteria.
(c) Managed Access Connection Category: There are four access connection permit categories for managed access connections to state highways: Category I, Category II, Category III, and Category IV (see Chapter 540).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Access Control
Annual Daily Traffic (ADT): The volume of traffic passing a point or segment of a highway, in both directions, during a period of time, divided by the number of days in the period, and factored to represent an estimate of traffic volume for an average day of the year. Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT): The average volume of traffic passing a point or segment of a highway, in both directions, during a year. Average Weekday Vehicle Trip Ends (AWDVTE): The estimated total of all trips entering plus all trips leaving the applicant’s site based on the final stage of proposed development. Connection: See approach and access connection. Contiguous Parcels: Two or more pieces of real property, under the same ownership, with one or more boundaries that touch and have similarity of use. Corner Clearance: On a managed access highway, the distance from an intersection of a public road or street to the nearest access connection along the same side of the highway. The minimum corner clearance distance (see Chapter 540, Exhibit 540-2 ) is measured from the closest edge of the intersecting road or street to the closest edge of the traveled way of the access connection, measured along one side of the traveled way (through lanes) (see also access point spacing). DHV: Design hourly volume. E&EP: WSDOT’s Environmental and Engineering Programs Division. Easement: A documented right, as a right of way, to use the property of another for designated purposes. Findings and Order (F&O): A legal package containing information based on the hearing record from a limited access hearing (see Chapter 210 and Chapter 530). Findings and Order (F&O) Plan: A limited access plan, prepared after a limited access hearing, which is based on the hearing record. HQ: WSDOT’s Headquarters in Olympia. Intersection: An at-grade access point connecting a state highway with a road or street duly established as a public road or public street by the local governmental entity. Limited Access: Full, partial, or modified access control is planned and established for each corridor and then acquired as the right to limit access to each individual parcel.
•
•
•
Planned Limited Access Control: Limited access control is planned for some time in the future; however, no access hearing has been held. Established Limited Access Control: An access hearing has been held and the Assistant Secretary, Environmental and Engineering & Regional Operations Programs Director, has adopted the findings and order, which establishes the limits and level of control. Acquired Limited Access Control: Access rights have been purchased.

Access Control
Limited Access Highway: All highways listed as “Established L/A” on the Limited Access and Managed Access Master Plan (see below) and where the rights of direct access to or from abutting lands have been acquired from the abutting landowners.
•
•
•
Full Access Control: This most restrictive level of limited access provides access, using interchanges, for selected public roads/streets only, and prohibits highway intersections at grade. Partial Access Control: The second most restrictive level of limited access. At grade intersections with selected public roads are allowed, and there may be some crossings and some driveway approaches at grade. Direct commercial access is not allowed. Modified Access Control: The least restrictive level of limited access. Characteristics are the same as for partial access control except that direct commercial access is allowed.
Limited Access and Managed Access Master Plan: A map of Washington State that shows established and planned limited access highways: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-access-requests-training Managed Access Highway: Any highway not listed as “Established L/A” on the Limited Access and Managed Access Master Plan and any highway or portion of a highway designated on the plan as “Established L/A” until such time as the limited access rights are acquired. Under managed access legislation, the property owner’s access rights are regulated through an access connection permitting process. Median: The portion of a divided highway separating vehicular traffic traveling in opposite directions. Median Opening: An opening in a continuous median for the specific purpose of allowing vehicle movement. MOU: Memorandum of Understanding. There is one MOU (Highways Over National Forest Lands) between the United States Forest Service (USFS) and WSDOT that requires the USFS to obtain a road approach permit for new access to a state highway that is crossing Forest Service land. Permit Holder: The abutting property owner or other legally authorized person to whom an access connection permit is issued by the permitting authority. Permitted Access Connection: A connection for which an access connection permit has been issued by a permitting authority. Permitting Authority: The agency that has legal authority to issue managed access connection permits. For access connections in unincorporated areas, the permitting authority is WSDOT; for access connections within corporate limits, the permitting authority is a city or town. Right of Way (R/W): A general term denoting land or interest therein, acquired for or designated for transportation purposes. More specifically, lands that have been dedicated for public transportation purposes or land in which WSDOT, a county, or a municipality owns the fee simple title, has an easement devoted to or required for use as a public road/street and appurtenant facilities, or has established ownership by prescriptive right. Right of way and Limited Access Plan (R/W and L/A plan): A right of way plan that also shows limited access control details. Road Approach: A road or driveway built to provide private access to or from the state highway system. Shoulder: The portion of the highway contiguous with the traveled lanes for the accommodation of stopped vehicles for emergency use and, where allowed, for bicycles (see Chapter 530). State Highway System: All roads, streets, and highways designated as state routes in compliance with RCW 47.17.

520.04 Vocabulary The entries shown in Exhibit 520-1 are examples of suitable wording for the distinctly different types of access control in Chapter 530 and Chapter 540. These entries demonstrate the difference in terminology between limited access and managed access in the applicable WACs. For instance, there is nothing about permit, connection, category, or class in the limited access vocabulary and, likewise, nothing about approach or type in the managed access vocabulary. Also note that Chapter 1340 uses road approach, access, and driveway in a generic way, unrelated to WAC legal terminology, and makes no distinction related to access control.

530.01 General Limited access control is established to preserve the safety performance and efficiency of specific highways for all modes and to preserve the public investment. Limited access control is achieved by acquiring rights of direct access to or from abutting property owners and by selectively limiting a right of access, to a highway, considering all modes in the control and treatment of access. (For an overview of access control and the references list and definitions of terminology for this chapter, see Chapter 520, Access Control.) Requirements for the establishment of limited access highways are set forth in the Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 47.52. The type of access control applied to a location is considered a design control (see Chapter 1103), and is determined during planning, scoping, or the early stages of design in conformance with this chapter. Highways controlled by acquiring rights of direct access to or from abutting property and by selectively limiting a right of access are termed limited access highways and are further distinguished as having full, partial, or modified control. The title to the right of way for limited access facilities vests in the state (pursuant to RCW 47.52.210). The number of access points per mile, the spacing of interchanges or intersections, and the location of frontage roads or local road/street/ shared-use path approaches are determined by the:

Functional classification and importance of the highway Context-based modal priorities and relevant considerations Character of the traffic Current adjacent land use and future planned changes to land use Environment and aesthetics Highway design, operation, safety, and connectivity for all modes Economic considerations involved
530.02 Achieving Limited Access 530.02(1) Evaluation The benefits of maintaining or acquiring full, partial, or modified control are to be evaluated during project development if the route is shown in the Access Control Tracking System Limited Access and Managed Access Master Plan database as either “established” or “planned” for limited access. It is generally known that full limited access control applies to interstates and freeways. However, state highways that do not fall under full access control may have more flexibility in the type of control applied (whether limited or managed control). These highways can benefit by having access control evaluations conducted early in planning and project development.

Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
The cost of acquiring limited access is evaluated to determine whether those costs will be included in the project. The evaluation includes the societal costs of crashes, current and future land use development, and the improved level of service for motor vehicle traffic of limited access highways. Use the Basis of Design documentation tool to summarize key results of the evaluation process, considering connectivity, mobility, safety and accessibility for all modes. (See chapters in the 1100 series for more information on using the Basis of Design tool.)
530.02(2) Process All Washington State highways are managed access highways (see Chapter 540), except where limited access rights have been acquired. The right of way and limited access plans for routes show the acquired limited access boundaries. This is further represented in the Access Control Tracking System, a database that identifies the status and type of access control for all state highways. The database lists the specific types of limited access control (full, partial, or modified) and identifies whether the control is planned, established, or acquired for a specific route segment. If limited access has not been acquired, the database reports the type of managed access classification that currently applies. The existing access classification is periodically updated to reflect changes on a corridor segment. The planned limited access reflects the vision for access on a corridor by resolution from the Washington Transportation Commission in the 1960s and 1970s. Conditions may have changed since the plan for limited access was envisioned. It is important to re-evaluate this plan and determine the access design control most appropriate for the agreed context. (See Chapter 1102 and Chapter 1103 for context and design control guidance, respectively.) For help determining the status of limited access control for any state highway, consult the Headquarters (HQ) Access and Hearings Section. The Access Master Plan database is available at: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-accessrequests-training

Limited Access Control
530.02(2)(a) Procedure for Limited Access Control Use the following procedure to achieve limited access control: 1. The Secretary of Transportation (or a designee) first identifies a highway as “Planned for Limited Access.” 2. To establish or revise limited access on a new or existing highway, either a limited access hearing is held or waivers are obtained. (See Chapter 210 regarding hearings, and Chapter 510 for the phases of appraisal and acquisition.) a. Phase 1 The region develops a limited access report and a limited access report plan for department approval and presentation to local officials. The plan notes the level of limited access proposed to be established. b. Phase 2 The region develops a limited access hearing plan for Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division (or designee), approval and for presentation at the hearing. c. Phase 3 After the hearing, the region develops the findings and order and revises the limited access hearing plan to become the findings and order plan (see Chapter 210). The findings and order is processed and sent to the HQ Access and Hearings Section for review and approval. The Assistant Secretary, Regions and Mega Programs/Chief Engineer, adopts the findings and order and thus establishes the limits and level of limited access control to be acquired. d. Phase 4 The findings and order plan is now revised by the HQ Right of Way Plans Section for approval by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division (or designee), as a Phase 4 final right of way and limited access plan. 3. Real Estate Services acquires limited access rights from individual property owners based on final design decisions and updates the right of way and limited access plans and the property deed. 4. These highways or portions thereof are now limited access highways and no longer fall under the managed access program.
530.02(3) Access Report The Access Report (RCW 47.52.131) is developed by the region to legally inform local governmental officials of the proposed limited access highway and the principal access features involved, and to secure their approval. This report is not furnished to abutting property owners. Submit the report to the HQ Access and Hearings Section for review and approval prior to submission to local authorities. Including local agencies as stakeholders from the onset of the project helps establish project expectations and positive working relationships, making reviews and approvals run as smoothly as possible.

530.02(3)(a) Access Report Content The Access Report consists of the following: 1. A description of the existing and proposed highways, including data on the history of the existing highway, which may include references to safety analyses and also locations identified in WSDOT’s priority programming process. 2. Traffic analyses pertaining to the proposed highway, including available information about current and potential future motor vehicle, pedestrian, bicyclist, transit, and freight traffic volumes on county roads and city streets crossing or severed by the proposed highway and reference sources such as origin-destination surveys. Traffic data, together with counts of existing traffic available from state or local records, is normally adequate for motor vehicle analysis. Special counts of existing traffic are obtained only if circumstances indicate that the available data is inadequate or outdated. Data for pedestrian and bicyclist traffic may rely on demographics, land-use context, and an analysis of the active transportation network where volume information is not available. 3. A discussion of factors affecting the design of the subject highway, including:

Limited Access Control
The limited access report plan shows the effects of the proposed highway on the street and road system, transit service and pedestrian/bicyclist network by delineating the points of public access. (See the Plans Preparation Manual for a list of the minimum details to be shown on the plan and for a sample plan.) 7. Notifications and reviews. Upon receipt of the Phase 1 approval (see Exhibit 510-1) from the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, the region publishes the necessary copies, submits the limited access report to the county or city officials for review and approval, and meets with all involved local governmental agencies to discuss the report. Providing a form letter with a signature block for the local agency to use to indicate its approval of the limited access report can help expedite the review and approval process. The region reviews any requests for modification and submits recommendations, with copies of any correspondence or related minutes, to the HQ Access and Hearings Section.
530.02(4) Limited Access Hearing Plan The region prepares a limited access hearing plan to be used as an exhibit at the public hearing (see Chapter 210 for hearings) and forwards it to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section for review. (See the Plans Preparation Manual for a list of data to be shown on the access hearing plan in addition to the access report plan data.) When the plan review is completed by Headquarters, the access hearing plan is placed before the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, for approval of Phase 2 authority (see Exhibit 510-1).
530.02(5) Documentation Documentation for the establishment of limited access control is in Chapter 210.
530.03 Full Control (Most Restrictive) 530.03(1) Introduction Full control limited access highways allow access only through interchanges at selected public roads/streets, rest areas, viewpoints, or weigh stations, and by prohibiting at-grade crossings and approaches. At times, on state highways (except interstate) where full access control has been established, staged acquisition of limited access may be used, subject to the approval of an access design analysis, with initial acquisition as partial or modified control and with ultimate acquisition of full control planned on the highway. When there is no feasible alternative within a reasonable cost, the decision to defer acquisition of limited access control must be documented and is subject to the approval of an access design analysis.
530.03(2) Application Terminate full control limited access sections at apparent logical points of design change. The following guidelines are to be used for the application of full control on limited access highways.
530.03(2)(a) Interstate Full control is required on interstate highways.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-5
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.03(2)(b) Principal Arterial Documentation assessing the evaluation of full control is required for principal arterial highways requiring four or more through traffic lanes within a 20-year design period unless approved for partial or modified control on existing highways.
530.03(2)(c) Minor Arterial and Collector Minor arterial and collector highways will not normally be considered for development to full control. However, short sections of full control to preserve the operational and safety performance of all modes may be appropriate in some situations.
530.03(3) Crossroads at Interchange Ramps At interchanges where ramps terminate with crossroads, limited access control will extend along crossroads, and in certain cases along local service or frontage roads (as shown in Exhibit 530-1 through Exhibit 530-6). This establishes the Interchange Functional Area, for the preservation of operational and safety performance of the interchange asset. For guidance on interchange spacing, see Chapter 1360.
530.03(3)(a) Ramps At-grade intersections and approaches are prohibited within the full length of any interchange ramp. The ramp is considered to terminate at its intersection with the local road or street.
530.03(3)(b) Frontage Roads Direct access from the highway to a local service or frontage road is allowed only via the interchange crossroad (see Exhibit 530-1, Exhibit 530-2, Exhibit 530-3, and Exhibit 530-6).
530.03(3)(c) Interchange Crossroads In both urban and rural areas, full control limited access must be established and then acquired along the crossroad at an interchange for a minimum distance of 300 feet. This distance is measured from the centerline of the intersection of the crossroad and ramp terminal unless noted otherwise in the conditions below. Control designs in all crossroad contexts should address and incorporate connectivity for shared-use paths, trails and sidewalks in and beyond the control area. If a frontage road or local road is located at or within 350 feet of a ramp terminal, limited access will be established and then acquired up to the intersection, then along the crossroad and for an additional minimum distance of 130 feet in all directions from the centerline of the intersection of the crossroad and the frontage or local road, or measured from the center for roundabouts (see Exhibit 530-1, Exhibit 530-2, Exhibit 530-3, and Exhibit 530-6). For interchanges incorporating partial cloverleaf or buttonhook ramps (see Exhibit 530-2), limited access is required for all portions of the crossroad and frontage roads between the ramp terminals and for a distance of 300 feet beyond the ramp terminals. If an at-grade intersection for a local road or street is served directly opposite the ramp terminals, limited access will be extended for a minimum of 300 feet along that leg of the intersection. When the intersection in question is a roundabout, see Exhibit 530-3. This shows extension of full control along the crossroad to be 300 feet, measured from the center of the roundabout for an intersection with a ramp terminal.

Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
Exhibit 530-4 shows the terminus of transition taper and that full control limited access is extended a minimum distance of 300 feet beyond the end of the farthest taper. For a single point urban interchange (SPUI) with a right- or left-turn “ramp branch” separated by islands, limited access control is established and acquired for a minimum distance of 300 feet from the intersection of the centerline of the ramp branch with the centerline of the nearest directional roadway (see Exhibit 530-5.) For a diverging diamond interchange, limited access control is established and acquired for a minimum distance of 300 feet from the end of the splitter island nose (see Exhibit 530-6). Not all interchange configurations match with the basic illustrations in this chapter. Consult with the HQ Access and Hearings Section for confirmation of limited access boundary requirements for non-traditional interchange configurations.
530.03(3)(d) Levels of Limited Access: Location of Approaches Provide full control for a minimum of 300 feet from the centerline of the ramp or terminus of a transition taper (see Exhibit 530-1 through Exhibit 530-6). The intent is to ensure approaches are far enough away from a frontage road intersection to provide efficient intersection operation. If the economic considerations to implement full control for the entire 300 feet are excessive, then provide full control for at least the first 130 feet; partial or modified control may be provided for the remainder, for a total minimum distance of 300 feet of limited access. Full limited access should be extended as far as possible before any partial or modified access is implemented. Contact the HQ Access and Hearings Section when considering this option. An approved access design analysis is required if the limited access control falls short of 300 feet or for any approach that has been allowed to remain within the first 130 feet.
530.03(4) Location of Utilities, Bus Stops, and Mailboxes 530.03(4)(a) Utilities Connecting utility lines are allowed along the outer right of way line between intermittent frontage roads. (See the Utilities Accommodation Policy regarding the location of and access to utilities.)
530.03(4)(b) Bus Stops Common carrier or school bus stops are not allowed, except at:
•
•
•
Railroad crossings (see Chapter 1350). Locations provided by the state on the interchanges (such as flyer stops). In exceptional cases, along the main roadway where pedestrian separation is available.
530.03(4)(c) Mailboxes Mailboxes are not allowed on full control limited access highways. Mail delivery will be from frontage roads or other adjacent local roads.
530.03(5) Pedestrian and Bicyclist Crossings and Paths All pedestrian and bicyclist traffic is managed as follows:
•
•
At-grade pedestrian and bicyclist crossings are allowed only at the at-grade intersections of ramp terminals. Pedestrian and bicyclist separations or other facilities are provided specifically for pedestrian and bicyclist use.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 530

•
Limited Access Control
Shared-use paths serving bicyclists, pedestrians, and other forms of active transportation. See Chapter 1515. Bicyclists use the right-hand shoulders or other facilities as shown in Chapter 1520, except where such use has been specifically prohibited. Information pertaining to such prohibition is available from the WSDOT website: wsdot.wa.gov/bike/closed.htm
Coordinate with the local agency when planning and designing a shared-use path and the access points within a limited access highway. Pedestrians and bicyclists are allowed, consistent with “Rules of the Road” (RCW 46.61), within the limits of full control limited access highways. Where existing or future planned paths are allowed they must be documented on the right of way and limited access plan. The plan shows the location of the existing or proposed path and where the path crosses limited access and provides movement notes (see Section 530.10(1)). See Chapter 1515 for shared-use path design guidance.
530.04 Partial Control 530.04(1) Introduction Partial control may be established, when justified, on any highway except interstate. Partial control provides a considerable level of protection from motor vehicle traffic interference and protects the highway from future strip-type development while maintaining and improving appropriate active transportation network connections. Upon acquisition of partial control limited access rights, the number, type, and use of access approaches of abutting property are frozen. The abutting property access rights and type of use are recorded on the property deed. The rights and use may not be altered by the abutting property owner, the local jurisdiction, or the region. This authority resides with the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division (see Section 530.10).
530.04(2) Application Partial control will not normally be used in urban areas, urbanizing area, suburban area, rural town centers or inside corporate limits on existing principal arterial highways where motor vehicle traffic volumes are less than 700 design hourly volume (DHV). Terminate limited access sections at apparent logical points of design change.
530.04(2)(a) Principal Arterial Partial control is considered when the estimated motor vehicle traffic volumes exceed 3,000 average daily traffic (ADT) within a 20-year design period on principal arterial highways requiring two through motor vehicle traffic lanes. For multilane principal arterial highways, see Section 530.03(2)(b).
530.04(2)(b) Minor Arterial The minimum route length is: urban, 2 miles; rural, 5 miles; and combination urban and rural, 3 miles. Partial control is required on:
•
•
Rural minor arterial highways at both new and existing locations. Urban minor arterial highways at new locations requiring four or more through motor vehicle traffic lanes within a 20-year design period or requiring only two through motor vehicle traffic lanes where the estimated motor vehicle traffic volumes exceed 3,000 ADT within a 20-year design period.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-8
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
Other rural minor arterial highways with only two motor vehicle lanes may be considered for partial control if any of the following conditions applies:
•
•
•
The partial control can be acquired at a reasonable cost. The route connects two highways of a higher functional classification. The highway traverses publicly owned lands where partial control is desirable.
530.04(2)(c) Collector: New Alignment Partial control is considered on collector highways in new locations requiring four or more through motor vehicle traffic lanes in a 20-year design period
530.04(2)(d) Collector: Existing Existing collector highways will normally be considered for partial control limited access only when all of the following conditions apply:
•
•
•
The highway serves an area that is not directly served by a higher functional classification of highway. Existing or planned development will result in motor vehicle traffic volumes significantly higher than what is required for partial control on minor arterials. Partial control can be established without a major impact on development of abutting properties within the constraints of established zoning at the time the partial control is proposed.
530.04(3) Interchanges and Intersections 530.04(3)(a) Interchanges Where an interchange occurs on a partial control limited access highway, full control applies at the interchange and interchange ramps. Refer to Section 530.03(3) and see Exhibit 530-1, Exhibit 530-2, Exhibit 530-3, and Exhibit 530-6 for required minimum lengths of access control along the crossroad. For these and other interchange configurations not shown, consult with the HQ Access and Hearings Section for support developing limits of access control. (See Chapter 1360 for guidance on interchange spacing.) Where appropriate, address and incorporate connectivity for shared-use paths, trails and sidewalks in and beyond the control area.
530.04(3)(b) Intersections At an at-grade intersection on a partial control limited access highway, control will be established and acquired along the crossroad for a minimum distance of 300 feet from the centerline of the highway (see Exhibit 530-7). Where appropriate, address and incorporate connectivity for shared-use paths, trails and sidewalks in and beyond the control area. If another frontage or local road is located at or within 350 feet of the at-grade intersection, limited access will be established and then acquired along the crossroad, between the intersections, and:
•
•
For an additional minimum distance of 130 feet in all directions from the centerline of the intersection of the frontage or local road (see Exhibit 530-7). In the case of a roundabout, for an additional minimum distance of 300 feet along the crossroad, measured from the center of the roundabout or a minimum distance of 130 feet measured from the end of the slip lane radius or the end of the slip lane taper (as shown in Exhibit 530-8).
On multilane highways, measurements will be made from the centerline of the nearest directional roadway (see Exhibit 530-7).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-9
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
An approved access design analysis is required if the limited access control falls short of 300 feet or for any access that has been allowed to remain within the first 130 feet. At-grade intersections with public roads are limited to the number allowed for the functional classification of highway involved, as follows:
i Principal Arterial If the ADT of the crossroad is less than 2,000, 1-mile spacing (minimum), centerline to centerline. If over 2,000 ADT within 20 years, plan for grade separation.
ii Minor Arterial If the ADT of the crossroad is less than 2,000, ½-mile spacing (minimum), centerline to centerline. If over 2,000 ADT within 20 years, plan for grade separation.
iii Collector Road (or street) plus property approaches, not more than six per side per mile. With approval from the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, shorter intervals may be used where topography or other conditions (such as parcel sizes in some cases) restrict the design. Where intersecting roads are spaced farther apart than one per mile, median crossings may be considered for Uturns, in accordance with Chapter 1310. Keep U-turns to a minimum, consistent with requirements for operation and maintenance of the highway. To discourage movement in the wrong direction on multilane highways, locate private approaches 300 feet or more from an at-grade intersection. At a tee intersection, a private approach may be located directly opposite the intersection or a minimum of 300 feet away from the intersection. Ensure a private approach directly opposite a tee intersection cannot be mistaken for a continuation or part of the public traveled way.
530.04(4) Access Approach Partial control is exercised to the level that, in addition to intersections with selected public roads, some crossings and private driveways may be allowed.
530.04(4)(a) Approach Types Partial control limited access highways allow at-grade intersections with selected public roads, trails, shared-use paths, and private approaches using Type A, B, C, and F approaches. (See Chapter 520 for the definitions of approach types.) Type D, commercial approaches, are not allowed direct access to partial control limited access highways. Commercial access is allowed only by way of other public roads. The type of approach provided for each parcel is based on current and potential land use and on an evaluation that assesses connectivity for all modes. (See Section 530.05(4) for a list of evaluation criteria.)

Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.04(4)(b) Design Considerations The following considerations are used to determine the number and location of access approaches on partial control limited access highways. 1. Access approaches must be held to a minimum. The number is limited as follows:
•
•
•
Principal arterial: two per side per mile Minor arterial: four per side per mile Collector: six per side per mile, including at-grade intersections
2. Approaches in excess of the number listed above may be allowed as staged construction (until full buildout is complete) if approved by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division. 3. Approaches are not allowed for parcels that have reasonable access to other public roads unless a parcel has extensive highway frontage. 4. Relocate or close approaches at locations where available sight distance is below Design Manual criteria. 5. Allow only one approach for each parcel, except for very large ownerships, or where terrain features do not allow the property to be served by a single approach. This includes contiguous parcels under a single ownership. 6. Where possible, locate a single approach to serve two or more parcels. 7. The approved design is to provide for future development of frontage roads that will eliminate an excessive number of approaches.
530.04(5) Location of Utilities, Bus Stops, and Mailboxes 530.04(5)(a) Utilities Connecting utility lines are allowed along the outer right of way line between intermittent frontage roads. (See the Utilities Accommodation Policy regarding the location of and access to utilities.)
530.04(5)(b) Bus Stops Bus stops for both common carriers and school buses are not allowed on either two-lane or four-lane highways except:
•
•
•
•
At railroad crossings (see Chapter 1350). At locations of intersections with necessary pullouts to be constructed by the state. Where shoulder widening has been provided for mail delivery service. For a designated school bus loading zone on or adjacent to the traveled lane, that has been approved by WSDOT.
Buses are not allowed to stop in the traveled lanes blocking at-grade intersections or private approaches to load or unload passengers. School bus loading zones on partial control limited access highways must be posted with school bus loading zone signs, in accordance with the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD).

Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.04(5)(c) Mailboxes Locate mailboxes on frontage roads or at intersections, with the following exceptions for properties that are served by Type A or B approaches:
•
•
Locate mailboxes on a four-lane highway only on the side of the highway on which the deeded approach is provided. Locate mailboxes on a two-lane highway on the side of the highway that is on the right in the direction of the mail delivery.
Wherever mailboxes are allowed on a partial control limited access highway, provide mailbox turnouts to allow mail delivery vehicles to stop clear of the through traffic lanes. (See Chapter 1600 for additional information concerning mailbox locations and turnouts.)
530.04(6) Pedestrian and Bicyclist Crossings and Paths Pedestrian and bicyclist crossings are allowed on partial control limited access highways when they are gradeseparated or, crossings can be at grade, when the following conditions apply:
•
•
•
•
Only at intersections where an at-grade crossing is provided in accordance with Chapter 1510. On two-lane highways at mailbox locations. On two-lane highways not less than 100 feet from a school bus loading zone (pullout) adjacent to the traveled lane, if school district and WSDOT personnel determine that the bus stopping in the traveled lane is not recommended. On two-lane highways where the school bus is stopped on the traveled lane to load or unload passengers and the required sign and signal lights are displayed.
On partial control limited access highways, pedestrian and bicyclist traffic is allowed, consistent with “Rules of the Road” (RCW 46.61), except where unusual safety conditions support prohibition. Information pertaining to such prohibitions is available from the WSDOT website: wsdot.wa.gov/bike/closed.htm Shared-use paths and trails, and access to and from, within a partial control limited access highway are best planned and designed with the local agency’s participation. Where existing and future planned paths are allowed, they must be documented on the right of way and limited access plan. The plan shows the location of the existing or proposed shared-use path and where the path crosses limited access, and it provides movement notes (see Section 530.10(1)), with the intention of maintaining and improving active transportation connectivity.
530.05 Modified Control (Least Restrictive) 530.05(1) Introduction Modified control is intended to prevent further deterioration in the safety and motor vehicle operational characteristics of existing highways by limiting the number and location of access points. Upon acquisition of modified control limited access, the number, type, and use of access approaches of abutting property are frozen. The abutting property access rights and type of use are recorded on the property deed. The rights and use may not be altered by the abutting property owner, the local jurisdiction, or the region. This authority resides with the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division (see Section 530.10).

Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.05(2) Application In general, modified control is applied where some level of control is desired, but existing and potential commercial development precludes the implementation of full or partial control.
530.05(2)(a) Existing Highways Modified control may be established and acquired on existing highways other than main line interstate. Priority is given to highway segments where one or more of the following conditions applies:
•
•
•
Commercial development potential is high, but most of the adjoining property remains undeveloped. There is a reasonable expectation that the adjoining property will be redeveloped to a more intensive land use, resulting in greater motor vehicle traffic congestion and increased presence of people walking, bicycling, and/or accessing transit service. At interchange areas if full or partial access cannot be provided as described in Section 530.03(3)(d).
530.05(2)(b) Modified Control Evaluation Selection of highways on which modified control may be applied is based on an evaluation that includes the following contextual factors for all modes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The current form of managed access control Traffic volumes Level of service, or other selected mobility performance metric Selected safety performance Functional class Route continuity Mix of residential, destination and employment densities Operational considerations related to achieving the selected motor vehicle target speed Operational considerations related to transportation efficiency for people utilizing active transportation Local land use planning Current and potential land use Predicted growth rate Economic analysis
530.05(2)(c) Exceptions Where modified control is to be established, developed commercial areas may be excepted from control when all or most of the abutting property has been developed to the extent that few, if any, additional commercial approaches will be needed with full development of the area. Contact the HQ Access and Hearings Section when considering this option. If this exception is within the limits of access control, an approved access design analysis is required.
530.05(3) Intersections At an intersection on a modified control limited access highway, access control will be established and acquired along the crossroad for a minimum distance of 130 feet:
•
•
•
Measured from the centerline of a two-lane highway (see Exhibit 530-10). Measured from the centerline of the nearest directional roadway of a four-lane highway (see Exhibit 530-10). Measured from the center of a roundabout (see Exhibit 530-9).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-13
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
Approaches are allowed within this area only when there is no reasonable alternative. An approved access design analysis is required for any access that has been allowed to remain within the first 130 feet. Where appropriate, address and incorporate connectivity for shared-use paths, trails and sidewalks in and beyond the control area.
530.05(4) Access Approach The number and location of approaches on a highway with modified control must be carefully planned and monitored to provide a safe and efficient highway compatible with present and potential land use.
530.05(4)(a) Approach Types Modified control limited access highways allow at-grade intersections with selected public roads, shared-use paths, trails, and with private approaches using Type A, B, C, and D approaches. (See Chapter 520 for definitions of the approach types.) The type of approach provided for each parcel is based on present and potential land use and an evaluation of the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Local comprehensive plans, zoning, and land use ordinances Property covenants and agreements City or county ordinances The highest and best use of the property The highest and best use of adjoining lands A change in use by merger of adjoining ownerships All other factors bearing upon proper land use of the parcel
530.05(4)(b) Design Considerations The following items are used to determine the number and location of approaches: 1. Parcels that have access to another public road or street are not normally allowed direct access to the highway. 2. Meets sight distance criteria (see Chapter 1340). 3. Hold the number of access approaches to a minimum. Access approaches are limited to one approach for each parcel of land or where adjoining parcels are under one contiguous ownership. 4. Encourage joint use of access approaches where similar use of land and topography allows. 5. Additional approaches may be allowed for future development consistent with local zoning. Once limited access has been acquired, this will require a value determination process (see Section 530.10). Close existing access approaches not meeting the above.
530.05(5) Location of Utilities, Bus Stops, and Mailboxes 530.05(5)(a) Utilities Connecting utility lines are allowed along the outer right of way line between intermittent frontage roads. (See the Utilities Accommodation Policy regarding location of and access to utilities.)
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-14
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.05(5)(b) Bus Stops Bus stops are allowed as follows:
•
•
In rural areas, bus stops are subject to the same restrictions as in Sections 530.04(5) and 530.04(6). In urban areas, bus stops for both commercial carriers and school buses are allowed. (See Chapter 1730 for transit stop considerations and pullout designs.)
530.05(5)(c) Mailboxes Locate mailboxes adjacent to or opposite all authorized approaches as follows:
•
•
On a four-lane highway only on the side of the highway on which the deeded approach is provided. On a two-lane highway on the side of the highway that is on the right in the direction of the mail delivery.
Where mailboxes are allowed, a mailbox turnout is recommended to allow mail delivery vehicles to stop clear of the through traffic lanes. (See Chapter 1600 for additional information concerning mailbox locations and turnouts.)
530.05(6) Pedestrian and Bicyclist Crossings and Pedestrian and/or Bicycle Paths Pedestrian and bicyclist crossings are allowed as follows. Pedestrians and bicyclists are allowed, consistent with “Rules of the Road” (RCW 46.61), on modified control limited access highways except where unusual safety considerations support prohibition. Information pertaining to such prohibitions is available from the WSDOT website: wsdot.wa.gov/bike/closed.htm Shared-use paths and trails, and access to and from, within a modified control limited access highway are best planned and designed with the local agency’s participation. Where existing or future planned shared-use paths or trails are allowed, they must be documented in the right of way and limited access plan. The plan shows the location of the existing or proposed path and where the shared-use path crosses limited access, and it provides movement notes (see Section 530.10(1)) with the intention of maintaining and improving active transportation connectivity.
530.06 Access Approaches 530.06(1) General Access approaches may be allowed on limited access highways, consistent with the requirements outlined in Sections 530.03, 530.04, and 530.05. For additional information pertaining to approaches, refer to Chapter 1320, Chapter 1340, and Chapter 510, and the Plans Preparation Manual. The widths for the approach types are negotiated, and only the negotiated widths are shown on the right of way and limited access plan. (See Chapter 520 for definitions of the approach types.)
530.07 Frontage Roads Local agency approval is required for any planned frontage roads, county roads, city streets, cul-de-sacs, shareduse paths, or trails. The local agency must also agree in writing to accept and maintain the new section as a county road or city street.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-15
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.07(1) General Frontage roads are provided in conjunction with limited access highways to:
•
•
•
Limit access to the main line. Provide access to abutting land ownerships. Restore the continuity of the local street or roadway system and active transportation network.
Refer to Chapter 1210 for frontage road general policy and Chapter 300 for required documentation. By agreement under which the state is reimbursed for all costs involved, frontage roads that are not the responsibility of the state may be built by the state upon the request of a local political subdivision, a private agency, or an individual.
530.07(2) County Road and City Street To connect roads or streets or walk/bike connections that have been closed off by the highway, short sections of county roads, city streets, shared-use paths, or trails that are not adjacent to the highway may be constructed if they will serve the same purpose as, and cost less than, a frontage road.
530.07(3) Cul-de-sacs For a frontage road or local street bearing substantial traffic that is terminated or closed at one end, provide a cul-de-sac or other street or roadway consistent with local policy or practice, that is sufficient to allow vehicles to turn around without encroachment on private property. Consider and address continued connectivity and provision of alternate routes for pedestrians and bicyclists.
530.08 Turnbacks When WSDOT transfers jurisdiction of operating right of way to a city, town, or county, a turnback agreement is required. (See the Agreements Manual for turnback procedures (Consultants: Please contact your WSDOT Project Manager for access to the Agreements Manual).) Locate the turnback limits at points of logical termination. This will allow WSDOT to retain an adequate amount of right of way for maintenance of the highway and for other operational functions. In areas where limited access rights have been acquired from the abutting property owners, the limited access rights will continue to be required for highway purposes; therefore, the limited access rights will not be included as part of a turnback agreement.
530.09 Adjacent Railroads 530.09(1) General A limited access highway and a railroad are considered adjacent when they have a common right of way border with no other property separating them. The allowed approaches apply only to adjacent railroad property that is directly used for current railroad operation.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-16
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.09(2) Requirements It is in the public’s interest to provide access to the railroad right of way, from limited access highways, for maintenance of the railroad and the utilities located on the railroad right of way where other access is not feasible. This applies to both new highways and to existing highways where limited access has been acquired. Direct access is allowed where local roads are infrequent or there are few highway-railroad crossings from which unimproved road access for maintenance purposes is feasible, and where unique topography or other unusual conditions lead to its use. To provide direct approaches for access to railroad right of way, all of the following conditions must be met:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
A maximum of one approach is allowed for every 2 miles of highway. The approach must not adversely affect the design, construction, stability, traffic safety, or operation of the highway. Except where the railroad is located in the median area, the approach is to be accomplished in a legal manner by right turns only, to and from the roadway nearest the railroad. Median crossing is not allowed. The approach is secured by a locked gate under arrangements satisfactory to the department. (See the Definitions section in Chapter 520 for Approach Type C, and Chapter 550.) The parking of any vehicles or railroad equipment is prohibited within limited access highway right of way. A special emergency maintenance permit must be obtained for periods of intensive railroad maintenance. The approach must be closed if the railroad operation ceases. Approaches are limited to use by the railroad company unless specific provisions for other use are shown on the right of way and limited access plan and included in the right of way negotiations.
530.09(3) Restrictions Direct access to a railroad from the highway is considered unnecessary and is not allowed where:
•
•
•
•
There are local roads adjacent to or crossing the railroad. An unimproved road can be provided by the railroad between crossroads. The limited access highway is paralleled by a frontage road adjacent to the railroad. No highway previously existed adjacent to the railroad.
530.10 Access Breaks and Inner Corridor Access This section addresses three topics:
•
•
•
Section 530.10(1) applies to access breaks and inner corridor access of limited access rights of way on full, partial and modified highways. Section 530.10(2) provides specific detail on changes for private approaches. Section 530.10(3) provides specific guidance on changes for public approaches.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-17
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.10(1) General When non-highway purpose activities are proposed that involve either crossing limited access boundaries or entering into roadside areas from within limited access facilities, a formal request shall be approved prior to the activity or use. The request will be either an access break or an inner corridor access. An access break is needed when the limited access boundary is to be crossed. This refers to any point from inside or outside the state limited access right of way limited access hachures that crosses over, under, or physically through the plane of the limited access. An inner corridor access is needed when entry into roadside areas inside of the limited access corridor is to be made from within the limited access boundary. Inner corridor access may be from a mainline, a ramp, or from a local road or street that is also within limited access. Evaluate the following factors concerning a potential access break or inner corridor access:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Crash potential for all modes, including how crash types and contributing factors and how operational considerations related to the access break would change Level of access control (full, partial, or modified) Existing and planned land use changes Functional classification Land use and zoning Environment impacts/mitigation Determination from a Corridor Sketch, Basis of Design and/or CMAR
Regional staff or Program staff work with the requesting party to compile and submit access break and inner corridor access requests to the HQ Access and Hearings Section. The request package will contain the completed access request checklist and all supporting documents and will be submitted electronically using instructions located on the Access and Hearings Section website: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-accessrequests-training
530.10(1)(a) Approvals Access breaks (either temporary or permanent) and inner corridor access for all limited access state highways require approval prior to implementation. For permanent access breaks or inner corridor access approvals involving existing property rights, the right of way and limited access plan must be revised and deeds may need to be rewritten. On non-interstate limited access routes, WSDOT HQ approves access breaks and inner corridor access. On interstate routes, 23 CFR 710.403 requires prior approval from FHWA. Note that any changes proposed on Interstate limited access facilities must include environmental documentation in the request, as required by FHWA. Contact the HQ Access and Hearings Section for assistance.
530.10(2) Changes for Private Access Approaches (Modified/Partial Control Only) Private accesses are allowed within modified control and sometimes allowed within partial control (WAC 46858-010).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 530-18
Chapter 530
Limited Access Control
530.10(2)(a) Requirements Examples of access modifications requested by abutting property owners include additional road approaches, changes in the allowed use, or additional users of existing road approaches. Plan revisions that provide for additional access to abutting properties after WSDOT has purchased the access rights are discouraged. However, these revisions may be considered if the following can be established:
•
•
•
•
There are no other reasonable alternatives. The efficiency and safety of the highway will not be adversely impacted. The existing situation causes extreme hardship on the owner(s). The revision is consistent with the limited access highway requirements.
530.10(2)(b) Procedures The region initiates a preliminary engineering review of the requested modification to or break in limited access and contacts the HQ Access and Hearings Section to determine whether conceptual approval can be granted for the request. If conceptual approval can be granted, then:
•
•
•
The region initiates an engineering review of the requested modification. The region prepares and submits to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section a preliminary right of way and limited access plan revision, together with a recommendation for Headquarters approval. When federalaid funds are involved in any phase of the project, the proposed modification will be sent to FHWA for review and approval. The recommendation will include an item-by-item analysis of the factors listed in Sections 530.10(1) and 530.10(2)(a).
530.10(2)(c) Valuation Determination Upon preliminary approval, region Real Estate Services prepares an appraisal for the value of the access change using a before and after appraisal.
•
•
•
The appraisal follows the requirements set forth in the Right of Way Manual. The appraisal package is sent to HQ Real Estate Services for review and approval. If federal-aid funds were involved in purchasing access control, HQ Real Estate Services will send a copy of the appraisal package to FHWA for review and approval.
530.10(2)(d) Final Processing
•
•
•
•
•
•
Region Real Estate Services informs the requester of the approved appraised value for the change. If the requester is still interested, the region prepares a “Surplus Disposal Package” for HQ Real Estate Services’ review and approval. At the same time, the preliminary right of way and limited access plan revision previously transmitted is processed for approval. After the department collects the payment from the requester, the region issues a permit for the construction, if required. If an existing approach is being surrendered, region Real Estate Services obtains a conveyance from the property owner. HQ Real Estate Services prepares and processes a deed granting the change to the access rights.

530.10(3) Changes for Public At-Grade Intersections (Modified/Partial Control Only) 530.10(3)(a) Requirements
•
•
•
Public at-grade intersections on partial or modified control limited access highways serve local arterials that form part of the local transportation network for all modes. Requests for new intersections on limited access highways must be made by or through the local governmental agency to WSDOT. The region will forward this request, including the data referenced in Sections 530.10(1) and 530.10(2)(a) to the HQ Access and Hearings Section. WSDOT must comply with the hearing, or waiver, process as outlined in Chapter 210 and discussed in Section 530.02(2)(a). The access acquisition and conveyance must be completed prior to beginning construction of the new intersection. The new intersection is to meet WSDOT design and spacing requirements, unless otherwise approved through design analysis document.
530.10(3)(b) Procedures
•
•
•
•
•
•
The region evaluates the request for modification and contacts the HQ Access and Hearings Section for conceptual approval. The region submits an intersection plan for approval (see Chapter 1310) and a right of way and limited access plan revision request (see the Plans Preparation Manual). This plan includes the limited access design requirements for all modes along the proposed public atgrade intersection. The Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, approves the intersection plan. The Assistant Secretary, Regions and Mega Programs/Chief Engineer (or designee), approves the access revision. The region submits the construction agreement to the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division (see the Agreements Manual). The Assistant Secretary, Regions and Mega Programs/Chief Engineer (or designee), approves the construction agreement.
530.10(3)(c) Valuation Determination
•
•
When a requested public at-grade intersection will serve a local arterial that immediately connects to the local transportation network, compensation will not be required. When a requested public at-grade intersection will serve only a limited area, does not immediately connect to the local transportation network, or is primarily for the benefit of a limited number of developers, compensation for the access change will be addressed in the plan revision request. In these situations, compensation is appropriate and a value will be determined as outlined in Section 530.10(2)(c).

Managed Access Control Exhibit 540-1 Managed Access Highway Class Description Exhibit 540-2 Minimum Corner Clearance: Distance From Access Connection to Public Road or Street
540.01 General Access management is the systematic regulation of the location, spacing, design, and operation of driveway, city street, and county road connections to state highways. This chapter describes the access management process for granting permission to connect to managed access highways within cities and unincorporated areas. For an overview of access control, references to related state laws and codes, and definitions of terminology for this chapter, see Chapter 520, Access Control. In Washington State, managed access highways include all state highways that are not limited access highways. State highways that are planned for or established as limited access, are treated as managed access highways until the limited access rights are acquired. The Access Control Tracking System Limited Access and Managed Access Master Plan (Access Master Plan) identifies not only the limits of limited access control, but also managed access control segments. The current managed access classification is based on access connection densities, distance between access connections, spacing of intersections, and context (see Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 468-52-040). The existing access classification is periodically updated by Headquarters (HQ) with region input to reflect changes on a corridor segment. Conditions may have changed since the Access Master Plan was envisioned or the last managed access classification update. On non-freeways it is important to consider the current classification and any classifications previously planned, and determine the access design control most appropriate for the agreed context (see Chapter 1102 and Chapter 1103 for context and design control guidance, respectively). The Access Master Plan database is available at: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-access-requests-training Access to managed access highways is regulated by the governmental entity with jurisdiction over a highway’s roadsides. Access connection permits are issued on managed access highways. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has access connection permitting authority over all state highways outside incorporated towns and cities. Incorporated towns and cities have access connection permitting authority for city streets that are part of state highways, as specified in Revised Code of Washington (RCW) 47.24.020. When any project is developed on a state highway outside an incorporated city or town, state law requires that existing access connections be evaluated to determine whether they are consistent with all current department spacing, location, and design standards (see Section 540.03).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 540
Managed Access Control
540.02 Design Considerations Evaluate access connections by using the Access Master Plan database to identify the route classification and determine access connection requirements in conformance with this chapter or Chapter 530 as appropriate. See also Chapter 1100, Practical Design, and chapters in that series for guidance on how access control is used as a design control. Review all connections and verify whether they are in the Roadway Access Management Permit System (RAMPS) database. Contact the region Development Services Office or the HQ Access and Hearings Section for permission to log on to the link through this page: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-access-requests-training If a nonconforming connection is identified, consider relocating, modifying, or eliminating the connection. It is not the intent of the managed access program that modifications to the connection will change the general functionality of the property. Where current department standards cannot be met while providing the same general functionality, classify the connection as nonconforming and process the appropriate documentation as discussed below. This documentation is part of the permit process.
540.03 Managed Access Highway Classes The principal objective of the managed access classification system is to maintain the safety and capacity of existing highways. This is accomplished by establishing access management criteria, which are to be adhered to in the planning and regional approval of access connections to the state highway system. The classification system for state managed access highways consists of five classes. The classes are arranged from the most restrictive, Class 1, to the least restrictive, Class 5. In general, most state highways outside the incorporated limits of a city or town have been designated as Class 1 or Class 2, with only the most urban and lowest-speed state highways within an incorporated town or city designated as Class 5. Exhibit 540-1 shows the five classes of highways, with a brief description of each class. WSDOT keeps a record of the assigned managed access classifications, by state route and milepost, in the Access Control Tracking System database: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-access-requests-training One of the goals of state law is to restrict or keep access connections to a minimum in order to help preserve the safety, operation, and functional integrity of the state highway. On Class 1 highways, mobility is the primary function, while on Class 5 highways, access needs have priority over mobility needs. Class 2 highways also favor mobility, while Class 3 and Class 4 highways generally achieve a balance between mobility and access. The most notable distinction between the five highway classes is the minimum spacing requirements of access connections. Exhibit 540-1 shows the minimum distances between access points on the same side of the highway. Exhibit 540-2 applies to the minimum clearance from a public road or street. In all five highway classes, access connections are to be located and designed to minimize interference with transit facilities and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities on state highways where such facilities exist or are proposed in state, regional, metropolitan, or local transportation plans. In these cases, if reasonable access is available to the local road/street system, access is to be provided to the local road/street system rather than directly to the state highway. Following are the functional characteristics and the legal requirements for each class.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 540-2
Chapter 540
Managed Access Control
540.03(1) Class 1 540.03(1)(a) Functional Characteristics Class 1 highways provide for high-speed and/or high-volume traffic movements for interstate, interregional, and intercity (and some intracity) travel needs. Service to abutting land is subordinate to providing service to major traffic movements. Highways in Class 1 are typically distinguished by a highly-controlled, limited number of (public and private) access points, restrictive medians with limited median openings on multilane facilities, and infrequent intersections.
540.03(1)(b) Legal Requirements 1. It is the intent that Class 1 highways be designed to have a posted speed limit of 50 to 65 mph. Intersecting streets, roads, and highways are planned with a minimum spacing of 1 mile. Spacing of ½ mile may be allowed, but only when no reasonable alternative access exists. 2. Private access connections to the state highway are not allowed except where the property has no other reasonable access to the local road/street system. When a private access connection must be provided, the following conditions apply: o The access connection continues until such time other reasonable access to a highway with a less restrictive access control class or access to the local road/street system becomes available and is allowed. o The minimum distance to another (public or private) access point is 1,320 feet along the same side of the highway. Nonconforming access connection permits may be issued to provide access connections to parcels whose highway frontage, topography, or location otherwise precludes issuance of a conforming access connection permit; however, variance permits are not allowed. o No more than one access connection may be provided to an individual parcel or to contiguous parcels under the same ownership. o All private access connections are for right turns only on multilane facilities. Where special conditions apply, justify the exception in a traffic analysis in the access connection permit application that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43. o Additional access connections to the state highway are not allowed for newly created parcels resulting from property divisions. All access for these parcels must be provided by an internal road/street network. Access to the state highway will be at existing permitted locations or revised locations. 3. Restrictive medians are provided on multilane facilities to separate opposing traffic movements and to prevent unauthorized turning movements.
540.03(2) Class 2 540.03(2)(a) Functional Characteristics Class 2 highways provide for low-to-high travel speeds depending on context, and medium-to-high-volume traffic movements over medium and long distances for interregional, intercity, and intracity travel needs. Direct access service to abutting land is subordinate to providing service to traffic movements.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 540-3
Chapter 540
Managed Access Control
Highways in Class 2 are typically distinguished by existing or planned restrictive medians on multilane facilities and by large minimum distances between (public and private) access points.
540.03(2)(b) Legal Requirements 1. It is the intent that Class 2 highways be designed to have a posted speed limit of 35 to 50 mph in urbanized areas and 45 to 55 mph in rural areas. Intersecting streets, roads, and highways are planned with a minimum spacing of ½ mile. Intersection spacing of less than ½-mile may be allowed, but only when no reasonable alternative access exists. In urban areas and developing areas where higher volumes are present or growth that will require a change to intersection control is expected in the foreseeable future, it is imperative that the location of any public access point be planned carefully to ensure adequate traffic progression. The addition of all new public or private access points that might require signalization or other form of intersection control will require an engineering analysis that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43. 2. Private access connections to the state highway system are allowed only where the property has no other reasonable access to the local road/street system or where access to the local road/street system will cause unacceptable traffic operational conditions or safety concerns on that system. When a private access connection must be provided, the following conditions apply: o The access connection continues until such time other reasonable access to a highway with a less restrictive access control class or acceptable access to the local road/street system becomes available and is allowed. o The minimum distance to another (public or private) access point is 660 feet on the same side of the highway. Nonconforming access connection permits may be issued to provide access to parcels whose highway frontage, topography, or location precludes issuance of a conforming access connection permit. o Only one access connection is allowed for an individual parcel or to contiguous parcels under the same ownership. This applies unless the highway frontage exceeds 1,320 feet and it can be shown that the additional access connection will not adversely affect the desired function of the state highway in accordance with the assigned managed access Class 2 or the safety or operation of the state highway. o Variance permits may be allowed if there are special conditions and the exception can be justified to the satisfaction of the department by a traffic analysis in the access connection permit application that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43. o All private access connections are for right turns only on multilane facilities. This applies unless there are special conditions and the exception can be justified to the satisfaction of the department by a traffic analysis in the access connection permit application that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43 and only if left-turn channelization is provided. o Additional access connections to the state highway are not allowed for newly created parcels that result from property divisions. All access for these parcels must be provided by an internal road/street network. Access to the state highway will be at existing permitted locations or at revised locations.

Managed Access Control
3. On multilane facilities, restrictive medians are provided to separate opposing traffic movements and to prevent unauthorized turning movements. However, a nonrestrictive median or a two-way leftturn lane may be used where special conditions exist and main line volumes are below 20,000 average daily traffic (ADT).
540.03(3) Class 3 540.03(3)(a) Functional Characteristics Class 3 highways provide for moderate travel speeds depending on context, and moderate traffic volumes for medium and short travel distances for intercity, intracity, and intercommunity travel needs. There is a reasonable balance between access and mobility needs for highways in this class. This class is to be used primarily where the existing level of development of the adjoining land is less intensive than maximum buildout and where the probability of significant land use change and increased traffic demand is high. Highways in Class 3 are typically distinguished by planned restrictive medians on multilane facilities and by meeting minimum distances between (public and private) access points. Two way left-turn lanes may be used where justified and main line traffic volumes are below 25,000 ADT. Development of properties with internal road/street networks and joint access connections is encouraged.
540.03(3)(b) Legal Requirements 1. It is the intent that Class 3 highways be designed to have a posted speed limit of 30 to 40 mph in urbanized areas and 45 to 55 mph in rural areas. In rural areas, intersecting streets, roads, and highways are planned with a minimum spacing of ½ mile. Intersection spacing of less than ½-mile may be allowed, but only when no reasonable alternative access exists. In urban areas and developing areas where higher volumes are present or growth that will require a change to intersection control is expected in the foreseeable future, it is imperative that the location of any public access point be planned carefully to ensure adequate traffic progression. Where feasible, major intersecting roadways that might ultimately require signalization or other intersection control type are planned with a minimum of ½-mile spacing. The addition of all new public or private access points that may require signalization or other intersection control type, will require an engineering analysis that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43. 2. Private Access Connections o No more than one access connection may be provided to an individual parcel or to contiguous parcels under the same ownership. This applies unless it can be shown that additional access connections will not adversely affect the desired function of the state highway in accordance with the assigned managed access Class 3 and will not adversely affect the safety or operation of the state highway. o The minimum distance to another (public or private) access point is 330 feet on the same side of the highway. Nonconforming access connection permits may be issued to provide access to parcels whose highway frontage, topography, or location precludes issuance of a conforming access connection permit. o Variance permits may be allowed if there are special conditions and the exception can be justified to the satisfaction of the department by a traffic analysis in the access connection permit application that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43.

540.03(4) Class 4 540.03(4)(a) Functional Characteristics Class 4 highways provide for low to intermediate travel speeds depending on context, and moderate traffic volumes for medium and short travel distances for intercity, intracity, and intercommunity travel needs. There is a reasonable balance between direct access and mobility needs for highways in this class. This class is to be used primarily where the existing level of development of the adjoining land is more intensive and where the probability of major land use changes is less than on Class 3 highway segments. Highways in Class 4 are typically distinguished by existing or planned nonrestrictive medians. Restrictive medians may be used to mitigate unfavorable operational conditions such as turning, weaving, and crossing conflicts. Minimum access connection spacing requirements apply if adjoining properties are redeveloped.
540.03(4)(b) Legal Requirements 1. It is the intent that Class 4 highways be designed to have a posted speed limit of 30 to 35 mph in urbanized areas and 35 to 45 mph in rural areas. In rural areas, intersecting streets, roads, and highways are planned with a minimum spacing of ½ mile. Intersection spacing of less than ½ mile may be allowed, but only when no reasonable alternative access exists. In urban areas and developing areas where higher volumes are present or growth that will require a change in intersection control is expected in the foreseeable future, it is imperative that the location of any public access point be planned carefully to ensure adequate traffic progression. Where feasible, major intersecting roadways that might ultimately require intersection control changes are planned with a minimum of ½-mile spacing. The addition of all new public or private access points that may require signalization, or other intersection control type, will require an engineering analysis that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43. 2. Private Access Connections o No more than one access connection may be provided to an individual parcel or to contiguous parcels under the same ownership. This applies unless it can be shown that additional access connections will not adversely affect the desired function of the state highway in accordance with the assigned managed access Class 4 and will not adversely affect the safety or operation of the state highway. o The minimum distance to another (public or private) access point is 250 feet on the same side of the highway. Nonconforming access connection permits may be issued to provide access connections to parcels whose highway frontage, topography, or location precludes issuance of a conforming access connection permit. o Variance permits may be allowed if there are special conditions and the exception can be justified to the satisfaction of the department by a traffic analysis in the access connection permit application that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43.

540.03(5) Class 5 540.03(5)(a) Functional Characteristics Class 5 highways provide for low travel speeds and moderate traffic volumes for primarily short travel distances for intracity and intracommunity trips and for access to state highways of a higher class. Access needs generally may be higher than the need for through-traffic mobility without compromising the public’s health, welfare, or safety. These highways will normally have nonrestrictive medians.
540.03(5)(b) Legal Requirements 1. It is the intent that Class 5 highways be designed to have a posted speed limit of 25 to 35 mph. In rural areas, intersecting streets, roads, and highways are planned with a minimum spacing of ¼ mile. Spacing of less than ¼ mile may be allowed where no reasonable alternative exists. In urban areas and developing areas where higher volumes are present or growth that will require changes to intersection control is expected in the foreseeable future, it is imperative that the location of any public access point be planned carefully to ensure adequate traffic progression. Where feasible, major intersecting roadways that might ultimately require changes to intersection control are planned with a minimum of ¼ mile spacing. The addition of all new public or private access points that might require signalization, or other control type, will require an engineering analysis that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43. 2. Private Access Connections o No more than one access connection may be provided to an individual parcel or to contiguous parcels under the same ownership. This applies unless it can be shown that additional access connections will not adversely affect the desired function of the state highway in accordance with the assigned managed access Class 5 and will not adversely affect the safety or operation of the state highway. o The minimum distance to another (public or private) access point is 125 feet on the same side of the highway. Nonconforming access connection permits may be issued to provide access to parcels whose highway frontage, topography, or location precludes issuance of a conforming access connection permit. o Variance permits may be allowed if there are special conditions and the exception can be justified to the satisfaction of the department by a traffic analysis in the access connection permit application that is signed and sealed by a qualified professional engineer who is registered in accordance with RCW 18.43.

540.03(6) Changes in Managed Access Classification WSDOT, RTPOs, MPOs, or other entities such as cities, towns, or counties may initiate a review of managed access classifications per the process identified by WAC 468-52. In all cases, WSDOT consults with the RTPOs, MPOs, and local agencies and takes into consideration comments received during the review process. For city streets that are designated as state highways, the department will obtain concurrence in the final classification assignment from the city or town. The modified highway classification list shall be submitted to Headquarters for approval by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, or a designee. WSDOT regions shall notify the RTPOs, MPOs, and local governmental entities in writing of the final determination of the reclassification.
540.04 Corner Clearance Criteria In addition to the five access control classes, there are also corner clearance criteria that must be used for access connections near intersections (see Exhibit 540-2). Corner clearance spacing must meet or exceed the minimum access point spacing requirements of the applicable managed access highway class. A single access connection may be placed closer to the intersection, in compliance with the permit application process specified in WAC 468-51 and in accordance with the following criteria:
•
•
•
The minimum corner clearance criteria in Exhibit 540-2 may be used where access point spacing cannot be obtained due to property size and where a joint-use access connection cannot be secured or where it is determined by WSDOT not to be feasible because of conflicting land use or conflicting traffic volumes or operational characteristics. Some local agencies have adopted corner clearance as a design element in their design standards; these standards are to meet or exceed WSDOT standards. Coordinate with the local agency regarding corner clearance of an access connection on or near an intersecting local road or street. When a joint-use access connection or an alternate road/street system access—meeting or exceeding the minimum corner clearance requirements—becomes available, the permit holder must close the permitted access connection unless the permit holder shows to WSDOT's satisfaction that such closure is not feasible.

540.05 Access Connection Categories Whenever an access connection permit is issued on a managed access state highway, the permit must also specify one of four access connection categories: Category I to Category IV. Categories I through III are based on the maximum vehicular usage of the access connection. Category IV specifies temporary use, usually for less than a year. Access connection permits must specify the category and the maximum vehicular usage of the access connection in the permit. All access connections are determined by WSDOT to be in one of the following categories (WAC 468-51-040):
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 540-10
Chapter 540
Managed Access Control
540.05(1) Category I “Category I – minimum connection” provides connection to the state highway system for up to ten single-family residences, a duplex, or a small multifamily complex of up to ten dwelling units that use a common access connection. This category also applies to permanent access connections to agricultural and forestlands, including field entrances; access connections for the operation, maintenance, and repair of utilities; and access connections serving other low-volume traffic generators expected to have average weekday vehicle trip ends (AWDVTE) of 100 or less.
540.05(2) Category II “Category II – minor connection” provides connection to the state highway system for medium-volume traffic generators expected to have an AWDVTE of 1,500 or less, but not included in Category I.
540.05(3) Category III “Category III – major connection” provides connection to the state highway system for high-volume traffic generators expected to have an AWDVTE exceeding 1,500.
540.05(4) Category IV “Category IV – temporary connection” provides a temporary, time-limited connection to the state highway system for a specific property for a specific use with a specific traffic volume. Such uses include, but are not limited to, logging, forestland clearing, temporary agricultural uses, temporary construction, and temporary emergency access. The department reserves the right to remove any temporary access connection at its sole discretion and at the expense of the property owner after the expiration of the permit. Further, a temporary access connection permit does not bind the department, in any way, to the future issuance of a permanent access connection permit at the temporary access connection location.
540.06 Access Connection Permit RCW 47.50 requires all access connections to be permitted. This can be accomplished by the permitting process (see Section 540.07) or by the connection being “grandfathered” (in place prior to July 1, 1990). All new access connections to state highways, as well as alterations and improvements to existing access connections, require an access connection permit. Every owner of property that abuts a managed access state highway has the right to reasonable access, but not a particular means of access. This right may be restricted with respect to the highway if reasonable access can be provided by way of another local road/street. When a new private road or street is to be constructed, approval by the permitting authority is required for intersection design, spacing, and construction work on the right of way. However, if an access connection permit is issued, it will be rendered null and void if and when the road or street is duly established as a local road or street by the local governmental entity. It is the responsibility of the applicant or permit holder to obtain all necessary local, state, and federal approvals and permits (which includes all environmental permits and documentation). The access connection permit only allows the applicant permission to connect to the state highway. It is also the responsibility of the applicant to acquire any and all property rights necessary to provide continuity from the applicant’s property to the state highway.

Chapter 540
Managed Access Control
The alteration or closure of any existing access connection caused by changes to the character, intensity of development, or use of the property served by the access connection or the construction of any new access connection must not begin before an approved access connection permit is obtained. If a property owner or permit holder with a valid access connection permit wishes to change the character, use, or intensity of the property or development served by the access connection, the permitting authority must be contacted to determine whether an upgraded access connection permit will be required.
540.07 Permitting and Design Documentation An access connection permit is obtained from the department by submitting the appropriate application form, including the fee, plans, traffic data, and access connection information, to the department for review. All access connection and roadway design documents for Category II and III permits must bear the seal and signature of a professional engineer registered in Washington State. The permitting process begins with the application. Upon submittal of the application with all the attached requirements, it is reviewed and either denied or accepted. If denied, the department must notify the applicant in writing stating the reasons, and the applicant will have thirty (30) days to submit a revised application. Once the application is approved and the permit is issued, the applicant may begin construction. The Access Manager in each region keeps a record of all access points, including those that are permitted and those that are grandfathered (see Section 540.08). A permit for a grandfathered access point is not required but may be issued for recordkeeping reasons.
540.07(1) Conforming Access Connection Permit Conforming access connection permits may be issued for access connections that conform to the functional characteristics and all legal requirements for the designated class of the highway.
540.07(2) Nonconforming Access Connection Permit Nonconforming access connection permits may be issued:
•
•
•
•
•
For short-term access connections pending the availability of a future joint-use access connection or local road/street system access. For location and spacing not meeting requirements. For Category I through IV permits. After an analysis and determination by the department that a conforming access connection cannot be made at the time of permit application submittal. After a finding that the denial of an access connection will leave the property without a reasonable means of access to the local road/street system.
In such instances, the permit is to be noted as being a nonconforming access connection permit and may contain the following specific restrictions and provisions:
•
•
•
•
•
Limits on the maximum vehicular use of the access connection. The future availability of alternate means of reasonable access for which a conforming access connection permit can be obtained. The removal of the nonconforming access connection at the time the conforming access is available. The properties to be served by the access connection. Other conditions as necessary to carry out the provisions of RCW 47.50.

Chapter 540
Managed Access Control
540.07(3) Variance Access Connection Permit Variance access connection is a special nonconforming or additional access connection permit issued for longterm use where future local road/street system access is not foreseeable:
•
•
For location and spacing not meeting requirements or for an access connection that exceeds the number allowed for the class. After an engineering study demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the department, that the access connection will not adversely affect the safety, maintenance, or operation of the highway in accordance with its assigned managed access class.
In such instances, the permit is to be noted as being a variance access connection permit and may contain the following specific restrictions and provisions:
•
•
•
Limits on the maximum vehicular use of the access connection The properties to be served by the access connection Other conditions as necessary to carry out the provisions of RCW 47.50
This permit will remain valid until modified or revoked by the permitting authority unless an upgraded permit is required due to changes in property site use (see Section 540.08(1)). A variance access connection permit must not be issued for an access connection that does not conform to minimum corner clearance requirements (see Section 540.04).
540.07(4) Corner Clearance Design Analysis 540.07(4)(a) Outside Incorporated City Limits A design analysis request will be required for nonconforming access connections if corner clearance criteria are not met. The ASDE should be involved early in the process. Such an access will be outside the corner radius and as close as feasible to the property line farthest away from the intersection. An exception to the above may be allowed for a single-family residence, serving a single residence, not meeting the minimum corner clearance criteria and having no feasible connection to the local cross street. One single family home generates a very low volume of traffic and will pose a low conflict potential for traffic on the State Highway System. A single-family access connection exception is to comply with the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
•
Serves a single residence Access is to be outside the corner radius Access is to be located as close as feasible to the property line farthest away from the intersection The denial of an access connection would leave the property without a reasonable means of access. The connection is to be relocated to a local road/street system, if one becomes available.
Document the above criteria in the access connection permit.
540.07(4)(b) Within Incorporated Cities In accordance with RCW 35.78.030 and RCW 47.50, incorporated cities and towns have jurisdiction over access permitting on streets designated as state highways and, therefore, no design analysis by WSDOT will be required. On WSDOT projects, document decisions made on these accesses in the DDP.

540.08 Other Considerations 540.08(1) Changes in Property Site Use With Permitted Access Connection The access connection permit is issued to the permit holder for a particular type of land use generating specific projected traffic volumes at the final stage of proposed development. Any changes made in the use, intensity of development, type of traffic, or traffic flow require the permit holder, an assignee, or the property owner to contact the department to determine whether further analysis is needed because the change is significant and will require a new permit and modifications to the access connection (WAC 468-51-110). A significant change is one that will cause a change in the category of the access connection permit or one that causes an operational, safety, or maintenance problem on the state highway system based on objective engineering criteria or available collision data. Such data will be provided to the property owner and/or permit holder and tenant upon written request (WAC 468-51-110).
540.08(2) Existing Access Connections 540.08(2)(a) Closure of Grandfathered Access Connections Any access connections that were in existence and in active use on July 1, 1990, are grandfathered. The grandfathered access connection may continue unless:
•
•
•
There are changes from the 1990 AWDVTE. There are changes from the 1990 established use. The department determines that the access connection does not provide minimum acceptable levels of highway safety and mobility based on collision and/or traffic data or accepted traffic engineering criteria, a copy of which must be provided to the property owner, permit holder, and/or tenant upon written request (WAC 468-51-130).
540.08(2)(b) Department Construction Projects i Notification The department must notify affected property owners, permit holders, business owners, and emergency services in writing, when appropriate, whenever the department’s work program requires the modification, relocation, or replacement of its access connections. In addition to written notification, the department will facilitate, when appropriate, a process that may include, but is not limited to, public notices, meetings, or hearings, as well as individual meetings.
ii Modification Considerations When the number, location, or design of existing access connections to the state highway is being modified by a department construction project, the resulting modified access connections must provide the same general functionality for the existing property use as they did before the modification, taking into consideration the existing site design, normal vehicle types, and traffic circulation requirements. These are evaluated on an individual basis. It is important to remember that the intent is not to damage the property owner by removing nonconforming access connections, but to eliminate access connections that are both nonconforming and not needed.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 540-14
Chapter 540
Managed Access Control
The permitting authority evaluates each property individually to make a determination about which category of access connection (see Section 540.05) and which design template (see Chapter 1340) will be reasonable. If it is a commercial parcel, determine whether the business can function with one access connection. Each parcel, or contiguous parcels under the same ownership being used for the same purpose, is allowed only one access connection. If the business cannot function properly with only one access connection, a variance permit may be issued for additional access connections. If the property is residential, only one access connection is allowed; however, certain circumstances might require an additional access connection (see 540.07(4)(a)).
iii Costs: Replacement of/Modifications to Existing Access Connections The costs of modifying or replacing the access points are borne by the department if the department construction project caused the replacement or modification. Modification of the connection may require a change to the existing permit.
540.08(3) Work by Permit Holder’s Contractor The department requires that work by the owner’s contractor be accomplished at the completion of the department’s contract or be scheduled so as not to interfere with the department’s contractor. The department may require a surety bond prior to construction of the access connection in accordance with WAC 468-51-070.
540.09 Preconstruction Conference All new access connections, including alterations and improvements to existing access connections to the highway, require an access connection permit. The permitting authority may require a preconstruction conference prior to any work being performed on the access. The preconstruction conference must be attended by those necessary to ensure compliance with the terms and provisions of the permit. Details regarding the individual access connections will be included in the construction permit. This may include access connection widths, drainage requirements, surfacing requirements, mailbox locations, and other information (WAC 468-51090).
540.10 Adjudicative Proceedings Any person who can challenge any of the following departmental actions may request an adjudicative proceeding (an appeal to an Administrative Law Judge) within thirty (30) days of the department’s written decision (WAC 468-51-150):
•
•
•
•
•
•
Denial of an access connection permit application pursuant to WAC 468-51-080 Permit conditions pursuant to WAC 468-51-150 Permit modifications pursuant to WAC 468-51-120 Permit revocation pursuant to WAC 468-51-120 Closure of permitted access connection pursuant to WAC 468-51-120 Closure of grandfathered access connection pursuant to WAC 468-51-130
An appeal of a decision by the department can be requested only if the administrative fee has been paid. If the fee has not been paid, the permit application is considered incomplete and an adjudicative proceeding cannot be requested.

540.10(1) Adjudicative Proceedings Process Following is a brief summary of the adjudicative proceeding process. For the purpose of this summary, the responsibilities of the department are separated into those actions required of the region and those actions required of Headquarters. The summary is written as if the appealable condition was a denial of an access connection request. 1. The region receives an access connection permit application, with fee. 2. The region processes the application and makes a determination that the access connection request will be denied. 3. The region sends the applicant a written letter denying the access connection. Included in this letter is notification that the applicant has thirty (30) days to request an adjudicative proceeding if the applicant disagrees with the region’s denial decision. The region must notify affected property owners, permit holders, business owners, tenants, lessees, and emergency services, as appropriate. 4. The applicant requests, within thirty (30) days, an adjudicative proceeding. 5. The region reviews its initial denial decision and determines whether there is any additional information presented that justifies reversing the original decision. 6. If the region determines that the original denial decision will stand, the region then forwards copies of all applicable permit documentation to the HQ Development Services & Access Manager for review and processing. 7. The HQ Development Services & Access Manager reviews the permit application and sends the permit documentation and appeal request to the Office of the Attorney General (AG). 8. If the initial findings of the AG agree with the region’s denial decision, the AG’s Office sends the applicant a written letter, with the AG’s signature, informing the applicant that a hearing will be scheduled for the applicant to appeal in person the department’s decision to deny access. 9. The region reserves a location and obtains a court reporter, and Headquarters obtains an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to conduct the proceeding. The AG, by written letter, notifies the applicant of the time and place for the hearing. The AG’s Office has ninety (90) days from receipt of the applicant’s appeal to approve or deny the appeal application, schedule a hearing, or decide not to conduct a hearing. The actual hearing date can be set beyond this ninety-day (90-day) review period. 10. The AG’s Office leads the department’s presentation and works with the region regarding who will testify and what displays and other information will be presented to the ALJ. The HQ Development Services & Access Manager will typically not attend these proceedings. 11. After hearing all the facts, the ALJ issues a decision, usually within a few weeks after the proceedings. However, the ALJ has ninety (90) days in which to serve a written Initial Order stating the decision. 12. The ALJ’s decision is final unless the applicant, or the department through the HQ Development Services & Access Manager, decides to appeal the ALJ’s decision to the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division. This second appeal must occur within twenty (20) days of the ALJ’s written decision. 13. If appealed to the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, the Director & State Design Engineer has ninety (90) days to review the Initial Order and all the facts and supporting documentation and issue a Final Order. The review by the Director & State Design Engineer does not require the applicable parties to be present and may involve only a review of the material submitted at the adjudicative proceeding.

14. The Director & State Design Engineer’s decision is final unless appealed within thirty (30) days to the Washington State Superior Court. The above represents a general timeline if all appeals are pursued. Based on the noted timelines, it can take nearly a year before a Final Order is issued. If appealed to Superior Court, up to an additional 18 months can be added to the process. In any case, contact the region Development Services Engineer for further guidance and direction if an appeal might be forthcoming.

Freeway Access Revision Exhibit 550-1 Non-Access Feasibility Study Process Exhibit 550-2 Access Revision Report Process Exhibit 550-3 Access Revision Documentation and Review/Approval Levels
550.01 Overview It is in the national and state interest to preserve and enhance the Interstate and non-Interstate freeway system in Washington providing an appropriate level of service in terms of safety and mobility performance for the movement of people and goods. Full control of access along the freeway mainline and ramps, along with control of access on the local roadway network within the interchange functional area, is critical to providing such service. Therefore, decisions to approve new or revised interchange access points on Washington’s freeways depend on consistent application of procedures, analysis, and supporting documentation. In , the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) significantly revised its access policy. In the memorandum transmitting the new policy to the FHWA Division Administrators, FHWA states: “The FHWA has identified several areas where the current Policy may be streamlined to eliminate duplication with other project reviews. The new Policy will now focus on the technical feasibility of any proposed change in access in support of FHWA's determination of safety, operational, and engineering acceptability. Consideration of the social, economic, and environmental impacts and planning considerations will be addressed through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review of the project. This change will eliminate the potential for duplicative analysis of those issues in the State DOT's Interstate Access report and the NEPA documentation. The change will allow State DOTs to submit only a single technical report describing the types and results of technical analyses conducted to show that the change in access will not have significant negative impact on the safety and operations of the Interstate System.” The federal policy change points to a clear link between the NEPA and access revision processes. The NEPA process will account for the social, economic, and environmental impacts and a technical report herein called the Access Revision Report (ARR) will account for the safety and operational impacts.
550.02 Freeway Access Policy Federal law requires FHWA approval of all access revisions to the Interstate system. Both FHWA and WSDOT policy require the formal submission of a request to either add, revise, or abandon access to freeways. FHWA and WSDOT freeway access policies also require proposed access changes be consistent with the vision, goals, and long-range transportation plans of a metropolitan area, region, and state.

Chapter 550
Freeway Access Revision
Interstate freeways: New or revised access to Interstate freeways requires collaboration with and approval from FHWA. WSDOT and local partners need to include FHWA from the beginning of the planning process throughout the development of the proposal. WSDOT is the only entity recognized by FHWA Washington Division that is allowed to submit requests for Interstate access revisions for review and approval. Non-Interstate freeways: New or revised access to non-Interstate freeways requires engagement with and approval from WSDOT. For consistency in analysis and reporting, the policy to revise freeway access is the same for both Interstate and non-Interstate freeways. The only major difference is in the approving authorities, described above. Exhibit 550-3 helps clarify what is considered an access revision and presents approval authorities for both Interstate and non-Interstate access revisions. The contents of this chapter provides the requirements and expectations to fulfill this policy. Note: For breaks in freeway limited access that do not involve new, revised, or abandoned traffic interchanges, follow procedures given in Chapter 530 Limited Access Control. Examples include locked gates, pedestrian structures, and access to fire hydrants within the full control limited access. Contact the HQ Design Office, Access and Hearings Section for support.
550.03 Access Revision Process The access revision process begins when an entity considers the potential of revising access to a freeway (Interstate or non-Interstate). There are two distinct steps in the access revision process: a non-access feasibility study and an Access Revision Report. Both steps focus on safety performance and operations for all modes. The feasibility study is the beginning of the process and the conclusion of the feasibility study defines the purpose and verifies the need for a potential access revision. If the feasibility study concludes that an access revision is not necessary, the process is finished. If the feasibility study concludes that an access revision is necessary, then an Access Revision Report is written and the conclusion of the ARR determines the preferred access revision alternative. These two steps are detailed in the subsequent sections of this chapter. Exhibit 550-1 presents a flow chart detailing the Non-Access Feasibility Study process; Exhibit 550-2 provides the ARR process. For the process to be successful, there needs to be a clear link to the planning and environmental processes. The planning linkage should be addressed at the beginning of the process to make sure the access revision decision aligns with local, regional, and state planning efforts. This planning linkage is discussed in more detail in Section 550.05(2)(a). The environmental linkage exists throughout the process as the Federal policy promotes a more direct link between this access revision process and the environmental process. This chapter includes callouts to the environmental process at key points to highlight this linkage and to help align the processes and reduce duplication between the two processes. The access revision and practical design processes correlate through the use of the Context and Modal Accommodation Report (CMAR) and the Basis of Design (BOD). The CMAR can help determine modal priority and accommodation on non-freeway segments, such as the crossroad proposed for the freeway access connection. The CMAR may be completed during the feasibility study. The BOD can help document baseline and contextual needs and set the direction for a future project. Sections 1 through 3 of the BOD (Project Need, Context, and Design Controls) may be completed at the end of the Non-Access Feasibility Study. Sections 4 and 5 (Alternatives Analysis and Design Element Selection) of the BOD should be completed in conjunction with the ARR. The BOD completed with the ARR may be considered the scoping BOD. Use the Design Support website to download the CMAR, the CMAR learners Guide, the Basis of Design and Alternatives Comparison Table. https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/design-tools-and-support

Freeway Access Revision
550.03(1) Scalability The access revision process varies greatly due to the complexities of the transportation system and context environment planned for the horizon year (see Chapter 1103). Not all access revision cases require a full-scale ARR. Exhibit 550-3 reflects the access revision documentation levels for select project types. For variation from Exhibit 550-3 or clarification on scalability, discuss with the Assistant State Design Engineer (ASDE). Document the scalability in the method and assumptions documents.
550.03(2) Environmental Documentation Linkage Implement Planning and Environmental Linkage (PEL) principles during the access revision process to minimize rework in the environmental review/NEPA stage of the project. Using the PEL approach is most valuable where an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required. Chapter 200 of the Environmental Manual details this beneficial link between planning and environmental processes. The new FHWA policy states clearly that the environmental documentation and access revision processes be linked and aligned to reduce duplication of effort. Throughout this access revision analysis process, key points correlate with the environmental process. For best results, make sure the environmental staff is fully engaged and involved in the process. Region Environmental staff will help determine the best NEPA / SEPA compliance strategy. The team, including FHWA, determines the type of environmental document required during the feasibility phase of access review. Since FHWA approval of Interstate access revisions entails a federal action, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements apply to Interstate access reviews. If NEPA does not apply to a freeway access revision, environmental documentation through the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) does apply. In either case, the team, comprised of experts and agents from WSDOT and FHWA, is authorized to determine the type of environmental documentation required. If the team determines the project can be documented as a Categorical Exclusion/ Exemption (CE), involvement from environmental staff at key decision points will help ensure the project is appropriately scoped and environmental considerations are integrated into the ARR as appropriate. For a CE, information from the NonAccess Feasibility Study can be useful but is typically much more detailed than the information required for the CE checklist.
550.04 Support Teams 550.04(1) Executive Support Team Establish an executive support team before beginning the feasibility study. The executive support team is active throughout the access revision process. Their primary duty is to interpret policy and set direction for their representatives involved in the technical support team. The representatives will be signees on the deliverables that are required throughout this chapter. The executive support team meets to monitor the progress of the deliverables and prepares records of meeting minutes and decisions. Due to the scalability of the process, the executive support team can vary with each access revision case but will typically have a core of the following individuals:
•
•
•
•
•
FHWA Safety and Geometric Design Engineer Region Representatives (Assistant Regional Administer, Traffic Engineer, Local Programs Engineer, Environmental Manager, and/or Planning Manager) Assistant State Design Engineer HQ Transportation Operations Division Local agency representatives (city, county, port, transit and/or tribal government)

Chapter 550
Freeway Access Revision
550.04(2) Technical Support Team The technical support team conducts a majority of the detailed analyses required throughout the access revision process. This team meets regularly to ensure deliverables and project details are coordinated across disciplines. A subgroup of the technical team may also conduct separate meetings to coordinate specific details. The technical team delivers results and conclusions of their work back to the executive support team for review and approval. The technical group records and tracks meeting minutes and action items. Due to the scalability of the process, the technical support team can vary with each access revision case. Work with the executive support team to make sure the right personnel are on the team. The team members may include representation from the following groups:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Planning organization (Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) and/or Regional Transportation Planning Organization (RTPO)) FHWA (Area Engineer, Environmental Program Manager, and/or ITS Engineer) WSDOT Region (planning, design, environmental, maintenance, and/or traffic) WSDOT HQ Multimodal Development & Delivery Local agency specialist (planning, developer services, public works, and/or engineering) Project proponents specialists (developer and/or consultant) Multimodal specialist (transit, bike, and/or pedestrian) Other identified stakeholders/partners
550.05 Non-Access Feasibility Study Process The goal of this first step in the access revision process is to look at the non-access transportation network to determine if improvements can be made that address performance gaps for all modes. Non-access improvements are solutions that do not impact the gore points to/from the mainline of the freeway. Examples are changes to the local street network, travel demand management, traffic operations enhancements, crossroads, ramp meters, minor geometric ramp modifications, transit, and minor ramp terminal modifications. The Non-Access Feasibility Study is a multistep process and begins (see Exhibit 550-1) with assembling an executive support team. The WSDOT Region assembles the executive support team. The executive support team convenes and the local, regional, tribal, or state entity that is the proponent of the access revision presents the performance gaps that represent the probable baseline needs for an access revision. If the executive support team agrees there is a probable performance gap that needs further study, then the technical support team is formed. The technical support team develops the draft purpose and need and the process of conducting a nonaccess feasibility study begins and a method and assumptions (M&A) document is prepared.

Linking to the state and local planning representatives is essential. It is possible that a local planning study has been conducted that meets the requirements of the non-access feasibility study. If this is the case, the executive support team can make the determination that the planning study is sufficient and move on to the ARR. It is necessary to also coordinate with the region’s environmental representative to help ensure the local planning study is sufficient in developing the purpose and need necessary for the environmental process.
550.05(1) Non-Access Feasibility Study Methods and Assumptions Document The next step in a Non-Access Feasibility Study is to create a methods and assumptions (M&A) document that establishes the methods followed while the study is being conducted and the assumptions made during the study. Cover the following points in the M&A document:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Team Participants o Executive team members, roles, and responsibilities o Technical team members, roles, and responsibilities Scalability (if applicable, see Section 530.03(1) and Exhibit 550-3) Planning Linkage o Pertinent planning documents o Prior community engagement Environmental Linkage o Probable environmental documentation: EIS, EA, or CE o NEPA/SEPA compliance strategy Community Engagement o See Community Engagement Plan Alternatives Selection o Process for determining non-access reasonable alternatives including alternative development and screening Traffic Operational Analysis Scope and Scale o Determine the study area for operational analysis. For efficiency and uniformity of data, it may be beneficial to assume a freeway access revision will be necessary when determining the study area. Discuss the study area in detail, reach agreement on its scope and scale, and record in the M&A document. Typical analysis study areas include: ▪ Particularly in urbanized areas, at least the first adjacent existing or proposed interchange on either side of where an access revision is being considered and the entire freeway components within this area. ▪ The crossroads to at least the first major intersection on either side of where the access revision is being considered. The local street network should be extended as necessary to fully evaluate the impacts of the proposed change in access. ▪ Incorporate connections to the transit network inside the study area as modifications to the transit service may impact travel demand. ▪ Incorporate regional trails and shared-use paths inside the study area as improving multimodal connectivity may impact travel demand. o Study period: AM/PM Peak, midday, weekends o Study years: Current, opening, design/horizon o Methodology: Highway Capacity Manual or other tool o Multimodal priorities and accommodation

The above list is not all-encompassing nor is everything in the list covered in every study. The technical support team refines the above list as necessary and submits the outline of the feasibility study to the executive support team for concurrence. The Non-Access Feasibility Study M&A document contains a signature page for concurrence by the executive support team. A template for the M&A document is here: Non-Access-Feasibility-Study-Signature-Page.docx (live.com) The Non-Access Feasibility Study may begin upon concurrence of the M&A document.
550.05(2) Non-Access Feasibility Study Conduct and document the non-access feasibility study following the assumptions and guidance set forth in the M&A document. This determines whether non-access improvements can address the performance gaps agreed upon by the executive support team. The Non-Access Feasibility Study contains the following items:
•
•
•
•
Signature Page Project Background Vicinity Map o Study Area Planning Linkage (see Section 550.05(2)(a)) o Multimodal Needs
•
•
•
•
•
Traffic Volumes (see Section 550.05(2)(b)) Traffic Operational Analysis (see Section 550.05(2)(c)) Safety Performance Analysis (see Section 550.05(2)(d)) Reasonable Non-Access Alternatives (see Section 550.05(2)(e)) Conclusion (see Section 550.05(2)(f)) o Purpose and Need for Access Revision
Non-Access Feasibility Study is compiled and reviewed first by the technical support team prior to being sent to the executive support team for signature.

If the process does not go into the ARR phase, then send a final copy of the Non-Access Feasibility Report to your ASDE for filing. If the process continues into the ARR phase, then attach the Non-Access Feasibility Report to the ARR as an appendix.
550.05(2)(a) Planning Linkage It is essential to create the linkage to the transportation planning processes and outputs by the WSDOT and other agencies in the non-access feasibility study. Any transportation improvement considered in the access revision process should align with these planning processes. Describe how the improvements are consistent with local land use plans, and local, regional, and state transportation plans including possible future interchanges, bicyclist/pedestrian networks, transit service, and possible development. While the need for freeway access is motor vehicle based, it is also important to address the needs of all modes that will access and use the local networks and freeway crossroad(s). An important aspect of the planning linkage is to address multimodal connectivity on the crossroad. While interchange crossroads may provide vehicle access to and from the freeway mainline, they also provide critical multimodal connectivity between land uses on either side of the freeway. Consult comprehensive land use and transportation plans for multimodal elements. Document multimodal needs, priority, and accommodation in the Non-Access Feasibility Study. A non-access feasibility study may be performed in conjunction with another planning process. When a nonaccess feasibility study is performed in conjunction with another planning process, then that process must address the requirements for a non-access feasibility study in addition to requirements of other planning processes. Include WSDOT Planning and local agency staff (land use and transportation planning specialties) in the technical support team to determine if this linkage is possible or beneficial. If another planning process or study appears to meet the requirements of the Non-Access Feasibility Study, have the technical support team review it and determine if it is applicable. If the technical team finds the process or study meets the requirements of the feasibility study, then present it to the executive support team and request an exemption from the feasibility study process. Clearly document this exemption and receive written approval from the members of the executive support team.
550.05(2)(b) Traffic Volumes Traffic volumes for the existing, opening, design, and horizon year are determined and reported in the feasibility study. It is important to consider pedestrian, bicyclist, and transit volumes where applicable. The existing year is the year the traffic data is collected. Consult Chapter 1103 for definitions and details of opening, design, and horizon years. The data for the future years may come from a regional transportation model or linear projections unique to the study. Exponential growth projections are not recommended. Regional transportation models may also be used for the opening and design year volumes. Transportation models are commonly maintained by a Metropolitan Planning Organization. These models predict traffic volumes by dividing the area into zones, populating these zones with the appropriate type of land use, and predicting travel demand on the road network based upon the trip demand and travel time between destinations. The process to develop these models is extensive; therefore, the models are not continuously updated. Opening/design years that do not correlate with the years of the regional transportation model may be adjusted by a linear growth rate to the opening/design year of the traffic study. The technical support team determines how to best use an available model. Document the model used, how the model was calibrated and validated. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 550-8
Chapter 550
Freeway Access Revision
Traffic models used for the ARR process should incorporate transit, bicyclists, and pedestrians. If the model does not have the ability to incorporate these other modes, investigate the viability of modifying link and intra-zone trips with the technical support team to reflect the multimodal trips. Consider how changing access to these other modes may impact travel demand within and through the study area. If linear projections are used, be careful to not base projection on a valley or peak in historic traffic volumes. Record any assumptions applied to linear projections in the feasibility study.
550.05(2)(c) Operational Analysis Conduct the operational analysis over the study area, using the tools and methodology in accordance with the M&A document. Conduct the operational analysis on the opening and design year. The technical support team determines if it is necessary to have existing year analysis or if the no-build at opening year is sufficient. For these years:
•
•
•
Conduct the Existing operational analysis over the study area (if required by the technical support team) o No change in the existing roadway network. o Use the existing traffic volumes and calibrate to existing conditions to determine if the analysis reflects existing conditions and the model is validated. Conduct Base Improvements operational analysis over the study area. o The existing roadway network with the addition of local or non-access transportation projects and services that are funded for construction/delivery or have a high likelihood of being constructed/delivered, as identified as base network improvements in the M&A document. Incorporate base network improvements into the analysis. o The result of this base improvements operational analysis is a list of the locations where the transportation system has potential performance gaps. Compare this list of locations to the performance gaps identified in the beginning of the access revision process. The analysis helps clarify whether or not performance gaps exist. Identify these gaps in the report. These identified gaps will be where the technical support team focuses in the operational analysis done for the reasonable non-access alternatives. This leads to identification of performance targets by mode. Conduct the Build operational analysis over the study area. o Incorporate the base improvements as the starting point, then evaluate reasonable nonaccess alternatives as discussed in Section 550.05(2)(e) o The build operational analysis assesses whether the non-access alternatives address the identified performance gaps.
i Intersection Control Evaluation (New Section 2023) Conduct an Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) per Section 1300.05 or incorporate the requirements of an ICE into the non-access feasibility study operational analysis for all parts of the study area that are state highways. If the non-access feasibility study appropriately incorporates all aspects of Section 1300.05 into the study, a separate ICE for state highway intersections will not be required.
550.05(2)(d) Safety Analysis Conduct a safety analysis per Chapter 321.04 and Section 8.1 of the Safety Analysis Guide. In this section of the feasibility study, discuss the safety performance of the existing transportation network. For the non-access Feasibility Study, the safety analysis needs to focus on the non-access network; safety analysis of the freeway mainline is not required. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 550-9
Chapter 550
Freeway Access Revision
550.05(2)(e) Reasonable Non-Access Alternatives The Non-Access Feasibility Study must look at reasonable alternatives that can address the performance gaps noted in the operational analysis and/or safety performance analysis. The determination of reasonable alternatives follows the process as noted in Chapter 400.07(1)4 of the WSDOT Environmental Manual. Each reasonable alternative must consider the change in safety performance per the Safety Analysis Guide. The goal of the alternatives is to identify non-access improvements and performance targets that address operation gaps and safety performance characteristics for all modes. Alternatives should first consider nonaccess, operational and/or demand management improvements. Coordinate these improvements with local and state planning staff. The technical support team initiates alternatives for consideration and presents them to the executive support team for approval. Include alternatives comprised of varying types such as intersection solutions, corridor solutions, land use modifications, transit improvements, mode shift, travel demand management or other systematic network-based Practical Solutions approaches. Use the measures of effectiveness discussed in the methods and assumptions document to compare alternatives. Provide a list of non-access improvements needed to address the performance gaps. If an improvement will be within the state’s jurisdiction, then complete a scoping Basis of Design for this improvement and include as an appendix to the feasibility study. If the non-access improvements can address the performance gaps within the criteria defined in the M&A, then state such in this section and conclude the access revision process. If the non-access improvements do not completely address the performance gaps, but do show value, then they should be carried forward into the access revision analysis for further inclusion in the project.
550.05(2)(f) Non-Access Conclusion If the non-access improvements can address the performance gaps within the criteria defined in the M&A, then state such in this section and conclude the access revision process. If the feasibility study indicates that addressing performance gaps cannot be reasonably achieved without revising freeway access, then write a purpose and need for access revision in this section of the feasibility study. This purpose and need statement should be written in close coordination with the Environmental Office as this is a key linkage point between the NEPA/SEPA process and the access revision process. The goal of this section is to provide a purpose and need statement that can be used for the Access Revision Report, a Basis of Design for an access revision, and the NEPA/SEPA process. In addition to the purpose and needs statement, summarize the non-access alternatives that are needed and carried this list forward into the ARR.
550.06 Access Revision Report Process In order to approve or reject a proposed revision to freeway access, specific analyses are to be completed and then documented in a technical report. This report is the Access Revision Report (ARR), previously known as an Interchange Justification Report (IJR). The proponents, with the help of the support team, prepares the ARR. One of the first steps should be the formation of the Executive Support Team. See Section 550.04. Next develop a methods and assumptions document as outlined in Section 550.05(2). The M&A document will be used to analyze the access revision and assist in developing the Access Revision Report.

Freeway Access Revision
550.06(1) Access Revision Report Method and Assumptions Document Begin by reevaluating the Non-Access Feasibility Study M&A to determine if it is applicable to the ARR. Pay attention to the sections on alternatives selection and assumptions. These two sections will likely change between the feasibility and the ARR phases. If there is no change, the Non-Access Feasibility M&A may be adopted by the executive committee. If a modification of the M&A is necessary, the executive committee has the ability to require a full rewrite or to agree to a scaled down effort for the ARR. If a full rewrite is necessary, follow the same outline as presented in Section 550.05(1) with the addition of allowing on-system improvements.
550.06(2) Access Revision Report The Access Revision Report addresses: 1. 2. 3. 4.
Reasonable Alternatives; see Section 550.06(2)(a) Operational Analysis; see Section 550.06(2)(b) Safety Performance Analysis; see Section 550.06(2)(c) Conceptual Signing Plan; see Section 550.06(2)(d)
The following provides details for completing the Access Revision Report.
550.06(2)(a) ARR Reasonable Alternatives Consider alternatives in the Non-Access Feasibility Study that are carried forward into the ARR process and any new alternatives that may be developed for on-system alternatives. Then narrow the alternatives down to a few reasonable alternatives that will go through the evaluation process. Determine the reasonable alternatives for the ARR phase near the beginning of the process. This is necessary because the alternatives will set the course for the operational and safety analysis and determine exactly what must be analyzed. The technical team evaluates each reasonable alternative with respect to operations and safety performance for all modes (see Section 550.06(2)(b) and 550.06(2)(c)). Alternatives are refined based upon the results of the analysis and then presented to the executive support team for acceptance. Conduct the alternatives selection and analysis process within the ARR with full consideration of the environmental process and environmental documentation that will be required. The ARR must be fully compatible with the corresponding environmental process. Include Region environmental staff in the alternatives selection process. In the ARR document, include a description of the reasonable alternatives identified for consideration. At this point, you should have a few reasonable alternatives that will be carried forward through the whole ARR process and will have detailed operations and safety analysis conducted (see Section 550.06(2)(b) and 550.06(2)(c)). The results of this analysis will be used to compare the alternatives and ultimately reach a preferred alternative. To document the evaluation criteria and the results of the analysis, use the Alternatives Comparison Table (ACT) or a similar tool.

Chapter 550
Freeway Access Revision
i Public Road Connection The ARR must show that the proposed access will connect to a public road network. Less than “full interchanges” may be considered on a case-by-case basis for applications requiring special access, such as managed lanes (e.g., transit or high occupancy vehicle and high occupancy toll lanes) or park and ride lots. In other cases where all basic movements are not provided by the proposed design, the ARR typically includes a full interchange option with a comparison of the operational and safety performance analyses to the partial-interchange option. The ARR should also include the mitigation proposed to compensate for the missing movements, including wayfinding signage, impacts on local intersections, mitigation of driver expectation leading to wrong-way movements on ramps, etc. The ARR should demonstrate that the future provision of a full interchange is not precluded by the proposal or describe how that future decision will be accommodated. The crossroad must address the needs of all modes that are supported by the land use and demographics of the area. While the needs and priority of multimodal users are identified in the feasibility study, the ARR helps ensure multimodal needs are incorporated in the design.
ii Design Standards and Criteria FHWA policy requires that AASHTO Interstate standards (A Policy on Design Standards – Interstate System, AASHTO, latest edition) are used. This Design Manual provides criteria to meet FHWA and WSDOT policy on geometric standards. To achieve design standards requirements, apply the criteria in these key Design Manual Chapters:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Chapters 1100 – 1106 for an overview of practical design procedures, development of need statements, procedures for selecting appropriate multimodal design controls and design element dimensions. Assume the crossroad design will have implications and effects on all travel modes legally allowed. Provide obvious traffic control for all modes. Chapters in the 1200 series provide geometrics including plan and profile elements and freeway and other roadway type cross section criteria. Chapter 1232 provides geometric cross section dimensions for Interstate and non-Interstate freeways. Other chapters in this series provide cross section criteria for roadway types which could apply to multimodal crossroads and local street or roadway contexts. Chapters in the 1300 series provide design criteria for Interchange spacing and design, and procedures for evaluating intersection control types. Chapter 1300 and Chapter 1360 For special interchanges for HOV or Transit, see chapters in the 1400 series. Chapters in the 1500 series provide design guidance for pedestrian and bicyclist facilities. See other chapters as applicable for various aspects of design and approvals.
550.06(2)(b) ARR Operational Analysis The operational analysis for the ARR builds upon the operational analysis from the feasibility study. If demonstrated in the feasibility study that local solutions will not completely satisfy the Purpose and Need, the scope of the ARR operational analysis includes reasonable alternatives that consider revisions in freeway access as well as non-access improvements that are carried forward from the Non-Access Feasibility Study.

Freeway Access Revision
This analysis must conclude that the proposed change in access does not have a significant adverse impact on the safety and operation of the freeway facility or on the local street network for all modes, based on both current and planned future traffic projections. The freeway facility includes the main line lanes, collectordistributor lanes, existing, new, or modified ramps, and ramp intersections with crossroad. The following are typical requirements for the analysis. The technical support team makes the ultimate decisions on transportation operational and safety performance analysis requirements. However, FHWA policy suggests the following expectations.
•
•
•
•
The analysis includes, particularly in urbanized areas, a minimum of the first adjacent existing or proposed interchange on either side of the proposed change in access. The crossroads and the local street network, to a minimum of the first major intersection on either side of the proposed change in access, should be included in this analysis to the extent necessary to fully evaluate the safety performance and operational impacts that the proposed change in access and other transportation improvements may have on the local street network. The requested proposed change in access should include a description and assessment of the impacts and ability of the proposed changes to collect, distribute, and accommodate traffic on the Interstate facility, ramps, intersection of ramps with crossroad, and local street network. Intersection Control Analysis (ICE)(see Section 550.05(2)(c)i)
550.06(2)(c) ARR Safety Analysis Conduct a safety performance analysis per Chapter 321 and Section 8.1 of the Safety Analysis Guide. For the ARR, discuss the safety performance of the reasonable alternatives. Use the results of the safety performance analysis to compare alternatives.
550.06(2)(d) ARR Signing Plan Include a conceptual plan of the type and location of the signs proposed for the preferred alternative to support the Access Revision Report. The conceptual plan is typically limited to guide signage, but regulatory or warning signs may be required if the interchange configuration is unusual.
550.06(3) Access Revision Report Review and Approval A template for Access Revision Report approvals and concurrence signatures is available on the Design Tools & support webpage, under the Signature pages for approval section. Design guidance & support | WSDOT (wa.gov) Draft ARR review: The draft ARR is first reviewed by the executive and technical support teams. After their review, the Region submits an electronic copy (in PDF format), including appendices, to the ASDE along with a cover memo requesting review. The ASDE responds in writing either with needed revisions or to request the final draft. Final ARR Submittal: For final submittal, send the final ARR in PDF format to the ASDE. Contact the ASDE for the necessary number of hard copies. The Region submits a memo to the appropriate ASDE, requesting final approval of the ARR. After ASDE concurrence, the ASDE submits Interstate ARRs to FHWA for approval. ARR Approvals can be a two-step process:
•
•
If environmental documentation is not complete, teams can request a finding of engineering and operational acceptability. FHWA grants this for Interstate access revisions and WSDOT grants for noninterstate. If the environmental documentation is complete, teams request final ARR approval.

Interstate Approval Notes:
•
Interstate Access Revision Reports are most often reviewed and approved by the Washington FHWA Division Office. A 30-day review period must be allowed for the FHWA Division Office. Occasionally they are sent to FHWA Headquarters Office in Washington, DC (see Exhibit 550-3). If this is the case, additional review time is necessary.
FHWA provides final approval of the Interstate ARR when the appropriate final environmental document is complete: CE, FONSI, or ROD. The intent of the federal policy is to create a clear link between the ARR and NEPA processes. The ARR may be used as the transportation discipline report for an EIS/EA or included as an attachment to a CE. Coordinate with the Region Environmental Staff to integrate the ARR with the environmental documentation. WSDOT provides final approval of the non-Interstate ARR when the appropriate final environmental document is complete.
550.06(4) Updating the Access Revision Report The period between the approval of the Access Revision Report, completion of the environmental documentation, and the construction contract commonly spans several years. If the period exceeds three years, the approved ARR must be reviewed to identify changes that may have occurred during this period. If there have been little or no changes, an extension of the period may be granted. In this case, write a summary assessment for approval by the Region Traffic Engineer, ASDE, and FHWA. If no work has begun within three years of completion of the environmental documentation, a re-evaluation of the CE/EA/EIS may be required (see Environmental Manual 400.06(1)). Contact the Region Environmental Office to determine if the environmental documentation must be re-evaluated.

Notes: [1] Washington Transportation Management Areas include Southwest Washington Regional Transportation Council (RTC) (Clark County), Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) (King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties), and Spokane Regional Transportation Council (SRTC) (Spokane County). [2] “Revision” includes changes in interchange configuration even if the number of access points does not change. Changing from a cloverleaf to a directional interchange is an example of a “revision.” [3] “Revision” includes changes that might adversely affect the level of service of the through lanes. Examples include: doubling lanes for an on-ramp with double entry to the freeway; adding a loop ramp to an existing diamond interchange; and replacing a diamond ramp with a loop ramp. Revisions to the ramp terminal intersections may not require an ARR unless the traffic analysis shows an impact to the main line traffic. [4] The scale and scope of the access revision dictate the level of effort needed. Consult the Assistant State Design Engineer (ASDE), Region Traffic, and the FHWA Area Engineer, if applicable, for direction. [5] Consult the Region Planning Manager for the status of planning at this location. [6] An Operations and Safety Analysis must be conducted. The ASDE will send and Access Change Determination with the analysis for FHWA to determine if the proposal is considered a change in access in accordance with FHWA access policy. If FHWA determines it is not a change in access, then the ASDE sets the scale and scope of the remainder of the ARR process. Otherwise, FHWA and ASDE will be involved in setting the scale and scope.

Fencing
560.01 General 560.02 Design Criteria 560.03 Fencing Types 560.04 Gates 560.05 Procedure 560.06 Documentation 560.07 References
560.01 General Fencing is provided primarily to discourage encroachment onto Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) highway right of way from adjacent property, to delineate the right of way, and to replace fencing that has been disrupted by construction. Encroachment onto the right of way is discouraged to limit the presence of people and animals that might disrupt the efficient flow of traffic on the facility. Although not the primary intent, fencing does provide some separation between people, animals, traffic flow, and other features.
560.02 Design Criteria 560.02(1) General Fencing on a continuous alignment usually has a pleasing appearance and is the most economical to construct and maintain. The recommended practice is to locate fencing on or, depending on the terrain, 12 inches inside the right of way line. Where the anticipated or existing right of way line has abrupt irregularities over short distances, coordinate with Maintenance and Real Estate Services personnel to dispose of the irregularities as excess property (where possible) and fence the final property line in a manner acceptable to Maintenance. Whenever possible, preserve the natural assets of the surrounding area and minimize the number of fence types on any particular project.
560.02(2) Limited Access Highways On highways with full and partial limited access control, fencing is mandatory unless it has been established that such fencing may be deferred. Fencing is not required for modified limited access control areas, but may be installed where appropriate. Fencing is required between frontage roads and adjacent parking or pedestrian areas (such as rest areas and flyer stops) and highway lanes or ramps unless other barriers are used to discourage access violations. On new alignment, fencing is not provided between the frontage road and abutting property unless the abutting property was enclosed prior to highway construction. Such fencing is normally part of the right of way negotiation.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 560-1
Chapter 560
Fencing
Unless there is a possibility of access control violation, fencing installation may be deferred until needed at the following locations:
•
•
•
•
•
In areas where rough topography or dense vegetation provides a natural barrier. Along rivers or other natural bodies of water. In sagebrush country that is sparsely settled. In areas with high snowfall levels and sparse population. On long sections of undeveloped public or private lands not previously fenced.
When in doubt about fencing installation, consult the Headquarters (HQ) Access and Hearings Manager.
560.02(3) Managed Access Highways Fencing is not required for managed access highways. When highway construction will destroy the fence of an abutting property owner (which was originally constructed on private property), the cost of replacement fencing may be included in the right of way payment. When the fences of several property owners will be impacted, it may be cost-effective to replace the fences as part of the project. If fencing is essential to the safe operation of the highway, it will be constructed and maintained by the state. An example is the separation of traveled highway lanes from adjacent facilities with parking or pedestrian areas (such as rest areas and flyer stops).
560.02(4) Special Sites Fencing may be needed at special sites such as pit sites, stockpiles, borrow areas, and stormwater detention facilities. Fencing is not normally installed around stormwater detention ponds. Evaluate the need to provide fencing around stormwater detention facilities when pedestrians or bicyclists are frequently present. Document your decision in the Design Documentation Package. The following conditions suggest a need to evaluate fencing:
•
•
•
Children or persons with mobility impairments are frequently present in significant numbers in locations adjacent to the facility, such as routes identified in school walk route plans or nearby residential areas or parks. Water depth reaches or exceeds 12 inches for several days. Sideslopes into the facility are steeper than 3H:1V.
Fencing proposed at sites that will be outside WSDOT right of way requires that local ordinances be followed if they are more stringent than WSDOT’s. Wetland mitigation sites are not normally fenced. When evaluating fencing for wetland mitigation sites, balance the need to restrict human access for safety considerations (such as the presence of children) with the need to provide animal habitat. Other special sites where fencing may be required are addressed in the following chapters:
•
•
•
Section 720.03(13), Bridge Fence Chapter 1510 Pedestrian Facilities Chapter 1520 Roadway Bicycle Facilities
The fencing types and designs for special sites are determined by the requirements of each situation.

Chapter 560
Fencing
560.03 Fencing Types 560.03(1) Chain Link Installation of chain link fence is appropriate for maximum protection against right of way encroachment on sections of high-volume highways in the following locations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Along existing business districts adjacent to a freeway. Between freeways and adjacent parallel city streets. Where existing streets have been cut off by freeway construction. In industrial areas. At large residential developments. On military reservations. At schools and colleges. In recreational and athletic areas. In developed areas at the intersection of two limited access highways. At any other location where a barrier is needed to protect against pedestrian, bicyclist, or livestock encroachment in limited access areas.
For roadway sections in rock cuts, see Chapter 1239. The Standard Plans contains details for the approved types of chain link fence. The recommended uses for each type of fence are as follows:
560.03(1)(a) Type 3 This is a high fence for areas of intensified use, such as industrial areas or school playgrounds. Use this fence for new installations of high fencing. It may be used within the Design Clear Zone.
560.03(1)(b) Type 4 This is a lower fence for special use, such as between the traveled highway lanes and a rest area or transit flyer stop or as a rest area boundary fence if required by the development of the surrounding area. This fence may be used along a shared-use path or trail to separate it from an adjacent roadway. Justify why corrective action is not taken when existing fencing with a rigid top rail will be left in place within the limits of a proposed project. For cases where a more rigid fence is needed, contact the HQ Design Office. Coated galvanized chain link fence is available in various colors and may be considered in areas where aesthetic considerations are important. Coated ungalvanized chain link fence is not recommended.
560.03(2) Wire Fencing The Standard Plans and the Standard Specifications contain details for the two approved types of wire fence. The recommended uses for each type of fence are as follows:
560.03(2)(a) Type 1 This fence is used in urban and suburban areas where improvements along the right of way are infrequent and future development is not anticipated. It may also be used adjacent to livestock grazing areas. The lower portion of this fence is wire mesh and provides a barrier to children and small animals.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 560-3
Chapter 560
Fencing
560.03(2)(b) Type 2 This fence is used in farming areas to limit highway crossings by farm vehicles to designated approaches. These areas include irrigation districts to prevent ditch riders, maintenance personnel, and farmers from making unauthorized highway crossings, and where new alignment crosses parcels previously enclosed by barbed wire.
560.03(3) Other Considerations Extremely tall fences (7 to 10 feet high) may be used in areas where there are exceptional conditions such as large concentrations of deer or elk. (See the region Environmental Services Office and the Roadside Manual concerning wildlife management.) Metal fencing can interfere with airport traffic control radar. When locating fencing in the vicinity of an airport, contact the Federal Aviation Administration to determine whether metal fence will create radar interference at the airport. If so, use nonmetallic fencing. Do not straddle or obstruct surveying monuments with any type of fencing.
560.04 Gates Keep the number of fence gates along limited access highways to a minimum. On limited access highways, all new gates must be approved as described in Chapter 550. Usually such gates are necessary only to allow highway maintenance personnel and operating equipment to reach the state right of way without using the highway or freeway main line. Gates may be needed to provide access to utility supports, manholes, and so on, located within the right of way. Use gates of the same type as each fence and provide locks to deter unauthorized use. In highly developed and landscaped areas where maintenance equipment is parked outside the fence, provide the double gate shown in the Standard Plans. Where continuous fencing is not provided on limited access highways (see Chapter 530), approaches are normally gated and locked, with a short section of fence on both sides of the gate.
560.05 Procedure Fencing is addressed in the access report (see Chapter 530) and the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates, in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual.

Exhibit 610-1 Materials Source Development
610.01 General It is the Washington State Department of Transportation’s (WSDOT’s) responsibility to understand the characteristics of the soil and rock materials that support or are adjacent to a transportation facility so that, when designed, constructed, and maintained, the facility will be adequate to safely carry the estimated traffic. It is also the responsibility of WSDOT to ensure the quality and quantity of all borrow, soils, rock, and surfacing materials used in the construction of transportation facilities. Specific requirements for geotechnical investigation, design, construction, and maintenance support are set forth in the WSDOT Geotechnical Design Manual. The following information serves as guidance in the above areas. When a project consists of a surface overlay on an existing highway, the WSDOT Pavement Policy is used. Before making project budget and schedule commitments to the Legislature, other agencies, and the public, it is necessary to identify the extent and estimated cost for a project. Contact the Region Materials Engineer (RME) and the Headquarters (HQ) Geotechnical Office as early as possible to obtain conceptual-level recommendations regarding how the project soil, rock, and groundwater conditions may affect the design of the project elements. The project soil, rock, and groundwater conditions, and the availability, quantity, and quality of borrow and surfacing materials, can affect the project scope, schedule, and budget. The RME and the HQ Geotechnical Office will use existing subsurface information and their knowledge of the project area to assess the subsurface conditions within the project limits. If there is little information available or the information is poor, and the subsurface conditions have the potential to significantly affect the project budget or schedule, it may be necessary to obtain a limited number of geotechnical borings or test pits during Project Definition to assess soil, rock, and groundwater conditions within the project limits. Once the Project Definition has been developed and project funding secured, a more detailed geotechnical investigation follows during the design and Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) phases. It is essential to involve the RME and the HQ Geotechnical Office in the design as soon as possible once the need for geotechnical work is identified. (See Section 610.04(3) for time-estimate information.) If major changes occur as the project is developed, inform the RME and the HQ Geotechnical Office as soon as possible so that the geotechnical design can be adapted to the changes without significant delay to the project.

610.03 Materials Sources 610.03(1) General The region Project Development Engineer determines when a materials source is needed. The RME determines the best materials source for the project (see Exhibit 610-1). It is preferred that existing approved materials source sites be used when there are suitable sites available. When there are no approved sites available, the RME determines the locations for new materials sources. The RME contacts the HQ Geotechnical Office to provide a geotechnical investigation for the proposed site. The HQ Geotechnical Office provides geologic mapping of the site; develops a subsurface exploration plan and cost estimate; conducts the subsurface investigation; develops a subsurface geologic model including groundwater; evaluates slope stability issues; and makes recommendations. The HQ Geotechnical Office develops and provides a geotechnical report with materials source development recommendations to the RME. The RME uses this report and materials source recommendations to develop the Materials Source Report and to identify the quantity and quality of material that are intended for the life of the materials source. Specific requirements for materials source investigations are set forth in the Geotechnical Design Manual.
610.03(2) Materials Source Approval The HQ Geotechnical Office must review and approve the Materials Source Report produced by the RME to ensure consistency with the geotechnical report produced by the HQ Geotechnical Office. The HQ Materials Office and the HQ Design Office must approve each pit or quarry site before it is purchased, leased, or acquired on a royalty basis. Until the approval process is complete, the project cannot be advertised for bids. Local and state permits are required for materials sources. To avoid delay in advertising the project, begin the site investigations and permitting process in the early stages of the Project Definition phase.
610.04 Geotechnical Investigation, Design, and Reporting 610.04(1) General A geotechnical investigation is conducted on all projects that involve significant grading quantities (including state-owned materials source development), unstable ground, foundations for structures, and groundwater impacts (including infiltration). The goal of the geotechnical investigation is to preserve the safety of those who use the facility, as well as to preserve the economic investment by the state of Washington. Additional WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 610-2
Chapter 610
Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
requirements regarding geotechnical investigations and who conducts these investigations are set forth in the Geotechnical Design Manual.
610.04(2) Key Contacts for Initiating Geotechnical Work For regions, the RME is the first person to contact for geotechnical work. Projects with structures designed by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, Washington State Ferries (WSF) projects, and Urban Corridors projects generally require the involvement of the HQ Geotechnical Office. These particular WSDOT offices should contact the HQ Geotechnical Office directly for their geotechnical project needs. The specific roles and responsibilities of the RME and HQ Geotechnical Office, including application to the Project Management Process (PMP), are set forth in the Geotechnical Design Manual. For information on retaining walls and noise walls, see Design Manual Chapter 730 and Chapter 740, respectively. For geosynthetic design, see Chapter 630.
610.04(3) Scheduling Considerations for Geotechnical Work The region Project Office, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, the WSF, and the HQ Facilities Office are responsible for identifying the potential need for geotechnical work and requesting time and budget estimates from the RME or the HQ Geotechnical Office as early as possible to prevent delays to the project. Once the geotechnical design request and the site data are received by the RME or the HQ Geotechnical Office, it can take from two to six months or more to complete the geotechnical design. Design completion depends on the complexity of the project, whether or not test holes are needed, current workload, the need to give the work to consultants, and how long it takes to obtain environmental permits and rights of entry. If a consultant must be used, the minimum time required to complete a design (for even a simple project) is typically two and a half months. In true emergency situations (such as a highway blocked by a landslide or a collapsed bridge), it is possible to get geotechnical design work completed (in-house or by consultants) more rapidly to at least provide a design for temporary mitigation. Consider all of these factors when deciding how soon (in general, as early as possible) to initiate the geotechnical work for a project. To incorporate geotechnical scheduling considerations into the overall project schedule, see the Geotechnical Design Manual, which provides a description and discussion of the Master Deliverables List (MDL) as it applies to geotechnical work.
610.04(4) Site Data and Permits Needed to Initiate Geotechnical Work 610.04(4)(a) Geotechnical Work During Project Definition Phase To initiate geotechnical work on a project during the Project Definition phase, provide the following information: 1. Project description. 2. Plan view or description showing the proposed alignment or alignment alternative(s). 3. Description of project scope as it relates to geotechnical features such as major cuts and fills, walls, structures, and potential stormwater facilities.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 610-3
Chapter 610
Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
610.04(4)(b) Geotechnical Work During Design and PS&E Phases To initiate geotechnical work on a project during the design and PS&E phases, provide the following information: 1. Project description. 2. Plan sheets showing: o Station and location of cuts, fills, walls, bridges, retention/detention ponds, and other geotechnical features to be designed. o Existing utilities; as-built plans are acceptable. o Right of way limits. o Wetlands. o Drainage features. o Existing structures. o Other features or constraints that could affect the geotechnical design or investigation. 3. Electronic files, or cross sections every 50 feet or as appropriate, to define existing and new ground line above and below walls, cuts, fills, and other pertinent information. o Show stationing. o Show locations of existing utilities, right of way lines, wetlands, and other constraints. o Show locations of existing structures that might contribute load to the cut, fill, wall, or other structure. 4. Right of entry agreements and permits required for geotechnical investigation. 5. Due date and work order number. 6. Contact person. When the alignment and any constraints (as noted above) are staked, the stationing on the plans and in the field must be in the same units. Physical surveys are preferred to photogrammetric surveys to ensure adequate accuracy of the site data. Permits and agreements to be supplied by the region might include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
HPA Shoreline permits Tribal lands and waters Railroad easement and right of way City, county, or local agency use permits Sensitive area ordinance permits
The region Project Office is also responsible for providing survey locations of test holes once the test holes have been drilled. The survey information includes the station, offset, elevation, and test hole coordinates. Coordinates are the latitude and longitude or state plane coordinates (north or south as appropriate), but not project coordinates.
610.04(5) Well Decommissioning In accordance with RCW 18.104.020 and WAC 173-160-111, a well is defined as a water well, resource protection well, dewatering well, and geotechnical soil boring. Specifically, RCW 18.104.020(8) defines "geotechnical soil boring" or "boring" as “a well drilled for the purpose of obtaining soil samples or information to ascertain structural properties of the subsurface.”

Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
Wells may be installed as part of the project design for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to monitoring groundwater and performing downhole testing after drilling within the cased hole. A more detailed definition of a well and all applicable WACs and RCWs related to this subject are summarized in Chapter 3 of the Geotechnical Design Manual (GDM). All wells are assigned a unique well tag ID that is unique to that well throughout the life cycle from the time of installation during drilling until decommissioning when the well is no longer needed. The region project office and the geotechnical office should work together to ensure that the decommissioning of all wells within the limits of a project and within WSDOT right of way occurs in accordance with Department of Ecology regulations prior to construction. This includes wells completed by WSDOT HQ Geotechnical crews, Region drill crews, consultant drillers under subcontract to WSDOT (both directly and through GECs), and wells installed by outside agencies within WSDOT right of way. The HQ Geotechnical Office is responsible for maintaining a database of all active wells within WSDOT right-of way, including those done by outside agency or by drilling contractors under subcontract. All wells, including those installed by outside agencies or consultants, should be clearly identified in the PS&E plans (see Plans Preparation Manual). The timing of decommission can vary depending on the purpose of the well installation, but in general all wells should be decommissioned prior to contract award unless there is an unusual circumstance that would make it beneficial to continue monitoring from a safety standpoint or other reason during construction. If this is the case, then this must be discussed at the first general pre-construction meeting for the project with the contractor so that they fully understand the importance of leaving the wells undisturbed until they are properly decommissioned. Decommissioning of wells for design build projects shall be done in accordance with the requirements in Section 2.6 of the RFP (see Design Build Manual). All wells installed as part of the development of the Geotechnical Data Report for the project should be decommissioned prior to contract advertisement.
610.04(6) Overview of Geotechnical Design Objectives for the Various Project Stages Geotechnical design objectives for the various design phases are described in the Geotechnical Design Manual.
610.04(7) Earthwork 610.04(7)(a) Project Definition The designer contacts and meets with the RME (and the HQ Geotechnical Office as needed) at the project site to conduct a field review to help identify the geotechnical issues for the project. In general, if soil/rock conditions are poor and/or large cuts or fills are anticipated, the RME requests that the HQ Geotechnical Office participate in the field review and reporting efforts. The designer provides a description and location of the proposed earthwork to the RME as follows:
•
•
•
For widening of existing facilities, the anticipated width, length, and location of the widening, relative to the current facility, are provided. For realignments, the approximate new location proposed for the facility is provided. Locations in terms of length can be by milepost or stations.
A brief conceptual-level report that summarizes the results of the investigation is provided to the designer.

Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
610.04(7)(b) Project Design Geotechnical data necessary to allow completion of the PS&E-level design is compiled during the design phase. This includes soil borings, testing, and geotechnical design based on final geometric data. Detailed design of cut and fill slopes can be done once the roadway geometry is established and geotechnical data are available. The purpose of this design effort is to determine the maximum stable cut or fill slope and, for fills, the potential for short- and long-term settlement. Also, the usability of the cut materials and the type of borrow needed for the project (if any) are evaluated. Evaluate the use of soil bioengineering as an option for building steeper slopes or to prevent surface erosion. (See Roadside Manual Chapter 740, Soil Bioengineering, for more information.) The designer requests a geotechnical report from the RME. The site data given in Section 610.04(4), as applicable, is provided. It is important that the request for the geotechnical report be made as early as possible in the design phase. Cost and schedule requirements to generate the report are project-specific and can vary widely. The time required to obtain permits and rights of entry must be considered when establishing schedule requirements. The Geotechnical Design Manual, Chapter 24, summarizes the type of information and recommendations that are typically included in the geotechnical report for earthwork. The recommendations should include the background regarding analysis approach and any agreements with the region or other customers regarding the definition of acceptable level of risk. The region Project Office uses the report to finalize design decisions for the project. To meet slope stability requirements, additional right of way might be required or a wall might be needed. Wall design is covered in Chapter 730. Construction timing might require importing material rather than using cut materials. The report is used to address this and other constructability issues. The report is also used to proceed with completion of the PS&E.
610.04(7)(c) PS&E Development Adequate geotechnical design information to complete the PS&E is typically received during the design phase. Additional geotechnical work might be needed when right of way cannot be acquired, restrictions are included in permits, or other requirements are added that result in changes to the design. Special provisions and plan details, if not received as part of the report provided during design, are developed with the assistance of the RME or the HQ Geotechnical Office. The designer uses this information, as well as the design phase report, to complete the PS&E documents. Both the region Materials Laboratory and the HQ Geotechnical Office can review (if requested) the contract plans before the PS&E review process begins. Otherwise, they will review the contract plans during the normal PS&E review process.
610.04(8) Hydraulic Structures, Ponds, and Environmental Mitigation 610.04(8)(a) Project Definition The designer provides a description and location of the proposed hydraulic/ environmental improvements and other pertinent site information and discusses the extent of the improvements with both the RME and the HQ Hydraulics Section to identify the geotechnical issues to be investigated. At this stage, only the identification and feasibility of the proposed hydraulic structures or environmental mitigation are investigated. The cost and schedule requirements for the geotechnical investigation are also determined at this time. Examples of hydraulic structures include, but are not limited to, large culverts, pipe arches, underground detention vaults, and fish passage structures. Examples of environmental mitigation include, but are not limited to, detention/retention ponds, wetland creation, and environmental mitigation measures on fill slopes.

Chapter 610
Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
It is especially important to identify the potential to encounter high groundwater at the proposed hydraulic structure or pond location. In general, avoid high groundwater locations (see the Highway Runoff Manual) as groundwater can greatly affect design, constructibility, operations, performance, and maintenance.
610.04(8)(b) Project Design The designer requests a geotechnical report from the RME. The site data given in Section 610.04(4), as applicable, is provided along with the following information:
•
•
Pertinent field observations (such as unstable slopes, existing soft soils or boulders, evidence of high groundwater, or erosion around and damage to existing culverts or other drainage structures). Jurisdictional requirements for geotechnical design of berms/dams.
It is important that the request for the geotechnical report be made as early as possible in the design phase. Cost and schedule requirements to generate the report are project-specific and can vary widely. The time required to obtain permits and rights of entry must be considered when establishing schedule requirements. Furthermore, since the depth to groundwater can be critical to the feasibility of these types of facilities, and since seasonal variation of groundwater is typically important to know, it is essential to have adequate time to determine the effect of seasonal variations on groundwater. The RME, with support from the HQ Geotechnical Office as needed, provides the following information in addition to the overall requirements specified in the Geotechnical Design Manual, when requested and where applicable, as part of the project geotechnical report:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Soil boring logs. Soil pH and resistivity. Water table elevation. Soil infiltration rates (the highest rate for assessing spill containment/aquifer protection and the longterm rate for determining pond capacity). Bearing capacity and settlement for hydraulic structure foundations. Slope stability for ponds. Retention berm/dam design. Potential for and amount of differential settlement along culverts and pipe arches and the estimated time required for settlement to occur. Soil pressures and properties (primarily for underground detention vaults). Erosion potential. Geosynthetic design in accordance with Chapter 630. Recommendations for mitigation of the effects of soft or unstable soil on the hydraulic structures. Recommendations for construction.
Note that retaining walls that are part of a pond, fish passage, and so on, are designed in accordance with Chapter 730 and the Geotechnical Design Manual. The designer uses the geotechnical information to:
•
•
•
Finalize design decisions. Evaluate and mitigate environmental issues. Proceed with completion of the PS&E design. This includes determining the most cost-effective hydraulic structure/pond to meet the desired objectives; locating and sizing ponds and foundations for hydraulic structures; structural design; mitigating the effects of settlement; and satisfying local jurisdictional requirements for design.

Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
610.04(8)(c) PS&E Development During PS&E development, the designer uses the information provided in the geotechnical report to:
•
•
Select pipe materials in accordance with corrosion, resistivity, and abrasion guidelines in the Hydraulics Manual. Consider and include construction recommendations.
Additional design and specification guidance and support from the RME or the HQ Geotechnical Office are sought as needed. Both sections provide careful review of the contract plans before the PS&E review process begins, if requested. Otherwise, they will review the contract plans during the normal PS&E review process.
610.04(9) Signals, Sign Bridges, Cantilever Signs, and Luminaire Foundations 610.04(9)(a) Project Definition and Design Geotechnical information is usually not required for signals, sign bridges, cantilever signs, and luminaires during Project Definition. The region Traffic Design Office contacts the RME for conceptual foundation recommendations. The conceptual recommendations are based on existing information in the area and identify whether Standard Plan foundations are feasible or whether special-design foundations are required. If good soils are anticipated or the foundations will be placed in fill, Standard Plan foundations can be assumed. If special-design foundations are required, additional time and money can be included in the project to accommodate increased field exploration for foundation design, HQ Geotechnical Office involvement, and structural design by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office.
610.04(9)(b) PS&E Development Foundation recommendations are made by either the RME or the HQ Geotechnical Office. The recommendations provide all necessary geotechnical information to complete the PS&E. The region Traffic Design Office (or region Project Engineer in some cases) is responsible for delivering the following project information to the RME:
•
•
Plan sheet showing the location of the structures (station and offset) and the planned structure type. Applicable values for: XYZ coordinates, strain pole class, sign bridge span length, luminaire height, variable message sign weight, wind load, CCTV pole height, and known utility information in the area.
The RME provides the following information to the requester if Standard Plans foundation types can be used:
•
•
•
•
Allowable lateral bearing capacity of the soil Results of all field explorations Groundwater elevation Foundation constructibility
The region uses this information to complete the plan sheets and prepare any special provisions. If utilities are identified during the field investigation that could conflict with the foundations, the region pursues moving or accommodating the utility. Accommodation could require special foundation designs. If special designs are required, the RME notifies the requester that special designs are required and forwards the information received from the region to the HQ Geotechnical Office. The HQ Geotechnical Office provides the HQ Bridge and Structures Office with the necessary geotechnical recommendations to complete the foundation designs. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 610-8
Chapter 610
Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
The region coordinates with the HQ Bridge and Structures Office to ensure they have all the information necessary to complete the design. Depending on the structure type and complexity, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office might produce the plan sheets and special provisions for the foundations, or they might provide the region with information so they can complete the plan sheets and special provisions. Additional guidelines and requirements for design of foundations for these types of structures are contained in the Geotechnical Design Manual.
610.04(10) Buildings, Park & Ride Lots, Communication Towers, and Rest Areas In general, the RME functions as the clearinghouse for the geotechnical work to be conducted in each of the phases, for technical review of the work if it is performed by consultants, or for getting the work done in-house. For sites and designs that are more geotechnically complex, the RME contacts the HQ Geotechnical Office for assistance. (See the Geotechnical Design Manual for geotechnical investigation and design requirements for these types of facilities.)
610.04(10)(a) Site Selection Conceptual geotechnical investigation (based on historical data and minimal subsurface investigation) of several alternative sites is performed in which the geotechnical feasibility of each site for its intended use is evaluated, allowing the sites to be ranked. In this phase, geological hazards (such as landslides, rockfall, compressible soils, and liquefaction) are identified, and geotechnical data adequate to determine a preliminary cost to develop and build on the site is gathered.
610.04(10)(b) Schematic Design For the selected site, the best locations for structures, utilities, and other elements of the project are determined based on site constraints and ground conditions. In this phase, the site is characterized more thoroughly than in the site selection phase, but subsurface exploration is not structure specific.
610.04(10)(c) Design and PS&E Development The final locations of each of the project structures, utilities, and other project elements determined from the schematic design phase are identified. Once these final locations are available, a geotechnical investigation is conducted that is adequate to complete the final design of each of the project elements, such as structure foundations, detention/retention facilities, utilities, parking lots, roadways, and site grading. From this investigation and design, the final PS&E is developed.
610.04(11) Retaining Walls, Reinforced Slopes, and Noise Walls 610.04(11)(a) Project Definition The designer provides the RME with a description and location of the proposed walls or reinforced slopes, including the potential size of the proposed structures and other pertinent site information. At this stage, only the identification and feasibility of the proposed walls or reinforced slopes are investigated. A field review may also be conducted as part of the investigation effort. In general, if soil/rock conditions are poor and/or large walls or reinforced slopes are anticipated, the RME requests that the HQ Geotechnical Office participate in the field review and reporting efforts. The cost and schedule requirements for the geotechnical investigation are also determined at this time. A brief conceptual-level report that summarizes the results of the investigation may be provided to the designer at this time, depending on the complexity of the geotechnical issues.

Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
610.04(11)(b) Project Design and PS&E Development Geotechnical data necessary to allow completion of the PS&E-level design for walls and reinforced slopes are compiled during the design and PS&E development phases. These include soils borings, testing, and final geometric data. Detailed designs of walls and reinforced slopes can be done once the roadway geometry is established and geotechnical data are available. The purpose of this design effort is to determine the wall and slope geometry needed for stability; noise wall and retaining wall foundation requirements; and the potential for short- and long-term settlement. The designer requests a geotechnical report from the RME for retaining walls, noise walls, and reinforced slopes that are not part of the bridge preliminary plan. For walls that are part of the bridge preliminary plan, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office requests the geotechnical report for the walls from the HQ Geotechnical Office. (See Chapter 730 for the detailed design process for retaining walls and reinforced slopes, Chapter 740 for the detailed design process for noise walls, and the Geotechnical Design Manual for design requirements for all walls.) It is important that requests for a geotechnical report be made as early as possible in the design phase. The time required to obtain permits and rights of entry must be considered when establishing schedule requirements. For retaining walls and reinforced slopes, the site data to be provided with the request for a geotechnical report are as given in Chapter 730. Supply right of entry agreements and permits required for the geotechnical investigation. The site data given in Section 610.04(4), as applicable, are provided for noise walls. The RME or the HQ Geotechnical Office provides the information (see Chapter 730 or Chapter 740 for specific responsibilities for design) specified in the Geotechnical Design Manual as part of the project geotechnical report. The recommendations may also include the background regarding the analysis approach and any agreements with the region or other customers regarding the definition of acceptable level of risk. Additional details and design issues to be considered in the geotechnical report are as provided in Chapter 730 for retaining walls and reinforced slopes and in Chapter 740 for noise walls. The designer uses this information for final wall/reinforced slope selection and to complete the PS&E. For final PS&E preparation, special provisions and plan details (if not received as part of the report provided during design) are developed with the assistance of the region Materials Laboratory or the HQ Geotechnical Office. Both the region Materials Laboratory and the HQ Geotechnical Office can review the contract plans before the PS&E review process begins, if requested. Otherwise, they will review the contract plans during the normal PS&E review process.
610.04(12) Unstable Slopes Unstable slope mitigation includes the stabilization of known landslides and rockfall that occur on slopes adjacent to the WSDOT transportation system and that have been programmed under the P3 Unstable Slope Program.
610.04(12)(a) Project Definition The region Project Office provides the RME with a description and location of the proposed unstable slope mitigation work. Location of the proposed work can be milepost limits or stationing. The designer meets at the project site with the RME and HQ Geotechnical Office to conduct a field review, discuss project requirements, and identify geotechnical issues associated with the unstable slope project. The RME requests that the HQ Geotechnical Office participate in the field review and Project Definition reporting.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 610-10
Chapter 610
Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
The level of work in the Project Definition phase for unstable slopes is conceptual in nature, not a final design. The geotechnical investigation generally consists of a field review, a more detailed assessment of the unstable slope, review of the conceptual mitigation developed during the programming phase of the project, and proposed modification (if any) to the original conceptual-level unstable slope mitigation. The design phase geotechnical services cost and schedule, including any required permits, are determined at this time. A brief conceptual-level report is provided to the designer that summarizes the results of the Project Definition investigation.
610.04(12)(b) Project Design Geotechnical information and field data necessary to complete the unstable slope mitigation design is compiled during this design phase. This work includes, depending on the nature of the unstable slope problem, test borings, rock structure mapping, geotechnical field instrumentation, laboratory testing, and slope stability analysis. The purpose of this design effort is to provide design-level geotechnical recommendations to stabilize the known unstable slope. The designer requests a geotechnical report from the HQ Geotechnical Office through the RME. The site data given in Section 610.04(4), as applicable, is provided along with the following information:
•
•
A plan sheet showing the station and location of the proposed unstable slope mitigation project. If requested, the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) files necessary to define the on-ground topography of the project site (the limits of the DTM will have been defined during the Project Definition phase).
It is important that the request for the geotechnical report be made as early as possible in the design phase. Cost and schedule requirements to generate the report are project-specific and can vary widely. Unstable slope design investigations might require geotechnical monitoring of ground movement and groundwater over an extended period of time to develop the required field information for the unstable slope mitigation design. The time required to obtain rights of entry and other permits, as well as the long-term monitoring data, must be considered when establishing schedule requirements for the geotechnical report. In addition to the geotechnical report requirements specified in the Geotechnical Design Manual, the HQ Geotechnical Office provides the following information as part of the project geotechnical report (as applicable):
•
•
•
Unstable slope design analysis and mitigation recommendations. Constructibility issues associated with the unstable slope mitigation. Appropriate special provisions for inclusion in the contact plans.
The region Project Office uses the geotechnical report to finalize the design decisions for the project and the completion of the PS&E design.
610.04(12)(c) PS&E Development Adequate geotechnical design information to complete the PS&E is typically obtained during the project design phase. Additional geotechnical work might be needed when right of way cannot be acquired, restrictions are included in permits, or other requirements are added that result in changes to the design. Special provisions, special project elements, and design details, if not received as part of the design phase geotechnical report, are developed with the assistance of the RME and the HQ Geotechnical Office. The designer uses this information in conjunction with the design phase geotechnical report to complete the PS&E document. The RME and the HQ Geotechnical Office can review the contract plans before the PS&E review begins, if requested. Otherwise, they will review the contract plans during the normal PS&E review process.

610.04(13) Rockslope Design 610.04(13)(a) Project Definition The region Project Office provides the RME with a description and location of the proposed rock excavation work. For widening of existing rock cuts, the anticipated width and length of the proposed cut in relationship to the existing cut are provided. For new alignments, the approximate location and depth of the cut are provided. Location of the proposed cut(s) can be milepost limits or stationing. The designer meets at the project site with the RME and the HQ Geotechnical Office to conduct a field review, discuss project requirements, and identify any geotechnical issues associated with the proposed rock cuts. The RME requests that the HQ Geotechnical Office participate in the field review and Project Definition reporting. The level of rockslope design work for the Project Definition phase is conceptual in nature. The geotechnical investigation generally consists of the field review, review of existing records, an assessment of existing rockslope stability, and preliminary geologic structure mapping. The focus of this investigation is to assess the feasibility of the rock cuts for the proposed widening or realignment, not final design. A brief conceptual-level report that summarizes the result of the Project Definition investigation is provided to the designer.
610.04(13)(b) Project Design Detailed rockslope design is done once the roadway geometrics have been established. The rockslope design cannot be finalized until the roadway geometrics have been finalized. Geotechnical information and field data necessary to complete the rockslope design are compiled during this design phase. This work includes rock structure mapping, test borings, laboratory testing, and slope stability analysis. The purpose of this design effort is to determine the maximum stable cut slope angle and any additional rockslope stabilization measures that could be required. The designer requests a geotechnical report from the HQ Geotechnical Office through the RME. The site data given in Section 610.04(4), as applicable, is provided. It is important that the request for the geotechnical report be made as early as possible in the design phase. Cost and schedule requirements to generate the report are project-specific and can vary widely. The time required to obtain permits and rights of entry must be considered when establishing schedule requirements. In addition to the geotechnical report requirements specified in the Geotechnical Design Manual, the HQ Geotechnical Office provides the following information as part of the project geotechnical report pertaining to rockslope design analysis and recommendations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Type of rockslope design analysis conducted and limitation of the analysis. Also included will be any agreements with the region and other customers regarding the definition of “acceptable risk.” The slope(s) required for stability. Additional slope stabilization requirements (such as rock bolts or rock dowels). Rockslope ditch criteria (see Chapter 1239). Assessment of rippability. Blasting requirements, including limitations on peak ground vibrations and air blast over-pressure if required. Usability of the excavated material, including estimates of shrink and swell. Constructibility issues associated with the rock excavation.
The region Project Office uses the geotechnical report to finalize the design decisions for the project and the completion of the PS&E design for the rockslope elements of the project.

610.04(13)(c) PS&E Development Adequate geotechnical design information to complete the PS&E is typically obtained during the design phase. Additional geotechnical work might be needed when right of way cannot be acquired, restrictions are included in permits, or other requirements are added that result in change to the design. Special provisions, special blasting requirements, and plan details, if not received as part of the design phase geotechnical report, are developed with the assistance of the RME or the HQ Geotechnical Office. The designer uses this information in conjunction with the design phase geotechnical report to complete the PS&E documents. The RME and the HQ Geotechnical Office can review (if requested) the contract plans before the PS&E review begins. Otherwise, they will review the contract plans during the normal PS&E review process.
610.04(14) Bridge Foundations 610.04(14)(a) Project Definition The HQ Geotechnical Office supports the development of reasonably accurate estimates of bridge substructure costs beginning with the Project Definition phase. A field review is recommended for major projects and projects that are located in areas with little or no existing geotechnical information. The region office responsible for Project Definition coordinates field reviews. Subsurface exploration (drilling) is usually not required at this time, but might be needed if cost estimates cannot be prepared within an acceptable range of certainty. Once it has received the necessary site data from the region Project Office, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for delivering the following project information to the HQ Geotechnical Office:
•
•
•
Alternative alignments and/or locations of bridge structures. A preliminary estimate of channelization (structure width). Known environmental constraints.
The HQ Geotechnical Office provides the following to the HQ Bridge and Structures and region offices:
•
•
•
•
•
Summary of existing geotechnical information. Identification of geotechnical hazards (such as slides, liquefiable soils, and soft-soil deposits). Identification of permits that might be required for subsurface exploration (drilling). Conceptual foundation types and depths. If requested, an estimated cost and time to complete a geotechnical foundation report.
The HQ Bridge and Structures Office uses this information to refine preliminary bridge costs. The region Project Office uses the estimated cost and time to complete a geotechnical foundation report to develop the project delivery cost and schedule.
610.04(14)(b) Project Design The HQ Geotechnical Office assists the HQ Bridge and Structures Office with preparation of the bridge preliminary plan. Geotechnical information gathered for Project Definition will normally be adequate for this phase, as test holes for the final bridge design cannot be drilled until accurate pier location information is available. For selected major projects, a type, size, and location (TS&L) report might be prepared, which usually requires some subsurface exploration to provide a more detailed, though not final, estimate of foundation requirements.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 610-13
Chapter 610
Investigation of Soils, Rock, and Surfacing Materials
The HQ Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for delivering the following project information, based on bridge site data received from the region Project Office, to the HQ Geotechnical Office:
•
•
•
Anticipated pier locations. Approach fill heights. For TS&L, alternate locations/alignments/structure types.
The HQ Bridge and Structures Office can expect to receive the following:
•
•
•
•
Conceptual foundation types, depths, and capacities. Permissible slopes for bridge approaches. For TS&L, a summary of site geology and subsurface conditions, and more detailed preliminary foundation design parameters and needs. If applicable or requested, the potential impact of erosion or scour potential (determined by the HQ Hydraulics Section) on foundation requirements.
The HQ Bridge and Structures Office uses this information to complete the bridge preliminary plan. The region Project Office confirms right of way needs for approach embankments. For TS&L, the geotechnical information provided is used for cost estimating and preferred alternate selection. The preliminary plans are used by the HQ Geotechnical Office to develop the site subsurface exploration plan.
610.04(14)(c) PS&E Development During this phase, or as soon as a 95% preliminary plan is available, subsurface exploration (drilling) is performed and a geotechnical foundation report is prepared to provide all necessary geotechnical recommendations needed to complete the bridge PS&E. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for delivering the following project information to the HQ Geotechnical Office:
•
•
•
•
95% preliminary plans, concurrent with distribution for region approval. Estimated foundation loads and allowable settlement criteria for the structure when requested. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office can expect to receive: The bridge geotechnical foundation report.
The HQ Bridge and Structures Office uses this information to complete the bridge PS&E. The region Project Office reviews the geotechnical foundation report for construction considerations and recommendations that might affect region items, estimates, staging, construction schedule, or other items. Upon receipt of the structure PS&E review set, the HQ Geotechnical Office provides the HQ Bridge and Structures Office with a Summary of Geotechnical Conditions for inclusion in Appendix B of the contract.

For upland retaining walls and grading, utility trenches, and pavement design, the RME assists WSF with determining geotechnical feasibility. In addition to the site data provided in Section 610.04(4), as applicable, the following information is supplied by WSF to the HQ Geotechnical Office or the RME, as appropriate, with the request for the project geotechnical report:
•
•
•
•
•
A plan showing anticipated structure locations as well as existing structures. Relevant historical data for the site. A plan showing utility trench locations. Anticipated utility trench depths. Proposed roadway profiles.

Assessment of constructibility issues that affect feasibility. Surfacing depths and/or pavement repair and drainage schemes. If applicable or requested, potential impact of erosion or scour potential (determined by the HQ Hydraulics Section) on foundation requirements.
WSF uses this information to complete the design report, design decisions, and estimated budget and schedule. WSF is responsible for obtaining any necessary permits or right of entry agreements needed to access structure locations for the purpose of subsurface exploration (such as test hole drilling). The time required for obtaining permits and rights of entry must be considered when developing project schedules. Possible permits and agreements might include, but are not limited to:
•
•
City, county, or local agency use permits. Sensitive area ordinance permits.
610.04(16)(b) PS&E Development Subsurface exploration (drilling) is performed and a geotechnical foundation report is prepared to provide all necessary geotechnical recommendations needed to complete the PS&E. The designer requests a geotechnical report from the HQ Geotechnical Office or the RME, as appropriate. The site data given in Section 610.04(4), as applicable, is provided along with the following information:
•
•
A plan showing final structure locations as well as existing structures. Proposed structure loadings.

WSF uses this information to complete the PS&E. Upon receipt of the WSF PS&E review set, the HQ Geotechnical Office provides WSF with a Summary of Geotechnical Conditions for inclusion in Appendix B of the Contract. A Final Geotechnical Project Documentation package is assembled by the HQ Geotechnical Office and sent to WSF or the Plans Branch, as appropriate, for reproduction and sale to prospective bidders.
610.05 Use of Geotechnical Consultants Prior to authorizing a consultant to conduct the geotechnical investigation for a project, the region Project Office, the HQ Geotechnical Office, and the RME determine the scope of work and schedule for the project and whether or not the project will go to a geotechnical consultant. Once the decision has been made to have a consultant conduct the geotechnical investigation for a project, the HQ Geotechnical Office or the RME assists in developing the geotechnical scope and estimate for the project (WSDOT Consultant Services assists in this process). A team meeting between the consultant team, the region or Washington State Ferries (depending on whose project it is), and the HQ Geotechnical Office/RME is conducted early in the project to develop technical communication lines and relationships. Good proactive communication between all members of the project team is crucial to the success of the project due to the complex supplierclient relationships. Additional guidelines on the use of geotechnical consultants and the development of a scope of work for the consultant are provided in the Geotechnical Design Manual.
610.06 Geotechnical Work by Others Geotechnical design work conducted for the design of structures, or other engineering works by other agencies or private developers within the right of way, is subject to the same geotechnical engineering requirements as for engineering works performed by WSDOT. Therefore, the provisions contained within this chapter also apply in principle to such work. All geotechnical work conducted for engineering works within the WSDOT right of way or that otherwise directly impacts WSDOT facilities must be reviewed and approved by the HQ Geotechnical Office or the RME, depending on the nature of the work. Additional requirements for geotechnical work by others that impacts WSDOT facilities and land within the WSDOT right of way are set forth in the Geotechnical Design Manual.

610.07 Surfacing Report Detailed criteria and methods that govern pavement rehabilitation can be found in the WSDOT Pavement Policy. The RME provides the surfacing report to the region Project Office. This report provides recommended pavement types, surfacing depths, pavement drainage recommendations, and pavement repair recommendations.
610.08 Documentation 610.08(1) Design Documentation Refer to Chapter 300 for design documentation requirements.
610.08(2) Final Geotechnical Project Documentation and Geotechnical Information for the Construction Contract Once a project PS&E is near completion, all of the geotechnical design memorandums and reports are compiled together to form the Final Geotechnical Project Documentation, to be published for the use of prospective bidders. The detailed process for this is located in the Plans Preparation Manual. Geotechnical information included in the contract consists of the final project boring logs and, as appropriate for the project, a Summary of Geotechnical Conditions. The boring logs from the geotechnical reports are incorporated into the contract by the region, WSF, or Urban Corridors Office (UCO) staff. The Summary of Geotechnical Conditions is provided to the region, WSF, or UCO by the HQ Geotechnical Office and/or RME. Additional geotechnical project documentation requirements are set forth in the Geotechnical Design Manual.

*3,700 lb/cy (1.85 tons/cy) is recommended as the most suitable factor; however, if the grading approaches the coarseness of ballast, the factor would approach 3,800 lb/cy (1.90 tons/cy), and if the grading contains more than 45% sand, the factor would decrease, approaching 3,400 lb/cy (1.70 tons/cy) for material that is essentially all sand. Notes:

Weights shown are dry weights and corrections are required for water contents. The tabulated weights for the materials are reasonably close; however, apply corrections in the following order: For specific gravity: Wt. = tabular wt. x specific gravity on surface report/2.65 For water content: Wt. = tabular wt. x (1 + free water % in decimals) If material is to be stockpiled, increase required quantities by 10% to allow for waste. Consider the inclusion of crushed surfacing top course material for keystone when estimating quantities for projects having ballast course.

630.01 General Geosynthetics include a variety of manufactured products that are used by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) in drainage, earthwork, erosion control, and soil reinforcement applications. The following geosynthetic applications are addressed in the Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction (Standard Specifications):
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Low survivability underground drainage Moderate survivability underground drainage Separation Soil stabilization Moderate survivability permanent erosion control High survivability permanent erosion control Ditch lining Temporary silt fence
The Standard Specifications addresses geosynthetic properties as well as installation requirements and are not site-specific. The geosynthetic properties provided are based on the range of soil conditions likely to be encountered in Washington for the applications defined. Other applications, such as prefabricated edge drains, pond liners, and geotextile retaining walls, are currently handled by special provision. Design responsibilities are discussed in Section 630.05 and illustrated in Exhibit 630-4 and Exhibit 630-5. This chapter does not address applications where geosynthetics are used to help establish vegetation through temporary prevention of erosion (vegetation mats).

Geosynthetics
630.03 Geosynthetic Types and Characteristics Geosynthetics include woven and nonwoven geotextiles, geogrids, geonets, geomembranes, and geocomposites. (Examples of the various types of geosynthetics are provided in Exhibit 630-5.) Terms used in the past for these construction materials include fabrics, filter fabric, or filter cloth, which are for the most part synonymous with the newer term geotextile.
630.03(1) Definitions Definitions of the geosynthetic types are as follows:
630.03(1)(a) Woven Geotextiles Slit polymer tapes, monofilament fibers, fibrillated yarns, or multifilament yarns simply woven into a mat. Woven geotextiles generally have relatively high strength and stiffness and, except for the monofilament wovens, relatively poor drainage characteristics.
630.03(1)(b) Nonwoven Geotextiles A sheet of continuous or staple fibers entangled randomly into a felt for needle-punched nonwovens and pressed and melted together at the fiber contact points for heat-bonded nonwovens. Nonwoven geotextiles tend to have low-to-medium strength and stiffness with high elongation at failure and relatively good drainage characteristics. The high elongation characteristic gives them superior ability to deform around stones and sticks.
630.03(1)(c) Geogrids A polymer grid mat constructed either of coated yarns or a punched and stretched polymer sheet. Geogrids usually have high strength and stiffness and are used primarily for soil reinforcement.
630.03(1)(d) Geonets Similar to geogrids, but typically lighter weight and weaker, with smaller mesh openings. Geonets are used in light reinforcement applications or are combined with drainage geotextiles to form a drainage structure.
630.03(1)(e) Geomembranes Impervious polymer sheets that are typically used to line ponds or landfills. In some cases, geomembranes are placed over moisture-sensitive swelling clays to control moisture.
630.03(1)(f) Geocomposites Prefabricated edge drains, wall drains, and sheet drains that typically consist of a cuspated or dimpled polyethylene drainage core wrapped in a geotextile. The geotextile wrap keeps the core clean so that water can freely flow through the drainage core, which acts as a conduit. Prefabricated edge drains are used in place of shallow geotextile-wrapped trench drains at the edges of the roadway to provide subgrade and base drainage. Wall drains and sheet drains are typically placed between the back of the wall and the soil to drain the soil retained by the wall.
630.04 Geosynthetic Function Definitions and Applications The function of the geosynthetic varies with the application. (See Exhibit 630-7 for examples of the various applications.) The geosynthetic must be designed with its application function(s) in mind. Typical geosynthetic functions include filtration, drainage, separation, reinforcement, and erosion control. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 630
Geosynthetics
630.04(1) Definitions Definitions of these functions and examples of their dominant applications are as follows:
630.04(1)(a) Geosynthetic Filtration The passage of water through the geosynthetic relatively unimpeded (permeability or permittivity) without allowing passage of soil through the geosynthetic (retention). This is the primary function of geotextiles in underground drainage applications.
630.04(1)(b) Drainage The carrying of water in the plane of the geosynthetic as a conduit (transmissivity) is a primary function of geocomposite drains. In some cases, the function includes thick, nonwoven needle-punched geotextiles placed in underground drainage applications where water must be transported away from a given location by the geosynthetic itself.
630.04(1)(c) Separation The prevention of the mixing of two dissimilar materials. This is a primary function of geotextiles placed between a fine-grained subgrade and a granular base course beneath a roadway.
630.04(1)(d) Reinforcement The strengthening of a soil mass by the inclusion of elements (geosynthetics) that have tensile strength. This is the primary function of high-strength geotextiles and geogrids in geosynthetic reinforced wall or slope applications, or in roadways placed over very soft subgrade soils that are inadequate to support the weight of the construction equipment or even the embankment itself.
630.04(1)(e) Geosynthetic Erosion Control The minimizing of surficial soil particle movement due to the flow of water over the surface of bare soil or due to the disturbance of soil caused by construction activities under or near bodies of water. This is the primary function of geotextiles used as silt fences or placed beneath riprap or other stones on soil slopes. Silt fences keep eroded soil particles on the construction site, whereas geotextiles placed beneath riprap or other stones on soil slopes prevent erosion from taking place at all. In general, the permanent erosion control methods described in this chapter are only used where more natural means (like the use of biodegradable vegetation mats to establish vegetation to prevent erosion) are not feasible. These functions control some of the geosynthetic properties, such as apparent opening size (AOS) and permittivity, and in some cases load-strain characteristics. The application will also affect the geosynthetic installation conditions. These installation conditions influence the remaining geosynthetic properties needed, based on the survivability level required.
630.04(1)(f) Geosynthetic Survivability The ability of the geosynthetic to resist installation conditions without significant damage, such that the geosynthetic can function as intended. Survivability affects the strength properties of the geosynthetic required.

Geosynthetics
630.05 Design Approach for Geosynthetics The following questions must be answered to complete a geosynthetic design:
•
•
•
•
Is a geosynthetic really needed? What geosynthetic properties will ensure the geosynthetic functions as intended? Where should the geosynthetic be located? Will maintenance of the geosynthetic, or the structure of which it is a part, be needed? If so, how will it be maintained?
The site conditions and purpose for the geotextile are reviewed to determine whether or not a geotextile is needed.
•
•
•
•
For most drainage, separation, soil stabilization, permanent erosion control, and silt fence applications, if a geotextile is needed, the geotextile properties in the Standard Specifications can be used. In some situations where soil conditions are especially troublesome or in critical or high-risk applications, a project-specific design may be needed. The location of the geosynthetic will depend on how it is intended to function. (See Exhibit 630-7 for examples.) Consider the flow path of any groundwater or surface water when locating and selecting the geotextile to be used. For example, in permanent erosion control applications, water may flow to the geotextile from the existing ground as well as from the surface through wave action, stream flow, or overland sheet flow. For saturated fine sandy or silty subgrades, water must be able to flow from the subgrade through the geotextile soil stabilization layer during the pumping action caused by traffic loads.
Background information and the answers to each of these questions, or at least guidance to obtaining the answers to these questions, are provided for each of the following Standard Specifications applications:
630.05(1) Underground Drainage: Low and Moderate Survivability Geotextiles used for underground drainage must provide filtration to allow water to reach the drain aggregate without allowing the aggregate to be contaminated by finer soil particles. Geotextile filtration properties are a function of the soil type. For underground drainage applications, if the subgrade soil is relatively clean gravel or coarse sand, a geotextile is probably not required. At issue is whether or not there are enough fines in the surrounding soil to eventually clog the drain rock or drain pipe if unrestricted flow toward the drain is allowed. To approximately match the geotextile filtration properties to various soil types, specifications for three classes of Construction Geotextile for Underground Drainage are available in the Standard Specifications. For underground drainage applications, use the gradation of the soil, specifically the percent by weight passing the #200 sieve, to select the drainage geotextile class required. Base your selection of the appropriate class of geotextile on Exhibit 630-1. Exhibit 630-1 Selection Criteria for Geotextile Class
Percent Passing the #200 Sieve Less than 15% 15% to 50% Greater than 50% WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Geosynthetics
Obtain soil samples for geotextile underdrain design every 300 feet along the roadway alignment, using hand holes, and at major soil type transitions. This may be spread to every 1000 feet if the soil conditions appear to be uniform. Use existing soil data where feasible instead of taking new soil samples. If soil conditions vary widely along the alignment where underground drainage geotextile is anticipated, different classes of drainage geotextile may be required for specific sections of a continuous system. Strength properties for the underground drainage geotextile depend on the survivability level required to resist installation stresses. Low survivability designates that the installation stresses placed on the geotextile will be relatively low, requiring only moderate geotextile strength to resist potentially damaging installation conditions. Examples of low survivability level underground drainage applications include:
•
•
•
Trench drains. Drains placed behind walls or other structures to drain the backfill. A geotextile filter sheet placed behind a gabion wall to prevent fines from being washed through the gabion wall face. Trench depths, or the height of the geotextile filter sheet behind gabion walls, must be less than or equal to 6 feet for the low survivability level.
In moderate survivability applications, significant installation stresses may occur, requiring higher geotextile strength. Examples of the moderate survivability application include:
•
•
•
Trench drains with a depth of greater than 6 feet. A geotextile filter sheet behind a gabion wall with a height greater than 6 feet. Any area drain.
An area drain is defined as a geotextile placed over or under a horizontal-to-moderately sloping (1.5H:1V or flatter slope) layer of drainage aggregate. Examples of area drains include:
•
•
•
•
Drainage layers over cut-and-cover tunnels. Rock buttress drainage. Permeable base beneath highway pavement (see the WSDOT Pavement Policy for additional information on permeable bases). A parking lot drainage layer.
Note that pipe wrapping (the geotextile is wrapped around the surface of the pipe) is not included as an underground drainage application. Locate the geotextile such that it will function as intended. For example, if the objective is to keep the drainage aggregate surrounding a drain pipe clean, locate the geotextile so that it completely separates the drainage aggregate from more silty surrounding soils, which may include native soils as well as relatively silty roadway base or fill materials. Consider the flow path of any groundwater or surface water when locating the geotextile. The flow path from the geotextile, as part of the groundwater drainage, is typically directed to a surface water conveyance system. Design of surface water conveyance is guided by the Hydraulics Manual. The surface water conveyance must be low enough to prevent backflow and charging of the groundwater drainage—typically, by matching inverts of groundwater drainage to crowns of surface water conveyance pipes. A 1-foot allowance is usually applied when connecting to open water or ditches.

Geosynthetics
630.05(2) Separation Geotextile used for separation must prevent penetration of relatively fine grained subgrade soil into the ballast or other roadway or parking lot surfacing material to prevent contamination of the surfacing material (the separation function). This application may also apply to situations other than beneath roadway or parking lot surfacing where it is not necessary for water to drain through the geotextile unimpeded (filtration), but where separation of two dissimilar materials is required. Separation geotextile should only be used in roadway applications where the subgrade is can be prepared and compacted as required in the Standard Specifications, but without removal and replacement of the subgrade soil with granular material. Such removal and replacement defeats the purpose of the geotextile separator. Separation geotextile placed beneath roadway surfacing is feasible if the subgrade resilient modulus is greater than 5,800 psi and if a saturated fine sandy, silty, or clayey subgrade is not likely to be present. Note that the feasibility of separation geotextile may be dependent on the time of year and weather conditions expected when the geotextile is to be installed. For separation applications, a geotextile is not needed if the subgrade is dense and granular (silty sands and gravels), but is not saturated fine sands. In general, a separation geotextile is not needed if the subgrade resilient modulus is greater than 15,000 psi.
630.05(3) Soil Stabilization Geotextile used for soil stabilization must function as a separator, a filtration layer, and (to a minor extent) a reinforcement layer. This application is similar to the separation application, except the subgrade is anticipated to be softer and wetter than in the separation application. Soil stabilization geotextile is used in roadway applications if the subgrade is too soft and wet to be prepared and compacted as required in the Standard Specifications. Soil stabilization geotextile is placed directly on the soft subgrade material, even if some overexcavation of the subgrade is performed. Backfill to replace the overexcavated subgrade is not placed below the geotextile soil stabilization layer, as this would defeat the purpose of the geotextile. Anticipate the need for soil stabilization geotextile if the subgrade resilient modulus is less than or equal to 5,800 psi, or if a saturated fine sandy, silty, or clayey subgrade is likely to be present. Consider the flow path of any groundwater or surface water when locating the soil stabilization geotextile and when selecting the geotextile to be used. For saturated fine sandy or silty subgrades, water must be able to flow from the subgrade through the geotextile soil stabilization layer during the pumping action caused by traffic loads. Even if the subgrade is not anticipated to be saturated based on available data, if the subgrade is silty or clayey and it is anticipated that the geotextile will be installed during prolonged wet weather, a soil stabilization geotextile may still be needed. Soil stabilization geotextile should not be used for roadway fills greater than 5 feet high or when extremely soft and wet silt, clay, or peat is anticipated at the subgrade level (for example, the deposits encountered in wetlands). In such cases, the reinforcement function becomes more dominant, requiring a site-specific design.

630.05(4) Permanent Erosion Control: Moderate and High Survivability The primary function of geotextile used for permanent erosion control is to protect the soil beneath it from erosion due to water flowing over the protected soil. The need for a permanent erosion control geotextile depends on the type and magnitude of water flow over the soil being considered for protection, the soil type in terms of its erodability, and the type and amount of vegetative cover present (see the Highway Runoff Manual). The source of flowing water could be streams, constructed channels, wave action, or runoff. Water may also flow from the soil behind the geotextile depending on the groundwater level. If groundwater cannot escape through the geotextile, an erosion control system failure termed ballooning (resulting from water pressure buildup behind the geotextile) or soil piping could occur. Therefore, the geotextile must have good filtration characteristics. Three classes of permanent erosion control geotextile are available to approximately match geotextile filtration characteristics to the soil. In order to select the drainage geotextile class, determine the gradation of the soil, specifically the percent by weight passing the #200 sieve. Base selection of the appropriate class of geotextile on Exhibit 630-1. A minimal amount of soil sampling and testing is needed to determine the geotextile class required. Permanent erosion control geotextile generally does not extend along the roadway alignment for significant distances as does underground drainage geotextile. One soil sample per permanent erosion control location is sufficient. If multiple erosion control locations are anticipated along a roadway alignment, soil sampling requirements for underground drainage can be applied. If soil conditions vary widely along the alignment where permanent erosion control geotextile is anticipated, different classes of erosion control geotextile may be required for specific sections of a continuous system. Examples of the permanent erosion control application are the placement of geotextile beneath riprap or gabions along drainage channels, shorelines, and waterways; around bridge piers; and under slope protection for highway cut or fill slopes. If a moderate survivability geotextile is to be used, the geotextile must be protected by a 12-inch aggregate cushion and be placed on slopes of 2H:1V or flatter to keep installation stresses to a relatively low level. Large stones can cause significant damage to a moderate survivability geotextile if the geotextile is not protected in this manner. If these conditions are not met, then a high survivability erosion control geotextile must be used.
630.05(5) Ditch Lining The primary function of the geotextile in a ditch lining application is to protect the soil beneath it from erosion. This ditch lining application is limited to constructed ditches less than 16 feet wide at the top with side slopes of 2H:1V or flatter. If the ditch does not meet these requirements, then permanent erosion control, with moderate or high survivability geotextile, must be used. It is assumed that only quarry spall-sized stones or smaller will be placed on the geotextile, so only a moderate survivability geotextile will be required. Filtration is not a significant function in this application. Since the ditch is relatively shallow, it is expected that the main water source will be the water carried by the ditch, and little water will pass through the geotextile. Another application with a similar geotextile function is the placement of geotextile below culvert outlets to prevent erosion at the outlet.

Geosynthetics
630.05(6) Temporary Silt Fence The primary function of geotextile used in a temporary silt fence is to prevent eroded material from being transported away from the construction site by runoff water. The silt fence acts primarily as a temporary dam and secondarily as a filter. In some cases, depending on the topography, the silt fence may also function as a barrier to direct flow to low areas at the bottom of swales where the water can be collected and temporarily ponded. It is desirable to avoid the barrier function as much as possible, as silt fences are best suited to intercepting sheet flow rather than the concentrated flows that would occur in swales or intermittent drainage channels. To function as intended, the silt fence should have a low enough permeability to allow the water to be temporarily retained behind the fence, allowing suspended soil particles in the water to settle to the ground. If the retention time is too long, or if the flow rate of water is too high, the silt fence could be overtopped, thus allowing silt-laden water to escape. Therefore, a minimal amount of water must be able to flow through the fence at all times. Temporary water ponding is considered the primary method of silt removal and the filtration capabilities of the fence are the second line of defense. However, removal of silt-sized particles from the water directly by the geotextile creates severe filtration conditions for the geotextile, forcing the geotextile to either blind or allow the fines to pipe through the geotextile. (Blinding is the coating of the geotextile surface with soil particles such that the openings are effectively plugged.) If the geotextile openings (AOS) are designed to be small enough to capture most of the suspended soil particles, the geotextile will likely blind, reducing the permeability enough to allow water to overtop the fence. Therefore, it is best to allow some geotextile openings that are large enough to allow the silt-sized particles to easily pass through. Even if some silt particles pass through the fence, the water flow rate below the fence will be decreased and the volume of silt-laden water passing through the geotextile is likely to be relatively small and the water is partially filtered. The geotextile apparent opening size (AOS) and permittivity are typically used to specify the filtration performance of geotextiles. The geotextile function in silt fence applications is more complex than this and AOS and permittivity do not relate directly to how well a silt fence will perform. However, nominal values of AOS and permittivity can be specified such that the types of geotextile products known to perform satisfactorily in this application are selected. These values are provided in the Standard Specifications. The source of load on the geotextile is from silt buildup at the fence and water ponding. The amount of strength required to resist this load depends on whether or not the geotextile is supported with a wire or polymer grid mesh between the fence posts. Obviously, unsupported geotextile must have greater strength than supported geotextile. If the strength of the geotextile or its support system is inadequate, the silt fence could fail. Furthermore, unsupported geotextile must have enough stiffness that it does not deform excessively and allow silt-laden water to go over the top of the fence.
630.05(6)(a) Need for Silt Fence The need for a silt fence can be anticipated where construction activities disturb and expose soil that could erode. The ground surface is considered disturbed if vegetative cover is at least partially removed over a significant area by construction activities. Consider whether or not silt-laden runoff water from the disturbed area can reach an environmentally sensitive area or a constructed stormwater system. If the exposed soil is a clean sand or gravel or if a significant zone of heavy vegetative cover separates the exposed soil from the environmentally sensitive area, a silt fence may not even be needed. Contact the Headquarters (HQ) Hydraulics Section for help in determining whether or not a silt fence is needed in such situations.

Geosynthetics
630.05(6)(b) Feasibility of Silt Fence The feasibility of a geotextile silt fence depends on the magnitude of water flow to the fence, the steepness of the slope behind the fence, and whether or not flow is concentrated at the fence. If the silt fence is not feasible, alternative erosion control methods may be needed (see the Highway Runoff Manual). Consider all feasible erosion control options in terms of potential effectiveness and economy before making the final decision to use a silt fence. Select the best option for the site conditions, including site geometry and contours, soil type, and rainfall potential. Consider silt fences for temporary erosion control in disturbed areas in the following circumstances:
•
•
•
•
•
Fully covering disturbed areas temporarily with polyethylene sheeting or other temporary covering is not feasible or practical. Permanent ground cover for disturbed areas is not yet established. Runoff water reaches the silt fence primarily as sheet flow rather than as concentrated flows, with the exception of some ditch and swale applications. Slopes above the silt fence are not steeper than 1.5H:1V. The sheet flow length (length of slope contributing runoff water to the silt fence) is not too long.
630.05(6)(c) Sheet Flow Length Maximum sheet flow lengths allowed for silt fences are provided in Exhibit 630-2, which is based on the typical 2-year, 24-hour design storm for Washington, resulting in a 24-hour rainfall of 3 inches. Exhibit 630-2 Maximum Sheet Flow Lengths for Silt Fences
Slope 1.5H:1V 2H:1V 4H:1V 6H:1V
Sheet Flow Length 100 ft 115 ft 150 ft 200 ft
The sheet flow length represents the area contributing runoff water from precipitation. The sheet flow length is defined in Exhibit 630-8. The sheet flow lengths provided in Exhibit 630-2 were determined assuming a bare soil condition, with the soil classified as a silt. These are worst-case assumptions because less runoff would be expected for sand or gravel soils or when some vegetation is present. The sheet flow length is usually equal to or greater than the disturbed soil slope length. However, undisturbed sloping ground above the disturbed slope area may also contribute runoff to the silt fence area. The length of undisturbed sloping ground above the disturbed slope to be included in the total contributing slope length depends on the amount and type of vegetation present, the slope steepness, and the degree of development above the slope. If unsure whether the proposed silt fence meets the requirements in Exhibit 630-2, contact the HQ Hydraulics Section for assistance.

630.05(6)(d) Temporary Silt Fence Temporary silt fences may also be used in ditch or swale applications. If the area contributing runoff to the fence exceeds the value determined from Exhibit 630-3, hydraulic overload will occur. The ditch or swale storage length and width are defined in Exhibit 630-9. The assumptions used in the development of Exhibit 630-3 are the same as those used for Exhibit 630-2 in terms of the design storm and ground conditions. As an example, if a site has a 13-foot-wide ditch with an average slope of 2%, the fence can be located such that 7800 ft2 of area drain to it. If it appears that the area draining to the fence will be larger than the allowable, it may be possible to divide the contributing area into smaller areas and add a silt fence for each smaller area as shown in Exhibit 630-10. The minimum storage length for the ditch behind each silt fence must be maintained. If this is not possible, it may be necessary to use an alternate erosion control structure, as described in the Highway Runoff Manual, or develop a special silt fence design. Exhibit 630-3 was developed with the assumption that water will be able to pond to a depth of at least 2 feet behind the fence. If this is not the case (the ditch or swale depth is less than 2 feet), the table cannot be used. Furthermore, the ditch depth must be greater than the height of the silt fence at its lowest point within the ditch. Otherwise, there will not be enough storage available behind the fence and water will circumvent the fence by flowing around it.
630.05(6)(e) Locating a Silt Fence Locate silt fences on contour as much as possible. At the ends of the fence, turn it up hill such that it captures the runoff water and prevents water from flowing around the end of the fence. This is illustrated in Exhibit 630-11. Silt fences are designed to capture up to a 2-foot depth of water behind the fence. Therefore, the ground line at the ends of the fence must be at least 2 feet above the ground line at the lowest part of the fence. This 2-foot requirement applies to ditches as well as to general slope erosion control.

Chapter 630
Geosynthetics
If the fence must cross contours (except for the ends of the fence), use gravel check dams placed perpendicular to the back of the fence to minimize concentrated flow and erosion along the back of the fence (see Exhibit 630-12).
•
•
•
•
The gravel check dams are approximately 1 foot high at the back of the fence and are continued perpendicular to the fence at the same elevation until the top of the dam intercepts the ground surface behind the fence. Locate the gravel check dams every 10 feet along the fence. In general, the slope of the fence line is not to be steeper than 3H:1V. For the gravel check dams, use Crushed Surfacing Base Course, Gravel Backfill for Walls, or Permeable Ballast (see the Standard Specifications).
If the silt fence application is considered critical (such as when the fence is placed immediately adjacent to environmentally sensitive areas like streams, lakes, or wetlands), place a second silt fence below the first silt fence to capture any silt that passes through the first fence and/or place straw bales behind the silt fence. Locate silt fences at least 7 feet from an environmentally sensitive area. Where this is impossible, and a silt fence must be used, a special design may be necessary. Temporary silt fences are sometimes used to completely encircle underground drainage inlets or other similar features to prevent silt from entering the drainage system. This is acceptable, but the silt fence functions primarily as a barrier, and not as a ponding or filtering mechanism, unless the drainage inlet is in a depression that is large enough to allow water to pond behind the silt fence.
•
•
If the drainage inlet and silt fence are not in a large enough depression, silt-laden water will simply be directed around the fence and must be captured by another fence or sedimentation pond downslope. If the depression is deep, locate the silt fence no more than 2 feet below the top of the depression to prevent overtopping. A site-specific design may be needed if the silt fence is located deeper than 2 feet within the depression.
It may be necessary to relocate silt fences during the course of a construction project as cuts and fills are built or as disturbed areas change. An erosion control/silt fence plan that accounts for the anticipated construction stages (and eventual removal) should be developed. Do not assume that one silt fence location can routinely be used for the entire life of the contract. Periodically check the locations in the field during the construction project, and field-adjust the silt fence locations as necessary to ensure the silt fences function as intended.
630.05(7) Standard Specification Geotextile Application Identification in the Contract Plans Identify the geotextile in the contract plan detail in a way that ties it to the appropriate application in the Standard Specifications. For example:
•
•
If a geotextile is to be used to line an underground trench drain 3 feet deep and the native soil has less than 15% passing the #200 sieve, identify the geotextile on the plan sheet as “Construction Geotextile for Underground Drainage, Low Survivability, Class A.” If the geotextile is to be placed beneath riprap on a slope without a cushion layer between the geotextile and the riprap, and the native soil contains 35% passing the #200 sieve, identify the geotextile on the plan sheet as “Construction Geotextile for Permanent Erosion Control, High Survivability, Class B.”

•
Geosynthetics
If the geotextile is to be placed between the roadway base course and a moist silt subgrade with a resilient modulus of 6,500 psi, and the roadway is planned to be constructed during the dry summer and early fall months, identify the geotextile on the plan sheet as “Construction Geotextile for Separation.”
630.05(8) Site-Specific Designs (All Applications) A site-specific design is required:
•
•
For all reinforcement applications. For applications not covered by the Standard Specifications.
Consider a site-specific design for:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
High-risk applications. Exceptionally large geotextile projects: if the geotextile quantity in a single application is over 35,000 yd2 or over 85,000 yd2 for the separation application. Severe or unusual soil or groundwater conditions. Soil in the vicinity of the proposed geotextile location that consists of alternate thin layers of silt or clay with potentially water-bearing sand layers on the order of 1 to 3 inches thick or less. Soil known through past experience to be problematic for geosynthetic drains. Drains in native soil behind structures except drains contained within granular backfill. Drains designed to stabilize unstable slopes. Drains designed to mitigate frost heave.
In such cases, obtain assistance from the HQ Materials Laboratory, Geotechnical Office. To initiate the special design, provide a plan and cross section showing:
•
•
•
•
The geosynthetic structure to be designed. The structure’s relative location to other adjacent structures that it could potentially affect. The structure’s intended purpose. Any soil data in the vicinity.
Consider a site-specific design for temporary silt fences:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
If silt fence must be used in intermittent streams or where a significant portion of the silt fence functions as a barrier that directs flow to the lower portions of the silt fence. If the fence must be located on steep slopes. In situations not meeting the requirements in Exhibit 630-2 and Exhibit 630-3. If the 2-year, 24-hour design storm for the site is greater than the 3 inches assumed for the development of Exhibit 630-2 and Exhibit 630-3. Where concentrated flow is anticipated. If closer than 7 feet from an environmentally sensitive area. If more than 2 feet of storage depth is needed.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 630-12
Chapter 630
Geosynthetics
For a site-specific temporary silt fence design, obtain assistance from the HQ Hydraulics Section. To initiate the design, send the following information to the HQ Hydraulics Section and a copy to the HQ Materials Laboratory, Geotechnical Office:
•
•
•
Plan sheets showing proposed silt fence locations and grading contours. Estimate of the area contributing runoff to each silt fence, including percentage and general type of vegetative cover within the contributing area. Any available site soil information.
For all site-specific designs of applications not covered by the Standard Specifications, complete plans and special provisions are needed. In general, for site-specific designs of Standard Specifications applications, only a minor modification of the appropriate geotextile property table will be needed.
630.06 Design Responsibility The design responsibility and process for geotextile design are illustrated in Exhibit 630-4 and Exhibit 630-5. The region Project Development Office, in particular the region Project Manager, is responsible to initiate and develop all geotextile designs for the Standard Specifications, except for roadway separation and soil stabilization applications, which are initiated and developed by the region Materials Laboratory. The region Materials Laboratory assists the region Project Manager with Standard Specifications underground drainage and permanent erosion control designs. The region Environmental Design Office assists with Standard Specifications, permanent erosion control, and temporary silt fence designs. Once the region Project Manager or Materials Laboratory has determined that a geotextile is appropriate, development of a geotextile design for the Standard Specifications includes the development of plan details showing the plan location and cross section of the geotextile installation. Standard details for geotextiles as provided in the Plans Preparation Manual may be used or modified to adapt to the specific project situation. Note that only minimum dimensions for drains are provided in these standard details. Site-specific geosynthetic designs and applications not addressed by the Standard Specifications are designed by the region with the assistance of the HQ Materials Laboratory, Geotechnical Office, or the HQ Hydraulics Section as described in Section 630.05. Design assistance by the HQ Geotechnical Office or HQ Hydraulics Section for site-specific design of Standard Specifications applications includes determination of geosynthetic properties and other advice as needed to complete the geosynthetic plans and any special provisions required. The HQ Geotechnical Office is fully responsible to develop and complete the following:
•
•
•
Geosynthetic design, plan details that can be used to develop the contract plan sheets, and special provisions for geosynthetic reinforced walls, slopes, and embankments. Deep trench drains for landslide stabilization. Other applications that are an integral part of a Headquarters geotechnical design.
The region Project Manager incorporates the plan details and special provisions into the PS&E.

Chapter 700 Project Development Roles and Responsibilities for Projects with Structures 700.01 General 700.02 Procedures
Exhibit 700-1 Determination of the Roles and Responsibilities for Projects with Structures: Project Development Phase
700.01 General This chapter presents the project development process used by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) in the regions and the Headquarters (HQ) Bridge and Structures Office to determine the roles and responsibilities for projects with structures during the project development phase of a project. This chapter complements WSDOT’s Project Management Guide: Project management guide | WSDOT (wa.gov) For design procedures, see Division 7 chapters and the Bridge Design Manual. The primary objective of this process is to provide a consistent means of selecting a bridge design team to perform the structural design work, whether it is by a consultant or the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. If the local agency will be requesting any services from WSDOT, the local agency will contact WSDOT’s Local Programs Engineer, who will help define the level of WSDOT’s involvement in design and construction.
700.02 Procedures The flow diagram (see Exhibit 700-1) begins at the left with the initial approval and funding of the project and ends at the right with the start of the project delivery process. After a project is programmed, WSDOT is tasked with confirming the project scope and defining the structural team’s level of involvement in design and construction. Structural support will be provided by the Bridge and Structures Office. The Bridge and Structures Office may procure or recommend the Region procure a consultant as needed. If a consultant is used, the region and the HQ Bridge and Structures Office will determine the level of involvement and responsibility for the design, including scope and level of effort. Agreements defining the level of involvement and responsibility will be developed and executed between the region office responsible for project development and the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, and the appropriate project delivery process will be implemented. More information on this process and the desired outcomes is available on the WSDOT website under the Structures Design Topic : Preliminary design, plan preparation & specifications | WSDOT (wa.gov)

710.01 General The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Headquarters (HQ) Bridge and Structures Office provides preliminary site data reviews to determine the applicability of, and requirements surrounding, proprietary structural solutions, or the need for specific structural design strategies, as well as structural design services to the regions. This chapter describes the information required by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office to perform these functions.
710.02 Required Data for All Structures Structure site data provides information about the type of crossing, topography, type of structure, and potential future construction. Submit structure site data to the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for all structures meeting the Chapter 720 definition of a bridge with a structural clear span equal to 30 feet or greater measured along the overcrossing alignment. This includes all buried structures such as concrete three-sided structures, concrete box culverts and split box culverts, and steel and aluminum structural plate, pipes, arches, and boxes. Structures conforming to the National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS) definition of a bridge, as cited in Chapter 720, having structural clear spans less than 30-feet as a general rule do not require preparation of a preliminary plan at the onset of design, and hence do not require structure site data to be submitted to HQ Bridge and Structures Office. See Section 720.03(14) when the delivery method involves a contractor supplied design. However, unique site-specific conditions known at the completion of the Preliminary Hydraulics Report may indicate the need for preparation of a preliminary plan in the design process, and thus require development of structural site data. Contact HQ Bridge and Structures Office after the completion of the Preliminary Hydraulics Report for collaboration. See Chapter 800 for specialty group coordination. Site data shall also provide information on nonstandard retaining walls needing project-specific design by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. Submit the structure site data to the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, Project Support unit, by email. In the email message, provide a general description of the project and provide a bullet list itemization of the structure site data forms, files, and data attached or linked in the email. Submit the structure site data as a CAD file with associated supplemental drawings and a report. (See Exhibit 710-1 for items to include in a structure site data submittal). Direct any questions relating to the preparation of structure site data to the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, Project Support unit. The Bridge Design Manual shows examples of required WSDOT forms.

710.02(1) Scour At any location where a structure can be in contact with water (such as culvert outfall, lake, river, or floodplain), there is a risk of scour. This risk is to be analyzed as part of the preliminary hydraulic design (PHD) and final hydraulic design (FHD) reports. Contact the HQ Geotechnical Office and the HQ Hydraulics Office to determine whether a scour analysis is required. See Chapter 800.

Coordinate any realignment of the waterway with the HQ Hydraulics Section. Many waterway crossings require a permit from the U.S. Coast Guard (see Bridge Design Manual Chapter 2.2.4 and the Environmental Manual). Generally, ocean tide-influenced waterways and waterways used for commercial navigation require a Coast Guard permit. These structures require the following additional information: o Names and addresses of the landowners adjacent to the bridge site. o Quantity of new embankment material within the floodway. This quantity denotes, in cubic yards, the material below and the material above normal high water.
For all waterway crossings, where the structural clear span parallel to the centerline of roadway width is less than 30 feet, the Region’s designer shall contact the US Coast Guard for determination of waterway jurisdiction and any associated permit requirements.

710.05(1) Bridge Widenings Submit DOT Form 235-002A, Supplemental Bridge Site Data-Rehabilitation/ Modification. Supplement structure site data for structures involving bridge widenings by the following:
710.05(1)(a) Plan
•
•
•

Elevations accurate to 0.1 foot taken at 10-foot intervals along the curb line of the side of the structure being widened. Pair these elevations with corresponding elevations (same station) taken along the crown line or an offset distance (10-foot minimum from the curb line). This information will be used to establish the cross slope of the existing bridge. Tabulate elevations in a format acceptable to the HQ Bridge and Structures Office.
Take these elevations at the level of the concrete roadway deck. For bridges with concrete overlay, elevations at the top of the overlay will be sufficient. For bridges with a nonstructural overlay, such as an asphalt concrete overlay, take elevations at the level of the concrete roadway deck. For skewed bridges, take elevations along the crown line or at an offset distance (10-foot minimum from the curb line) on the approach roadway for a sufficient distance to enable a cross slope to be established for the skewed corners of the bridge.
710.06 Site Data for Design-Build Conceptual Drawings Structure site data content and submittal requirements for development of structure conceptual drawings associated with Design-Build projects are similar but simplified to those associated with Design-Bid-Build projects. The simplified content requirements are outlined in Exhibit 710-2. The submittal of elements identified in Exhibit 710-2 as conceptual plan structure site data components shall conform to and be as described in Sections 710.02 through 710.05.

720.01 General The National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS), published in the Code of Federal Regulations (23 CFR 650, Subpart C), defines a bridge as: A structure including supports erected over a depression or an obstruction, such as water, highway, or railway, and having a track or passageway for carrying traffic or other moving loads, and having an opening measured along the center of the roadway of more than 20 feet between undercopings of abutments or spring lines of arches, or extreme ends of openings for multiple boxes; it may also include multiple pipes, where the clear distance between openings is less than half of the smaller contiguous opening. The term “bridge” as used in this chapter applies to all structures conforming to the above definition. This includes all buried structures with a structural clear span greater than 20 feet measured along the overcrossing alignment, such as concrete three-sided structures, concrete box culverts and split box culverts, and steel and aluminum structural plate, pipes, arches, and boxes. Bridge design is the responsibility of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Headquarters (HQ) Bridge and Structures Office, which develops a preliminary or conceptual bridge plan for a new or modified structure in collaboration with the region. This chapter provides basic design considerations for the development of this plan. Unique staging requirements, constructability issues, and other considerations are addressed during plan development. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office early in the planning stage regarding issues that might affect the planned project (see Chapter 700). See Exhibit 800-1 thru Exhibit 800-3 for specialty group coordination of water crossings.
720.02 Bridge Locations Bridge locations are chosen to conform to the alignment of the highway. Conditions that can simplify design efforts, minimize construction activities, and reduce structure costs are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
A perpendicular crossing. The minimum required horizontal and vertical clearances. A constant bridge width (without tapered sections). A tangential approach alignment of sufficient length not to require superelevation on the bridge. A crest vertical curve profile that will facilitate drainage. An adequate construction staging area.

Bridges
720.03 Bridge Site Design Elements 720.03(1) Structural Capacity The structural capacity of a bridge is a measure of the structure’s ability to carry vehicle loads. For new bridges, the bridge designer chooses the design load that determines the structural capacity. For existing bridges, the structural capacity is calculated to determine the “load rating” of the bridge. The load rating is used to determine whether or not a bridge is “posted” for legal weight vehicles or “restricted” for overweight permit vehicles.
720.03(1)(a) New Structures All new structures that carry vehicular loads are designed to HL-93 notional live load in accordance with AASHTO’s LRFD Bridge Design Specifications.
720.03(1)(b) Existing Structures When the structural capacity of a bridge will be affected by the project, the Region requests a Structural Capacity Report from the Risk Reduction Engineer in the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. Permanent redistribution of traffic, introduction of median barrier, and widening or deck rehabilitation are among the triggers for evaluation of a bridge’s structural capacity. The report will state:
•
•
The structural capacity status of the structures within the project limits. What action, if any, is appropriate.
The Region requests the Bridge and Structures Asset Manager to provide status about whether a bridge is included in the 6-year or 20-year plans for replacement or rehabilitation under the P2 program and, if so, in which biennium the P2 project is likely to be funded. The criteria used by the Bridge and Structures office to evaluate the structural capacity of a bridge are as follows: 1. On National Highway System (NHS) routes (including Interstate routes): o The operating load rating is at least 36 tons (which is equal to HS-20). o The bridge is not permanently posted for legal weight vehicles. o The bridge is not permanently restricted for vehicles requiring overweight permits. 2. On non-NHS routes: o The bridge is not permanently posted for legal weight vehicles. o The bridge is not permanently restricted for vehicles requiring overweight permits. Include the Structural Capacity Report in the Project File (see Chapter 300).
720.03(2) Bridge Widths The Design Manual contains multiple chapters that provide geometric cross section criteria and procedures relevant to determining design element widths. See Chapter 1230 for a guide to chapters that provide geometric cross section element widths. While it is preferred not to alter the continuity of a roadway, there may be situations where providing a structure width more or less than the roadway approaching the structure is appropriate. All structures on city or county routes crossing over a state highway must conform to the Local Agency Guidelines. For structures involving railroads, contact the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison.

Bridges
720.03(3) Horizontal Clearance Horizontal clearance for structures is the distance from the edge of the traveled way to bridge piers and abutments, traffic barrier ends, or bridge end embankment slopes. Minimum distances for this clearance vary depending on the type of structure. (See Chapter 1239, Chapter 1600, and Chapter 1610 and the Bridge Design Manual for guidance on horizontal clearance.) For structures involving railroads, contact the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison.
720.03(4) Bridge Medians Designs for bridges on divided multilane highways often include the decision to join parallel bridges as one or build them as independent structures. There are several factors in this decision, such as in new corridor construction, phased construction of corridors, and the general median width of the divided highway. This section covers some common design considerations related to bridge medians. Advances in crash barriers and their applications have resulted in an expanded set of choices for bridge medians on divided highways. Modern barrier designs and applications have allowed for longer runs of traffic barrier, different barrier types, and bullnose guardrail designs for shielding the gap between parallel structures. These tools have reduced collisions with abrupt bridge ends as well as shielded the opening between bridges. Some highway corridors are initially planned as multilane divided highways but may be developed in logical, affordable phases and individual projects. This could result in an initial phase where a corridor may open as a two-lane rural highway used by both travel directions. A later phase could convert the facility to a divided highway, bringing with it the need for median separation. Consider the long-range plans when determining median widths for bridges. The photos in Exhibit 720-1 show a completed multilane highway where two separate bridges were ultimately constructed years apart and a new corridor underway where one bridge is now built. Joining two structures may not be the most cost-effective or sustainable solution for all projects. Coordinate with the Bridge and Structures Office and the local Maintenance Office when discussing options and concerns. For bridges on parallel horizontal and vertical alignments, practical considerations for joining two structures as one includes, but are not limited to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Phased development where one structure exists, and another is planned. Old and new structure types and compatibility (with phased corridor construction). Median width. Median barrier treatment options. Environmental contexts and regulations. Seismic conditions and load ratings. Bridge maintenance and inspection techniques: accessibility options and equipment for terrain in specific contexts. An open area between structures may be needed for bridge inspection. Skew angles and/or curvature of waterways or roadways beneath the structures. Economics. Historical/aesthetic value of existing bridges to remain in place.

Chapter 720
Bridges
If structures will not be joined, evaluate the median as described here: When there is a median gap between bridges of 6 inches or more, the Region PEO will evaluate whether or not the median gap needs to be screened. Address the potential for pedestrians on the bridge and if closing the median gap to less than 6 inches, or installing fencing, netting, or other elements to enclose the area between the bridges would be beneficial. Document this evaluation in the Basis of Design and Alternatives Comparison Table. Exhibit 720-1 Phased Development of Multilane Divided Highways
720.03(5) Vertical Clearance Vertical clearance is the critical height under a structure that will accommodate vehicular and rail traffic based on its design characteristics. This height is the least height available from the lower roadway surface (including usable shoulders) or the plane of the top of the rails to the bottom of the bridge. Usable shoulders are the design shoulders for the roadway and do not include paved widened areas that may exist under the structure. In addition to the following vertical clearance guidance, consider whether the corridor experiences overheight loads. Consider a vertical clearance such that it will not create a new “low point” in the corridor.
720.03(5)(a) Vertical Falsework Clearance for Bridges Over Highways Construction of new bridges and the reconstruction or widening of existing structures often requires the erection of falsework across the traveled way of a highway. The erection of this falsework can reduce the vertical clearance for vehicles to pass under the work area. The potential for collisions to occur by hitting this lower construction stage falsework is increased. 1. On all routes that require a 16.5-foot vertical clearance, maintain this same clearance for falsework vertical clearance. o On structures that currently have less than a 16.5-foot vertical clearance for the falsework envelope, maintain existing clearance. o On new structures, maintain the falsework vertical clearance at least to those of the minimum vertical clearances referenced below. 2. Any variance from the above must be approved by the Regional Administrator or designee in writing and made a part of the Project File.

720.03(5)(b) Minimum Clearance for New Structures For new structures, the minimum vertical clearances are as follows:
i Bridge Over a Roadway The minimum vertical clearance for a bridge over a roadway is 16.5 feet.
ii Bridge Over a Railroad Track The minimum vertical clearance for a bridge over a railroad track is 23.5 feet (see Exhibit 720-2). A lesser clearance may be negotiated with the railroad company based on certain operational characteristics of the rail line; however, any clearance less than 22.5 feet requires the approval of the Washington State Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) per WAC 480-60. Vertical clearance is provided for the width of the railroad clearance envelope. Coordinate railroad clearance issues with the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison.
iii Pedestrian Bridge Over a Roadway The minimum vertical clearance for a pedestrian bridge over a roadway is 17.5 feet. Exhibit 720-2 Highway Structure Over Railroad
Notes:
•
•
•
•
Use 22.5-foot vertical clearance for existing structures. Lesser vertical clearance may be negotiated (see Section 720.03(5)). Increase horizontal clearance when the track is curved. Coordinate railroad clearance issues with the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison.

Bridges
iv Water Crossing Structures When determining the vertical clearance beneath a bridge or inside a buried structure, there are two elements that must be considered. The first is freeboard above the hydraulic design flood, and the second is Maintenance Clearance. Freeboard is related to the hydraulic capacity of the structure and is required by state and federal guidance. Typically, all bridges and buried structures are required to have a minimum of 1-3 feet of Freeboard above the hydraulic design flood water surface elevation (see WSDOT Hydraulics Manual). The State Hydraulics Engineer determines the Freeboard, and it is documented in the Preliminary/Final Hydraulic Design Report (PHD/FHD). Approval from the State Hydraulics Engineer is required for any vertical clearance that is less than Freeboard. Maintenance Clearance is the distance from the highest ground elevation within the horizontal limits of the Hydraulic Width to the controlling top elevation. The State Hydraulics Engineer determines the Hydraulic Width, and it is documented in the Hydraulic Design Report. Providing Maintenance Clearance beyond the minimum Freeboard is beneficial for required monitoring and inspections, as well as any maintenance activities that may be required during the life of the structure. Generally, these activities include staff walking through the culvert, taking measurements and photographs, but could also involve the use of machinery within the structure limits. Clearances above the minimums that are driven by other contextual needs, are typically captured in the structure free zone (SFZ) height term. For each water crossing location, evaluate and document the type of activities that will be conducted in collaboration with Region Maintenance, Bridge Preservation, ESO/Stream Restoration Biologists, and other key stakeholders. Additionally, site specific considerations must be evaluated in order to determine the appropriate Maintenance Clearance. See Vertical Clearance Considerations Design Bulletin 2022-03 (wa.gov) for additional information and considerations when determining the preferred vertical clearance. In general, when no large objects are placed beneath the structure, use 6 feet as the initial Maintenance Clearance target. Design Instructions - Vertical Clearance Considerations Large objects, including boulders and large woody debris, under or inside water crossing structures are not allowed unless approved by the State Hydraulics Engineer. When large objects are approved to be placed beneath the structure, provide 10 feet minimum Maintenance Clearance. The ARA for Development approves vertical clearance where greater than or equal to the Freeboard and does not otherwise require a Design Analysis.
720.03(5)(c) Minimum Clearance for Existing Structures The criteria used to evaluate the vertical clearance for existing structures depend on the work being done on or under that structure. When evaluating an existing structure on the Interstate System, see Section 720.03(5)(e), Coordination. This guidance applies to bridge clearances over state highways and under state highways at interchanges. For state highways over local roads and streets, city or county vertical clearance requirements may be used as minimum design criteria. (See Exhibit 720-3 for bridge vertical clearances.)

Bridges
i Bridge Over a Roadway For a project that will widen an existing structure over a highway or where the highway will be widened under an existing structure, the vertical clearance can be as little as 16.0 feet on the Interstate System or other freeways or 15.5 feet on nonfreeway routes. An approved design analysis is required for clearance less than 16.0 feet on Interstate routes or other freeways and 15.5 feet on nonfreeway routes. For a planned resurfacing of the highway under an existing bridge, if the clearance will be less than 16.0 feet on the Interstate System or other freeways and 15.5 feet on nonfreeway routes, evaluate the following options and include in a design analysis request:
•
•
•
Pavement removal and replacement Roadway excavation and reconstruction to lower the roadway profile Providing a new bridge with the required vertical clearance
Reducing roadway paving and surfacing thickness under the bridge to achieve the minimum vertical clearance can cause accelerated deterioration of the highway and is not recommended. Elimination of the planned resurfacing in the immediate area of the bridge might be a short-term solution if recommended by the Region Materials Engineer (RME). Solutions that include milling the existing surface followed by overlay or inlay must be approved by the RME to ensure adequate pavement structure is provided. For other projects that include an existing bridge where no widening is proposed on or under the bridge, and the project does not affect vertical clearance, the clearance can be as little as 14.5 feet. For these projects, document the clearance in the Design Documentation Package. For an existing bridge with less than a 14.5-foot vertical clearance, an approved design analysis request is required.
ii Bridge Over a Railroad Track For an existing structure over a railroad track (see Exhibit 720-2), the vertical clearance can be as little as 22.5 feet. A lesser clearance can be used with the agreement of the railroad company and the approval of the Washington State Utilities and Transportation Commission. Coordinate railroad clearance issues with the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison.

720.03(5)(d) Signing Low-clearance warning signs are necessary when the vertical clearance of an existing bridge is less than 15 feet 3 inches. Refer to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices and the Traffic Manual for other requirements for low-clearance signing.
720.03(5)(e) Coordination The Interstate System is used by the Department of Defense (DOD) for the conveyance of military traffic. The Military Traffic Management Command Transportation Engineering Agency (MTMCTEA) represents the DOD in public highway matters. The MTMCTEA has an inventory of vertical clearance deficiencies over the Interstate System in Washington State. Contact the MTMCTEA, through the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), if either of the following changes is proposed to these bridges:
•
•
A project would create a new deficiency of less than a 16.0-foot vertical clearance over an Interstate highway. The vertical clearance over the Interstate is already deficient (less than 16.0 feet) and a change (increase or decrease) to vertical clearance is proposed.
Coordination with MTMCTEA is required for these changes on all rural Interstate highways and for one Interstate route through each urban area.
720.03(6) Liquefaction Impact Considerations To determine the amount of settlement and the potential for the soil to flow laterally during the design level earthquake due to liquefaction, an analysis performed by the HQ Geotechnical Office is needed for each bridge project site location. The information collected is used by bridge engineers to determine the bridge’s capability to withstand the movement and loading in a seismic event and to explore other foundation mitigation options not necessitating total bridge replacement. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office, in collaboration with the HQ Geotechnical Office, evaluates bridgewidening projects involving liquefiable soils and recommends appropriate liquefaction mitigation. See the Bridge Design Manual LRFD for further information.
720.03(7) Pedestrian and Bicycle Facilities When pedestrians or bicyclists are anticipated on bridges, provide facilities consistent with guidance in Chapter 1510, Chapter 1515, and Chapter 1520. For locations where pedestrian users are not anticipated, evaluate the potential for stranded motorists to become pedestrians, where they may have exited their vehicle after a breakdown or other emergency. The infrequent and random nature of these occurrences makes it difficult to identify locations with even a moderate probability of pedestrian exposure. Evolving programs and technologies such as incident response, personal cell phones, and ITS cameras have further reduced the probability of motorists becoming pedestrians. Investigate other methods of treatment such as pedestrian signing or other low-cost safety improvement measures. Document decisions in the Basis of Design.

720.03(8) Bridge Approach Slab Bridge approach slabs are reinforced concrete pavement installed across the full width of the bridge ends. They provide a stable transition from normal roadway cross section to the bridge ends, and they compensate for differential expansion and contraction of the bridge and the roadway. Bridge approach slabs are provided on all new bridges. If an existing bridge is being widened and it has an approach slab, slabs are required on the widenings. The region, with the concurrence of the State Geotechnical Engineer and the State Bridge Design Engineer, may decide to omit bridge approach slabs. Document decisions in the DDP.
720.03(9) Traffic Barrier End Treatment Plans for new bridge construction and bridge traffic barrier modifications include provisions for the connection of bridge traffic barriers to the longitudinal barrier approaching and departing the bridge. Indicate the preferred longitudinal barrier type and connection during the review of the bridge preliminary plan.
720.03(10) Bridge End Embankments The design of embankment slopes at bridge ends depends on several factors. The width of the embankment is determined not only by the width of the roadway, but also by the presence of traffic barriers, curbs, and sidewalks, all of which create the need for additional widening. Examples of the additional widening required for these conditions are shown in the Standard Plans. The end slope is determined by combining the recommendations of several technical experts within WSDOT. Exhibit 720-4 illustrates the factors taken into consideration and the experts involved in the process.
720.03(11) Bridge Slope Protection Slope protection provides a protective and aesthetic surface for exposed slopes under bridges. Slope protection is normally provided under:
•
•
•
•
Structures over state highways. Structures within an interchange. Structures over other public roads unless requested otherwise by the public agency. Railroad overcrossings if requested by the railroad.
Slope protection is usually not provided under pedestrian structures. The type of slope protection is selected at the bridge preliminary plan stage. Typical slope protection types are concrete slope protection, and rubble stone.
720.03(12) Slope Protection at Water Crossings The HQ Hydraulics Section determines the slope protection requirements for structures that cross waterways. The type, limits, and quantity of slope protection are shown on the bridge preliminary plan.

720.03(13) Bridge Fence The Washington State Patrol (WSP) classifies the throwing of an object from a highway structure as an assault, not an accident or collision. Therefore, records of these assaults are not contained in WSDOT’s crash databases. Contact the Region Traffic Engineer, RME’s office and the WSP for the history of reported incidents. Bridge fence might reduce the number of incidents but will not stop a determined individual at that location, or deter them from moving to other locations in the area. Enforcement provides the most effective deterrent and is typically the first approach used. Installing bridge fence is analyzed on a case-by-case basis at the following locations:
•
•
•
•
•
On existing structures where there is a history of multiple incidents of objects being dropped or thrown and where enforcement has not changed the situation. On new structures near schools, playgrounds, or areas frequently used by children not accompanied by adults. In urban areas on new structures used by pedestrians where surveillance by local law enforcement personnel is not likely. On new structures with walkways where experience on similar structures within a 1-mile radius indicates a need. On private property structures, such as buildings or power stations, subject to damage.
In most cases, installing bridge fence on a new structure can be postponed until there are indications of need. Submit all proposals to install bridge fence on structures to the State Design Engineer, for approval. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for approval to attach bridge fence to structures and for specific design and mounting details.
720.03(14) Contractor Supplied Designs for Buried Structures When utilizing a contractor supplied design for a buried structure in a design-bid-build Contract (see WSDOT Bridge Design Manual 8.3.3.A), provide for sufficient time from award to any construction windows to allow for design, review, and fabrication of the Buried Structure (typically up to 6 months). Determine any restrictions to be placed on the contractor in their selection of buried structure, headwall, wingwall, vehicle barrier, and fall protection types. Include sufficient information in the contract documents so that the contractor can properly execute the design (see Plans Preparation Manual 700.06(2)).
720.03(15) Maintenance Access (New Section 2023) Provide permanent maintenance access from the roadway to all scour countermeasures when a bridge abutment is supported by a deep foundation (e.g., piles, drilled shafts) and the foundation is designed assuming the soil protected by the scour countermeasures remain in place. Additional consideration may include adequate maintenance staging area(s). Design any necessary highway elements such as the road approach to the highway (see Chapter 1340), access gate(s), roadside safety hardware and other highway features in accordance with Design Manual guidance. The width, grade and other features associated with the maintenance access beyond the highway features are designed on a case-by-case basis to reflect the needs of the individual location and the area maintenance’s equipment and ability to conduct potential scour countermeasures repair work. The Assistant Region Administrator for Maintenance & Operations must concur with the design of the maintenance access beyond the roadway features.

The project’s required restoration, right of way, and environmental footprint may be impacted. For example, the access road will be planted with vegetation that can be infrequently mowed or is easily removed and restored following the scour countermeasure maintenance activities (see Roadside Manual 830.06(3)). To ensure impacts and other considerations associated with the maintenance access to the scour countermeasures are adequately addressed, coordinate with subject matter experts such as region hydraulics, region landscape architect, environmental coordinator, area maintenance, materials engineer, right of way and others when developing the maintenance access.
720.04 Coordination with US Coast Guard for Existing Bridges Existing bridges crossing navigable waters occasionally require construction or maintenance activities that impact navigation channels governed by USCG permits. See Federally regulated waters, US Coast Guard (USCG) section of - https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/environmental-guidance/wetlands-other-waters and See “Bridges” Section of Federal Navigation Regulations | Navigation Center (uscg.gov). For fixed span bridges, this may include construction or maintenance activities that infringe upon the horizontal and vertical navigation opening defined in the USCG permit. See Environmental guidance - Wetlands & other waters | WSDOT (US Coast Guard (USCG), For bridge work) For movable bridges, in addition to the above, this may also include adjustments to existing bridge opening operating notice and process as defined in current regulations. See Movable bridges on state routes | WSDOT (wa.gov). Because these impacts are temporary and are limited to the duration of the construction or maintenance activity, they do not affect or change the actual USCG bridge permit. However, such temporary adjustments still require coordination with the US Coast Guard early in the project design schedule. The primary responsibility for this contact and coordination lies with the Region Design Project Office. The scope of such coordination varies depending on the extent of the infringement into the defined horizontal or vertical navigation clearance opening, the extent of the change to the bridge operation notice or process as defined in current regulation, and the duration of the construction or maintenance activity. This coordination activity may require the Design Project Office to conduct a survey of waterway users or to perform other background information tasks requested by the US Coast Guard. Projects with more extensive impacts may lie outside the approval authority of the local USCG Commander and may require review and action by US Coast Guard HQ in Washington, DC. In all cases, the earlier in the design process that the Region Design Project Office initiates these coordination efforts, the more likely the USCG can complete their regulatory process without impacting the project schedule.

730.01 General The function of a retaining wall is to form a nearly vertical face through confinement and/or strengthening of a mass of earth or other bulk material. Likewise, the function of a reinforced slope is to strengthen the mass of earth or other bulk material such that a steep (up to 1H:2V) slope can be formed. In both cases, the purpose of constructing such structures is to make maximum use of limited right of way. The difference between the two is that a wall uses a structural facing, whereas a steep reinforced slope does not require a structural facing. Reinforced slopes typically use a permanent erosion control matting with low vegetation as a slope cover to prevent erosion. (See the Roadside Manual for more information.) To lay out and design a retaining wall or reinforced slope, consider the following items:
•
•
•
•

•
Functional classification Highway geometry Design Clear Zone requirements (see Chapter 1600) Amount of excavation required Traffic characteristics Constructability Impact to adjacent environmentally sensitive areas Impact to adjacent structures Potential added lanes

Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
730.01(1) Retaining Wall Classifications Retaining walls are generally classified as gravity, semigravity, nongravity cantilever, or anchored. The various wall types and their classifications are summarized in Exhibit 730-1 through Exhibit 730-6. a) Gravity Walls Gravity walls derive their capacity to resist lateral soil loads through a combination of dead weight and sliding resistance. Gravity walls can be further subdivided into rigid gravity walls, prefabricated modular gravity walls, and mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) gravity walls. Rigid gravity walls consist of a solid mass of concrete or mortared rubble, and they use the weight of the wall itself to resist lateral loads. Prefabricated modular gravity walls consist of interlocking soil or rock-filled concrete, steel, or wire modules or bins (such as gabions). The combined weight resists the lateral loads from the soil. MSE gravity walls use strips, bars, or mats of steel or polymeric reinforcement to reinforce the soil and create a reinforced soil block behind the face. The reinforced soil block then acts as a unit and resists the lateral soil loads through the dead weight of the reinforced mass. MSE walls may be constructed as fill walls, with fill and reinforcement placed in alternate layers to create a reinforced mass, or reinforcement may be drilled into an existing soil/rock mass using grouted anchor technology to create a reinforced soil mass (soil nail walls). b) Semigravity Walls Semigravity walls rely more on structural resistance through cantilevering action of the wall stem. Generally, the backfill for a semigravity wall rests on part of the wall footing. The backfill, in combination with the weight of the wall and footing, provides the dead weight for resistance. An example of a semigravity wall is the reinforced concrete wall provided in the Standard Plans. c) Nongravity Cantilever Walls Nongravity cantilever walls rely strictly on the structural resistance of the wall in which vertical elements of the wall are partially embedded in the soil or rock to provide fixity. These vertical elements may consist of piles (such as soldier piles or sheet piles), caissons, or drilled shafts. The vertical elements may form the entire wall face or they may be spanned structurally using timber lagging or other materials to form the wall face. d) Anchored Walls Anchored walls derive their lateral capacity through anchors embedded in stable soil or rock below or behind all potential soil/rock failure surfaces. Anchored walls are similar to nongravity cantilevered walls except that anchors embedded in the soil/rock are attached to the wall facing structure to provide lateral resistance. Anchors typically consist of buried or grouted soil/rock anchors. Reinforced slopes are similar to MSE walls in that they also use fill and reinforcement placed in alternate layers to create a reinforced soil mass. However, the face is typically built at a 1.2H:1V to 1H:2V slope. Rockeries (rock walls) behave to some extent like gravity walls. However, the primary function of a rockery is to prevent erosion of an oversteepened but technically stable slope. Rockeries consist of large, well-fitted rocks stacked on top of one another to form a wall. An example of a rockery and reinforced slope is provided in Exhibit 730-10.

730.03 Design Principles The design of a retaining wall or reinforced slope consists of the following principal activities:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Develop wall/slope geometry Provide adequate subsurface investigation Evaluate loads and pressures that will act on the structure Design the structure to withstand the loads and pressures Design the structure to meet aesthetic requirements Ensure wall/slope constructibility Coordinate with other design elements
The structure and adjacent soil mass also needs to be stable as a system, and the anticipated wall settlement needs to be within acceptable limits.
730.04 Design Requirements 730.04(1) Wall/Slope Geometry Wall/slope geometry is developed considering the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Geometry of the transportation facility itself Design Clear Zone requirements (see Chapter 1600) Flare rate and approach slope when inside the Design Clear Zone (see Chapter 1610) Right of way constraints Existing ground contours Existing and future utility locations Impact to adjacent structures
Impact to environmentally sensitive areasFor wall/slope geometry, also consider the foundation embedment and type anticipated, which requires coordination between the various design groups involved. Retaining walls are designed to limit the potential for snagging vehicles by removing protruding objects (such as bridge columns, light fixtures, or sign supports).

Page 730-3
Chapter 730
Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
Provide a traffic barrier shape at the base of a new retaining wall constructed 12 feet or less from the edge of the nearest traffic lane. The traffic barrier shape is optional at the base of the new portion when an existing vertical-faced wall is being extended (or the existing wall may be retrofitted for continuity). Depending on the application, precast or cast-in-place Single Slope Concrete Barrier with vertical back or Type 4 Concrete Barrier may be used for both new and existing walls except when the barrier face can be cast as an integral part of a new wall. Design analyses may be considered, but they require approval as prescribed in Chapter 300. A design analysis is not required where sidewalk exists in front of the wall or in other situations where the wall face is otherwise inaccessible to traffic.
730.04(2) Investigation of Soils All retaining wall and reinforced slope structures require an investigation of the underlying soil/rock that supports the structure. Chapter 610 provides guidance on how to complete this investigation. A soil investigation is an integral part of the design of any retaining wall or reinforced slope. The stability of the underlying soils, their potential to settle under the imposed loads, the usability of any existing excavated soils for wall/reinforced slope backfill, and the location of the groundwater table are determined through the geotechnical investigation.
730.04(3) Geotechnical and Structural Design The structural elements of the wall or slope and the soil below, behind, and/or within the structure are designed together as a system. The wall/slope system is designed for overall external stability as well as internal stability. Overall external stability includes stability of the slope the wall/reinforced slope is a part of and the local external stability (overturning, sliding, and bearing capacity). Internal stability includes resistance of the structural members to load and, in the case of MSE walls and reinforced slopes, pullout capacity of the structural members or soil reinforcement from the soil.
730.04(3)(a) Scour At any location where a retaining wall or reinforced slope can be in contact with water (such as a culvert outfall, ditch, wetland, lake, river, or floodplain), there is a risk of scour at the toe. This risk must be analyzed. Contact the HQ Geotechnical Office and HQ Hydraulics Office to determine whether a scour analysis is required.
730.04(4) Drainage Design One of the principal causes of retaining wall/slope failure is the additional hydrostatic load imposed by an increase in the water content in the material behind the wall or slope. This condition results in a substantial increase in the lateral loads behind the wall/slope since the material undergoes a possible increase in unit weight, water pressure is exerted on the back of the wall, and the soil shear strength undergoes a possible reduction. To alleviate this, adequate drainage for the retaining wall/slope needs to be considered in the design stage and reviewed by the region Materials Engineer during construction. The drainage features shown in the Standard Plans are the minimum basic requirements. Underdrains behind the wall/slope need to daylight at some point in order to adequately perform their drainage function. Provide positive drainage at periodic intervals to prevent entrapment of water. Native soil may be used for retaining wall and reinforced slope backfill if it meets the requirements for the particular wall/slope system. In general, use backfill that is free-draining and granular in nature. Exceptions to this can be made depending on the site conditions as determined by the Geotechnical Office of the Headquarters (HQ) Materials Laboratory.

Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
A typical drainage detail for a gravity wall (in particular, an MSE wall) is shown in Exhibit 730-11. Include drainage details with a wall unless otherwise recommended to be deleted by the Region Materials Engineer or HQ Geotechnical Office.
730.04(5) Aesthetics Retaining walls and slopes can have a pleasing appearance that is compatible with the surrounding terrain and other structures in the vicinity. To the extent possible within functional requirements and cost-effectiveness criteria, this aesthetic goal is to be met for all visible retaining walls and reinforced slopes. Aesthetic requirements include consideration of the wall face material, top profile, terminals, and surface finish (texture, color, and pattern). Where appropriate, provide planting areas and irrigation conduits. These will visually soften walls and blend them with adjacent areas. Avoid short sections of retaining wall or steep slope where possible. In higher walls, variations in slope treatment are recommended for a pleasing appearance. High continuous walls are generally not desirable from an aesthetic standpoint, because they can be quite imposing. Consider stepping high or long retaining walls in areas of high visibility. Plantings may be considered between wall steps. Approval by the State Bridge and Structures Architect is required on all retaining wall aesthetics, including finishes, materials, and configuration (see Chapter 950).
730.04(6) Constructability Consider the potential effect that site constraints might have on the constructability of the specific wall/slope. Constraints to be considered include but are not limited to site geometry, access, time required to construct the wall, environmental issues, and impact on traffic flow and other construction activities.
730.04(7) Coordination With Other Design Elements 730.04(7)(a) Other Design Elements Retaining wall and slope designs are to be coordinated with other elements of the project that might interfere with or impact the design or construction of the wall/slope. Also consider drainage features; utilities; luminaire or sign structures; adjacent retaining walls or bridges; concrete traffic barriers; and beam guardrails. Locate these design elements in a manner that will minimize the impacts to the wall elements. In general, locate obstructions within the wall backfill (such as guardrail posts, drainage features, and minor structure foundations) a minimum of 3 feet from the back of the wall facing units. Greater offset distances may be required depending on the size and nature of the interfering design element. If possible, locate these elements to miss reinforcement layers or other portions of the wall system. Conceptual details for accommodating concrete traffic barriers and beam guardrails are provided in Exhibit 730-12. Where impact to the wall elements is unavoidable, the wall system needs to be designed to accommodate these impacts. For example, it may be necessary to place drainage structures or guardrail posts in the reinforced backfill zone of MSE walls. This may require that holes be cut in the upper soil reinforcement layers or that discrete reinforcement strips be splayed around the obstruction. This causes additional load to be carried in the adjacent reinforcement layers due to the missing soil reinforcement or the distortion in the reinforcement layers.

The need for these other design elements and their impacts on the proposed wall systems are to be clearly indicated in the submitted wall site data so the walls can be properly designed. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office (or the Geotechnical Office for geosynthetic walls/slopes and soil nail walls) for assistance regarding this issue.
730.05 Guidelines for Wall/Slope Selection Wall/slope selection is dependent on:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Whether the wall/slope will be located primarily in a cut or fill (how much excavation/shoring will be required to construct the wall or slope). If located in a cut, the type of soil/rock present. The need for space between the right of way line and the wall/slope or easement. The amount of settlement expected. The potential for deep failure surfaces to be present. The structural capacity of the wall/slope in terms of maximum allowable height. The nature of the wall/slope application. Whether or not structures or utilities will be located on or above the wall. Architectural requirements. Overall economy.
730.05(1) Cut and Fill Considerations Due to the construction technique and base width required, some wall types are best suited for cut situations, whereas others are best suited for fill situations. For example, anchored walls and soil nail walls have soil reinforcements drilled into the in-situ soil/rock and are therefore generally used in cut situations. Nongravity cantilevered walls are drilled or cut into the in-situ soil/rock, have narrow base widths, and are also well suited to cut situations. Both types of walls are constructed from the top down. Such walls are also used as temporary shoring to allow other types of walls or other structures to be constructed where considerable excavation will otherwise be required. MSE walls and reinforced slopes, however, are constructed by placing soil reinforcement between layers of fill from the bottom up and are therefore best suited to fill situations. Furthermore, the base width of MSE walls is typically on the order of 70% of the wall height, which requires considerable excavation in a cut situation. Therefore, in a cut situation, base width requirements usually make MSE structures uneconomical and possibly unconstructible. Semigravity (cantilever) walls, rigid gravity walls, and prefabricated modular gravity walls are free-standing structural systems built from the bottom up, but they do not rely on soil reinforcement techniques (placement of fill layers with soil reinforcement) to provide stability. These types of walls generally have a narrower base width than MSE structures (on the order of 50% of the wall height). Both of these factors make these types of walls feasible in fill situations as well as many cut situations. Reinforced slopes generally require more room overall to construct than a wall because of the sloping face, but they typically are a feasible alternative to a combination wall and fill slope to add a new lane. Reinforced slopes can also be adapted to the existing ground contours to minimize excavation requirements where fill is placed on an existing slope. Reinforced slopes might also be a feasible choice to repair slopes damaged by landslide activity or deep erosion.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 730-6
Chapter 730
Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
Rockeries are best suited to cut situations as they require only a narrow base width, on the order of 30% of the rockery height. Rockeries can be used in fill situations, but the fill heights they support need to be kept relatively low. It is difficult to get the cohesive strength needed in granular fill soils to provide minimal stability of the soil behind the rockery at the steep slope typically used for rockeries in a cut (such as 1H:6V or 1H:4V). The key considerations in deciding which walls or slopes are feasible are the amount of excavation or shoring required and the overall height. The site geometric constraints are defined to determine these elements. Another consideration is whether or not an easement will be required. For example, a temporary easement might be required for a wall in a fill situation to allow the contractor to work in front of the wall. For walls in cut situations, especially anchored walls and soil nail walls, a permanent easement may be required for the anchors or nails.
730.05(2) Settlement and Deep Foundation Support Considerations Settlement issues, especially differential settlement, are of primary concern in the selection of walls. Some wall types are inherently flexible and can tolerate a great deal of settlement without suffering structurally. Other wall types are inherently rigid and cannot tolerate much settlement. In general, MSE walls have the greatest flexibility and tolerance to settlement, followed by prefabricated modular gravity walls. Reinforced slopes are also inherently very flexible. For MSE walls, the facing type used can affect the ability of the wall to tolerate settlement. Welded wire and geosynthetic wall facings are the most flexible and the most tolerant to settlement, whereas concrete facings are less tolerant to settlement. In some cases, after the wall settlement is complete, concrete facing can be placed such that the concrete facing does not limit the wall’s tolerance to settlement. Facing may also be added for aesthetic reasons. Semigravity (cantilever) walls and rigid gravity walls have the least tolerance to settlement. In general, total settlement for these types of walls needs to be limited to approximately 1 inch or less. Rockeries also cannot tolerate much settlement, as rocks can shift and fall out. Therefore, semigravity cantilever walls, rigid gravity walls, and rockeries are not used in settlement prone areas. If very weak soils are present that will not support the wall and are too deep to be overexcavated, or if a deep failure surface is present that results in inadequate slope stability, select a wall type capable of using deep foundation support and/or anchors. In general, MSE walls, prefabricated modular gravity walls, and some rigid gravity walls are not appropriate for these situations. Walls that can be pile-supported, such as concrete semigravity cantilever walls, nongravity cantilever walls, and anchored walls, are more appropriate for these situations.
730.05(3) Feasible Wall Heights and Limitations Feasible wall heights are affected by issues such as the capacity of the wall structural elements, past experience with a particular wall, current practice, seismic risk, long-term durability, and aesthetics. For height limitations, see Exhibit 730-1 through Exhibit 730-6.
730.05(4) Supporting Structures or Utilities Not all walls are acceptable to support other structures or utilities. Issues that are to be considered include the potential for the wall to deform due to the structure foundation load, interference between the structure foundation and the wall components, and the potential long-term durability of the wall system. Using retaining walls to support other structures is considered to be a critical application, requiring a special design.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 730
Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
In general, soil nail walls, semigravity cantilever walls, nongravity cantilever walls, and anchored walls are appropriate for use in supporting bridge and building structure foundations. In addition to these walls, MSE and prefabricated modular gravity walls may be used to support other retaining walls, noise walls, and minor structure foundations such as those for sign bridges and signals. On a project-specific basis, MSE walls can be used to support bridge and building foundations as approved by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. Consider the location of any utilities behind the wall or reinforced slope when making wall/slope selections. This is mainly an issue for walls that use some type of soil reinforcement and for reinforced slopes. It is best not to place utilities within a reinforced soil backfill zone because it will be impossible to access the utility from the ground surface without cutting through the soil reinforcement layers, thereby compromising the integrity of the wall. Sometimes utilities, culverts, pipe arches, and so on must penetrate the face of a wall. Not all walls and facings are compatible with such penetrations. Consider how the facing can be formed around the penetration so that backfill soil cannot pipe or erode through the face. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for assistance regarding this issue.
730.05(5) Facing Options Facing selection depends on the aesthetic and structural needs of the wall system. Wall settlement may also affect the feasibility of the facing options. More than one wall facing may be available for a given system. Consider the available facing options when selecting a particular wall.
730.05(5)(a) MSE Walls For MSE walls, facing options typically include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Precast modular panels. In some cases, full height precast concrete panels. Full height panels are generally limited to walls with a maximum height of 20 feet placed in areas where minimal settlement is expected. Welded wire facing. Timber facing. Shotcrete facing with treatment options that vary from a simple broom finish to a textured and colored finish. Segmental masonry concrete blocks. Cast-in-place concrete facing with various texturing options.
Plantings on welded wire facings can be attempted in certain cases. The difficulty is in providing a soil at the wall face that is suitable for growing plants and meets engineering requirements in terms of soil compressibility, strength, and drainage. If plantings in the wall face are attempted, use only small plants, vines, and grasses. Small bushes may be considered for plantings between wall steps. Larger bushes or trees are not considered in these cases due to the loads they can create on the wall face. Geosynthetic facings are not acceptable for permanent facings due to potential facing degradation when exposed to sunlight. For permanent applications, use some type of timber, welded wire, or concrete face for geosynthetic walls. Shotcrete, masonry concrete blocks, cast-in-place concrete, welded wire, or timber are typically used for geosynthetic wall facings.

Chapter 730
Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
730.05(5)(b) Soil Nail Walls Soil nail walls can use either architecturally treated shotcrete or a cast-in-place facia wall textured as needed to produce the desired appearance.
730.05(5)(c) Prefabricated Modular Gravity Walls For prefabricated modular gravity walls, the facing generally consists of the structural bin or crib elements used to construct the walls. For some walls, the elements can be rearranged to form areas for plantings. In some cases, textured structural elements might also be feasible. This is also true of rigid gravity walls, though planting areas on the face of rigid gravity walls are generally not feasible. The concrete facing for semigravity cantilever walls can be textured as needed to produce the desired appearance.
730.05(5)(d) Nongravity Cantilevered Walls For nongravity cantilevered walls and anchored walls, a textured cast-in-place or precast facia wall is usually installed to produce the desired appearance.
730.05(6) Cost Considerations Usually, more than one wall type is feasible for a given situation. Consider initial and future maintenance costs throughout the selection process, as the decisions made may affect the overall cost. For example, you may have to decide whether to shut down a lane of traffic to install a low-cost gravity wall system that requires more excavation room or use a more expensive anchored wall system that will minimize excavation requirements and impacts to traffic. In this case, determine whether the cost of traffic impacts and more excavation justifies the cost of the more expensive anchored wall system. Consider long-term maintenance costs when determining wall type. Decisions regarding aesthetics can also affect the overall cost of the wall system. In general, the least expensive aesthetic options use the structural members of the wall as facing (welded wire or concrete or steel cribbing or bins), whereas the most expensive aesthetic options use textured cast-in-place concrete facias. In general, concrete facings increase in cost in the following order: shotcrete, segmental masonry concrete blocks, precast concrete facing panels, full height precast concrete facing panels, and cast-in-place concrete facing panels. Special architectural treatments usually increase the cost of any of these facing systems. Special wall terracing to provide locations for plants will also tend to increase costs. Therefore, weigh the costs against the value of the desired aesthetics. Other factors that affect the costs of wall/slope systems include wall/slope size and length; access at the site and distance to the material supplier location; overall size of the project; and competition between wall suppliers. In general, costs tend to be higher for walls or slopes that are high, but short in length, due to lack of room for equipment to work. Sites that are remote or have difficult local access increase wall/ slope costs. Small wall/slope quantities result in high unit costs. Lack of competition between materials or wall system suppliers can result in higher costs as well. Some of the factors that increase costs are required parts of a project and are therefore unavoidable. Always consider such factors when estimating costs because a requirement may not affect all wall types in the same way. Current cost information can be obtained by consulting the Bridge Design Manual or by contacting the HQ Bridge and Structures Office.

Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
730.05(7) Summary For wall/slope selection, consider factors such as the intended application; the soil/ rock conditions in terms of settlement, need for deep foundations, constructibility, and impacts to traffic; and the overall geometry in terms of wall/slope height and length, location of adjacent structures and utilities, aesthetics, and cost. Exhibit 730-1 through Exhibit 730-6 provide a summary of many of the various wall/slope options available, including their advantages, disadvantages, and limitations. Note that specific wall types in the exhibits may represent multiple wall systems, some or all of which will be proprietary.
730.06 Design Responsibility and Process 730.06(1) General The retaining walls available for a given project include standard walls, nonstandard walls, and reinforced slopes. Standard walls are those walls for which standard designs are provided in the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Standard Plans. These designs are provided for reinforced concrete cantilever walls up to 35 feet in height. The internal stability design and the external stability design for overturning and sliding stability have already been completed for these standard walls. Determine overall slope stability and allowable soil bearing capacity (including settlement considerations) for each standard-design wall location. Nonstandard walls may be either proprietary (patented or trademarked) or nonproprietary. Proprietary walls are designed by a wall manufacturer for internal and external stability, except bearing capacity, settlement, and overall slope stability, which are determined by WSDOT. Nonstandard nonproprietary walls are fully designed by WSDOT. The geosynthetic soil reinforcement used in nonstandard nonproprietary geosynthetic walls is considered to be proprietary. It is likely that more than one manufacturer can supply proprietary materials for a nonstandard nonproprietary geosynthetic wall. Reinforced slopes are similar to nonstandard nonproprietary walls in terms of their design process.
730.06(1)(a) Preapproved Proprietary Walls Some proprietary wall systems are preapproved. Preapproved proprietary wall systems have been extensively reviewed by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office and the Geotechnical Office. Design procedures and wall details for preapproved walls have already been agreed upon between WSDOT and the proprietary wall manufacturers, allowing the manufacturers to competitively bid a particular project without having a detailed wall design provided in the contract plans. Note that proprietary wall manufacturers might produce several retaining wall options, and not all options from a given manufacturer have necessarily been preapproved. For example, proprietary wall manufacturers often offer more than one facing alternative. It is possible that some facing alternatives are preapproved, whereas others are not preapproved. WSDOT does not preapprove the manufacturer, but specific wall systems by a given manufacturer can be preapproved. It is imperative with preapproved systems that the design requirements for all preapproved wall alternatives for a given project be clearly stated so that the wall manufacturer can adapt the preapproved system to specific project conditions. For a given project, coordination of the design of all wall alternatives with all project elements that impact the wall is critical to avoid costly change orders or delays during construction.

Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
These elements include drainage features, utilities, luminaires and sign structures, noise walls, traffic barriers, guardrails, or other walls or bridges. In general, standard walls are the easiest walls to incorporate into project Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E), but they may not be the most cost-effective option. Preapproved proprietary walls provide more options in terms of cost-effectiveness and aesthetics and are also relatively easy to incorporate into a PS&E. Nonstandard state-designed walls and nonpreapproved proprietary walls generally take more time and effort to incorporate into a PS&E because a complete wall design needs to be developed. Some nonstandard walls (such as state-designed geosynthetic walls) can be designed relatively quickly, require minimal plan preparation effort, and only involve the region and the Geotechnical Office. Other nonstandard walls such as soil nail and anchored wall systems require complex designs, involve both the HQ Bridge and Structures Office and Geotechnical Office, and require a significant number of plan sheets and considerable design effort. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office maintains a list of the proprietary retaining walls that are preapproved. The region consults the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for the latest list. The region consults the HQ Geotechnical Office for the latest geosynthetic reinforcement list to determine which geosynthetic products are acceptable if a critical geosynthetic wall or reinforced slope application is anticipated.
730.06(1)(b) Experimental Wall Systems Some proprietary retaining wall systems are classified as experimental by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The HQ Bridge and Structures Office maintains a list of walls that are classified as experimental. If the wall intended for use is classified as experimental, a work plan is to be prepared by WSDOT and approved by the FHWA. An approved public interest finding, signed by the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division, is required for the use of a sole source proprietary wall.
730.06(1)(c) Gabion Walls Gabion walls are nonstandard walls that are to be designed for overturning, sliding, overall slope stability, settlement, and bearing capacity. A full design for gabion walls is not provided in the Standard Plans. Gabion baskets are typically 3 feet high by 3 feet wide, and it is typically safe to build gabions two baskets high (6 feet) but only one basket deep. This results in a wall base width of 50% of the wall height, provided soil conditions are reasonably good (medium-dense to dense granular soils are present below and behind the wall).
730.06(2) Responsibility and Process for Design A flow chart illustrating the process and responsibility for retaining wall/reinforced slope design is provided in Exhibit 730-13. As shown in the exhibit, the region initiates the process except for walls developed as part of a preliminary bridge plan. These are initiated by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. In general, it is the responsibility of the design office initiating the design process to coordinate with other groups in the department to identify all wall/slope systems that are appropriate for the project in question. Coordinate with the region and the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, Geotechnical Office, and State Bridge and Structures Architect as early in the process as feasible. Headquarters or region consultants, if used, are considered an extension of the Headquarters staff and must follow the process summarized in Exhibit 730-13. All consultant designs, from development of the scope of work to the final product, are to be reviewed and approved by the appropriate Headquarters offices.

Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
730.06(2)(a) Standard Walls The regions are responsible for detailing retaining walls for which standard designs are available. For standard walls greater than 10 feet in height, and for all standard walls where soft or unstable soil is present beneath or behind the wall, a geotechnical investigation will be conducted, or reviewed and approved, by the HQ Geotechnical Office. Through this investigation, provide the foundation design, including bearing capacity requirements and settlement determination, overall stability, and the selection of the wall types most feasible for the site. For standard walls 10 feet in height or less where soft or unstable soils are not present, it is the responsibility of the region Materials Laboratory to perform the geotechnical investigation. If it has been verified that soil conditions are adequate for the proposed standard wall that is less than or equal to 10 feet in height, the region establishes the wall footing location based on the embedment criteria in the Bridge Design Manual, or places the bottom of the wall footing below any surficial loose soils. During this process, the region also evaluates other wall types that may be feasible for the site in question. The Standard Plans provides design charts and details for standard reinforced concrete cantilever walls. The Standard Plans are used to size the walls and determine the factored bearing pressure to compare with the factored bearing resistance determined from the geotechnical investigation. The charts provide maximum soil pressure for the LRFD service, strength, and extreme event limit states. Factored bearing resistance for the LRFD service, strength, and extreme event limit states can be obtained from the HQ Geotechnical Office for standard walls over 10 feet in height and from the region Materials Laboratory for standard walls less than or equal to 10 feet in height. The Standard Plans can be used for the wall design if the factored bearing resistance exceeds the maximum soil pressure shown in the Standard Plans for the respective LRFD limit states. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office if the factored bearing resistance provided by the geotechnical investigation does not exceed the maximum soil pressure shown in the Standard Plans for one or all of the LRFD limit states. The wall is considered a nonstandard wall design and the Standard Plans cannot be used. If the standard wall must support surcharge loads from bridge or building foundations, other retaining walls, noise walls, or other types of surcharge loads, a special wall design is required. The wall is considered to be supporting the surcharge load and is treated as a nonstandard wall if the surcharge load is located within a 1H:1V slope projected up from the bottom of the back of the wall. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for assistance The Standard Plans provides eight types of reinforced concrete cantilever walls (which represent eight loading cases). Reinforced concrete retaining walls Types 5 through 8 are not designed to withstand western Washington earthquake forces and are not to be used in western Washington (west of the Cascade crest). Once the geotechnical and architectural assessments have been completed, the region completes the PS&E for the standard wall option(s) selected, including a generalized wall profile and plan, a typical cross section as appropriate, and details for desired wall appurtenances, drainage details, and other details as needed. Metal bin walls, Types 1 and 2, have been deleted from the Standard Plans and are therefore no longer standard walls. Metal bin walls are seldom used due to cost and undesirable aesthetics. If this type of wall is proposed, contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for plan details and toe bearing pressures. The applied toe bearing pressure will then have to be evaluated by the HQ Geotechnical Office to determine whether the site soil conditions are appropriate for the applied load and anticipated settlement.

Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
730.06(2)(b) Preapproved Proprietary Walls Final approval of preapproved proprietary wall design, with the exception of geosynthetic walls, is the responsibility of the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. Final approval of the design of preapproved proprietary geosynthetic walls is the responsibility of the HQ Geotechnical Office. It is the region’s responsibility to coordinate the design effort for all preapproved wall systems. The region Materials Laboratory performs the geotechnical investigation for preapproved proprietary walls 10 feet in height or less that are not bearing on soft or unstable soils. In all other cases, it is the responsibility of the HQ Geotechnical Office to conduct, or review and approve, the geotechnical investigation for the wall. The region also coordinates with the State Bridge and Structures Architect to ensure that the wall options selected meet the aesthetic requirements for the site. Once the geotechnical and architectural assessments have been completed and the desired wall alternatives selected, it is the responsibility of the region to contact the suppliers of the selected preapproved systems to confirm in writing the adequacy and availability of the systems for the proposed use. Include a minimum of three different wall systems in the PS&E for any project with federal participation that includes a proprietary wall system unless specific justification is provided. Standard walls can be alternatives. Once confirmation of adequacy and availability has been received, the region contacts the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for special provisions for the selected wall systems and proceeds to finalize the contract PS&E in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual. Provide the allowable bearing capacity and foundation embedment criteria for the wall, as well as backfill and foundation soil properties, in the Special Provisions. In general, assume that gravel borrow or better-quality backfill material will be used for the walls when assessing soil parameters. Complete wall plans and designs for the proprietary wall options will not be developed until after the contract is awarded, but will be developed by the proprietary wall supplier as shop drawings after the contract is awarded. Therefore, include a general wall plan; a profile showing neat line top and bottom of the wall; a final ground line in front of and in back of the wall; a typical cross-section; and the generic details for the desired appurtenances and drainage requirements in the contract PS&E for the proprietary walls. Estimate the ground line in back of the wall based on a nominal 1.5-foot facing thickness (and state this on the wall plan sheets). Include load or other design acceptance requirements for these appurtenances in the PS&E. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for assistance. It is best to locate catch basins, grate inlets, signal foundations, and the like outside the reinforced backfill zone of MSE walls to avoid interference with the soil reinforcement. In those cases where conflict with these reinforcement obstructions cannot be avoided, indicate the location(s) and dimensions of the reinforcement obstruction(s) relative to the wall on the plans. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for preapproved wall details and designs for size and location of obstructions and to obtain the generic details that are to be provided in the plans. If the obstruction is too large or too close to the wall face, a special design may be required to accommodate the obstruction, and the wall is treated as a nonpreapproved proprietary wall. A special design is required if the wall will support structure foundations, other retaining walls, noise walls, signs or sign bridges, luminaires, or other types of surcharge loads. The wall is considered to be supporting the surcharge load if the surcharge is located within a 1H:1V slope projected from the bottom of the back of the wall. For MSE walls, the back of the wall is considered to be the back of the soil reinforcement layers. If this situation occurs, the wall is treated as a nonpreapproved proprietary wall.

Chapter 730
Retaining Walls and Steep Reinforced Slopes
For those alternative wall systems that have the same face embedment criteria, the wall face quantities depicted in the plans for each alternative are to be identical. To provide an equal basis for competition, the region determines wall face quantities based on neat lines. Once the detailed wall plans and designs are available as shop drawings after contract award, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office will review and approve the wall shop drawings and calculations, with the exception of geosynthetic walls. They are reviewed and approved by the HQ Geotechnical Office.
730.06(2)(c) Nonpreapproved Proprietary Walls Final approval authority for nonpreapproved proprietary wall design is the same as for preapproved proprietary walls. The region initiates the design effort for all nonpreapproved wall systems by submitting wall plan, profile, cross section, and other information for the proposed wall to the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, with copies to the HQ Geotechnical Office and the State Bridge and Structures Architect. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office coordinates the wall design effort. Once the geotechnical and architectural assessments have been completed and the desired wall types selected, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office contacts suppliers of the selected nonpreapproved wall systems to obtain and review detailed wall designs and plans to be included in the contract PS&E. To ensure fair competition between all wall alternatives included in the PS&E, make the wall face quantities identical for those wall systems subject to the same face embedment requirements. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office develops the special provisions and cost estimates for the nonpreapproved proprietary walls and sends the wall PS&E to the region for inclusion in the final PS&E in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual.
730.06(2)(d) Nonstandard Nonproprietary Walls With the exception of rockeries over 5 feet high, nonproprietary geosynthetic walls and reinforced slopes, and soil nail walls, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office coordinates with the HQ Geotechnical Office and the State Bridge and Structures Architect to carry out the design of all nonstandard, nonproprietary walls. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office develops the wall preliminary plan from site data provided by the region, completes the wall design, and develops the nonstandard nonproprietary wall PS&E package for inclusion in the contract. For rockeries over 5 feet high, nonproprietary geosynthetic walls and reinforced slopes, and soil nail walls, the region develops wall/slope profiles, plans, and cross sections and submits them to the HQ Geotechnical Office to complete a detailed wall/slope design. For geosynthetic walls and slopes and for rockeries, the region provides overall coordination of the wall/slope design effort, including coordination with the State Bridge and Structures Architect regarding aesthetics and finishes, and the region or HQ Landscape Architect if the wall uses vegetation on the face. The HQ Geotechnical Office has overall approval authority for the wall design. Once the wall design has been completed, the HQ Geotechnical Office, and in some cases the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, provides geotechnical and structural plan details to be included in the region plan sheets and special provisions for the PS&E. The region then completes the PS&E package. For soil nail walls, once the HQ Geotechnical Office has performed the geotechnical design, the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, in cooperation with the HQ Geotechnical Office, coordinates the design effort and completes the PS&E package.

730.06(3) Guidelines for Wall/Slope Data Submission for Design 730.06(3)(a) Standard Walls, Proprietary Walls, Geosynthetic Walls/Slopes, and Soil Nail Walls Where Headquarters involvement in retaining wall/slope design is required (as it is for standard walls and preapproved proprietary walls over 10 feet in height, gabions over 6 feet in height, rockeries over 5 feet in height, all nonpreapproved proprietary walls, geosynthetic walls/slopes, and all soil nail walls), the region submits the following information to the HQ Geotechnical Office or HQ Bridge and Structures Office as appropriate:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Wall/slope plans. Profiles showing the existing and final grades in front of and behind the wall. Wall/slope cross sections (typically every 50 feet) or InRoads files that define the existing and new ground line above and below the wall/slope and show stations and offsets. Location of right of way lines and other constraints to wall/slope construction. Location of adjacent existing and/or proposed structures, utilities, and obstructions. Desired aesthetics. Date design must be completed. Key region contacts for the project.
Note that for the purpose of defining the final wall geometry, it is best to base existing ground measurements on physical survey data rather than solely on photogrammetry. In addition, the region is to complete a Retaining Wall/ Reinforced Slope Site Data Check List, DOT Form 351-009 EF, for each wall or group of walls submitted.
730.06(3)(b) Nonstandard Walls, Except Geosynthetic Walls/Slopes and Soil Nail Walls In this case, the region is to submit site data in accordance with Chapter 710. Additionally, the region is to complete a Retaining Wall/Reinforced Slope Site Data Check List, DOT Form 351-009 EF, for each wall or group of walls.

Noise Barriers Exhibit 740-1 Standard Noise Wall Types
740.01 General The function of a noise barrier is to reduce traffic noise levels in adjoining areas. The noise abatement decisions are made during the environmental stage of project development, which is a highly interactive process. Before a noise barrier is designed, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) needs to be confident that there is significant need, a cost-effective and environmentally acceptable noise barrier, a source of funds, and acceptance by adjacent property owners, local governmental agencies, and the general public. Preliminary design information that may be found in the noise report includes:
•
•
•
•
•
Sources of noise. Noise receiver locations. Predicted level of noise reduction. Locations of existing and future noise ¬impacts along the project corridor. Barrier location and height recommendations based on what is feasible and reasonable.
Design of a noise barrier project is the result of a team effort coordinated by the Project Engineer. This chapter addresses the factors that are considered when designing a noise barrier and the associated procedures and documentation requirements.
740.02 Design The two basic types of noise barriers are the earth berm and the noise wall. An earth berm can be constructed to the full height required for noise abatement or to partial height in conjunction with a noise wall to reach the required height. A noise wall can be made of concrete, masonry, metal, wood, or other approved innovative products, and can be supported by spread, pile, shaft, or trench footings. Consideration of the noise report and the visual characteristics of adjacent land forms, vegetation, and structural elements (such as buildings, bridges, and retaining walls) will determine whether a proposed noise barrier might be berm, wall, or both. An earth berm is the primary alternative if the visual and environmental quality of the corridor will be preserved or enhanced and materials and right of way widths are available. (See the Roadside Manual for criteria for determining whether a vegetated earth berm is appropriate.) The region uses the noise report and other environmental documents (see the Environmental Manual) to help determine the location, exposure conditions, length, and height of the proposed noise barrier.

740.02(1) Earth Berm Berm slopes are a function of the material used, the attainable right of way width, and the desired visual quality. Slopes steeper than 2H:1V (3H:1V for mowing) are not recommended. Design the end of the berm with a lead-in slope of 10H:1V and curve it toward the right of way line. Refer to the Roadside Manual for guidance regarding vegetation on berms.
740.02(2) Noise Wall When feasible, to encourage competitive bidding, include several alternate noise wall designs in the contract and permit the contractor to submit alternate designs under the value engineering specification. There are noise wall designs in the Standard Plans. Additional designs are in various stages of development to become standard plans. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 740-2
Chapter 740
Noise Barriers
The draft-standard design sheets and other preapproved plans are available from the Headquarters (HQ) Bridge and Structures Office. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office also works with the regions to facilitate the use of other designs as bidding options. When a noise wall has ground elevations that are independent of the roadway elevations, a survey of ground breaks (or cross sections at 25 foot intervals) along the entire length of the wall is needed for evaluation of constructability and to assure accurate determination of panel heights. Size of openings (whether lapped, door, or gated) depends on the intended users. Agencies such as the local fire department can provide the necessary requirements. Unless an appropriate standard plan is available, such openings are designed and detailed for the project. When a noise wall is inside the Design Clear Zone, design its horizontal and vertical (ground elevation) alignment as if it were a rigid concrete traffic barrier. (See Chapter 1610 for maximum flare rates.) See Chapter 1600 for more information about Design Clear Zone. Provide a traffic barrier when a new noise wall is constructed within the Design Clear Zone. Installation of a traffic barrier is optional for a new wall when an existing wall is being extended (or the existing wall may be retrofitted with a barrier for continuity). For flare rates and approach slopes for concrete barriers, see Chapter 1610. Noise walls that provide a traffic barrier integrated in the design are available. Contact HQ Design for more information. To designate a standard noise wall, select the appropriate general special provisions (GSPs) and state the standard plan number, type, and foundation type. Wall type is a function of exposure and wind speed (see Exhibit 740-1). A geotechnical report identifying the angle of internal friction “f” and the allowable bearing pressure is needed for selection of a standard foundation. The standard spread footing designs require an allowable bearing pressure of 1 Tsf (Ton per square foot). The standard trench and shaft footing designs require an “f” of at least 32° for D1 and 38° for D2. A special design of the substructure is required for noise walls on substandard soil, where winds exceed 90 mph, and for exposures other than B1 and B2 as defined in Exhibit 740-1. For maintenance of the surface of a tall wall (10 feet or more), consider harness tie offs for the fall protection required by the Department of Labor and Industries. Exhibit 740-1 Standard Noise Wall Types

Wind speed is according to Figure 1-2.1.2.A of the (AASHTO) Guide Specifications for Structural Design of Sound Barriers. Assume the wind to be perpendicular to the wall on both sides and design for the most exposed side.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 740-3
Chapter 740
Noise Barriers
Exposure is determined by the nature of the immediately adjacent ground surface and the extension of a plane at the adjacent ground surface elevation for 1500 feet to either side of the noise wall:
•
•
•
Exposure B1 = Urban and suburban areas with numerous closely spaced obstructions having the size of single-family or larger dwellings that prevail in the upwind direction from the noise barrier for a distance of at least 1,500 feet. Exposure B2 = Urban and suburban areas with more open terrain not meeting the requirements of Exposure B1. Exposure C = Open terrain with scattered obstructions that includes flat, open country, grasslands, and elevated terrain.
*For a noise wall with Exposure C, on a bridge or overpass or at the top of a slope, consult the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, as a special design will probably be necessary.
740.03 Procedures The noise unit notifies the Project Engineer’s Office when a noise barrier is recommended in the noise report. The Project Engineer’s Office is responsible for interdisciplinary teams, consultation, and coordination with the public, noise specialists, maintenance, construction, region Landscape Architecture Office (or the HQ Roadside and Site Development Section), right of way personnel, Materials Laboratory, State Bridge and Structures Architect, HQ Bridge and Structures Office, CAE Support Team, HQ Development Services & Access Manager, consultants, and many others. If a noise wall is contemplated, the region evaluates the soils (see Chapter 610 and Chapter 710) and obtains a list of acceptable wall design options. The list is obtained by sending information pertaining to soils and drainage conditions, alignment, and height of the proposed wall to the State Bridge and Structures Architect. If a vegetated earth berm is considered, see the Roadside Manual for procedures. The State Bridge and Structures Architect coordinates with the HQ Bridge and Structures Office, HQ Hydraulics Section, HQ Geotechnical Office, and the region to provide a list of acceptable standard, draft-standard, and preapproved proprietary noise wall designs, materials, and finishes that are compatible with existing visual elements of the corridor. Only wall designs from this list may be considered as alternatives. Limit design visualizations of the highway side of proposed walls (available from the CAE Support Team in Olympia) to options from this list. The visual elements of the private property side of a wall are the responsibility of the region unless addressed in the environmental documents. After the noise report is completed, any changes to the ¬dimensions or location of a noise barrier must be reviewed by the appropriate noise unit to determine the impacts of the changes on noise abatement. On limited access highways, coordinate any opening in a wall or fence (for pedestrians or vehicles) with the HQ Development Services & Access Manager and obtain approval from the Director & State Design Engineer, Development Division. On nonlimited access highways, an access connection permit is required for any opening (approach) in a wall or fence. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office provides special substructure designs to the regions upon request; reviews contract design data related to standard, draft-standard, and preapproved designs; and reviews plans and calculations that have been prepared by others (see Chapter 710).

Noise Barriers
Approval by the State Bridge and Structures Architect is required for any attachment or modification to a noise wall and for the design, appearance, and finish of door and gate-type openings. Approval by the State Bridge and Structures Architect is also required for the final selection of noise wall appearance, finish, materials, and configuration.

800.01 General This chapter is intended to serve as a guide to highway designers so they can identify and consider hydraulicrelated factors that impact design. Detailed criteria and methods that govern highway hydraulic design are in the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) Hydraulics Manual and Highway Runoff Manual. Some drainage, flood, and water quality problems can be easily recognized and resolved; others might require extensive investigation before a solution is developed. The Project Engineer’s Office (PEO) should use good engineering judgment and be mindful of WSDOT’s legal and ethical obligations concerning hydraulic issues. The Hydraulics Manual explains WSDOT policy regarding hydraulic design and hydraulic reports; this chapter also includes roles and responsibilities and required documentation for hydraulic reports. Below is a summary of roles and responsibilities:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
PEO – responsible for the preparation of correct and adequate stormwater and drainage design. The work may be performed by WSDOT or a private consultant engineer but is overseen by the PEO. The PEO is also responsible for initiating the application for required hydraulic-related permits. Region Hydraulic Engineer (RHE) provide technical assistance to Scoping teams, Pre-Design teams, PEOs, WSDOT consultants, Maintenance, Developer Services and Local Programs. The roles and responsibilities of the RHE and HQ Hydraulics Section are outlined in the Hydraulics Manual. WSDOT Headquarters (HQ) Hydraulics Section – responsible for the preparation or oversight of all hydraulics Specialty reports as described in the Hydraulics Manual. While the PEO is responsible for preparation of reports, plans, specs, and estimate for all drainage facilities except bridges, assistance from the RHE and the HQ Hydraulics Section may be requested for any drainage facility design. Geotechnical – responsible for understanding the characteristics of the soil and rock materials that support or are adjacent to a transportation facility so that, when designed, constructed, and maintained, the facility will be adequate to safely carry the estimated traffic and to support hydraulic structures for stormwater and stream crossing designs, as set forth in the Geotechnical Design Manual. Bridge – responsible for delivering or coordinating bridge design calculation and plans per WSDOT Bridge Design Procedure and the Bridge Design Manual; review consultant and contractor designed structures; acts as the subject matter expert for structural issues; assure that the most cost-effective and appropriate structure type is selected for a particular bridge site. Pre-Design Team – consists of engineering, environmental, utilities, real estate, geotechnical, bridge and structures staff for coordination prior to beginning preliminary design. The Pre-Design Guidance for Fish Passage Projects document contains helpful links and provides guidance for pre-design. Design Team – the team of designers, checkers, engineers, and architects responsible for design and preparation of the contract documents for construction.

800.02 Coordination with Other Specialty Groups For the design and construction of structures, walls, and roadway embankments in the vicinity of waterbodies, early and often coordination with specialty groups, along with coordination at key check-in points throughout the project delivery process is critical for the efficient delivery of a project. In Exhibit 800-1 through Exhibit 800-3, the pre-design team/project engineering office (PEO) includes, environmental, survey, utilities, right of way and other groups to support the project. The coordination for the design and construction of structures, walls, and roadway embankments in the vicinity of waterbodies is only one component of many that the delivery team needs to consider within the entire PS&E process. Exhibit 800-1 through Exhibit 800-3 provide a series of flow charts to illustrate the process and timing throughout the project delivery process (e.g., pre-design through construction) for the minimum level of coordination between the following groups: pre-design team, design team, bridge, geotechnical, hydraulics, WSDOT maintenance office, and the WSDOT construction office. Exhibit 800-1 is a flow chart for specialty group coordination during pre-design, resulting in a structure free zone (SFZ) determined collaboratively by the pre-design team, hydraulics, geotechnical, and bridge. This SFZ shall be used for the next steps in design or development of design-build documentation. To determine the SFZ, early coordination between the pre-design team, geotechnical, and hydraulics for identifying potential risks such as total scour, seismic conditions, and unstable slopes is important to reduce the potential for unaccounted costs later in design or construction. Coordination between the geotechnical and hydraulic engineers is necessary to obtain data as part of the geotechnical scoping memo/package for determining total scour and the need for scour countermeasures, which may affect the SFZ at the pre-design phase. For design-build, the information determined during the pre-design phase is used to assist in preparing the design-build documentation. For a design-bid-build, the design team determines if the structure and walls will be contractor supplied design (Exhibit 800-2) or designed by a bridge and geotechnical engineer as part of the PS&E (Exhibit 800-3). Exhibit 800-2 is a flow chart when the design team determines the crossing structure will be designed through a contractor supplied design method. The starting point for Exhibit 800-2 is after the SFZ is determined during predesign. Since the structure will be designed by the contractor, the design team shall provide preliminary structures plans. The geotechnical engineer completes the geotechnical data required for the substructure design and coordinates with the hydraulic engineer to make sure there will be sufficient geotechnical data to assess preliminary total scour. After completion of the geotechnical substructure design, the design team, geotechnical engineer, and hydraulic engineer coordinate to determine if the preliminary structure span and substructure types are feasible for the calculated scour depths. If the structure span is feasible, a final geotechnical report and final hydraulic design report (FHD) are completed. If the structure span is not feasible, additional structure types and sizes are evaluated. Coordination continues through PS&E to make sure the contract is in compliance with the design. Once a contract is awarded, the Region construction office coordinates with the design team, geotechnical engineer, and hydraulic engineer for review of Type 3E working drawings and other various submittals. The Region construction office shall coordinate with the HQ Hydraulics office for all stream and restoration construction components of the design. Exhibit 800-3 is a flow chart is for the structure design process. The starting point for Exhibit 800-3 is after the SFZ is determined during pre-design. The design team coordinates with the bridge engineer, geotechnical engineer, and hydraulic engineer to complete the various Bridge Design Manual (BDM) forms for site data, stream crossing, and other various geotechnical and hydraulics information. This information will be part of the bridge site data packet. After structure preliminary plans are completed, the geotechnical engineer completes the geotechnical data required for the substructure design and coordinates with the hydraulic engineer to make sure there will be sufficient geotechnical data to assess preliminary total scour.

Chapter 800
Hydraulic Design
After completion of the geotechnical substructure design, the design team, bridge engineer, geotechnical engineer, and hydraulic engineer coordinate to determine if the preliminary structure span and substructure types are feasible. If feasible, a final geotechnical report and final hydraulic design (FHD) are completed. If not feasible, alternative structure types are evaluated. Coordination continues through PS&E to make sure the contract is compliant with the design. The Region construction office coordinates with the PEO, HQ Geotechnical office, HQ Hydraulics office, and the HQ Bridge and Structures office for review of various submittals. The Region construction office shall coordinate with the HQ Hydraulics office for all stream construction and restoration.
800.03 Hydraulic Design Process The overall Hydraulic Design Process includes Scoping, Pre-Design, and Design. To allow the most efficient hydraulic report review and assessment, PEOs shall follow the hydraulic review process outlined in Section 1-5 and Figure 1-1 of the Hydraulics Manual. Figure 1-1 has been revised for this Design Manual Chapter and is shown here in Exhibit 800-4. All projects are required to complete a hydraulic assessment. During the Scoping phase, all WSDOT projects shall complete a stormwater and hydraulic assessment. Scoping instructions can be found online under Tools, Templates, and Links on the HQ Hydraulics website. This assessment’s goal is to discuss the following:
•
•
•
•
Does the project have existing stormwater and hydraulic deficiencies within the project limits? If so, assess and discuss the risk of the project not addressing these deficiencies. Does the project’s impacts or modifications make existing stormwater and hydraulic conditions worse? Does the project’s impacts or modifications create new stormwater and hydraulic issues that need to be addressed? Are there any stormwater retrofit opportunities within the project limits?
In many cases, the stormwater assessment may lead the project to create a hydraulic report. On certain types of projects, the stormwater and hydraulic assessment may be very brief if the impacts are minor, there are not any existing stormwater and hydraulic deficiencies within the project limits, and there are not any stormwater retrofit opportunities within the project limits. For example, a “paver” project may have a very brief stormwater and hydraulic assessment since the work is typically limited to just replacing the existing pavement. The Region Hydraulics Engineer shall review each stormwater and hydraulic assessment to determine the appropriate action and documentation necessary to support the project. There are three types of Hydraulic Reports: Specialty Report, Hydraulic Report Type A, and Hydraulic Report Type B. All reports developed for WSDOT must be reviewed and receive concurrence; Specialty Reports and Type A Hydraulic Reports require concurrence by the HQ Hydraulics Section, while a Type B Hydraulic Report only requires concurrence by the RHE. For some regions, HQ Hydraulics has delegated concurrence authority for Type A Hydraulic Report to the RHE. For design-bid-build projects, concurrence is required prior to the project advertisement date. For design-build projects, the identified concurring RHE or HQ Hydraulics Section engineer shall be involved in developing the scope and the Request for Proposal and reviewing conceptual hydraulics reports. The Hydraulics Manual discusses Hydraulic Reports, including a definition of the report types, descriptions, and respective concurrence requirements by RHE and/or HQ Hydraulics Section. PEOs shall contact the RHE to determine the hydraulic report review process. For more info regarding milestones and scheduling, see the Hydraulics Manual.

Hydraulic Design
800.04 Floodplain Management Encroachment of a highway or highway facility into a floodplain might present significant problems and requires an investigation for further action. A thorough investigation includes the following:
•
•
•
•
•
The effect of the design flood on the highway or highway facility and the required protective measures. The effect of the highway or highway facility on the upstream and downstream reaches of the stream and the adjacent property. Compliance with hydraulic-related environmental concerns and hydraulic aspects of permits from other governmental agencies per Chapter 225 of the Design Manual. Addressing requirements in Chapter 432 of the Environmental Manual. Compliance with floodplain requirements for non water-crossing projects per the Hydraulics Manual.
A Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) is required for all water crossing projects. WSDOT has developed a template for completing an FRA which serves as communication tool for identifying potential risks of meeting (1) FEMA, (2) local jurisdiction, and (3) public health and safety in the preliminary stages of design. The FRA helps to identify subsequent deliverables that may be needed for the permitting process. Once the Preliminary Hydraulic Design (PHD) is complete (or near completion) an FRA shall be completed and reviewed by HQ Hydraulics Section. The FRA is then provided to the PEO to be used to communicate with local communities and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) about potential flood risks associated with the proposed project. The FRA will also help determine the likelihood of needing to complete a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) based on the selected alternative documented in the PHD. The FRA is intended to help determine if the project may require a CLOMR, easements, right-of-way acquisition (or other critical path tasks) early in the project delivery process; these critical path items can have large impacts on the project schedule and should thus be coordinated early in the process. It is also intended that the FRA, along with the PHD, be used as reference documents for design build. The FRA is further discussed in the Hydraulics Manual. Projects proposed within a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) and other floodplain management additional requirements are found in Chapter 432 of the Environmental Manual.
800.05 Water Crossings Chapter 7 of the Hydraulics Manual covers the design requirements for water crossings on state highways. All fish-bearing water crossings within Washington State must meet the requirements of WAC’s Hydraulic Code Rules and the requirements of the Hydraulics Manual. WSDOT and WDFW have cooperated in a Fish Passage Barrier Removal program since 1991. To determine if a water crossing is within a fish bearing stream, PEOs can check the WSDOT fish barrier database or contact the HQ Environmental Services Office to determine if there are fish barriers within the limits of the proposed project. New water crossings (e.g., bridges and culverts) must be designed to meet current fish passage standards and WAC to ensure they do not hinder fish use or migration. HQ Hydraulics oversees the preparation of Preliminary and Final Hydraulic Design (PHD and FHD) for fish passage projects. Refer to Exhibit 800-5 for a flow chart describing the PHD Stream Design Process.
800.06 Safety Considerations Locate culvert ends outside the Design Clear Zone when feasible. (See Section 1600.03(2)(c) for roadside safety and hydraulic considerations with the design clear zone.)

Roadsides
900.01 General 900.02 Project Development 900.03 Documentation 900.04 References
900.01 General The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) recognizes roadsides as an asset. WSDOT is committed to highway designs that meet the transportation needs in a way that reduces the potential for fatal and injury crashes, is cost-effective, ecologically appropriate, context appropriate, and maintainable by managing roadsides that balance the natural and environmental functions within the right of way. The roadside integrates natural processes and visual continuity into the built (roadway) environment, preserving and promoting these natural and environmental functions. Highway projects achieve this integration through introduction and configuration of specific design elements such as structures, vegetation, signs, pedestrian and bicycle movement, erosion control, stormwater treatment facilities, etc. Develop highway designs in accordance with the criteria provided in the current version of WSDOT Roadside Policy Manual (RPM). Use guidance provided in the WSDOT Roadside Manual (RM), where appropriate, when implementing the provisions of the RPM. Provide coordination and engagement with WSDOT partners when designing roadsides. Also refer to the RM when addressing design issues such as law and policy, soil bioengineering, contour grading, vegetation, irrigation, etc. These manuals can be found at: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/roadside-development-facilities. On non-limited access highways in incorporated cities and towns having a population greater than 30,000 certain requirements of the WSDOT Roadside Policy Manual and Roadside Manuals apply. In these cases, the city or town has responsibility for and provides maintenance of those areas beyond the curb (including a median area if present), and if no curb is installed, beyond that portion of the highway used for highway purposes. Early communication and roadside plan reviews between WSDOT region landscape architects and the City is essential to document impacts to existing assets like established trees and to determine tree replacement based on impacts per Chapter 2 of the Roadside Policy Manual. Early WSDOT review of restoration plans enable local agencies to design and maintain roadsides consistent with surrounding corridor aesthetics and context. For areas located behind the curb or beyond that portion used for highway purposes, the City shall provide a signed maintenance agreement and/or public art plan (See Section 950.06) showing the exact design and the planned maintenance items and timing of work per Chapter 5 and 6 of the Roadside Policy Manual, that the City is responsible for.
900.02 Project Development 900.02(1) Region Landscape Architect The region Landscape Architect is responsible for the following:
•
•
•
Designs, supervises, has approval authority over, and stamps plans for wetland mitigation, roadside restoration, and revegetation. Coordinates the visual elements within highway corridors, in conjunction with the State Bridge and Structures Architect. Designs and supervises other roadside work, such as site design for park & ride lots or safety rest areas, to ensure roadside restoration is designed and constructed to WSDOT guidelines and standards.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 900-1
Chapter 900
•
•
Roadsides
Provides visual discipline reports for environmental documentation. Assists the region in completing the plant establishment phase of projects.
The Headquarters (HQ) Roadside and Site Development Section will provide roadside and mitigation design, visual impact assessment, and construction inspection work for the project offices in regions without a Landscape Architect. Refer to the Project Management Guide for further descriptions of the roles and responsibilities of project teams.
900.02(2) Roadside Restoration Projects There are typically two types of roadside restoration projects pertaining to vegetation-related roadway construction projects: regulatory and restoration.
900.02(2)(a) Regulatory The first type of project is work related to regulatory or permit requirements. Examples are wetland mitigation work or Hydraulic Permit Approvals (HPAs). This work typically must occur by the time the impacting project is complete.
900.02(2)(b) Restoration The second type of project is the restoration of construction impacts to roadside functions to meet the WSDOT policy requirements outlined in the Roadside Policy Manual.
900.02(3) Stand-Alone Project or Part of Roadway Construction? Roadside restoration work should be evaluated by the design team to determine whether it will be most efficient as part of the roadway construction contract or as a separate stage contract.
900.02(3)(a) Roadway Construction Contract The benefits of roadside restoration during roadway construction include the following:
•
•
•
All work can be done under one contract. The restoration can be completed without waiting for a new contract to be let and administered. Plant establishment can often begin sooner.
900.02(3)(b) Separate Stage Project A separate stage contract provides the following opportunities because it would be done when road construction is completed:
•
•
•
If construction impacts are different than originally anticipated, the restoration contract can be changed. For example, if disturbance is minimized, fewer plants and soil amendments may be needed. The site can be watched to see how the grading and hydrology interact before plants are planted. The prime contractor can be someone who specializes in roadside work.
900.02(4) Plant Establishment Plant establishment periods are included as part of roadside restoration and on all environmental mitigation projects.
•
A minimum of three years of plant establishment work is required for all planted areas in western Washington and planted and/or seeded areas in eastern Washington.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 900-2
Chapter 900

•
•
Roadsides
In situations where it is important to provide a full cover of vegetation to achieve the environmental or operational functions, five years of plant establishment may be needed. If the plant establishment period will last longer than three years on a roadside restoration contract, discussion should occur with Program Management to request and justify additional funding. In an environment that uses woody plants, plant establishment may take up to 10 years for the woody vegetation to exclude weeds and reach a condition with the lowest life cycle cost. Regulatory aspects of projects can require 10 years of plant establishment to ensure the standards of success outlined in the permit, although aggressive weed control and favorable weather can allow sites to close out early.
The goal is to give WSDOT Maintenance a site that is nearly self-sustaining after the plant establishment period is complete.

950.01 General Public art is an enhancement to a functional element, feature, or place within a transportation corridor to provide visual interest. The enhancement could be an addition to a functional element, integrated into a design, implemented as a form of community-identified mitigation or for purely aesthetic purposes. An element is considered “public art” if it is beyond WSDOT standard practice for architectural treatment. There has been a growing interest on the part of communities to use art within the transportation facilities of the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT). While public art can be a form of communityidentified mitigation for a project’s impacts, it can also be implemented as a standalone element. Public art can be used to provide visual interest along roadsides, make unique statements about community character, and create a positive public response that will last over time. Proponents for public art might be local agencies, engaged citizens’ groups, and representatives of impacted overburdened and vulnerable populations with interest in the outcome of a WSDOT project. The environmental and Community Engagement processes offer opportunities for community partnership on the visual and aesthetic qualities of a corridor. These processes also provide an opportunity to identify the need and form of potential community-identified mitigation measures (as required by federal and state law) that can address a project’s potential negative impacts to local communities, including environmental justice communities. Any potential community-identified mitigation must be reasonable, relative to the project’s impact and negotiated in good faith with the affected community. The public art policy in this chapter is intended to: provide guidance for managing public art on WSDOT facilities and within its rights of way; reinforce the existing policy in the Roadside Policy Manual; designate appropriate locations for the incorporation of public art features; and provide for the consistent use of statewide development, review, and approval processes on new and existing features. The community-identified mitigation elements within this chapter are intended to provide broader understanding of obligations under Federal and State law to mitigate for project impacts to communities and possible forms of mitigation for these impacts. The appropriateness of public art is frequently dependent upon its location and composition. For example, an art piece or feature chosen for the back side of a noise wall, at a safety rest area, or along a bike path may not be suitable at the end of a freeway ramp or along the main line of a highway. In addition to appropriate placement, WSDOT must balance the requests for proposed public art projects with the need to provide corridor continuity, improve the unity of highway elements, and provide roadsides that do not divert motorists’ attention from driving. While some local jurisdictions dedicate a percentage of their project budgets for art, WSDOT has no such dedicated funding.

Public Art
Section 40 of the State Constitution specifies that gas tax money must be used for a “highway purpose.” Therefore, public art beyond WSDOT standard design is typically funded by communities or other entities outside of WSDOT. However, public art as community-identified mitigation or other forms of communitymitigation outlined below, associated with project impacts are identified through NEPA/SEPA processes and may be funded by WSDOT. When city or community entrance markers are proposed, this policy should be used in conjunction with the guidance contained in Chapter 1600, Roadside Safety, the Traffic Manual, and the Roadside Policy Manual.

Limited to existing structures. No new overhead structures will be added to allow city entrance markers. Cannot be placed on structures with existing traffic control devices such as signals, guide signs, warning signs, regulatory signs, or variable message signs. The requesting agency enters into an airspace lease for use of WSDOT right-of-way. The airspace lease must include the removal of the item after its useful life and indicate the requesting agency is responsible for all cost for plan review, design, construction, maintenance, repair (including vandalism or damage), and damage to WSDOT property as the result of construction, maintenance, or repair. The proposed design meets Bridge & Structure Office design criteria on loading and clearance and is consistent with current WSDOT structural design details. The Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for review and approved of the design prior to installation. Display the name of a city only. Must be near or inside city limits. No phone numbers or web links can be displayed on the entrance marker. The entrance marker cannot be made of a material that has a short lifespan (such as a fabric or canvas banner) or requires routine maintenance. Maintenance of lighting is allowed during the lifespan. Should be centered on the direction of travel side of the structure. Distance from other existing traffic control signs both upstream and downstream must be at least 500 feet. Sight distance is not restricted. WSDOT will inspect the entrance marker as part of the bridge inspection program. The requesting agency is also responsible for all cost associated with addressing items found during the inspection. Once the need for maintenance is determined, the items must be addressed within 90 days of notification. Otherwise, the entrance marker will be repaired or removed by the WSDOT at the cost of the requesting agency. Must be relocated or removed by WSDOT at the cost of the requesting agency if the WSDOT structure is removed, rebuilt, needed for traffic control signing, or relocated, as directed by WSDOT. Requesting agency is also responsible for damages to the structure due to placement or maintenance of the city marker. No additional items may be attached to or hung from the display after approval. Any such items must be removed by the requesting agency. Does not obstruct pedestrian or cyclist’s clearance, visibility, and/or stopping sight distance. The city entrance marker has no moving parts, lights, design, or materials that may create glare or distraction. Decorative accents may be allowed but cannot be distracting to drivers per Section 950.04(2). Muted, non-MUTCD sign related colors may be used. Approval of the entrance marker is granted through the Public Art Plan process.

950.05 Community-Identified Mitigation Community-identified mitigation measures that address direct transportation impacts (as required by Federal and State laws) are commitments developed through the NEPA/SEPA process. These types of mitigation measures are different from proposals that go through the public art process. Community-identified mitigation measures are developed through extensive community engagement where the Department determines reasonable project related mitigation through good faith negotiations with the affected community. These reasonable mitigation measures5 must be appropriate relative to the project’s level of impact on the affected community. Refer to the Environmental Manual Chapters 458, 459 and 460 for policy direction that support mitigating project impacts to the human environment (community) and natural environment through the NEPA/SEPA process.
950.06 Process and Project Delivery Timing Begin the development and review of public art or community-identified mitigation early in the design process and conduct subsequent reviews during the course of its development. Do not include public art as a change order or addendum to a project without first having gone through the process described in this policy. A public art plan is developed to incorporate public art into projects on state highways. Include the review of the public art plan by the Public Art Specialty Services Team in project reviews (See 950.06(2)).

1010.01 General Addressing work zone impacts to all road users is an important component in the design of a project and needs to be given adequate consideration early in the design process. Most work zones create some level of traffic impacts and require additional safety features; therefore, identify and address all work areas and operations needed for construction during the project design. Planners, designers, construction engineers, maintenance personnel, and others all play a role in developing a comprehensive work zone design. There is no “cookbook” solution to work zone design. Work zone design is based on general guidance and best practices; however, effective work zone design requires innovation, adaptation, and ingenuity and is as much art as science. This chapter provides the designer with guidance to develop comprehensive work zone strategies and plans to address a project’s safety and mobility benefits/improvements for all modes, as well as constructability. A systematic process for addressing work zone impacts is required by federal regulations and state policy.
1010.02 Work Zone Design Strategy Meeting & Statement (New Section 2023) In the Scoping phase, a Work Zone Design Strategy Meeting shall be held with Region Transportation Operations (“Region Traffic”) and other critical attendees including, but not limited to: Bridge, Construction, Maintenance, Rail, Freight and Ports, Public Transportation, Active Transportation, Local Agencies, and Law Enforcement as appropriate. Participation in the conference will help develop work zone mitigation strategies that address the needs of the various divisions and road users while establishing an understanding for the project’s initial work zone direction. A Work Zone Strategy Statement shall be developed by Project Development and submitted to Region Transportation Operations Office for acceptance early in design (30% to 60%). The accepted Work Zone Strategy Statement shall be included in the Project Development’s Project Summary. It is meant to be a high-level, concise overview of the projects proposed overall work zone mitigation and shall include the following information as a minimum:
•
•
•
•
Whether the project is classified as significant or non-significant Anticipated work zone traffic control strategies, closures, and staging configurations Concurrence from Region Transportation Operations on any anticipated proposed regulatory speed limit reduction and/or advisory speeds An explanation/justification for any proposed high-impact closures or restrictions.

1010.03 Transportation Management Plans and Significant Projects 1010.03(1) Transportation Management Plan (TMP) A transportation management plan is a set of strategies such as Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) strategies (such as dynamic lane merge, dynamic speed control, or Smart Work Zone Systems) for managing the corridor-wide work zone impacts of a project. A TMP is required for all projects and is the key element in addressing known work zone safety and mobility impacts. The TMP development begins in the scoping phase of a project by assessing impacts known at the time and then selecting mitigating strategies and design solutions to manage those impacts. It is very important to continue the development of the TMP throughout the project development process. Not all work zone impacts have to be addressed with traffic control plans only. Many work zone impacts can be reduced or eliminated through project design elements like alignment choice, materials selection, structure types, overbuilding, and phased construction. Work zone impacts related to work duration may be resolved or reduced through innovative bidding and contract administration. For design-bid-build projects, the TMP is developed by Design and reviewed/approved by Region Transportation Operations Office. For design-build projects, WSDOT may begin a preliminary TMP during Scoping and Project Development, but the TMP is completed by the Design-Builder and approved per the requirements of the RFP. A TMP may include temporary modification to design elements outside the ranges discussed in the Design Manual. For example, a work zone may temporarily reduce lane and shoulder widths. These temporary design elements are justified and documented in the TMP. They do not require a Design Analysis. The three major components of a TMP are described in Section 1010.04(4).
1010.03(1)(a) Temporary Traffic Control Temporary Traffic Control (TTC) components are those strategies for directing traffic through the work zone and minimizing the duration of the impacts. These components are to be included in the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) as Traffic Control Plans (TCPs) and contract provisions. The TTC components may include but are not limited to the following strategies:
•
•
•
TTC strategies such as lane closures or shifts, one-lane two-way operations (flagging and or pilot car), staged construction, or full road closures and detours. Traffic Control Devices such as temporary signing, channelizing devices (cones, drums), changeable message signs, arrow boards, temporary signals, and temporary pavement markings. Corridor Project Coordination, Contracting Strategies, and Innovative Construction Strategies such as A+B bidding, incentives/disincentives, and precast members or rapid cure materials.
1010.03(1)(b) Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) The TSMO components are those strategies for improving traffic flow and safety through the work zone. Some of these strategies may be included in the PS&E but could also be WSDOT-managed elements outside the contract. The TSMO components may include but are not limited to the following strategies:
•
•
Transportation demand management strategies such as Transit service improvements, transit incentives, and park & ride promotion. Corridor/Network Management (traffic operations) Strategies such as Signal timing/coordination improvements, temporary signals, bus pullouts, reversible lanes, and truck/heavy-vehicle restrictions.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
Work Zone Safety Management Strategies such as using positive protective devices, speed limit reductions, automated flagger assistance devices, radar speed display signs. Traffic/Incident Management and Enforcement Strategies such as Traffic Management Centers (TMCs) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Washington State Patrol, tow service, WSDOT Incident Response Team vehicle(s), traffic screens, and emergency pullouts in long work zones with narrowed shoulders. Smart Work Zone Systems and simpler version, Queue Warning Systems are dedicated specialized smart systems to provide more rapid information to drivers and to optimize the safety and efficiency of traffic through the work zone. For more information on TSMO, see Home | TSMO | WSDOT (tsmowa.org)
1010.03(1)(c) Public Information The Public Information (PI) components are those strategies for raising awareness of the upcoming project impacts or current restrictions. Public awareness strategies may be developed and implemented by WSDOT through the region or Headquarters (HQ) Communications offices and implemented before and during construction. Motorist information strategies may be WSDOT-managed elements with state equipment outside the contract or identified on plans in the PS&E. The PI components may include, but are not limited to, the following strategies:
•
•
Public Awareness Strategies such as Brochures or mailers, press releases, paid advertisements, and project website (consider providing information in other languages if appropriate). Motorist Information Strategies such as Highway advisory radio (HAR), changeable message signs, and transportation management center (TMC).
It is very important to continue the development of the TMP throughout the project development process. Not all work zone impacts have to be addressed with traffic control plans only. Many work zone impacts can be reduced or eliminated through project design elements like alignment choice, materials selection, structure types, overbuilding, and phased construction. Work zone impacts related to work duration may be resolved or reduced through innovative bidding and contract administration. The TMP Checklist in Exhibit 1010-2 will help identify and organize TMP components. Include the completed checklist in the Project File. For significant projects, develop this checklist and the supporting plans, data, impacts assessment, strategies, capacity/delay analysis and endorsements into a formal TMP document to be included in the Project File. For TMP examples, see: http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/wz/resources/final_rule/tmp_examples/sample_tmps.htm http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/wz/resources/publications/trans_mgmt_plans/trans_mgmt_plans.pdf

1010.03(2) TMP Requirements for Significant & Non-Significant Projects Transportation Management Plan components for design-bid-build and design-build projects are as follows: Non-Significant Projects Temporary Traffic Control Plans Contract Special Provisions Request for Proposal Section 2.22 TMP Document Not Required + Temporary Modification to Design Element Explanations
Significant Projects Temporary Traffic Control Plans Contract Special Provisions Request for Proposal Section 2.22 TMP Document Required 1. Temporary Traffic Control (TTC) Strategies 2. Transportation Systems Management & Operation (TSMO) Strategies 3. Public Information (PI) Strategies + Agreements with Other Agencies & Stakeholders + Temporary Modification to Design Element Explanations + TMP Roles & Responsibilities, Contact Information
Significant projects, as defined in 23 CFR Part 630 J, are defined as: 1. A project that, alone or in combination with other concurrent projects nearby, is anticipated to cause sustained work zone impacts that are greater than what is considered tolerable based on state policy and/or engineering judgement. 2. All Interstate system projects within the boundaries of a designated Transportation Management Area that occupy a location for more than three days with either intermittent or continuous lane closures shall be considered as significant projects unless FHWA grants an exception request based on the State’s ability to show the project does not cause sustained work zone impacts. For Significant Projects: A TMP Document is required per federal law (23 CFR Part 630 J) in addition to the temporary traffic control plan and contract provisions. The TMP Document’s size and scale depends on the project’s complexity and extent of adverse road user impacts but should be expanded to include agreements with other agencies/stakeholders, WSDOT commitments, and project contact information as appropriate. The TMP Checklist in Exhibit 1010-2 will help identify and organize TMP components. In addition, Significant Projects may require a Value Engineering (VE) study (see Chapter 310) and a Cost Risk Assessment (CRA) or Cost Estimate Validation Process (CEVP) that could help define strategies or identify risks: Cost risk assessment | WSDOT (wa.gov) For additional TMP Document information, see:

Hold a Work Zone Design Strategy Meeting during Scoping. Afterwards, create the Work Zone Design Strategy Statement and submit to Region Transportation Operations Office for acceptance. Integrate work zone impacts strategies during Scoping and early in Project Development to develop an accurate scoping estimate and integrate project constructability, work efficiency, and cost efficiency. Designers need to possess a good understanding of project constructability (work methods, needed work area, and reasonable work durations to complete the work). Contact the Construction Project Engineering Offices when making decisions on assessing and addressing constructability impacts. Designers need to possess a strong understanding of work zone traffic control strategies. Contact Region Transportation Operations Office to discuss WZTC strategies and obtain preliminary closure hours used to develop traffic control plans, determine project duration, and estimate project costs. Designers need to circle back with Construction to assess the project’s constructability with the WZTC strategies and preliminary closure hours. This may be an iterative process involving both Construction, Region Transportation Operations Office, and others as appropriate to arrive to the final WZTC strategies and project’s permitted closures and closure hours. Identify work zone safety and mobility impacts accounting for all needed work areas, operations, and possible staging areas. Implement appropriate safety strategies based on Work Zone Safety Management in Traffic Manual Chapter 5. Address traffic impacts extending beyond the project limits and impacting other roads and consider seasonal/special event/business impacts. Region Transportation Operations Office can help determine an impact assessment via work zone traffic analysis and develop mitigation strategies. Continue developing the Transportation Management Plan throughout Design, refer to the TMP Checklist in Exhibit 1010-2 to help identify and organize TMP components. Take work zone training to better understand requirements, standard practices, and expectations including the legally adopted Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) with Washington State modifications per WAC 468-95 as the minimum standard to develop adequate traffic control plans Approach work zone design from the road user’s perspective. Except when required, consider positive protection devices when practical. Use established design criteria in work zone roadway and roadside design. A TMP will justify temporary design elements; a Design Analysis is not required. Address work vehicle ingress and egress to each work area. Consider impacts to freight based on Commercial Vehicle Considerations in Traffic Manual Chapter 5 Accommodate pedestrian access (including ADA requirements) and bicycle access through or around the work zone. Consider the maintenance of existing transit stops. Consider school, hospital, emergency services, and postal delivery impacts. Consider maintenance issues and needs through the duration of the project. Consider law enforcement assistance and enforcement.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.04(2) Impacts Assessment One of the most important tasks in developing a TMP is assessing the mobility impacts and safety performance. Careful consideration is needed when assessing the scope of the TMP. A designer needs to possess a clear understanding of how project features will be constructed, including work methods, equipment, materials, and duration, to complete the work. Involve the construction PE when making decisions on assessing and addressing impacts. A complete and accurate impacts assessment will allow for the development of an effective TMP that should only need minor modifications to address construction considerations. The Traffic Manual provides information on how to determine expected work zone congestion along with mobility management strategies. An early and ongoing impacts assessment allows time to:
•
•
•
Develop Temporary Traffic Control (see Section 1010.04(5)), Transportation Systems Management Operations (see Section 1010.04(6)), and Public Information (see Section 1010.04(7)) Resolve potential work zone impacts within the design features of the project. Decisions that consider work zone impacts during bridge type selection, materials selection, advertisement dates, and others have the potential to resolve or minimize work zone impacts. Consider innovative mitigation strategies that may involve many stakeholders.
Some impacts may be difficult to completely solve and may ultimately need a management decision to determine the level of mitigation or impact that is acceptable. These types of impacts need to be clearly addressed in the TMP with documentation supporting and explaining the decision. The following are some examples of impacts that need to be managed during the design of a project: 1. Bridge construction sequence or falsework opening plans need to match the TTC staging or channelization plans. Coordination with the HQ Bridge and Structures Office is essential as the bridge design schedule may differ than the project schedule. Maintain the legal height of 16 feet 6 inches as the minimum falsework opening whenever possible; if this height cannot be maintained, then consider overheight vehicle impacts, possible additional signing needs, and temporary bypass routes. Reduction in shoulder widths due to barrier or bridge staging may affect active transportation access and mobility and are to be addressed in TTC plans. Refer to Chapter 720 for additional requirements and approvals. Coordination with the Permits Office may be needed. 2. If existing signal and illumination systems are not able to be maintained during the construction phases, plans for temporary systems or connections need to be included in the project. 3. Temporary relocation of existing signing (including overhead signing) may be required and shall be detailed in the plans. 4. Permanent traffic loop installation (such as advance loops, turn pockets, and stop bars, and ITS loops) and pavement marking installations (crosswalks, arrows, and so on) may require specific TTC plans. 5. Maintenance of pavement markings. The type of temporary markings to be used based on work duration, pavement surface and reducing the potential for a “ghost stripe” on the final pavement surface need to be considered. 6. Lane shifts onto existing shoulders: o The depth of the existing shoulder pavement must be adequate to carry traffic and rumble stripes need to be removed for long-term temporary roadway configurations. For short/intermediate-term durations, a single open lane can be shifted onto the paved
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
shoulder with a variable regulatory speed limit reduction on freeways per Traffic Manual Chapter 5 Speed Limit Reductions in Work Zones. o Any existing catch basins or junction boxes located in the shoulder need to be addressed. o The existing clear zone needs to be reevaluated with when the edge of traveled way is temporarily shifted. o Shifting of more than one lane in a direction is only allowed with temporary pavement markings. Shifting lanes by using channelizing devices is not allowed due to the high probability that devices used to separate the traffic will be displaced. o Signal head alignment may need to be adjusted when lanes are shifted approaching an intersection. 7. Roundabout construction at an existing intersection requires site-specific staging plans to address the unique site-specific design features. 8. Evaluate impacts to the existing drainage system as discussed in Chapter 5 of the Hydraulics Manual, particularly for narrowed shoulders, superelevation and/or widening transitions.
1010.04(3) Work Duration The duration of work is a major factor in determining a strategy and the amount and types of devices to use for work zone traffic control. A project may have work operations with durations that meet several or all of the following conditions:
1010.04(3)(a) Long-Term Stationary Work Zone This is work that occupies a location continuously for more than three days. Construction signs should be postmounted and larger; more stable channelizing devices should be used for increased visibility. Temporary barriers, pavement markings, illumination, and other considerations may be required for long-term stationary work. Staged construction or temporary alignment/channelization plans are required with this type of work.
1010.04(3)(b) Intermediate-Term Stationary Work Zone This is work that occupies a location for up to three days. Construction signs may still be post-mounted if in place continuously but are typically tripod or barrier mounted. Conflicting overhead guide signs do not need to be modified. In addition to channelization devices, temporary pavement markings lane lines may be required where multiple lanes are laterally shifted in the same travel direction. Temporary barrier and temporary illumination would normally not be used in this work zone duration.
1010.04(3)(c) Short-Term Stationary Work Zone This is work that occupies a location for more than one hour within a single day. At these locations, all devices are placed and removed during the single period.
1010.04(3)(d) Short-Duration Work Zone This is work that occupies a location for up to one hour. Because the work time is short, simplified traffic control set-ups are allowed, to reduce worker exposure to traffic as the time it may take to set up a full complement of signs and devices could exceed the amount of time required to perform the work. Short-duration work zones usually apply to maintenance or some utility work and are not used on construction projects. (See Work Zone Traffic Control Guidelines for Maintenance Operations, M54-44 for more information.)

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.04(3)(e) Mobile Work Zone This is work that moves intermittently or continuously where workers are inside vehicles, except for a few minutes infrequently. Mobile operations include activities such as sweeping, paint striping, and raised pavement marker installation. Truck-mounted attenuators with truck-mounted Portable Changeable Message Signs or warning signs provide advance warning and shadow and protect the work vehicles with flashing lights as they move along at low speeds with infrequent stopping. Channelization devices are typically not used. Mobile closures are not appropriate for work operations such as pavement milling and paving activities where workers are on foot for significant durations. Instead, stationary work zone traffic control closures are required.
1010.04(4) Transportation Management Plan Strategies With a completed impacts assessment, strategy development can begin. There are often several strategies to address a work zone impact, and engineering judgment will be needed in selecting the best option. Constructability, along with addressing safety and mobility, is the goal. Selecting a strategy is often a compromise and involves many engineering and non-engineering factors. Work closely with bridge, construction, maintenance, and transportation operations office personnel when selecting and developing strategies for the Transportation Management Plan (TMP) and PS&E. Do not assume that strategies chosen for past projects will adequately address the impacts for similar current projects. There may be similarities with the type of work, but each project is unique and is to be approached in that manner. Always look for other options or innovative approaches; many projects have unique features that can be turned to an advantage if carefully considered. Even a basic paving project on a rural two-lane highway may have opportunities for detours, shifting traffic, or other strategies. The Traffic Manual Chapter 5 Work Zone Traffic Analysis contains comprehensive information regarding work zone traffic analysis to determine expected delay and queuing.
1010.04(5) Temporary Traffic Control Strategies (Section Rewritten 2023) 1010.04(5)(a) Work Near Traveled Way (Section Rewritten 2023) If all work and work vehicles remain outside of the work zone clear zone, or behind barrier or guardrail when within the work zone clear zone, then no advanced warning signage is required. If workers enter the work zone clear zone not protected by barrier and guardrail, add appropriate warning signs. See Section 1010.06(3).
1010.04(5)(b) Shoulder Closure (Section Rewritten 2023) For active work operations when workers or work vehicles are on the paved shoulder or within the work zone clear zone not protected by barrier and guardrail, a shoulder closure should be used. Shoulder closures are not required for TTC device installation and removal activities. On roadways 40 mph or less, channelization devices may encroach into the adjacent open lane if a 10-foot minimum lane width is maintained. On roadways 45 mph and higher, channelization devices shall not encroach the adjacent open lane (instead close the adjacent open lane). Do not use sequential arrow sign at shoulder closures. Avoid using PCMSs only for shoulder closures. See Section 1010.06(3).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1010-8
Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.04(5)(c) Lane Shift (Section Rewritten 2023) On undivided roadways with three or more lanes, a single open lane can be shifted laterally into the closed twoway left turn lane (which maintains the thru lane in both direction) or into a closed oncoming travel lane. Do not use a sequential arrow sign at the lane shifts. PCMSs are optional.
1010.04(5)(d) Alternating One-Lane Two-Way Traffic (Section Rewritten 2023) This strategy alternates all directions of traffic in a single open lane under the control of flagger, Automated Flagger Assistance Devices (AFADs), or temporary traffic signals where shown in traffic control plans. It is recommended to use AFADs on roadways 55 mph or higher, except near signalized intersections. Use temporary traffic signals for long-duration closures to alternate traffic during nonworking hours, but flaggers can control traffic during working hours (turn off the temporary signals and adjust signing as appropriate). Temporary rumble strips may be added in advance to increase driver alertness. These stations shall be illuminated at night with either temporary illumination or existing illumination, except in emergencies. Pilot cars should be used to guide motorists between flaggers or AFADs for lane closures exceeding 1000 feet or having multiple intersecting roadways, driveways, or business accesses. Refer to WAC 296-155-305 for flagging requirements. At least four advanced warning signs required on roadways 45 mph and higher and at least three advanced warning signs on roadways 40 mph or less. Flaggers are not to be used on freeways or expressways. Using flaggers solely to instruct motorists to proceed slowly is an unacceptable practice. When flaggers are used at an intersection, a flagger is required for each leg of the intersection. Close lanes and turn pockets so only one lane of traffic approaches a flagger station on multilane roadways. When a signal is present, it shall be turned off or set to red flash mode when flagging. An additional flagger may be added at the center of an intersection provided each intersection leg is controlled by a flagger. Only uniform police officers (UPOs) may flag from the center of an intersection without each intersection leg being controlled by a flagger. It is optional to close lanes and turn pockets approaching UPO-controlled intersections; however, two UPOs should be used on multilane roadways (2 or more thru lanes approaching the intersection in any direction). When a signal is present, it shall be turned off or set to red flash mode when UPOs are flagging. See Traffic Manual Chapter 5 for more information on the use of law enforcement personnel at work zones.
1010.04(5)(e) Lane Closure on Multilane Roadways (Section Rewritten 2023) On multilane roadways with two or more travel lanes in a direction, closing lanes and adjacent shoulders is a common strategy. Additional lanes shall be closed if encroachment is necessary. A separate sequential arrow sign shall be used at each lane closure taper. On multilane roadways 45 mph and above, a 2-foot lateral buffer is provided between traffic and the work area. Consider closing additional lanes to increase the lateral buffer space for enhanced safety if practical. Except at closure and shift tapers, channelization devices shall not encroach on the open lanes except when a single open lane is shifted onto the paved shoulder. Additional lanes shall be closed if encroachment is necessary whenever two or more lanes are open.

Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.04(5)(f) Single Open Lane Shifted onto Shoulder on Multilane Roadways (Section Rewritten 2023) For multilane roadways requiring channelization devices to encroach into the only remaining open lane, that single open lane must be shifted over onto either the left or right paved shoulder. This shoulder shift configuration is necessitated by work operations including but not limited to:
•
•
Two-lane freeway or divided highway with the work area extending up to the lane line adjacent to traffic for work including HMA pavement, concrete pavement, and/or expansion joint rehabilitation. Three-lane freeway with the work area including both lanes and extending up to the lane line adjacent to traffic for work including HMA pavement, concrete pavement, and/or expansion joint rehabilitation.
Reduced speed limits are required for this strategy on freeways and divided multilane highways with existing speed limits 60 mph or higher. See Speed Limit Reductions in Work Zones in Traffic Manual Chapter 5. For travel widths less than 16 feet, see Commercial Vehicle Considerations in Traffic Manual Chapter 5.
1010.04(5)(g) Rolling Slowdown (Section Rewritten 2023) This strategy involves using a slow-moving blockade of traffic control vehicles and/or law enforcement vehicles to create a large traffic gap enabling the completion of work activities requiring exclusive access across or over a directional roadway, including freeways, that otherwise presents a significant risk to motorists and workers. Rolling slowdowns are not to be used for routine work that can be addressed by lane closures or other stationary traffic control strategies. Rolling slowdowns are intended for work operations needing up to 10 minutes of clear time. For longer durations, use directional freeway or roadway closure. See Rolling Slowdowns in Traffic Manual Chapter 5 for detailed information. A Rolling Slowdown typical traffic control plan is now available in the WSDOT Typical Traffic Control Plan Library; however, a site-specific traffic control plan is required for complex rolling slowdown scenarios.
1010.04(5)(h) Traffic Holds (Section Rewritten 2023) This strategy involves using flaggers and/or uniform police officers to stop traffic in all directions to enable completion of work activities requiring exclusive access across or over the roadway that otherwise presents significant risks to motorists and/or workers. On multilane highways, reduce each direction of traffic down to a single open lane. Traffic holds are not to be used on freeways. See Traffic Holds in Traffic Manual Chapter 5. These traffic holds may be implemented with shoulder or lane closures, including alternating one-lane two-way traffic control. Traffic hold durations typically range from a few minutes up to 15 minutes. For unique situations needing longer traffic holds, contact Region Transportation Operations Office. Traffic holds are used for work operations including but not limited to:
•
•
•
Rock scaling and/or tree clearing operations Bridge painting/rehabilitation projects to install containment/falsework across roadway Heavy truck ingress/egress
Equipment crossing across roadway
1010.04(5)(i) Temporary Alignment and Channelization Temporary alignments and/or channelization may be an option for long-duration work zones or staged traffic control. The following are guiding principles for the design of temporary alignment and channelization plans:
•
Use site-specific base data to develop site-specific staged traffic plans.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
For all temporary design elements, use Design Manual guidance for permanent features to the extent practical and feasible. When use of permanent guidance is not feasible, justify any variance in the TMP. Provide beginning and ending station ties and curve data. Include lane and shoulder widths. Provide temporary roadway sections, including lateral clearance and temporary barrier deflection distances. To avoid confusion, do not show unnecessary details on the plan. Do not use straight line tapers through curves; use circular alignment. Consider existing crown points, lane/shoulder cross slope breaks, and super-elevation transitions that may affect a driver’s ability to maintain control of a vehicle. If the project has multiple stages, from one stage to the next, show features constructed in previous stages as existing elements. Consider the time needed for removal of existing markings and placement of the new markings and possibly placement of barriers and attenuators. In urban areas where work hours for lane closures are limited, special consideration may be necessary to allow time to implement the plan, or an interim stage may be necessary. Use shoulder closure signing and channelizing devices to close a shoulder prior to a temporary impact attenuator/sloped terminal and run of temporary barrier. Existing signing may need to be covered or revised, and additional construction warning signs may be needed for the new alignment. Temporary pavement marking type (short-duration or long-duration) and colors shall be specified. For better guidance through shifting or taper areas, consider solid lane lines. Return to broken lane lines between shift areas. Provide a list of the approved temporary impact attenuators that may be used for the plan, if applicable. The plans are to provide all the layout information for all the temporary features just as a permanent pavement marking plan would.
i Staged Construction Staged construction requires combining multiple work operations into a logical order to provide large, protected work areas and separate traffic spaces for long durations, which maximizes work operations and minimizes daily impacts to traffic. Design temporary alignment and channelization plans to place traffic in these semi-permanent locations. Permanent geometric design criteria are to be used when developing these plans to the extent practical and feasible; otherwise, the TMP will justify temporary design elements and a Design Analysis is not required. Design strategies such as overbuilding for future stages, or the use of temporary structures are often part of staged construction on significant impact projects. Request Region Transportation Operations to perform detailed work zone traffic analysis for each stage.
ii Lane Shift/Reduced Lane Width Traffic lanes may be shifted and/or width reduced in order to accommodate a long-duration work area when it is not practicable, for capacity reasons, to reduce the number of available lanes. Shifting lanes of traffic requires the removal of existing conflicting pavement markings and the installation of temporary markings. Use advanced warning signs and solid lane lines through L/2 lane shifts but consider more gradual shifting tapers for shifting multiple lanes on a freeway.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1010-11
Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
Utilizing the existing shoulder may be necessary to accommodate the shifting movement. First, determine the structural capacity of the shoulder to ensure its ability to carry the proposed traffic. Remove and inlay existing shoulder rumble strips prior to routing traffic onto the shoulder for long durations.
iii Traffic Split or Island Work Zone This strategy separates lanes of traffic traveling in one direction around a work area. Some drivers have difficulty understanding the "“lane split"” configuration resulting in braking or unnecessary late lane changes. Braking and erratic lane changes decrease the traffic capacity through the work zone, which results in an unstable traffic flow approaching the lane split. This strategy should be avoided in urban areas due to frequency of ramps. Evaluate other strategies to keep traffic on one side of the work area to avoid a traffic split if possible, such as a median crossover that utilizing a moveable barrier system to transfer the temporary center lane back and forth to the direction of heaviest traffic volumes. Consider the following guidance for traffic split operations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
If used, limit the duration the traffic split can be in place. Consider incentives and disincentives to encourage the contractor to be as efficient as possible. A higher level of traffic impacts may be acceptable if offset with fewer impacted days. Advance warning signs advising drivers of the approaching roadway condition are required. Consider the use of Portable Changeable Message Signs (PCMS), portable Highway Advisory Radio (HAR), and other dynamic devices. Overhead signing and in-lane pavement markings also may be necessary to give additional driver notice of the traffic split. Consider how the traffic split will impact truck traffic. If the truck volumes are high, restricted truck lanes approaching and through the traffic split may be appropriate. For questions concerning truck operations, contact the HQ Freight Systems Division. To discourage lane changing, consider the use of solid lane line markings to delineate traffic approaching the split or island. Refer to the MUTCD for additional details. Consider the use of STAY IN LANE (black on white) signs or set up a "“no pass"” zone approaching the lane split and coordinate with the Washington State Patrol (WSP). Supplement the existing roadway lighting with additional temporary lighting to improve the visibility of the island work area (see Chapter 1040). Coordinate with the region Transportation Operations Office for signing and pavement marking details when designing island work zones.
Work area ingress and egress should be through and adjacent lane closure.
iv Temporary Bypass This strategy involves total closure of one or both directions of travel on the roadway. Traffic is routed to a temporary bypass usually constructed within the highway right of way. An example of this is the replacement of an existing bridge by building an adjacent temporary structure and shifting traffic onto the temporary structure. A temporary channelization plan will show pavement markings, temporary barrier with impact attenuators/sloped terminals, sign, and device placement.
v Median Crossover This strategy involves placing both directions of traffic on one side of a multilane divided highway. The number of lanes is usually reduced in both directions and one direction is routed across the median. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1010-12
Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
Existing even-lane configurations may be converted to temporary odd-lane configurations with a moveable barrier system to transfer the temporary center lane back and forth to the direction of heaviest traffic volumes. The design for elements of temporary crossovers needs to follow the same guidance as permanent design for alignment, barriers, delineation, and illumination. Permanent geometric design criteria are to be used when developing these plans to the extent practical and feasible; otherwise, the TMP will justify temporary design elements and a Design Analysis is not required.
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The goal is to design crossovers not less than 10 mph below the posted speed limit unless site conditions require a lower design speed. Warning signs with an advisory speed plaque, based on the median crossover design speed, shall be used at median crossovers. The continuous regulatory work zone speed limit is based on the geometric configuration of temporary roadway outside of isolated restrictive features, such as lane and shoulder widths. Median paving may be required to create crossover locations (consider drainage for the added pavement). When feasible, use temporary barrier on freeways to separate the two directions of traffic and evaluate the need for a glare screen. It is acceptable to separate two directions of traffic with a double yellow centerline or an 18-inch yellow barrier line. Pavement-mounted tubular markers may be added but consider the frequency of Oversize/Superload commercial vehicle freight and impacts to snow plowing operations. Provide temporary illumination at the crossover locations (see Chapter 1040) Straight line crossover tapers work best for highways with narrow paved medians. Temporary pavement markings, removal of conflicting existing markings, and construction signs are also required. Channelizing devices shall be used to supplement temporary markings at the crossover locations. Provide a design clear zone adjacent to the crossover and avoid placing crossover detours near structures. For traffic that is crossed over (going against the normal traffic flow direction) existing bridge rail ends, barriers, guardrails or other objects may require temporary barrier/impact attenuators for protection.
1010.04(5)(j) Total Closures and Detours Total closures may be for the project duration or for a critical work operation because of major constructability considerations or safety performance. The main requirement for total closures is the availability of a detour route and if the route can accommodate the increased traffic volumes and truck turning movements. Local roads may have lower geometric criteria than state facilities. Placing additional and new types of traffic on a local road may influence safety performance, especially when drivers are accustomed to the geometrics associated with state highways. Pavement integrity and rehabilitation may need to be addressed when traffic is detoured to specific local roadways. For the traveling public, closing the road for a short time might be less of an inconvenience than driving through a work zone for an extended period of time (see the Traffic Manual and RCW 47.48). Advance notification of the closure is required, and a signed detour route may be required. Consider the following road closure elements:

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
Communication with all stakeholders, including road users, adjoining property owners, local agencies, transit agencies, the freight industry, emergency services, schools, and others, is required when considering a total closure strategy. This helps determine the level of support for a closure and development of an acceptable closure. Include the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison, Rail, Freight, and Ports; Commercial Vehicle Services; and Public Transportation Divisions to help coordinate. Analyze a closure strategy and compare it to other strategies, such as staged work zones, to determine which is overall more beneficial. This information helps stakeholders understand the impacts if a closure is not selected. A closure decision (other than short-term, minor-impact closures) will require stakeholder acceptance and Regional management approval once impacts and benefits have been analyzed. Closures that reopen to a new, completed roadway or other noticeable improvements are generally more accepted by the public. Route-to-route connections and other strategic access points may have to be maintained or a reasonable alternative provided. Material selection, production rates, and work operation efficiencies have a direct tie to the feasibility of the closure strategy. A strong emphasis has been placed on this area and several successful strategies have been implemented, such as weekend-long closures or extended-duration single-shift closures. These strategies use specific materials such as quick-curing concrete, accelerated work schedules, prefabricated structure components, on-site mix plants, and so on, and are based on actual production rates. The WSDOT Materials Laboratory and the HQ Construction Office are good resources for more information on constructability as a component of an effective work zone strategy. Interstate or interstate ramp closures (including interstate closures with interchange ramps as detours) lasting more than 7 days require FHWA 60-day advance notice. See the Stewardship and Oversight Agreement for closure notification requirements. Short-duration closures of ramps or intersecting streets during off-peak hours do not require extensive approval if advance notice is provided and reasonable alternate routes are available. Detailed, project-specific traffic control plans, traffic operation plans, and public information plans are required. Depending on the duration of the closure/detour and the anticipated amount and type of traffic that will use the route, consider upgrades to the route such as signal timing, intersection turning radius for large vehicle, structural pavement enhancements, or shoulder widening. An approved detour agreement with the appropriate local agency is required for detour routes using local roadways and are to be completed prior to project advertisement. Document road closure decisions and agreements in the Project File.
Roadway closures, detours, and alternate routes must be analyzed by for disproportionate impacts to EJ and LEP communities. If an EJ or LEP community is identified along a proposed route and will be disproportionately impacted, appropriate mitigation must be coordinated between WSDOT Communications and the Contractor. When additional changes are made to the route, it should be evaluated to determine if the detour adds congestion, noise or creates safety issues for adjacent residences and businesses and/or adds considerably longer distance to access residences/businesses that may affect low income and minority population. WSDOT will work with local agencies and conduct public outreach as necessary, to ensure that the proposed route will not have a disproportionately high and adverse effect on EJ or LEP populations. A Communications Plan must include appropriate accommodations for identified populations and businesses.

•
•
Overbuild beyond normal project needs to maintain additional traffic or facilitate staged construction. Replace bridges using new alignments so they can be built with minimal impacts. Bring adjacent lifts of hot mix asphalt (HMA) to match the latest lifts (lag up) and require a tapered wedge joint to eliminate drop-off and abrupt lane edges. Require permanent pavement markings at intervals during multi-season projects to limit the duration temporary markings are needed and to support pavement marking visibility during winter shutdown.
1010.04(6) Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) Strategies The following are operational strategies to consider based on project specific needs:
1010.04(6)(a) Transportation Demand Management
•
•
•
•
•
Provide transit service improvements and possible incentives to help reduce demand. For long-term freeway projects, consider ramp metering. Provide a shuttle service for pedestrians and bicyclists. Provide local road improvements (signals modifications, widening, and so on) to improve capacity for use as alternate routes. Provide traffic screens to reduce driver distraction.
1010.04(6)(b) Corridor/Network Management
•
•
•
•
Provide a temporary express lane with no access through the project. Consider signal timing or coordination modifications. Provide emergency pullouts for disabled vehicles on projects with long stretches of narrow shoulders and no other access points. Use heavy-vehicle restrictions and provide alternate routes or lane use restrictions.
1010.04(6)(c) Work Zone Safety Management
•
•
•
•
•
•
Provide temporary access road approaches for work zone access. Use positive protective devices (barrier) for long-term work zones to improve the environment for workers and road users. Consider including temporary portable transverse rumbles strips and/or automated flagger assistance devices (AFADs) for flagging operation plans. Use temporary portable traffic control systems for long duration one-lane two-way traffic control. Refer to the Traffic Manual Chapter 5 for additional information, guidance, and approval requirements for speed limit reductions in work zones. Use advanced queue mitigation systems depending on the extent of expected work zone congestion on high-speed roadways. Refer to the Traffic Manual Chapter 5 for additional information and guidance for Smart Work Zone Systems, Queue Warning Systems, and other simpler PCMS versions.
1010.04(6)(d) Traffic/Incident Management and Enforcement
•
•
•
Provide law enforcement patrols to reduce speeding and aggressive drivers. Provide incident response patrols during construction to reduce delays due to crashes in the work zone. Provide a dedicated tow service to clear incidents.

Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.04(6)(e) Smart Work Zone System (SWZS)
•
•
•
Deploy roadway monitoring technology such as queue length detection, mobile surveillance, and overdimension vehicle detection. Deploy dynamic traffic control technology such as temporary ramp metering, variable speed control, and dynamic lane merge. Deploy driver information systems such as portable changeable message signs (PCMS), travel time and congestion information, and integration with third-party trip planning applications.
See Section 1010.09(5) for more information on SWZS and potential integration with TMCs and broader ITS operations.
1010.04(7) Public Information The Public Information (PI) strategies help raise awareness of the upcoming project impacts and/or current restrictions. Typical public awareness strategies planned during Design and performed during Construction typically include:
•
Advanced closure notification via R11-1501 signage or using portable changeable message signs
•
Schematics detailing maps of the closure along with detour/alternative route information
•
Oversize/overweight and vertical clearance restrictions via WSDOT Commercial Vehicle Services and construction warning signs. Coordinate freight travel information and restrictions with Rail, Freight, and Ports Division.
•
Coordinate transit travel information and restrictions with the Public Transportation Division
•
Pedestrian and bicycle access information and alternative routes via information signing and alternative route maps/brochures
Public awareness strategies are typically developed by WSDOT Region Communications offices and implemented before and during construction closures by utilizing different public outreach tools such as news coverage via press releases, WSDOT social media (Facebook, Twitter, YouTube), WSDOT Construction Projects webpage, and WSDOT Blog. Consider providing information in other languages when appropriate. Maintain effective public relations throughout both design and construction phases for projects with highimpact closures. Avoid surprising stakeholders and the public by informing them answers to “What is closed and when?”, “How do you get to where you need to go?”, and “What are the anticipated delays and times to avoid traveling through the work zone?” Be sure to explain the benefits of high-impact closures: Why is the inconvenience worth it and what work will be/was completed?
1010.04(7)(a) Public Awareness One PI strategy is a public awareness campaign using the media, project websites, public meetings, e-mail updates, and mailed brochures. This gives regular road users advance notice of impacts they can expect and time to plan for alternate routes or other options to avoid project impacts. Involve the region or HQ Communications Office in developing and implementing these strategies. Coordinate transit travel information and restrictions with the Public Transportation Division. wwwi.wsdot.wa.gov/PubTran/ Coordinate freight travel information and restrictions with the Rail, Freight, and Ports Division. https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/WSDOT::wsdot-freight-data-truck-freight-economic-corridors/about

Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.04(7)(b) Driver Information In addition to work zone signs, provide driver information using highway advisory radio (HAR) and changeable message signs (existing or portable). Include a Smart Work Zone System to provide drivers with real time information on queuing and delays. Involve the region TMC in the development and implementation of these strategies. Additional information on smart work zone systems can be found on the Work Zone Safety web page: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/traffic-work-zone-traffic-control-wztc The Freight Alert system should be used to communicate information with freight industry on work zones. Each region has the capability to send alerts with this system. https://geo.wa.gov/datasets/WSDOT::wsdot-freight-data-truck-freight-economic-corridors/about Work zone strategy development is a fluid process and may be ongoing as project information and design features are developed during the design process. There may be many factors involved with strategy development, and it is necessary to be well organized to make sure all the relative factors are identified and evaluated.
1010.04(7)(c) Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Include pedestrian and bicycle access information and alternate routes in the public awareness plans. Pedestrian and bicyclist information signing, including alternate route maps specifically for these road users, could be considered.
1010.05 Work Zone Traffic Analysis Work zone congestion and delay is a significant consideration for many highway projects. At high-volume locations with existing capacity problems, even shoulder closures will increase congestion. All work zone traffic restrictions need to be analyzed to determine the level of impacts and the appropriate queue mitigation system and public information outreach. See Chapter 5 in the Traffic Manual for additional information. Include a Work Zone & Traffic Analysis in the TMP. Work zone mobility impacts can have the following effects:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Crashes: Most work zone crashes are congestion-related, usually in the form of rear-end crashes due to traffic queues. Traffic queues extending beyond the advance warning signs may increase potential for crashes. Driver Frustration: Drivers expect to travel to their destinations in a timely manner. If delays are excessive, driver frustration can lead to aggressive or inappropriate driving actions. Constructability: Constructing a project efficiently relies on the ability to pursue work operations while maintaining traffic flow. Delays in material delivery, work hour restrictions, and constant installation and removal of traffic control devices all detract from constructability. Local Road Impacts: Projects that reduce capacity can sometimes cause traffic to divert to local roadways, which may impact the surrounding local roadway system and community. Public Credibility: Unanticipated work zone congestion and delay can create poor credibility for WSDOT with drivers and the surrounding community without sufficient public outreach in advance. Restricted Access: Severe congestion can effectively gridlock a road system, preventing access to important route connections, businesses, schools, hospitals, and so on. User Cost Impacts: Traffic delays have an economic impact on road users and the surrounding community. Calculated user costs are part of a work zone capacity analysis and may be used to determine liquidated damages specifications.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
While maintaining the optimum carrying capacity of an existing facility during construction may not be possible, but efforts should be made to maintain existing traffic mobility through and/or around the work zone. Maintaining mobility does not rule out innovative strategies such as roadway closures. Planned closures can accelerate work operations, reducing overall impacts to road users. These types of traffic control strategies are to include transportation demand management and public information plans to notify road users and mitigate and manage the impacts as much as possible. A work zone capacity analysis helps determine whether a work zone strategy is feasible. Mitigation measures that provide the right combination of good public information, advance signing and notification, alternate routes, detours, and work hour restrictions, as well as innovations such as strategic closures, accelerated construction schedules, or parallel roadway system capacity improvements, can be very effective in managing mobility impacts. Many projects will have several potential work zone strategies, while other projects may only have one obvious work zone strategy. It is possible that a significant mobility impact strategy may be the only option. There is no policy on the acceptable level of work-zone-created congestion and delay allowed on a project. In conjunction with the region traffic engineers, the designer uses engineering judgement along with knowledge of the projects traffic conditions, alternate routes, and more to determine an acceptable level of congestion and delays. This level of impact anticipated by the work zone strategy are to be in concurrence with region management. The traffi1010-19rafficc analysis process helps shape the TMP as the work zone strategies are evaluated and refined into traffic control plans and specifications. Maintain work zone traffic analysis documents in the Project File. Current volume data in the project vicinity is required for accurate work zone traffic analysis results. Seasonal adjustment factors may be needed depending on the data was collected and when the proposed traffic restrictions may be in place. Assess existing data as early as possible to determine whether additional data collection may be required. The region Transportation Operations Office and the HQ Transportation Data & GIS Office can assist with collecting traffic volume data. Coordination with local agencies may be needed to obtain data on affected local roads. Refer to Chapter 5 in the Traffic Manual for comprehensive work zone mobility management, work zone capacity information, and work zone queue and delay estimation calculations.

1010.06 Work Zone Design Part 6 of the MUTCD mostly addresses short-duration temporary traffic control standards. Some long-duration work zones may require temporary alignments and channelization, including barrier and attenuator use, temporary illumination and signals, and temporary pedestrian and bicycle routes. Use Design Manual guidance for permanent features to the extent practical and feasible with temporary modification to design elements may be modified as justified in the TMP; a Design Analysis is not required.

1010.06(1) Lane Widths While it is desirable to maintain existing lane widths during work zone operations whenever practical, often temporary lane width reductions are necessary. For projects that require lane shifts or lane width reductions due to work area limits and staging, consider the following before determining the work zone lane configurations to be implemented:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Overall roadway width available Posted speed limit Traffic volumes through the project limits Number of lanes Existing lane and shoulder widths Crown points and shoulder slope breaks Treat lane lines and construction joints to provide a smooth flow Length and duration of lane width reduction (if in place) Roadway geometry (cross slope, vertical and horizontal curves) Vertical clearances Transit and freight vehicles, including over-sized vehicles
Abrupt geometric transitions in the work zone shall be minimized or avoided if possible. When necessary, such transitions should be made as smoothly as the space available allows. Maintain approach lane width, if possible, throughout the connection. Design lane width reductions prior to any lane shifts within the transition area. Do not reduce curve radii and lane widths simultaneously. Work with Region Transportation Operations to determine appropriate lane widths. The objective is to use lane geometrics that will be clear to the driver and keep the vehicle in the intended lane. In order to maintain the minimum lane widths, temporary widening may be needed.
1010.06(2) Buffer Space Buffer spaces separate road users from the workspace or other areas off limits to travel. Buffer spaces also might provide some recovery space for an errant vehicle.
•
•
A lateral buffer provides space between the vehicles and adjacent workspace, traffic control device, or a condition such as an abrupt lane edge or drop-off. A 2-foot lateral buffer space is recommended on roadways 45 mph or higher. Consider positive protection devices for long-duration closures (2 weeks or more) when workers are substantially exposed to vehicular traffic on roadways 45 mph or higher. When temporary barriers are used, place a temporary edge line (typically 2-foot laterally from the barrier, but may be reduced). When feasible, a longitudinal buffer space is used immediately downstream of a closed or shifted traffic lane or shoulder. This space provides a recovery area for errant vehicles as they approach the workspace.
The body of any channelization devices used to separate the road user from the workspace shall not encroach into adjacent lanes except where a single open lane is laterally shifted onto the shoulder. If encroachment is necessary, the adjacent lane must be closed to maintain the lateral buffer space except for shoulder closures on roadways 40 mph or less.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1010-20
Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
To achieve the minimum lateral buffer, there may be instances where pavement widening or a revision to a stage may be necessary. In the case of short-term lane closure operations, the adjacent lane may need to be closed or traffic may need to be temporarily shifted onto a shoulder to maintain a lateral buffer space. During the design of the traffic control plan, the lateral buffer needs to be identified on the plan so that additional width is available; use temporary roadway cross sections to show the space in relation to the traffic and work area.
1010.06(3) Work Zone Clear Zone The contractor’s operations present opportunities for errant vehicles to impact the clear area adjacent to the traveled way. The work zone clear zone(s) (WZCZ) in a project are determined by the posted speeds of the roadways in the project using Exhibit 1010-1. The WZCZ applies only to roadside objects introduced by the contractor’s operations (vehicles, equipment, and materials). It is not intended to resolve existing objects in the Design Clear Zone or clear zone values established at the completion of the project. During nonworking hours, vehicles, equipment, or materials shall not be within the WZCZ unless they are protected by permanent guardrail or temporary barrier. The use of temporary concrete barrier shall be permitted only if the engineer approves the installation and location. During actual hours of work, unless protected as described above, only equipment and materials absolutely necessary to construction shall be within the WZCZ, and only construction vehicles absolutely necessary to construction shall be allowed within the WZCZ or allowed to stop or park on the shoulder of the roadway.

1010.06(4) Abrupt Lane Edges and Drop-offs Minimize, mitigate, or eliminate abrupt lane edges and drop-offs whenever practicable. When unavoidable, traffic control plans should provide a protection method. Consider temporary barriers for long duration drop off protection and contract provisions limiting the duration of edges from daily paving operations consistent with Standard Specification section 1-07.23(1). When a temporary barrier is used to protect a drop-off, provide a lateral offset from the drop-off to the back side of the barrier with an offset distance equal-to or greater than the distance listed in DM Exhibit 1610-3. Provide an edge line on the traffic side of the temporary barrier (typically 2-feet from the face of the barrier). Provide a barrier end treatment; such as an impact attenuator, or end terminal, when the barrier end is located inside the Design Clear Zone.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
Unless behind guardrail or barrier, open trenches are prohibited within the Traveled Way, Auxiliary Lanes, Shoulders, or other areas in the work zone clear zone. Backfilling and paving operations are required to reopen to vehicular traffic. Steel plates are allowed for open and closed Pathways, provided the walking surface is painted with either a non-slip paint, anti-slip tape, or rolled roofing surface and transverse edges are beveled at 2:1 with a maximum ¼” vertical lip. When backfilling is not possible, steel plates may be used. Detailed steel plate drawings and Special Provisions (including steel plate dimensions, maximum allowable span and overlap dimensions, and nonskid surface, anchorage/shoring, and material requirements) shall be included in the PS&E in collaboration with Bridge & Structures and Region Transportation Operations. Steel plate shall be anchored and either embedded flush with the existing road surface or a wedge of suitable material provided for a smooth transition between the pavement and the steel plate. Abrupt lane edges, and drop-offs and steel plates require additional warning and considerations for motorcyclists, bicyclists, and pedestrians, including pedestrians with disabilities. Signing to warn the motorcycle rider, bicyclists and pedestrians, including pedestrians with disabilities of these conditions is required. (See RCW 47.36.200 and WAC 468-95-305). See Design Manual Chapter 1510 for work zone pedestrian accommodation guidance. See Standard Specifications section 1-07.23(1) for the contract requirements for drop off protection and address project specific protection if necessary.
1010.06(5) Vertical Clearance In accordance with Chapter 720, the minimum vertical clearance over new highways is 16.5 feet. For locations where this minimum cannot be met, follow the reduced clearance criteria discussed in Chapter 720 and include it in the traffic control plans. Maintain legal height on temporary falsework for bridge construction projects. If legal height on temporary falsework cannot be provided, consider over-height vehicle impacts and possible additional signing needs and coordination with permit offices. Widening of existing structures can prove challenging when the existing height is at or less than legal height, so extra care is required in the consideration of over-height vehicles when temporary falsework is necessary. Coordination with the HQ Bridge and Structures Office is essential to ensure traffic needs have been accommodated. Vertical clearance requirements associated with local road networks may be different than what is shown in Chapter 720. Coordinate with the local agency.
1010.06(6) Speed Limit Reductions & Advisory Speeds in Work Zones (Section Rewritten 2023) All work zone speed limit reduction and/or advisory speed requests must be submitted through Region Transportation Operations for review. Designers shall collaborate with Region Transportation Operations and obtain their concurrence early in project development in the Work Zone Designer Strategy Meeting. Refer to the Traffic Manual Chapter 5 for additional information, guidance and approval requirements for speed limit reductions in work zones. Include approval documents in the Project File. Speed reduction for work zones is categorized as follows:
•
•
Continuous Regulatory Speed Limit Reduction: In place 24 hours a day during both active work operations and nonworking hours for a stage of work lasting 4 or more calendar days. Variable/Intermittent Regulatory Speed Limit Reduction: In place only during active work operations when temporary lane closures are in place lasting 3 calendar days or less but typically used during
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1010
•
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
daily/nightly lane closures. When the lane closure is removed, the existing speed limit or continuous regulatory work zone speed limit is restored. Advisory Speed: Associated with a warning sign for an isolated work zone condition or roadway restriction up to ½ mile in length based on the reduced design speed or ball banking measurement. Advisory speeds may be in place continuously or variably.
Drivers tend to reduce their speed only if they perceive a need to do so. Unless Region Transportation Operations accepts otherwise, continuous regulatory speed limit reductions will only be considered for restrictive temporary roadway configurations that exceed ½ mile in length that cannot be designed for the existing speed limit; warning signs with advisory speeds, matching the reduced design speed, shall be used at restrictive features up to ½ mile in length provided it is within 10 mph of the regulatory speed limit. In addition, continuous regulatory speed limit reductions are also considered during bituminous surface treatment (BST) operations, alternating traffic under temporary portable traffic signal control, and emergency situations. Variable/intermittent regulatory speed limit reductions will be considered during lane closures utilizing active work operations with workers, equipment, or materials adjacent to traffic on roadways posted 45 mph or higher without positive protection devices. Variable/intermittent regulatory speed limit reductions may be considered as part of an overall safety strategy and shall be in compliance with Traffic Manual Chapter 5. Advisory speeds are associated with a warning sign for an isolated work zone condition or restricted roadway features up to ½ mile in length and posted based on the reduced design work zone speed or ball banking measurement provided it is within 10 mph of the regulatory speed limit, unless approved otherwise by Region Transportation Operations. Advisory speeds are used for restricted sight distance, median crossover, roadway realignment where the feature’s design speed does not match the regulatory speed limit.
1010.06(7) Accommodation for Pedestrians and Bicyclists Many public highways and streets accommodate pedestrians and bicyclists, predominately in urban areas. During construction, access must be maintained through or around the work zones. When existing pedestrian routes are closed, design and construct the alternate routes to be detectable and to meet or exceed the existing level of accessibility. When existing accessible routes are closed, temporary pedestrian facilities within the work zone are required to meet ADA accessibility criteria to the maximum extent feasible. Covered walkways are to be provided where there is a potential for falling objects. Shared bicycle-vehicle lanes are prohibited on freeways and multilane roadways 45 mph and higher. On these routes, bicyclists will need either a 4-foot shoulder, detour/alternate route (via sidewalk, shared path, or another roadway), shuttle, or some other reasonable accommodation through or around the work zone. When existing separated bicycle lanes are closed during construction, bicycles are to be detoured onto the adjacent sidewalk. If that sidewalk is also closed, then a combined bicycle-pedestrian detour route, free shuttle, or another reasonable accommodation is to be provided. On highways 30 mph or less without separated bicycle lanes, a shared vehicle-bicycle lane may be used with a R4-11 sign (Bicycles MAY USE FULL ROADWAY). On highways 35 mph or higher without separated bicycle lanes, a shared-bicycle lane may be used with additional W11-15 MOD (Bicycles SHARE THE ROAD) warning signs placed in advance and along the route except when existing separated/protected bicycle lanes are present.

Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
Bicycles may be combined with vehicular traffic when alternating traffic is controlled via flagger, AFAD, or temporary signal on all roadways regardless of the posted speed limit. It may be possible to make other provisions to transport pedestrians and bicyclists through a work zone or with a walking escort around the active work area. Roadway surfaces that are reasonably smooth provide for greater accessibility for those walking, biking and rolling. Conditions such as loose gravel, uneven surfaces, milled pavement, or asphalt tack coats restrict access and may increase the potential for falling or tripping. It is recognized that construction may create these temporary conditions and to the extent feasible should be avoided or signs shall indicate the conditions. Information can be gathered on considerations for bicyclists by contacting local bike clubs and local agencies. Coordination with local bike clubs increases the likelihood that their members are notified of work zone impacts, and it helps maintain good public relations. (See Chapter 1510 for more pedestrian and bicyclist design requirements and MUTCD Chapter 6D for pedestrian work zone design requirements.)
1010.06(8) Warning Signs for Motorcyclists The roadway surface condition requires additional warning signs to alert the motorcyclist of work zone conditions. Per RCW 47.36.200 paragraph 2, “(2) If the construction, repair, or maintenance work includes or uses grooved pavement, abrupt lane edges, steel plates, or gravel or earth surfaces, the construction, repair, or maintenance zone must be posted with signs stating the condition, as required by current law, and in addition, must warn motorcyclists of the potential hazard only if the hazard or condition exists on a paved public highway, county road, street, bridge, or other thoroughfare commonly traveled. For the purposes of this subsection, the department shall adopt by rule a uniform sign or signs for this purpose, including at least the following language, "MOTORCYCLES USE EXTREME CAUTION."
1010.06(9) Oversized Vehicles The region Maintenance offices and the HQ Commercial Vehicle Services Office issue permits to allow vehicles that exceed the legal width, height, or weight limits to use certain routes. If a proposed work zone will reduce roadway width or vertical clearance, or have weight restrictions, adequate warning signs and notification to the HQ Commercial Vehicle Services Office and the appropriate region Maintenance Office is required as a minimum. When the total width of a roadway is to be reduced to less than 16 feet for more than three days, communication with these offices and any other stakeholders is required; include documentation in the Project File. The contract documents shall include provisions requiring the contractor to provide a 30-calendar-day notice prior to placing the restriction. In the permit notification, identify the type of restriction (height, weight, or width) and specify the maximum size that can be accommodated. On some projects, it may be necessary to designate a detour route for oversized vehicles. Oversized vehicles can sometimes be unexpected in work zones, even though warning and restriction or prohibition signs may be in place. Some oversized loads can overhang the temporary barrier or channelization devices and encroach on areas where workers are present. Assess the exposure of those within the work zone. Routes with high volumes of oversized loads or routes that are already strategic oversized load routes may not be able to rely only on warning or prohibition signs. Protective features or active early warning devices may be needed. Consider bridge height restrictions, signage of conditions or other bridge strike mitigation measures in cases where an oversized load has the potential to cause significant damage to structures or expose workers to injury. The structure design, staging, and falsework openings may need to be reconsidered to accommodate oversized loads passing through these structures without striking them.

1010.07 Temporary Traffic Control Devices FHWA regulations require that temporary traffic control devices be compliant with the 2016 edition of the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH) crash test requirements. In some cases, either the 2009 MASH or the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 350 compliant devices may be used. See Standard Specification 1-10.2(3) for more information.
1010.07(1) Channelizing Devices (Section Rewritten 2023)
Channelizing devices warn and guide road users through the work zone. They are used to channelize traffic away from the work area, pavement drop-offs, or opposing directions of traffic. Typical channelization devices and their dimensions are as follows: On freeways and multilane roadways 45 mph or higher, traffic safety drums are required on lane closure and lane shift tapers and recommended on the tangents. For restricted areas, 42-inch tall channelization devices may be used on tangents. When a single open lane is shifted onto the shoulder, the edge of the shoulder pavement shall be delineated with 28-inch traffic cones during hours of darkness. For one-lane, two-way traffic configurations using 28-inch traffic cones is recommended. Portable tubular markers are not a recommended device unless they are being used to separate 40 mph or less traffic and are located near or on existing pavement markings. Pavement-mounted tubular markers may be added to supplement long-term temporary pavement markings (such a double yellow centerline for two-lane, two-way traffic) but its color shall match the adjacent lane line. Longitudinal channelizing devices are interconnected devices that provide channelization with no gaps but are not approved positive protection devices. Barricades are a channelization device mostly used to supplement other channelization devices in traffic control operations involving road and ramp closures. Avoid using barricades to delineate sidewalk closure limits. Pedestrian channelization devices shall be used to delineate sidewalk closure limits and may be used to delineate pedestrian detour routes.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.07(2) Construction Signs Construction signs are used to regulate, warn or guide road users through a work zone. Class A construction signs are signs that remain in service throughout the construction or during a major phase of the work. They are mounted on posts, existing fixed structures, or substantial supports of a semi-permanent nature. Class A signs will be designated as such on the traffic control plan. Class B construction signs are those signs that are placed and removed daily/nightly or are used continuously in one location for durations extending up to 7 calendar days and are mounted on portable or temporary crashworthy mountings with a minimum mounting height of 1 foot. Temporary sign supports with 5-foot minimum mounting heights should be used when temporary signs are mounted behind channelizing device or in urban areas with roadside parking that may obstruct sign visibility. Construction signs need to be placed such that they do not obstruct active transportation facilities. See Chapter 1020 and the Standard Plans for signing details. Sign messages, color, configuration, and usage are shown in the MUTCD and the Sign Fabrication Manual. Existing signs may need to be covered, removed, or modified during construction.
1010.07(3) Warning Lights Warning lights are either flashing or steady burn and can be mounted on channelizing devices, barriers, and signs. Secure crashworthy mounting of warning lights is required. Except for special circumstances permitted by Region Transportation Operations, warning lights will be phased out completely by January 1, 2027.
•
•
•
Type A: Low-intensity flashing warning light used on a sign or barricade to warn road users during nighttime hours that they are approaching a work zone. Type B: High-intensity flashing warning light used on a sign or barricade to warn road users during both daytime and nighttime hours. Type C and Type D 360 degree: Steady-burn warning lights designed to operate 24 hours a day to delineate the edge of the roadway.
1010.07(4) Arrow Board (Sequential Arrow Sign) An arrow board is a sign with a matrix electronic display elements capable of either flashing or sequential displays. They are usually trailer mounted with solar power and batteries to energize the electronic displays. An arrow board with merge displays are required for lane closures on multilane roadways. When closing more than one lane, use an arrow board for each lane reduction. Place the arrow board at the beginning of the transition taper and out of the traveled way. The caution display (four corner lights) is only used for shoulder work or when within lane closures away from the merge tapers. Arrow boards are not used on two-lane, two-way roadways at flagger tapers or lateral shifts. These devices are not crashworthy and shall be removed when not in use or placed behind barrier or guardrail.
1010.07(5) Portable Changeable Message Signs (PCMS) PCMS have electronic displays that can be modified and programmed with specific messages and may be used to supplement other warning signs. These signs are usually trailer mounted with solar power and batteries to energize the electronic displays. A two-second display of two messages is the recommended method to provide time to motorists to read the sign’s message twice. These devices are not crashworthy and shall be removed when not in use or placed behind barrier or guardrail. PCMS are best used to provide notice of unexpected situations like the potential for traffic delays or queuing and to provide a notice of future closures or restrictions. PCMSs shall not be used in place of required signs.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.07(6) Portable Temporary Traffic Control Signals These versatile trailer-mounted portable signals are battery powered, with the ability to be connected to AC power. They can operate on fixed timing or be traffic actuated. They are typically used on two-lane two-way highways to alternate traffic in a single lane for extended durations. Portable signals work best when the length between signals are 1,500 feet maximum and no accesses lie between the temporary signals. Temporary stop bars, and lighting at the stop bars is required for signal use. For assistance on using these devices, contact Region Transportation Operations.
1010.07(7) Portable Highway Advisory Radio Highway Advisory Radio (HAR) can be used to broadcast AM radio messages about work zone traffic and travelrelated information. The system may be a permanently located transmitter or a portable trailer-mounted system that can be moved from location to location as necessary. Contact the region Transportation Operations Office for specific guidance and advice on the use of these systems.
1010.07(8) Automated Flagger Assistance Device An Automated Flagger Assistance Device (AFAD) is a flagging machine that is operated remotely by a flagger located off the roadway and away from traffic. This device is recommended on 45 MPH routes to support flagger safety especially on highways with reduced sight distance or limited escape routes. A traffic control plan is required for use of the AFAD and a flagger is required to operate each device. If used, a Red/Yellow lens AFAD is required, see the MUTCD for additional guidance on temporary traffic control zone devices.
1010.07(9) Radar Speed Display Sign RSDS are a work zone speed management device that display motorist’s speed in real time along with a regulatory speed limit sign or advisory speed sign mounted above the speed display. RSDS work best when a single lane of traffic remains open but may be used when multiple lanes are open. When multiple lanes are open in heavy traffic volume conditions, it may be unclear which vehicle’s speed is actually displayed. RSDS are not an automated speed enforcement speed, but a passive feedback system to drivers. Modest speed reductions of 3 to 6 mph have been recorded when used within an active work zone.
1010.08 Positive Protection Devices Channelizing devices will not provide worker and road user protection in some work zones. Positive protection devices such as temporary barriers, impact attenuators, transportable attenuators, and protective vehicles shall be considered per federal law (23 CFR Part 630 K). Unless Region Transportation Operations decides otherwise, situations when positive protection devices are required include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
In advance of work areas within shoulder and lane closures that are adjacent to vehicular traffic To separate opposing traffic traveling 45 mph and faster normally separated by a median or existing median barrier. Where existing traffic barriers or bridge railings are to be removed. For drop-off protection during widening or excavations (see Standard Specification 1-07.23(1)). When temporary slopes change clear zone requirements. For bridge falsework protection.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
When equipment or materials are to remain in the work zone clear zone. When newly constructed features in the clear zone will not have permanent protection until later in the project. Where temporary signs or light standards are not crashworthy. To separate workers from motorized traffic when work zone offers no means of escape for the worker, such as tunnels, bridges, and retaining walls, or for long-duration worker exposure within one lanewidth of high-volume traffic with speeds of 45 mph and faster.
1010.08(1) Temporary Barriers (Section Rewritten 2023) Temporary barriers are meant to reduce the overall severity of crashes, but do not prevent crashes or injuries from occurring nor will they restrain or redirect all vehicles in all conditions. Consequently, barriers should not be used unless a reduced crash severity potential is likely as barrier itself is a potential hazard. To use temporary barriers effectively and economically, it usually requires a long-duration (2 week or longer) stationary work zone to be cost effective as it will increase the traffic control costs of a project. The safety benefit versus the cost of using barrier requires careful consideration, and cost should not be the only or primary factor determining the use of barrier. Temporary barrier should be anchored or pinned per the standard plans when the lateral deflection space is reduced. Narrow base barrier shall always be anchored. When anchoring temporary barrier across existing bridge expansion joints, a special steel plate spanning a barrier opening over the expansion joint may be required to avoid damaging the structure; contact Bridge & Structures Office. The lateral deflection space (“slide distance”) of the traffic barrier must be shown on the staged traffic control plan, desirably using a cross-section. F-shape concrete barrier with scuppers (holes at the base of barrier to allow for storm water drainage off the roadway) may be needed depending on roadway hydraulics due to pooling water. See Chapter 5 in Hydraulics Manual. Temporary barrier should typically begin with a temporary impact attenuator and be laterally offset from the traveled way as far as feasible, then the barrier will be tapered toward the traveled way to the proposed lateral offset from the edge of traveled way. Consideration must be given to construction vehicles access to the work area (provide 10-foot wide construction access where feasible), location of existing barriers or guardrails and placement space for the temporary impact attenuator. It should begin a minimum 4 feet laterally from any retaining wall or existing barrier. When flared temporary barrier begins at the existing guardrail or existing barrier, a transition section is needed to connect them. Use Chapter 1610 for guidance and design criteria on traffic barriers. For temporary barrier, the permanent barrier design criteria apply to the extent practical and feasible with temporary modification to design elements may be modified as justified in the TMP. For example, an unanchored temporary precast concrete barrier deflection distance could be reduced to 1 foot (from 3 feet) for a temporary bypass with a 25-mph regulatory speed limit.
1010.08(1)(a) Concrete Barriers Concrete barriers are the safety-shape barriers (Type F, Type 2) shown in the Standard Plans. Safety-shape barriers can be unanchored or anchored. See Chapter 1610 for more detailed information on these barriers and their deflection characteristics.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.08(1)(b) Movable Barrier Systems Movable barriers are specially designed segmental barriers that can be moved laterally one lane width or more as a unit with specialized equipment. This allows strategies with frequent or daily relocation of a barrier. The ends of the barrier must be located out of the design clear zone or fitted with a temporary impact attenuator and storage sites at both ends of the barrier will be needed for the barrier-moving machine. WSDOT owns a limited quantity of this type of barrier for project use; however, the barrier moving machine must be leased. Contact HQworkzone@wsdot.wa.gov for additional information.
1010.08(1)(c) Portable Steel Barriers Portable steel barriers have a lightweight stackable design. They have options for gate-type openings and relocation without heavy equipment. Steel barriers can be unanchored or anchored per the manufacturer’s specifications. The lateral displacement of unanchored steel barriers from vehicle impacts typically ranges from 5 to 8 feet depending on manufacturer. The lateral displacement of anchored steel barriers from vehicle impacts typically ranges from 1 to 3 feet depending on manufacturer and anchor pinning arrangement. Steel barriers are proprietary items. See manufacturer website for more information.
1010.08(2) Temporary Impact Attenuators Within the Design Clear Zone, the approach ends of temporary barriers shall be fitted with impact attenuators on roadways 30 mph or faster. On roadways 25 mph or slower, a sloped concrete terminal is permitted. The information in Chapter 1620 provides all the necessary temporary impact attenuator performance and selection information. In addition to the guidance in Chapter 1620, consider the characteristics of the work zone when selecting an attenuator. Selection should consider site specific conditions and the dynamic nature of work zones throughout the project. Contract plans showing temporary impact attenuator placement need to include a list of the approved attenuators that a contractor may use for that installation. See the Attenuator Selection Template at: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/design/ProductFolder/Impact_attenuator_selection_template.xlsx
1010.08(3) Transportable Attenuators A transportable attenuator is a positive protection device attached to the rear of a large truck or as a trailer that can be positioned to provide protection for a work area just in front of the device after a proper roll ahead distance is provided in case of an impact. A transportable attenuator shall be used for active work areas when speeds are 45 mph and greater (except for alternating traffic controlled via flagger, AFAD, or temporary signal) when other positive protection devices are not in place.
1010.08(4) Protective Vehicles (New section 2023) A protective vehicle is typically a work truck (without an attenuator) that can be positioned to provide protection for a work area just in front of the vehicle after a proper roll ahead distance is provided in case of an impact. A protective vehicle is suitable for active work areas when speeds are 40 mph or less but may be used for any speed when alternating traffic is controlled via flagger, AFAD, or temporary signal. Protective vehicles may be used behind channelizing devices to block closed on-ramps.

1010.09 Other Traffic Control Devices or Features 1010.09(1) Delineation Temporary pavement markings will be required when permanent pavement markings are obliterated due to construction operations or temporary reconfigurations needed for long-term work zone strategies. Temporary pavement markings can be made using paint, preformed tape, or raised pavement markers. Complex projects will most likely require both long- and short-duration temporary markings. All temporary pavement markings are to be retroreflective and match permanent pavement marking colors. All conflicting pavement markings are to be completely removed. Temporary pavement markings are installed in accordance with the Standard Plans and Standard Specifications. Short-duration temporary pavement markings are made with materials intended for short-duration (up to two months) until permanent markings can be installed on paving and BST projects, or for short durations between construction stages. Short-duration temporary pavement markings are abbreviated patterns. Broken line patterns typically consist of a 4-foot line with a 36-foot gap for paint and tape markings but may be increased to a 10-foot line with a 30-foot gap when specified in the Contract. Short-duration broken line patterns consist of a grouping of three raised pavement markings at 3-foot spacing with a 34-foot gap. Short-duration traffic arrows, HOV symbols, and other markings mimic permanent marking standards. Edge lines and gore lines are not installed unless otherwise specified in the Contract. Flexible raised pavement markers are required for bituminous surface treatments but typically are not allowed on other pavement types. Temporary edge lines are installed only when specified in the plans. When specified, temporary edge lines are either solid lines or raised pavement markers at 5-foot spacing. Long-duration temporary pavement markings layouts will match permanent pavement marking standards and shall be used on projects spanning multiple seasons and/or wintering over. To enhance wet-weather visibility, long-duration temporary pavement markings should be supplemented with reflective Type 2 Raised Pavement Markers. Long-duration markings need to be detailed in the contract plans for installation and material type. Pre-formed tapes should be used on the final pavement surface to avoid leaving scars when removed. Lateral clearance markers are used at the angle points of barriers where they encroach on or otherwise restrict the adjacent shoulder. Barrier delineation is necessary where the barrier is less than 4 feet from the edge of traveled way and shall match the color of the adjacent edge line. Guideposts may be considered to aid nighttime driving through temporary alignments or diversions. (See Chapter 1030 for delineation requirements.)
1010.09(2) Screening Screening devices can be used to reduce motorists’ distraction due to construction activities adjacent to the traveled way. Consider screening when a highway operates near capacity during most of the day. Screening should be positioned behind traffic barriers to prevent impacts by errant vehicles and should be anchored or braced to resist overturning when buffeted by wind. Commercially available screening or contractor-built screening can be used, provided the device meets crashworthy criteria if exposed to traffic and is approved by the Engineer prior to installation. Glare screening may be required on concrete barriers separating two-way traffic to reduce headlight glare from oncoming traffic. Woven wire and vertical blade-type screens are commonly used in this installation. This screening also reduces the potential for motorist confusion at nighttime by shielding construction equipment and the headlights of other vehicles on adjacent roadways.

Make sure that motorists’ sight distance is not impaired by these glare screens. Contact the HQ Design Office and refer to AASHTO’s Roadside Design Guide for additional information on screening.
1010.09(3) Illumination Illumination might be justified if construction activities take place on the roadway at night for an extended period of time. Illumination might also be justified for long-term construction projects at the following locations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Road closures with detours or diversions. Median crossovers on freeways. Complex or temporary alignment or channelization. Haul road crossings (if operational at night). Temporary traffic signals. Temporary ramp connections. Projects with lane shifts and restricted geometrics. Projects with existing illumination that needs to be removed as part of the construction process.
Illumination is required when:
•
•
Traffic flow is split around or near an obstruction. Flaggers are necessary for nighttime construction activities (supplemental lighting of the flagger stations by use of portable light plants or other approved methods). Refer to Standard Specification 1-10.3(1)A.
For information on light levels and other electrical design requirements, see Chapter 1040.
1010.09(4) Signals A permanent signal system can be modified for a temporary configuration such as temporary pole locations during intersection construction, span wire systems, and adjustment of signal heads and alternative detection systems to accommodate a construction stage (see Chapter 1330).
1010.09(5) Smart Work Zone Systems (SWZS) A Smart Work Zone System (SWZS) uses real time information to optimize the safety and efficiency of traffic through the work zone and should be considered on long term closures with recurring work zone queuing exceeding 3 miles. SWZS can provide information such as queue detection for “slowed or stopped traffic ahead” messaging before motorists sees brake lights, merging instructions (zipper merging where motorists are instructed to use all open lanes up to the merge point and take turns merging) to reduce the queue lengths, or travel time information so drivers can choose alternate routes. A SWZS may be limited to the highway approaching the work area or a more complex highway network system to manage regional impacts from the projects mobility impacts. Portable equipment used in a SWZS may include portable changeable message signs, portable roadside traffic sensors and cameras that communicate wirelessly through a web-based central management platform. Predetermined messages will be displayed on the changeable message signs approaching a work area based on traffic data from the portable sensors also placed approaching the work area. A SWZS technician will install, program, and monitor the system. A simplified version of a SWZS, A Queue Warning System (QWS) should be considered for daily, nightly, or weekend long closures for warning of non-recurring work zone queuing up to 3 miles.

Work Zone Safety and Mobility
As a minimum, A PCMS should be positioned in advance of a lane closure with messages about queuing when they are present and relocated as needed by a traffic control supervisor. Refer to the Traffic Manual for additional information and guidance on work zone queuing mitigation.
1010.10 Traffic Control Plan Development and PS&E WSDOT projects need to include plans and payment items for controlling traffic based on a strategy that is consistent with the project construction elements, even though there may be more than one workable strategy. A constructible and biddable method of temporary traffic control is the goal. The contractor has the option of adopting the contract plans or proposing an alternative method.
1010.10(1) Traffic Control Plans “Typical” traffic control plans are generic in nature and are not intended to address all site conditions. They are intended for use at multiple work locations when they can be applied with little or no modifications to address site conditions. They include spacing tables to address different roadway speeds. Typical plans may be all that are needed for basic paving projects. Some typical plans are located at: Design - Work Zone Typical Traffic Control Plans | WSDOT (wa.gov) “Project-specific” traffic control plans are typical-type plans that have been modified to fit a specific project or roadway condition. Dimension lines for signs and device placement provide the distances based on the regulatory speed limit, and only minimal spacing tables should remain; the lane and roadway configuration may also be modified to match the project conditions. “Site-specific” traffic control plans are drawn for a specific location. Scaled base data drawn plans will be the most accurate as device placement and layout considerations can be resolved by the designer; however, schematic plans are also permitted. Making a “project-specific” plan applicable for a site-specific location is another option if the device layout will match the site-specific location since the plan is usually not to scale. “Staged Traffic” plan should be used for temporary alignment and channelization for long-duration traffic control. For additional information, see Division 4 of the Plans Preparation Manual. The following plans, in addition to the TCP types above addressing the TTC strategies, may be included in the PS&E.
1010.10(1)(a) Construction Sign Plan Show Class A Construction Signs that will remain in place for the duration of the project located by either station or milepost. Verify the locations to avoid conflicts with existing signing or other roadway features. These locations may still be subject to movement in the field to fit specific conditions. For simple projects these signs are often shown on the vicinity map sheet.
1010.10(1)(b) Construction Sign Specification Sheet Provide a Class A Construction Sign Specifications sheet on complex or staged projects. Include location, post information, and notes for Standard Plans or other specific sign information and sign details.
1010.10(1)(c) Quantity Tabulation Sheets Quantity Tabulation sheets are recommended for barrier and attenuator items and temporary pavement markings on projects with large quantities of these items or for staged construction projects.

Chapter 1010
Work Zone Safety and Mobility
1010.10(1)(d) Traffic Control Plan Index An Index sheet is a useful tool for projects that contain a large quantity of traffic control plans and multiple work operations at various locations throughout the project. The Index sheet provides the contractor a quick referencing tool indicating the applicable traffic control plan for the specific work operation.
1010.10(1)(e) Construction Sequence Plans Sequence plans are placed early in the plan set and are intended to show the proposed construction stages and the work required for each stage. They should refer to the corresponding TCPs for the traffic control details of each stage.
1010.10(1)(f) Temporary Signal Plan The temporary signal plan will follow conventions used to develop permanent signals (as described in Chapter 1330) but will be designed to accommodate temporary needs and work operations in order to prevent conflicts with construction operations. If channelization has been temporarily revised then opposing left-turn clearances should be maintained as described in Chapter 1310, or signal timing should be adjusted to accommodate the revision. Some existing systems can be maintained using temporary span wires for signal heads and video, microwave actuation, or timed control.
1010.10(1)(g) Temporary Illumination Plan Full lighting is normally provided through traffic control areas where power is available. The temporary illumination plan will follow conventions used to develop permanent illumination (as described in Chapter 1040) but will be designed to accommodate temporary needs and work operations so that there will be no conflicts with construction operations.
1010.10(2) Contract Specifications Work hour restrictions for lane closure operations are to be specifically identified for each project where traffic impacts are expected and liquidated damages need to be applied to the contract. Refer to the Plans Preparation Manual for additional information on writing traffic control specifications.
1010.10(3) Cost Estimating Temporary traffic control devices and traffic control labor can be difficult to estimate. There is no way of knowing how many operations a contractor may implement at the same time. The best method is to follow the working day estimate schedule and the TCPs that will be used for each operation. Temporary signs and devices will be used on many plans, but the estimated quantity reflects the most used at any one time. A lump sum item can be used to pay for temporary traffic control when an assessment of the cost risk associated with that approach indicates that the traffic control operation is sufficiently well defined. Criteria to use in the assessment include the number and complexity of planned intersection, interchange, mainline, transit, bicycle, pedestrian, and other high impact closures; rolling slowdowns; multiple work shifts; and roadway detours. A template for assessing risk is available at the design support webpage www.wsdot.wa.gov/design/support/.
1010.11 Training and Resources Temporary traffic control-related training is an important component in an effective work zone safety and mobility program. Federal regulations require that those involved in the development, design, implementation, operation, inspection, and enforcement be trained at a level consistent with their responsibilities. Contact the State Work Zone Engineer at HQWorkZone@wsdot.wa.gov for training options. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Signing Exhibit 1020-1 Reflective Sheeting Requirements for Overhead Signs Exhibit 1020-2 Timber Posts Exhibit 1020-3 Wide Flange Steel Posts Exhibit 1020-4 Square Steel Posts
1020.01 General The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) uses signing as the primary mechanism for regulating, warning, and guiding traffic. Signing must be in place when any section of highway is open to the motoring public. Each highway project has unique and specific signing requirements. For statewide signing uniformity and continuity, it is sometimes necessary to provide signing beyond the project limits. Design characteristics of the facility determine the size and legend for a sign. As the design speed increases, larger sign sizes are necessary to provide adequate message comprehension time. The MUTCD, the Traffic Manual, and the Sign Fabrication Manual contain standard sign dimensions, specific legends, and reflective sheeting types for all new signs. Guide signing provides the motorist with directional information to destinations. This information is always presented in a consistent manner. In some cases, there are specific laws, regulations, and policies governing the content of the messages on these signs. All proposed guide signs for a project require the approval of the region Traffic Engineer. The use of nonstandard signs is strongly discouraged and their use requires the approval of the State Traffic Engineer. Apply the following criteria when determining whether to replace or modify existing signs:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Current sign’s service life is reached Lack of nighttime retroreflectivity Substantial damage, vandalism, or deterioration Replace existing signs with either Type I or Type II sheeting Change in sign use policy Improper location Message or destination changes necessary to satisfy commitments to public or local agencies Substandard mounting height Change in jurisdiction (for example, a county road becomes a state route)
Address sign support breakaway features in accordance with Chapter 1600.
1020.02 Design Components 1020.02(1) Location The MUTCD contains the guidelines for positioning signs. Check sign locations to ensure the motorist’s view of the sign is not obscured by other roadside appurtenances. Also, determine whether the proposed sign will obstruct the view of other signs or limit the motorist’s sight distance of the roadway. Reposition existing signs, when necessary, to satisfy these visibility requirements. Where possible, locate signs behind existing traffic barriers, on grade separation structures, or where terrain features will minimize their exposure to errant vehicles.

Signing
Longitudinal Placement
The MUTCD and the Traffic Manual provide guidelines for the longitudinal placement of signs that are dependent on the type of sign. Select a location to fit the existing conditions to provide for visibility and adequate response time. In most cases, signs can be shifted longitudinally to enhance safety without compromising their intended purpose.
1020.02(3) Lateral Clearance The Standard Plans and the MUTCD contain minimum requirements for the lateral placement of signs. Where possible, position the signs at the maximum feasible lateral clearance for safety and reduced maintenance costs. Locate large guide signs and motorist information signs beyond the Design Clear Zone (see Chapter 1600) where limited right of way or other physical constraints are not a factor. On steep fill slopes, an errant vehicle is likely to be partially airborne from the slope break near the edge of shoulder to a point 12 feet down the slope. When signs are placed on fill slopes steeper than 6H:1V, locate the support at least 12 feet beyond the slope break. Use breakaway sign support features, when required, for signs located within the Design Clear Zone and for signs located beyond this zone where there is a possibility they might be struck by an errant vehicle. Breakaway features are not necessary on signposts located behind traffic barriers. Install longitudinal barriers to shield signs without breakaway features within the Design Clear Zone when no other options are available. Sign bridges and cantilever sign structures have limited span lengths. Locate the vertical components of these structures as far from the traveled way as possible and, where appropriate, install traffic barriers (see Chapter 1610). Do not locate signposts in the bottom of a ditch or where the posts will straddle the ditch. The preferred location is beyond the ditch or on the ditch backslope (see the Standard Plans). In high-fill areas where conditions require placement of a sign behind a traffic barrier, consider adding embankment material to reduce the length of the sign supports.
1020.02(4) Sign Heights For ground-mounted signs installed at the side of the road, provide a mounting height of at least 7 feet, measured from the bottom of the sign to the edge of traveled way. Supplemental plaques, when used, are mounted directly below the primary sign. At these locations, the minimum mounting height of the plaque is 5 feet. Do not attach supplemental guide signs to the posts below the hinge mechanism or the saw cut notch on multiple-post installations. The location of these hinges or saw cuts on the sign supports are shown in the Standard Plans. A minimum 7-foot vertical height from the bottom of the sign to the ground directly below the sign is necessary for the breakaway features of the sign support to function properly when struck by a vehicle. The minimum mounting height for new signs located behind longitudinal barriers is 7 feet, measured from the bottom of the sign to the edge of traveled way. A lower mounting height of 5 feet may be used when replacing a sign panel on an existing sign assembly located behind the longitudinal barrier. The Standard Plans shows typical sign installations.

Page 1020-2
Chapter 1020
Signing
For ground-mounted signs installed on multiple posts that are a minimum of 12 feet from the edge of traveled way in cut sections, the minimum height clearance between the sign and the ground for the post farther from the edge of traveled way is as follows:
•
•
For slopes 2H:1V and steeper, the minimum height clearance is 2 feet. For slopes 3H:1V or flatter, the minimum height clearance is 7 feet.
Signs used to reserve parking for people with disabilities are installed at each designated parking stall and are mounted 7 feet above the surface at the sign location.
1020.02(5) Foundations Foundation details for timber and steel ground-mounted sign supports are shown in the Standard Plans, which also contains foundation designs for truss-type sign bridges and cantilever sign structures. Three designs, Types 1, 2, and 3, are shown for each structure. An investigation of the foundation material is necessary to determine the appropriate foundation design. Use the data obtained from the geotechnical report to select the foundation type.
•
•
•
The Type 1 foundation design uses a large concrete shaft and is the preferred installation when the lateral bearing pressure of the soil is 2,500 psf or greater. The Type 2 foundation design has a large rectangular footing design and is an alternative to the Type 1 foundation when the concrete shaft is not suitable. The Type 3 foundation design is used in poorer soil conditions where the lateral bearing pressure of the soil is between 1,500 psf and 2,500 psf.
If a nonstandard foundation or monotube structure design is planned, forward the report to the Headquarters (HQ) Bridge and Structures Office for use in developing a suitable foundation design (see Chapter 610).
1020.02(6) Signposts Ground-mounted signs are installed on either timber posts or steel posts. The size and number of posts required for a sign installation are based on the height and surface area of the sign, or signs, being supported. Use the information in Exhibit 1020-2, Exhibit 1020-3, and Exhibit 1020-4 and the Standard Plans to determine the posts required for each installation. Coordinate with the region Maintenance Office concerning signpost installation. Use steel posts with breakaway supports that are multidirectional if the support is likely to be hit from more than one direction. For any wide flange multiple-steel post installations located within the Design Clear Zone, the total weight of all the posts in a 7-foot-wide path is not to exceed a combined post weight of 34 lbs/foot. Use the Wide Flange Beam Weights table in Exhibit 1020-3 to determine wide flange steel post weights. If the proposed sign configuration does not meet the weight criterion, relocate, resize, or provide barrier protection for the proposed installation. All signposts are to be designed to 90 mph wind loads. Design features of breakaway supports are shown in the Standard Plans. Steel signposts commonly used are: Perforated Square Steel Tube (PSST); Square Steel Tube (SST); Round Pipe (RP); and Wide Flange "H-Beam." Steel posts with Type TP-A, TP-B, PL, PL-T, PL-U, AS, AP, SB-1, and SB-2 bases have multidirectional breakaway features.

Signing
1020.03 Overhead Installation Guidance on the use of overhead sign installations is provided in the MUTCD. Where possible, mount overhead signs on grade separation structures rather than sign bridges or cantilever supports. Details for the construction of truss-type sign bridges and cantilever sign supports are shown in the Standard Plans. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office designs structure-mounted sign mountings, monotube sign bridges, and monotube cantilever sign supports. For overhead sign installation designs, provide sign dimensions, horizontal location in relation to the roadway, and location of the lighting fixtures to facilitate design of the mounting components by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. Provide existing and proposed sign dimensions to the Bridge Preservation Office for review when replacing or modifying any overhead sign.
1020.03(1) Illumination The retroreflectivity of currently approved sign sheeting removes the need to provide illumination for sign installations. Sign lights for existing illuminated overhead and ground-mounted signs can be de-energized and removed when the retroreflective sheeting is adequate for nighttime legibility, or the existing sign is replaced with a new sign (see Exhibit 1020-1 for sheeting requirements). A nighttime assessment of all nonilluminated overhead signs within the project limits is required (contact the Region Traffic Office). Replace all signs that have inadequate retroreflectivity. In situations where a nonhighway light source interferes with a sign’s legibility, consider relocating the sign. Where a new overhead sign is being installed adjacent to an existing sign with sign lights, all other signs on the structure shall be replaced unless they meet current sheeting requirements (see Exhibit 1020-1). The existing sign lights shall then be de-energized by physical disconnection of the sign lighting wiring from the circuit or service cabinet, by maintenance as part of the project. On projects where there is additional electrical work, deenergized sign lights shall be removed and wiring shall be removed back to the point where the sign lighting circuit connects to any part of the lighting circuit to remain, or to the service cabinet, as appropriate. Replace any splices where a circuit branch is removed from the splice point. Overhead sign lights shall not be used. Where overhead sign visibility is less than 800 feet due to intervening sight obstructions such as highway structures or roadside features, roadside illumination may be considered to supplement reduced retroreflectivity from headlights. Overhead signs located within an area of continuous highway illumination are considered sufficiently illuminated. New overhead sign structures shall not be installed where a light standard (pole) will be within 50 feet of the front of the sign. New overhead sign structures may be installed where a light standard will be within 50 feet of the back of the sign only if a lighting analysis has been conducted to show that the light obstruction from the sign will not result in light levels outside of the requirements of Chapter 1040 for the applicable lighting design area type.

1020.03(2) Vertical Clearance The minimum vertical clearance from the roadway surface to the lowest point of an overhead sign assembly is 17 feet 6 inches. The minimum vertical clearance from the roadway surface to the lowest point of an overhead sign assembly without sign light(s) is 19 feet 6 inches. The maximum clearance is 21 feet. Vertically unbalanced mountings should be avoided on all overhead sign structures. Provide existing and proposed sign dimensions to the Bridge Preservation Office for review when replacing or modifying existing overhead signs. Contact the HQ Traffic Office regarding signs under bridges and in tunnels.
1020.03(3) Horizontal Placement Consider roadway geometrics and anticipated traffic characteristics when locating signs above the lane(s) to which they apply. Install advance guide signs/exit direction signs that require an EXIT ONLY and “down arrow” panel directly above the drop lanes. To reduce driver confusion about which lane is being dropped, avoid locating a sign with an EXIT ONLY panel on a horizontal curve.
1020.03(4) Service Walkways Walkways are provided on structure-mounted signs, truss-type sign bridges, and truss-type cantilever sign supports where roadway and traffic conditions prohibit normal sign maintenance activities. Monotube sign bridges/cantilever sign supports normally do not have service walkways. Vandalism of signs, particularly in the form of graffiti, can be a major problem in some areas. Vandals sometimes use the service walkways and vandalize the signs. Maintenance costs for cleaning or replacing the vandalized signs at these locations can exceed the benefit of providing the service walkway.
1020.04 State Highway Route Numbers For state routes, RCW 47.36.095 authorizes WSDOT to sign state highways using a system of state route numbers assigned to eliminate duplication of numbers. This numbering system follows the system employed by the federal government in the assignment of Interstate and U.S. routes: odd numbers indicate general northsouth routes and even numbers indicate general east-west routes.
1020.05 Mileposts Milepost markers are a part of a statewide system for all state highways and are installed in accordance with Executive Order E 1064, “State Route Mileposts,” and Chapter 2 of the Traffic Manual. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Signing
1020.06 Guide Sign Plan A preliminary guide sign plan is developed to identify existing and proposed guide signing on state highways and is reviewed by the region Traffic Engineer. Preliminary guide signs for Interstate routes are to be furnished to the HQ Traffic Office for review and concurrence. The plan provides an easily understood graphic representation of the signing and its continuity to motorist destinations, activities, and services. It is also used to identify deficiencies or poorly defined routes of travel. A guide sign plan for safety and mobility Improvement projects is desirable. When proposed highway work affects signing to a city or town, the guide sign plan can be furnished to the official governing body for review and consideration. The guide sign plan is reviewed and approved by the region Traffic Engineer.

1030.01 General The primary function of delineation is to provide the visual information needed by a driver to operate a vehicle in a variety of situations. Delineation includes the marking of highways with painted or more durable pavement marking lines and symbols, guideposts, and other devices such as curbs. These devices can use retroreflectance, which is the reflecting of light from a vehicle’s headlights back to the driver, to enhance an object’s visibility at nighttime. Delineation is a required design element (see Chapter 1105) on most projects. A decision to omit delineation is possible if the existing delineation is unaffected by construction and a safety performance evaluation (see Chapter 321) clearly shows that delineation is not a contributing factor to crashes. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) uses the latest edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) as a guide for the design, location, and application of delineation. Consult with the region Traffic Office early in the design process to ensure the proposed delineation is compatible with current WSDOT policy and guidance regarding types of markings and material selection.

1030.03 Pavement Markings 1030.03(1) Pavement Marking Types Pavement markings have specific functions: they guide the movement of traffic, and they promote increased safety performance. In some cases, they are used to supplement the messages of other traffic control devices. In other cases, markings are the only way to convey a message without distracting the driver. Pavement markings are intended to provide adequate performance year-round. Guidelines for the application of various pavement markings are provided in the Standard Plans Section M and the MUTCD.

1030.03(1)(a) Longitudinal Pavement Markings Longitudinal pavement markings define the boundary between opposing traffic flows, and they identify the edges of traveled way, multiple traffic lanes, turn lanes, and special-use lanes. The Standard Plans Section M shows the dimensions of longitudinal pavement markings. Longitudinal pavement markings are as follows: Barrier Centerline: A very wide—18 inches minimum, usually 20 inches: five 4-inch lines—solid yellow line or a combination of two single 4-inch solid yellow lines with yellow crosshatching between the lines, with a total width not less than 18 inches, used to separate opposing traffic movements where all movements over the line are prohibited. Barrier centerline locations require the approval of the region Traffic Engineer and Access Engineer. Centerline: A broken yellow line used to separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions, where passing in the opposing lane is allowed. Dotted Extension Line: A broken white or yellow line that is an extension of an edge line or centerline used at exit ramps, intersections on horizontal curves, multiple turn lanes, and other locations where the direction of travel for through or turning traffic is unclear. Double Centerline: Two parallel solid yellow lines used to separate lanes of traffic moving in opposite directions where passing in the opposing lane is prohibited. Double Lane Line: Two solid white lines used to separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction where crossing the lane line marking is prohibited. Double Wide Lane Line: Two solid wide white lines used to separate a concurrent preferential lane of traffic where crossing is prohibited. Drop Lane Line: A wide broken white line used in advance of a wide line to delineate a lane that ends at an offramp or intersection. Edge Line: A solid white or yellow line used to define the outer edges of the traveled way. Edge lines are not required where curbs or sidewalks are 4 feet or less from the traveled way. Lane Line: A broken white line used to separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction. No-Pass Line: A solid yellow line used in conjunction with a centerline where passing in the opposing lane is prohibited. Reversible Lane Line: Two broken yellow lines used to delineate a lane where traffic direction is periodically reversed. Solid Lane Line: A solid white line used to separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction where crossing the lane line marking is discouraged. Two-Way Left-Turn Centerline: Two yellow lines, one solid and one broken, used to delineate each side of a two-way left-turn lane. Wide Broken Lane Line: A wide broken white line used to designate a portion of a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane located on a divided highway where general-purpose vehicles may enter to make an exit. Wide Dotted Lane Line: A wide broken white line used to designate a portion of a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV), or business access and transit (BAT) lane located on an arterial highway where general-purpose vehicles may enter to make a turn at an intersection.

Delineation
Wide Lane Line: A wide solid white line used to separate lanes of traffic moving in the same direction, at ramp connections, storage lanes at intersections, and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, or at business access and transit (BAT) lanes, bike lanes, and other preferential lanes where crossing is discouraged. See MUTCD Chapter 3B for further information for these markings.
1030.03(1)(b) Transverse Pavement Markings Transverse pavement markings define pedestrian crossings and vehicle stopping points at intersections. They are also used to warn motorists of approaching conditions, required vehicular maneuvers, or lane usage. See the Standard Plans Section M for details of some of these pavement markings. Typical transverse pavement markings are as follows: Access Parking Space Symbol: A white marking used to designate parking stalls provided for motorists with disabilities. The marking may have an optional blue background and white border. Aerial Surveillance Marker: White markings used at one-mile and one-half-mile intervals on sections of highways where the State Patrol uses airplanes to enforce speed limits. Bicycle Lane Symbol: A white marking consisting of a symbol of a bicyclist and an arrow used in a marked bike lane. The bicycle lane symbol is to be placed immediately after an intersection and at other locations as needed (see the MUTCD). Typical spacing is 500 feet, with a maximum distance of 1,500 feet. Crosswalk Line: A series of parallel solid white lines used to define a pedestrian crossing. Drainage Marking: A white line used to denote the location of a catch basin, grate inlet, or other drainage feature in the shoulder of a roadway. HOV Symbol: A white diamond marking used for high-occupancy vehicle lanes. The spacing of the markings is an engineering judgment based on the conditions of use. Typical spacing is 1000 feet for divided highways and 500 feet for arterial highways. Railroad Crossing Symbol: A white marking used in advance of a railroad crossing where grade crossing signals or gates are located or where the posted speed of the highway is 40 mph or higher. Stop Line: A solid white line used to indicate the stopping point at an intersection or railroad crossing. Traffic Arrow: A white marking used in storage lanes and two-way left-turn lanes to denote the direction of turning movement. Arrows are also used at ramp terminals and intersections on divided highways to discourage wrong-way movements. Traffic Letters: White markings forming word messages, such as “ONLY,” used in conjunction with a traffic arrow at drop-lane situations. Traffic letters are not required for left- and right-turn storage lanes where the intended use of the lane is obvious. Wide Line: A wide solid line used for traffic islands, hash marks, chevrons, and other applications. A wide line used in conjunction with a centerline marking shall be yellow. A wide line used in conjunction with a lane line or right edge line marking shall be white. Yield Line Markings: A series of white triangular markings indicating that the lane yields.
1030.03(2) Pavement Marking Materials Pavement markings are applied using various materials. These materials are divided into two categories: paint and plastic. When selecting the pavement marking material to use in a project, consider the initial cost of the material and its durability; the location; the traffic conditions; the snow and ice removal practices of the particular maintenance area; and the region’s ability to maintain the markings.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1030-3
Chapter 1030
Delineation
Both painted and plastic pavement markings can accomplish the goal of providing a visible (daytime) and retroreflective (nighttime) pavement marking at the completion of a contract. The difference between the two marking materials is the projected durability of the markings. Paint used on sections of highway subjected to high traffic volumes and/or snow-removal operations might have a durability of only two to three months. Maintenance crews cannot restripe a highway during winter months; therefore, if a painted marking wears out prematurely, the highway will not have a stripe until maintenance crews can restripe in April or May. When these conditions are encountered in a highway project, consider a more durable plastic marking material and application type that will provide the desired durability for the marking. Check with your region Traffic Office for any specific pavement marking policy. For the recommended pavement marking material for different highway types and snow-removal practices, see Exhibit 1030-1. Consult with the region’s Traffic and Maintenance offices to select the best material for the project.
1030.03(2)(a) Paint Paint is the most common pavement marking material. It is relatively easy to apply and dries quickly (30–90 seconds in warm, dry weather) after application. This allows the application to be a moving operation, which minimizes traffic control costs and delays to the roadway users. On construction contracts, paint is applied with two coats: the first coat is 10 mils thick, followed by a second coat 15 mils thick. The disadvantage of using paint as a pavement marking material is its limited durability when subjected to traffic abrasion, sanding, or snowremoval activities. Specify paint only where it will have a durability that will provide a retroreflective stripe until maintenance crews can repaint the line and extend its usefulness until the next repainting. Paint is one of two material types dependent upon the solids carrier: solvent or water. The designer is encouraged to specify waterborne paint. Solvent paint is subject to a monetary penalty because it contains a high level of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). There is an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Clean Air Act penalty assessed on solvent paint that is passed on to those who purchase solvent paint in quantity. Durable waterborne paint or high-build waterborne paint is formulated to allow application thicknesses greater than 15 mils. It is more durable than standard waterborne paint and provides additional service life. The additional thickness permits the use of larger beads that enhance wet night retroreflectivity. Low-temperature waterborne paint is intended to extend the paint season later into the fall, although it may also be used earlier in the spring. The paint is formulated for application temperatures of 35° Fahrenheit and rising, though durability can be affected when applied during conditions where standard waterborne paint could have been used.
1030.03(2)(b) Plastic Plastic markings have a higher installation cost than paint. They can, however, be a more cost-effective measure than paint because of their longer service life. Plastic marking materials may provide a year-round retroreflective pavement marking, while paint may not last until the next restriping. Plastic marking materials currently listed in the Standard Specifications include the following:
i Type A: Liquid Hot Applied Thermoplastic Thermoplastic material consists of resins and filler materials in solid form at room temperature. The material is heated to a semiliquid, molten state (400° Fahrenheit) and is then applied to the roadway by spray or extrusion methods. This material can be used for both transverse and longitudinal line applications. Special equipment is required for both the initial application and subsequent maintenance renewal. Sprayed material can be applied at a thickness of 30 mils and dries in 30 to 60 seconds.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1030-4
Chapter 1030
Delineation
The durability of material applied in this manner is slightly longer than that of paint. Extruded material is applied at a thickness of 125 mils and has a drying time of 15 minutes. This material can be applied as a flat line or applied with ridges or profiles (bumps) that enhance wet night visibility. These profiles produce a rumble effect similar to raised pavement markers when a vehicle crosses over the marking. (Profiles come in the shape of a raised bar at set intervals and are formed simultaneously with the extruded baseline.)
ii Type B: Preformed Fused Thermoplastic This material consists of a mixture of pigment, fillers, resins, and beads that are factory produced in sheet form, 125 mils thick. The material is applied by heating (drying) the pavement and top heating the material. The heating process fuses the preformed thermoplastic material to the pavement surface. These materials, which are used for transverse markings, are available in white, red, blue, and other colors.
iii Type C: Cold Applied Preformed Tape Preformed tape is composed of thermoplastic or other materials that are fabricated under factory conditions. After curing, the material is cut to size and shipped to the work site in rolls or in flat pieces. The material is then applied to the roadway with an adhesive on the underside of the tape. Preformed tape is available in 60, 90, or 125 mils (WSDOT does not currently specify 125 mil tape.) The most durable application of preformed tape is achieved when the tape is either inlaid (rolled) into hot asphalt with the top of the tape flush with the surface of the pavement or placed in a groove cut into the pavement surface with the top of the tape slightly below the surface of the pavement. ASTM has classified preformed tape into two categories: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 tape has a profiled surface and a requirement to have a retroreflectivity of over 500 mcd/m2/lux. Type 1 tape has proven to be very durable. It is used on high-volume, high-speed highways. Type 2 tape has a flat surface and a requirement to have a retroreflectivity of over 250 mcd/ m2/lux. Field tests show that Type 2 tape has a shorter durability than Type 1 tape.
iv Type D: Liquid Cold Applied Methyl Methacrylate (MMA) Methyl methacrylate can be applied by either spraying or extrusion. Sprayed applications can be one or two coats, 30 to 45 mils thick. Extruded applications are 90 mils thick for asphalt concrete pavement or Portland cement concrete pavement, or 120 mils thick for open-graded asphalt pavement. MMA can also be extruded using specialized equipment to produce a textured line 150 mils thick. The material is not heated and can be applied within an approximate temperature range of 40° to 105° Fahrenheit, provided the pavement surface is dry. The material can be used for both transverse and longitudinal applications. The material can also be applied with profiles (bumps) that slightly enhance wet night retroreflectivity. The profiles also produce a rumble effect similar to raised pavement markers.
1030.03(2)(c) Beads Glass beads are small glass spheres used in highway markings to provide the necessary retroreflectivity. The beads are dropped onto the wet marking material immediately after it is applied (drop-on beads) or premixed into the wet marking material. Proper installation of glass beads is critical to achieving good pavement marking retroreflectivity. Each glass bead works like a light-focusing lens, reflecting light back to the driver. Glass beads are embedded into the pavement marking material; for optimum performance, the bead is embedded between 55% and 60% of its diameter. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1030-5
Chapter 1030
Delineation
Large glass and composite beads are effective when roads are wet. Large glass or composite beads are not appropriate for standard mil paint as the paint is too thin to properly embed the large glass or composite beads; therefore, WSDOT specifies small glass or composite beads for such paint applications. The use of large glass or composite beads is limited to high-build waterborne paint and other materials with a thickness of at least 22 mils.
1030.03(3) Pavement Marking Application Types There are five application types used for pavement markings. Most pavement marking applications are applied directly to the pavement surface. In steel bit snow plowing areas, the pavement markings may be inlaid or grooved to protect the markings. Because they are higher than the surrounding pavement surface, pavement markings are subject to rapid wear caused by traffic and snowplows. As they wear, they lose visibility and retroreflectivity, particularly in wet weather. Wear on the stripes can be greatly reduced and their durability considerably increased by placing them in a shallow groove in the surface of the pavement.
1030.03(3)(a) Application Types The five application types for pavement markings are:
i Flat Lines Flat lines are pavement marking lines with a flat surface.
ii Profiled Marking A profiled pavement marking consists of a baseline thickness and a profiled thickness, which is a portion of the pavement marking line that is applied at a greater thickness than the baseline thickness. Profiles are applied using the extruded method in the same application as the baseline. The profiles may be slightly rounded if the minimum profile thickness is provided for the entire length of the profile. (See the Standard Plans M-20.20 for the construction details.)
iii Embossed Plastic Line Embossed plastic lines consist of a flat line with transverse grooves. An embossed plastic line may also have profiles. (See the Standard Plans M-20.20 for the construction details.)
iv Inlaid Plastic Line Inlaid plastic line is constructed by rolling Type C tape into hot mix asphalt (HMA) with the finish roller. This application is used infrequently by WSDOT and is not in the Standard Specifications.
v Grooved Plastic Line Grooved plastic line is constructed by cutting a groove into the pavement surface and spraying, extruding, or gluing pavement marking material into the groove. The groove depth is dependent upon the material used, the pavement surface, and the location. The groove is typically in the range of 20 to 250 mils deep and 4 inches wide. Coordinate with the region Traffic Office on the use and dimensions of grooved plastic line marking.

1030.03(4) Raised Pavement Markers Raised pavement markers (RPMs) are installed as positioning guides with long line pavement markings. They can also be installed as a complete substitution for certain long line markings. RPMs have a durability of two years, and they provide good wet night visibility and a rumble effect. RPMs are made from plastic materials and are available in three different types:
•
•
•
Type 1 markers are 4 inches in diameter, ¾ inch high, and non-reflectorized. Type 2 markers are 4 inches wide, 4 inches long, ¾ inch high, and reflectorized. Type 3 markers are 6, 8, 10, or 12 inches wide, 4 inches long, ¾ inch high, and non-reflectorized.
Type 2 RPMs are not used as a substitute for right edge lines. They may be used to supplement the right edge line markings at lane reductions, at sections with reduced lane widths such as narrow structures, and at the gore of exit ramps. All other applications supplementing right edge line markings require the approval of the region Traffic Engineer. Red-backed RPMs are not desired and thus are only used at the discretion of the Region Traffic Engineer for specific locations. Research regarding their effectiveness for addressing wrong-way driving has been inconclusive to date. Type 3 RPMs are used in locations where additional emphasis is desired, including vehicle separations and islands. Obtain approval by the region Traffic Engineer for all installations of Type 3 RPMs. Retain approval in the Design Documentation Package. Reflectorized RPMs are not required for centerline and lane line applications in continuously illuminated sections of highway. However, if illumination policies (see Chapter 1040) affect a section of limited access roadway, coordinate with the region Traffic Engineer for RPM placement details. If reflectorized RPMs are used at an intersection within an illuminated section, they are also to be used throughout that section. For raised pavement marker application details, see the Standard Plans.
1030.03(5) Recessed Raised Pavement Markers Recessed raised pavement markers (RRPMs) are raised pavement markers (RPMs) installed in a groove ground into the pavement in accordance with the Standard Plans. RRPMs provide guidance similar to RPMs in ice chisel and steel blade snow-removal areas. RRPMs can also be used in rubber or Cooper-style blade snow-removal areas in accordance with region policy. Designers should be aware that the performance of RRPMs can be compromised, especially on curves, because the groove can block motorists’ view of the markers. Also, the groove for RRPMs installed on flat grades can fill with water during rain events and cause the RRPM to be non-reflective. RRPMs, when specified, are installed at the locations shown in the Standard Plans for Type 2W RPMs on multilane one-way roadways and Type 2YY RPMs on two-lane two-way roadways. Do not recess side-to-side RPMs on wide dotted lane lines. For recessed pavement marker application details, see the Standard Plans.

1030.04 Guideposts 1030.04(1) General Guideposts are retroreflective devices installed at the side of the roadway to indicate alignment. They are guidance devices rather than warning devices. Guideposts are used as an aid to nighttime driving primarily on horizontal curves; multilane divided highways; ramps; tangent sections where they can be justified due to snow, fog, or other reduced-visibility conditions; and at intersections without illumination.
1030.04(1)(a) Types of Guideposts The retroreflective device may be mounted on either a white or brown post. The types of guideposts and their application are as follows:
i Type W Type W guideposts have silver-white reflective sheeting, are facing traffic, and are used on the right side of divided highways, ramps, right-hand acceleration and deceleration lanes, intersections, and ramp terminals.
ii Type WW Type WW guideposts have silver-white reflective sheeting on both sides and are used on the outside of horizontal curves on two-way undivided highways.
iii Type Y Type Y guideposts have yellow reflective sheeting, are facing traffic, and are used on the left side of ramps, left-hand acceleration and deceleration lanes, ramp terminals, intersections on divided highways, median crossovers, and horizontal curves on divided highways.
iv Type YY Type YY guideposts have yellow reflective sheeting on both sides and are used in the median on divided highways.
v Type IC1 Type IC1 guideposts have silver-white reflective sheeting on both sides and an additional silver-white piece of reflective sheeting below the standard silver-white sheeting on the side facing traffic. They are used at intersections of undivided highways without illumination.
vi Type IC2 Type IC2 guideposts have silver-white reflective sheeting on both sides and an additional silver-white piece of reflective sheeting below the standard silver-white reflective sheeting on the back side. They are used at intersections of undivided highways without illumination.
1030.04(2) Placement and Spacing Guideposts are placed not less than 2 feet and not more than 8 feet outside the outer edge of the shoulder. Place guideposts at a constant distance from the edge of the roadway. When an obstruction intrudes into this space, position the guideposts to smoothly transition to the inside of the obstruction.

Delineation
Guideposts are not required along continuously illuminated divided or undivided highways. (See Exhibit 1030-2 for guidepost placement requirements and the Standard Plans for information on the different types and placement of guideposts.)
1030.05 Barrier Delineation Traffic barriers are delineated where guideposts are required, such as bridge approaches, ramps, and other locations on non-illuminated roadways (see Exhibit 1030-2). At these locations, the barrier delineation has the same spacing distance as guideposts or less if approved by the Region Traffic Engineer. Barrier delineation is also required when the traffic barrier is 4 feet or less from the traveled way. Use a delineator spacing of no more than 40 feet at these locations. For linear delineation panels, use no more than one unit per 12 foot 5 inch section of barrier unless the curve radius is less than 1,500 feet where two devices 12 foot 5 inch section of barrier can be used on the inside of the curve. The Region Traffic Engineer can approve an even tighter spacing where needed. Beam guardrail can be delineated by either mounting flexible guideposts behind the rail or by attaching shorter flexible guideposts to the wood guardrail posts. Concrete barrier can be delineated by placing linear or non-linear retroreflective devices on the face of the barrier about 6 inches down from the top. Consider mounting non-linear delineation devices on the top of the barrier at locations where mud or snow accumulates against the face of the barrier.
Example of linear delineation
1030.06 Object Markers Object markers are used to mark obstructions within or adjacent to the roadway. The MUTCD details three types of object markers. The Type 3 object marker with yellow and black sloping stripes is the most commonly used object marker. The MUTCD contains criteria for the use of object markers to mark objects in and/or adjacent to the roadway. Follow these criteria in project design. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1030-9
Chapter 1030
Delineation
The terminal ends of impact attenuators are delineated with modified Type 3 object markers. These are the impact attenuator markers in the Sign Fabrication Manual. When the impact attenuator is used in a roadside condition, the marker with diagonal stripes pointing downward toward the roadway is used. When the attenuator is used in a gore where traffic will pass on either side, the marker with chevron stripes is used. End of Roadway markers are similar to Type 1 object markers and are detailed in the MUTCD. They are used to alert users about the end of the roadway. Follow the MUTCD criteria in project design.

1040.01 General Illumination serves multiple functions along highways, in parking lots, and at other facilities, such as improving safety and enhancing security during hours of darkness. Lighting can highlight objects or locations that would not be illuminated by headlights, draw attention to a specific location or feature, or improve the visibility of approaching people or objects. Lighting design needs to balance the function of the lighting with its potential adverse effects, including light pollution and other environmental effects, energy consumption, maintenance impacts, and potentially less cautious user behavior. Lighting is not required to be addressed for WSDOT Q Program Low-Cost Enhancement projects (Q2/QE projects) unless the project is specifically to address lighting.

Chapter 1040
Illumination
1040.01(1) System Ownership and Management The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is generally responsible for illumination on state highways except within the limits of an incorporated city or town. Ownership and maintenance responsibility for highway lighting is defined by RCW 47.24.020, with clarification provided by WAC 468-18-050 (commonly referred to as the “City Streets as Part of State Highways Guidelines”). In unincorporated areas, WSDOT is responsible for all highway lighting. In incorporated areas, WSDOT is responsible for the lighting on limited access facilities (typically freeways and expressways) and interchanges, but not for local crossroads or nonlimited-access state highways. Local roadway lighting shall be designed to local agency standards and use local agency standard equipment such as luminaires and poles. For design and construction, the agency responsible for the construction project will provide the required illumination as part of the project, regardless of which agency will own any particular illumination system upon project completion. Systems shall be electrically separated by owning jurisdiction, starting from the electrical service cabinet and metering point. Two jurisdictions cannot jointly own, operate, and maintain separate parts of the same electrical system.
1040.01(1)(a) Conventional Roadways For the purposes of this Chapter, all state highways that are not freeways or expressways are considered Conventional Roadways. Lighting responsibility for conventional state highways depends on the type of access control. WSDOT is responsible for lighting the following types of state highways:
•
•
Any state highway outside of city limits. Any segment of state highway within city limits that is designated limited access. This does not include the cross street at a freeway interchange unless the cross street is still designated as limited access outside of the freeway limited access limits.
Cities are responsible for the lighting of state highways within city limits that are not designated limited access, including state highways that are cross-streets at freeway interchanges except those noted above. Refer to the WSDOT Highway Access Requests and Training web page to determine the access control level for any segment of state highway. Ownership of lighting for conventional (non-freeway) state highways may be different if a formal agreement is established between WSDOT and the local agency. Where WSDOT is responsible for lighting, provide basic lighting as required by the lighting design areas described in this chapter, with the lighting designed and constructed to WSDOT standards. If additional lighting is desired, the requesting local agency will need to take responsibility for any additional lighting beyond the basic required, at a minimum, and may choose to take responsibility for all lighting within the area of interest. WSDOT may agree to maintain colored (powder-coated) poles. If any other decorative pole features (arm style, base covers, etc.) or non-WSDOT-standard luminaires are desired, the agency requesting the decorative features must take responsibility for the lighting system.

Chapter 1040
Illumination
1040.01(1)(b) Freeways and Expressways WSDOT is responsible for the illumination of all freeways and their interchanges. At interchanges, WSDOT is responsible for the lighting of the ramp itself and the ramp intersection outside of cities, and the city is responsible for the lighting at the ramp intersection (see Exhibit 1040-1 and Exhibit 1040-2) inside cities. Where a ramp intersection is within city limits, but there is no additional city lighting in the area, WSDOT may take ownership of the ramp intersection lighting, particularly if the intersection includes a traffic signal. Exhibit 1040-1 Interchange Lighting Responsibility – Basic Interchange
Exhibit 1040-2 Interchange Lighting Responsibility – Complex Interchange
If a ramp is a continuation of a street (ramp becomes a street or street becomes a ramp, no intersection), then WSDOT’s responsibility for lighting stops at the WSDOT right-of-way line (see Exhibit 1040-3). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1040-3
Chapter 1040
Illumination
Exhibit 1040-3 Ramp to Street Transition Lighting Responsibility
Where a ramp terminal ends at a roundabout, and the cross street is within city limits, WSDOT responsibility for lighting stops at the end of each ramp where it meets the circulating roadway (see Exhibit 1040-5). When there is a right-turn slip lane for a corner of the roundabout, lighting of the right-turn slip lane is divided dependent on the type of right-turn slip lane:
•
•
If the right-turn slip lane stops near the edge of the circulating roadway (short slip lane), responsibility for lighting the right-turn slip lane falls under the same jurisdiction as the approach roadway that the right-turn slip lane is connected to. If the right-turn slip lane connects two approach roadways (long slip lane), responsibility for lighting the right-turn slip lane is split between the owners of the two connected approach roadways. The split point is approximately along a line from the center of the roundabout and perpendicular to the outside edge line of the right-turn slip lane.
For a roundabout ramp terminal in particular, it is expected that lighting from both WSDOT and City systems will be needed to meet required intersection light levels. The ownership limits shown in Exhibit 1040-5 are more applicable to which poles will belong to which agency, with the orientation of the luminaire arm and the roadway over which the luminaire is placed determining ownership of the luminaire (and related equipment). For example, poles along the ramp lanes would belong to WSDOT, even though some of the light output will contribute to the lighting of the circulating roadway if they are close enough to the intersection.

Exhibit 1040-4 Roundabout Ramp Terminal Street Lighting Responsibility
Where a local street goes over or under a freeway or expressway, the local agency (city or county) is responsible for any local street lighting – even when attached to a WSDOT owned structure (see Exhibit 1040-5). Structure mounted local agency lighting may be attached to traffic barrier (local street above freeway), suspended underneath the bridge, or attached to bridge pier columns or crossbeams.

1040.02 Conventional Roadways – Required Illumination Lighting for conventional roadways is typically focused around interaction areas such as intersections and pedestrian crossings. Local agency lighting design areas or pole placement standards may be different. For curved roadways, measurements for lighting design areas are always taken from the inside lane edge of a curve. Lighting design areas extend to the roadway edge line or face of curb unless otherwise noted here.
1040.02(1) Stop and Signal Controlled Intersections A minimum of two lights are required at all stop and signal-controlled highway intersections where any of the following are true:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
A left or right turn lane (channelization) is present on the highway The intersection has sidewalks and curb ramps The intersection has a marked crosswalk The intersection has a traffic signal The intersection has paired transit stops nearby – pedestrians will cross the roadway to reach the stop for the opposite direction. Applies only to the intersection that is part of the shortest path between opposing stops. The intersection has raised channelization or traffic barrier The intersection is on a divided highway
For intersections where none of these items are present, it may still be desirable to provide lighting as either a wayfinding device or in response to nighttime collisions where lighting may have a positive impact. This may be accomplished by requesting a single roadway luminaire be installed by a local electrical utility on a utility pole in the immediate vicinity of the intersection.

Lighting Design Area Lighting is required for the entirety of the intersection area, including paved shoulders, extending back to one of the following on each approach, in order of precedence (see Exhibit 1040-6): 1. To the stop line for the approach. 2. To 25 feet before the outside edge (edge away from intersection core) of the marked crosswalk. 3. To the leading end of the edge line radius return. Exhibit 1040-6 Basic Intersection Lighting Design Area
Where there is raised channelization, the lighting design area extends to 25 feet before the beginning of the raised channelization area. Where the raised channelization extends beyond the intersection channelization, or there is median traffic barrier, only the first 100 feet of the raised channelization or median barrier needs to be included (see Exhibit 1040-7). Paved shoulders do not need to be included outside the intersection core area. Exhibit 1040-7 Basic Intersection with Raised Channelization Lighting Design Area

Where there is a traffic island for a turning movement (see Section 1310.02(14)), the entire traffic island must be included. The lighting design area extends 25 feet in advance of the island (painted gore point) on the entry approach and extends 25 feet beyond where the right edge line meets the exit approach roadway edge line (see Exhibit 1040-8). Exhibit 1040-8 Basic Intersection with Traffic Island
1040.02(2) Roundabouts Roundabout lighting is dependent on the configuration of the roundabout. Roundabout lighting needs to address conflict areas, raised channelization, and pedestrian interaction points. A minimum of two lights are required for all roundabouts.
Lighting Design Areas Roundabout lighting covers the intersection core, not including the central island and central island truck apron (see Exhibit 1040-9), and out each approach. The area where lighting is required on the approach depends on the features of the approach. Light standards shall not be placed within 20 feet of the centerline of any crosswalk, if possible, to avoid placing lighting directly above a pedestrian (see Exhibit 1040-10 for an example pole/luminaire exclusion area).

For simple approaches, lighting is required to extend out to one of the following – whichever extends the design area farthest away from the intersection:
•
•
•
50 feet before the outside edge of the crosswalk 25 feet before the start of raised channelization (does not apply when raised channelization continues beyond the intersection area, such as continuous raised medians) 50 feet away from the edge of the circulating roadway
Exhibit 1040-11 Roundabout Approach Lighting Design Areas – Reverse Curves
For single direction approaches (entry only or exit only), the lighting design areas are the same as those required for simple approaches described above. For exit only approaches, the start of raised channelization is at the circulating roadway rather than at the end of the approach. Where a crosswalk is present, the lighting only needs to extend 25 feet beyond the outside edge of the crosswalk (see Exhibit 1040-12).

1040.02(3) Midblock Crossings Midblock crossings include any marked crossing not at an intersection, regardless of control type (such as uncontrolled, flashing beacon controlled, or traffic signal controlled). A minimum of two lights are required.
Lighting Design Areas (Exhibit 1040-13) Midblock crossings require lighting out to 50 feet in advance of the stop line for the crosswalk and 10 feet beyond the downstream edge of the crosswalk for each approach direction. Where any type of median is present, the full width of the median shall be illuminated out to the upstream limits for each approach direction. The lighting design area should be extended to the nose of the splitter island for islands specifically installed for the midblock crossing. Shoulders and sidewalks shall be included in the lighting design area. Lights shall be installed upstream of the crossing on each side of the roadway, such that there is positive lighting of any pedestrian in the crosswalk. Light standards shall not be placed within 20 feet of the centerline of any crosswalk, if possible, to avoid placing lighting directly above a pedestrian. Type III Signal Standards (mast arm with luminaire arm) should not be used for midblock crossing lighting since they are required to be downstream of the crosswalk.

1040.02(4) Railroad Crossings A minimum of two light standards are required for any railroad crossing where rail crossing warning lights or gates are operational. Lighting should be considered at any railroad crossing without rail crossing warning lights or signals and there is a high volume of nighttime rail activity, a known nighttime crash history involving any mode of transportation (rail, vehicle, bicycle, or pedestrian), or the crossing is blocked by trains for extended periods of time during hours of darkness.
Lighting Design Area (Exhibit 1040-7) Railroad crossings require lighting out to 50 feet in advance of the stop line for the approach for the full roadway width in both directions. For a one-way roadway, lighting may stop at the downstream rail dynamic envelope marking (10 feet beyond the center of the far rail, where no markings are provided). Shoulders and sidewalks shall be included in the lighting design area. Exhibit 1040-14 Railroad Crossing Lighting Design Areas
1040.02(5) Non-Freeway Weigh Sites Truck weighing and inspection sites (weigh stations) involve both slow moving large vehicles trying to maneuver and users on foot either inspecting vehicles or walking to and from the scale facility. To improve the safety of all users of the site, weigh sites are illuminated during hours of darkness when operational or open for nighttime truck parking.

Lighting is required for the entrance and exit ramps for the weigh station, and for the entirety of the weigh station itself. Entrances and exits shall be illuminated as required for freeway off-ramps and on-ramps as described in Section 1040.04(1). Where a weigh station serves both directions of traffic, the stop controlled entrances and exits shall be illuminated with design areas as shown in Section 1040.02(1) and ramp type entrances and exits shall be illuminated as shown for on-ramp areas at both ends. The remainder of the weigh station shall be illuminated from the end of the entrance area to the start of the exit area, using a minimum of two lights, and include any parking areas (see Exhibit 1040-15).

1040.03 Conventional Roadways – Additional Illumination Lighting of the following locations may be appropriate or required under certain conditions, such as utilization or collision history. Where collision history is used for justification of a lighting system, all the following must be true:
•
•
•
During the last five full calendar years, the site has experienced nighttime collisions that are correctable with illumination. The benefit-cost analysis for the proposed illumination exceeds 1. Alternative lower-cost countermeasures have been evaluated and did not address the particular nighttime collision history issue.
Nighttime collisions are defined as collisions occurring between one-half hour after sunset and one-half hour before sunrise. Correctible nighttime collisions are collisions that:
•
•
•
Meet the nighttime definition of this chapter Have contributing factors related to a lack of lighting Where lighting, if installed, would directly address the contributing factors to the collisions
Collision reporting forms and the collision data are not sufficient to distinguish between daytime and nighttime conditions; the collision location, reported time, and hours of darkness for the date of the collision are also needed to determine which collisions are nighttime collisions. Additionally, for sites where the number of nighttime collisions is equal to or greater than the number of daytime collisions, the above-mentioned collision and benefit-cost ratio analysis should be performed. For locations where nighttime vehicle-pedestrian collisions occur, the type of collision and the pedestrian utilization needs to be considered. A location where a pedestrian is not normally expected to be present or crossing a roadway may not be correctable with lighting, while a location with regular nighttime pedestrian activity such as an unmarked crosswalk may be an appropriate location for lighting.
1040.03(1) Transit Stops Lighting of a transit stop depends on the type of stop and facilities provided. Transit stops with a dedicated bus pullout lane, serving a large number of routes, or serving as a transfer point should be illuminated. Transit stops with shelters should be considered for illumination as a shelter typically indicates heavier use. Smaller transit stops may be appropriate to illuminate when there is significant use. Lighting of transit stops is the responsibility of the transit agency. Early engagement with the transit agency is required to determine funding, maintenance, and operation of the lighting system. It is recommended that a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) be established with each transit agency across their entire system, rather than location by location negotiations. Normally, two lights shall be provided for transit stops with a dedicated bus pullout. Where a bus is required to stop in the travel lane, a single light may be provided at the loading area. Where a transit agency is unable or unwilling to participate in funding and maintenance of transit stop lighting, and there is no other adjacent or overlapping lighting system (such as for an intersection), consider requesting a utility owned and maintained light installed on a nearby utility pole for minimum utility lighting of the transit stop.

Lighting Design Area For all transit stop types, an overlapping area shall be evaluated on the sidewalk or shoulder at the loading area for the front 20 feet of the bus. This smaller area has a higher light level requirement to accommodate loading and unloading of passengers. For transit stops with a dedicated bus pullout, lighting shall extend for the full length of the full-width pullout lane and include the adjacent lane and sidewalk (see Exhibit 1040-16). Exhibit 1040-16 Pullout Transit Stop Lighting Design Areas
For transit stops in a dedicated bus lane, lighting shall cover the lane for 60 feet (single bus stop) or 120 feet (articulated or two bus stop) as measured from the head of the stop (usually where the route sign is located) and include the adjacent lane and sidewalk (see Exhibit 1040-17). Exhibit 1040-17 In-Lane Transit Stop Lighting Design Areas
For rural or limited service transit stops where only one light will be provided (does not apply to utility provided lighting), lighting is only required for the loading area – extend to include any waiting area or pad (see Exhibit 1040-18).

1040.03(2) Continuous Lighting Continuous lighting is the illumination of the entirety of the roadway outside of required lighting design areas, usually connecting multiple lighting design areas together. WSDOT does not provide continuous lighting of conventional highways. Continuous lighting may be desirable in areas with regular nighttime pedestrian or other non-motorized use, such as commercial areas, residential areas, or connections between the two. Where continuous lighting is desired by the local agency, the local agency is required to take ownership of the additional lighting beyond any required lighting required unless an agreement is established with WSDOT. Continuous lighting shall be installed at the back of sidewalk to ensure adequate sidewalk lighting and minimize off-roadway light pollution. Continuous lighting areas are evaluated separately from required lighting areas, such that the lighting analysis areas overlap when being evaluated.
1040.04 Freeways and Expressways Lighting for freeways and expressways focuses primarily on decision points, conflict points, and unusual highway features that may not be adequately illuminated by headlights. For curved roadways, measurements for lighting design areas are always taken from the inside lane edge of a curve. Lighting design areas extend to the roadway edge line unless otherwise described here.
1040.04(1) Interchanges Lighting is required for the following locations at all interchanges:
•
•
•
•
Where an off-ramp departs the freeway Where an on-ramp connects to the freeway Ramp terminal intersections Loop ramps
A minimum of two lights are required for each lighting design area, with the exception of ramp terminal intersections where none of the items listed in Section 1040.02(1) are listed are present, in which case only one light needs to be provided.

Exhibit 1040-19 Single Lane Off-Ramp Lighting Design Area
Where a multi-lane off-ramp departs the freeway, lighting is required for 400 feet. The area starts 200 feet in advance of the painted gore point and continues 200 feet beyond this point as measured along the mainline freeway, including all off-ramp lanes and the two adjacent freeway lanes (see Exhibit 1040-20). Exhibit 1040-20 Multi-Lane Off-Ramp Lighting Design Area
Lighting design areas for off-ramps may be shifted up to 100 feet downstream, provided that the shifted design area starts at least 100 feet in advance of the physical gore point or impact attenuator (see Exhibit 1040-21). The design area may only be shifted to avoid light foundation obstructions or to avoid the need to add new light poles to existing bridges.

This length is measured along the mainline freeway, and the area includes the two adjacent continuing freeway lanes. Exhibit 1040-22 Single Lane On-Ramp Merge Lighting Design Area
Where an on-ramp (one or more lanes) connects to a freeway as additional lanes (add lanes), lighting is required for 200 feet starting from the start of the new lane (end of ramp wide line) (see Exhibit 1040-23). This length is measured along the mainline freeway, and the area includes the two adjacent continuing freeway lanes.

Lighting design areas for on-ramps may be shifted up to 100 feet downstream. The design area may only be shifted to avoid light foundation obstructions or to avoid the need to add new light poles to existing bridges.
1040.04(1)(c) Metered On-Ramps On-ramps with ramp meters require lighting of all lanes, including any HOV lanes or shoulders used as lanes during metering, from 150 feet before to 50 feet after the stop line for the ramp meter (see Exhibit 1040-25). Lighting is also required for any lane merges for general purpose lanes, HOV lanes, and HOV shoulders (metered or unmetered) as shown in Exhibit 1040-24.

1040.04(1)(e) Ramp Terminals Ramp terminals are where the freeway ramp connects to the secondary roadway. This secondary roadway may be a local roadway, a state highway, or another freeway. The ramp terminal lighting design area will depend on the type of connection. Ramp terminal intersections shall follow the requirements for intersections defined for Stop or Signal Controlled Intersections (Section 1040.02(1)) or Roundabouts (Section 1040.02(2)). Stop controlled ramp terminal intersections may use a single luminaire if none of the items listed in Section 1040.02(1) are present. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

1040.04(3) Special Use Lane Access Zones Certain freeway lanes may be designated for special use, such as High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes, or Express Toll Lanes (ETL). As part of these lane use designations, there may be limited zones for exit from and entry to these lanes. A minimum of two lights are required for each lighting design area. Where a special use lane is separated by a barrier or barrier line (extra wide line our double wide lane line), and the access zone is provided by changing the barrier line to a standard lane line (basic access zone), lighting is required for the first 200 feet after the line changes to a lane line, and for 200 feet before and 50 feet after the barrier or barrier line is restored (see Exhibit 1040-30). The design area includes the special use lane and the two adjacent freeway general purpose lanes. Exhibit 1040-30 Special Use Lane – Basic Access Zone Lighting Design Area
Where the special use lane is separated by barrier, and an access zone is provided by using a dedicated weaving transition lane, lighting is required at the start and the end of the access zone. The lighting area covers all of the special use lanes and the two adjacent general-purpose lanes. The area at the start of the access zone starts 200 feet before the start of the weave lane and extends to 200 feet after the start of the weave lane (see Exhibit 1040-31). The area at the end of the access zone starts 200 feet before the end of the weave lane and ends 200 feet after the merging weave lane reduces to 10 feet in width (see Exhibit 1040-32).

1040.04(4) Freeway Transit Stations Freeway transit stations consist of an off-ramp, a conventional roadway transit stop, and an on-ramp. On and off-ramp lighting shall be in accordance with Section 1040.04(1). Transit stop lighting is required and shall be in accordance with Section 1040.03(1) covering the entire length of the loading area curb and sidewalk using a minimum of two lights.
1040.04(5) Safety Rest Areas On and off-ramps for safety rest areas require lighting in accordance with Section 1040.04(1). Within the rest area, there are four types of areas that require lighting:
•
•
•
•
Lane merge and diverge points, connecting to the different parking areas (usually separated into cars and large trucks) Parking areas Pedestrian walkways Recreational Vehicle (RV) sanitary disposal facilities

Lighting coverage for each of these areas is as follows (see Exhibit 1040-33):
•
•
•
•
Merge and diverge areas from 50 feet before to after the merge or diverge point (minimum 100 feet total). Parking areas for the full area of each parking area, from the entry lane connection to the exit lane connection, including sidewalks. Where parking areas are divided into separate sections and connected with a single lane, lighting is not required for the connecting single lane. Each pedestrian walkway connecting the services buildings to the parking lots. Each lane for RV sanitary disposal facilities, from 25 feet before the start of the station pad to 25 feet beyond the end of the station pad. Where there are multiple pads, such as if there is a separate water station, the area starts before the first pad and ends after the last pad.
Parking areas and RV sanitary disposal facilities shall use a minimum of two lights. Interior merge and diverge areas may use a single light if light levels can be met.

1040.04(6) Chain-Up and Chain-off Areas Chain-up and chain-off (chaining) areas present a unique situation on a freeway where drivers are expected to be out of their vehicles and walking around while other vehicles are moving. Providing lighting both to highlight users on foot and to provide visibility for Exhibit 1040-34 the installation or removal of chains is particularly important. Lighting may be omitted if power is not available within one-half mile of either end of the chaining area. Lighting is required from the start of the chaining area shoulder widening taper to the end of the chaining area shoulder narrowing taper and shall include the two adjacent freeway lanes (see Exhibit 1040-34). Lighting is required on both the left and right side of the freeway to help illuminate users on foot, using a minimum of two lights on each side of the freeway (a minimum of four total). Lighting shall only be operational when chains are required for any vehicle type. Exhibit 1040-34 Chain-Up and Chain-Off Area Lighting Design Area
1040.04(7) Freeway Weigh Sites Truck weighing and inspection sites (weigh stations) involve both slow moving large vehicles trying to maneuver and users on foot either inspecting vehicles or walking to and from the scale facility. To improve the safety of all users of the site, weigh sites are illuminated during hours of darkness when operational or open for nighttime truck parking. There are two basic types of weigh sites – standard and Port of Entry. Standard weigh sites include one or two scales and truck parking. Ports of Entry also include additional inspection buildings and usually a larger scale building. Lighting is required for the entirety of the weigh station paved areas, starting from 50 feet before the first internal diverge point to 50 feet beyond the last merge point, and all paved areas in between including the scale area, truck parking area, officer parking area, inspection building access, and all connecting roadways and walkways (see Exhibit 1040-35). On and off-ramp connections to the weigh station shall include illumination in accordance with Section 1040.04(1).

1040.04(8) Lane Splits Lane splits are locations where same direction lanes split around an obstruction or onto different alignments. These could be general purpose lanes splitting around an obstruction, or a special use lane (such as an HOV lane) splitting from the general-purpose lanes. Lighting is required where the lanes split and where the lanes come back together (see Exhibit 1040-36), with a minimum of two lights required for each area, covering all lanes of traffic to the right of the split and at least two lanes to the left of the split. Lighting at the split point starts 100 feet before the painted diverge point and extends to 50 feet beyond the start of the obstruction or traffic barrier (such as concrete barrier, guardrail, or similar protective barrier). Lighting at the merge point starts 100 feet before the painted merge point and extends 200 feet beyond the painted merge point. Exhibit 1040-36 Lane Split Lighting Design Area
1040.04(9) Continuous Lighting Freeway continuous lighting is limited to areas designated by the WSDOT HQ Traffic Office. Continuous lighting is typically limited to urban core areas with significant interchange density and weaving movements. Continuous lighting of open freeways away from interchanges provides minimal benefits, increases energy use and light pollution, increases maintenance and operations costs, and can encourage riskier driver behavior such as speeding during low volume nighttime hours. Where continuous lighting is installed, lighting shall be split into separate circuits for minimum required lighting and all additional lighting. This allows for any lighting not required to cover a basic design area to be controlled separately as part of operational and energy use management. Direction specific continuous lighting may be appropriate in areas where significant weaving between on and off-ramps occurs in one direction of the freeway. The lighting design area for this application extends from the start of the upstream on-ramp lighting design area to the end of the downstream off-ramp lighting design area and includes the entirety of the two right-most freeway lanes, as well as any auxiliary (add-drop) lanes. This limited application of continuous lighting is not considered general continuous illumination, and only requires approval from the Region Traffic Engineer.

1040.05 Bridges and Tunnels Bridges and tunnels have special lighting considerations due to the complex nature of the structure and impacts of the structure regarding both daytime and nighttime visibility.
1040.05(1) Bridge Lighting Bridges do not specifically require lighting by themselves. The need for lighting on a bridge is determined by the presence of another lighting design area. If any of the lighting design areas described in this chapter are present on or under a bridge, then lighting for that area may be attached to the bridge. Decorative illumination such as lighting of architectural features of a bridge structure requires the approval of the State Traffic Engineer. Decorative lighting may not include light sources that are visible to drivers (drivers can see the bulb or LED source itself), lighting that is cast above horizontal (night sky light pollution), or lighting that is cast off the structure (environmental light pollution).
1040.05(2) Bridge Inspection Lighting and Receptacles Bridges where the interior of the structure is accessible, such as floating bridges or box girders, require inspection lighting and receptacles for use by inspection and maintenance staff. Lighting and receptacles shall be powered from separate circuits. Receptacles shall use two-gang boxes with two 20A duplex GFCI receptacles, where each duplex receptacle is powered from a separate circuit. There shall be no less than three circuits in use for bridge inspection lighting and receptacles. See Exhibit 1040-37 for typical lighting and receptacle circuit arrangements. Exhibit 1040-37 Bridge Inspection Lighting and Receptacle Circuit Layout
Bridge inspection lighting shall be ceiling mounted and uses vapor-tight bulb enclosures. Bulbs are LED type A19 bulbs with E26/Medium sockets. Bulbs have an output of 1600-2000 lumens (100W equivalent), and a color temperature of 4000K or higher. Each girder shall be supplied by two lighting circuits such that every other light is on a separate circuit. Bridge inspection lighting does not need to be analyzed for a target light level as it uses a set spacing arrangement instead. Lights are evenly spaced within each girder section as separated by diaphragms, with the end lights of each girder section no more than 12.5 feet from the ends of the girder section (pier centerline) as measured perpendicular from the diaphragm face. For steel box girder bridges, lights are spaced at either 25foot centers or four times the web depth, whichever is shorter. For concrete box girder bridges, lights are spaced at either 50-foot centers or eight times the web depth, whichever is shorter. Receptacles shall be evenly spaced within each girder section, spaced at 50-foot centers for all girder types, and no more than 25 feet from the ends of the girder section (pier centerline). See Exhibit 1040-37 for typical spacing arrangements. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Exhibit 1040-38 Bridge Inspection Lighting and Receptacle Layout
Lighting shall be operable from any external access point to the girders, with switches located adjacent to the access point. If there are only two access points, then a three-way light switch is required at each access point and the switches may be integrated into the lighting circuit. If there are three or more access points, such as with an intermediate access point or multiple girders are accessed from common access points, then two threeway and one or more four-way switches are required, and these switches shall operate a lighting contactor for the lighting circuit. Circuits with four-way switches cannot have the switches installed in-line with the rest of the lighting circuit. See Exhibit 1040-39 for lighting circuit design examples.

1040.05(3) Tunnels, Lids, and Underpasses For the purposes of this chapter, a tunnel is defined as any structure that restricts the normal daytime illumination of a roadway such that driver visibility is substantially diminished. This includes tunnels, highway lids, and roadways under bridges where the structure over the roadway is covered for more than 80 feet. Where tunnel lighting is required, tunnel lighting shall be designed in accordance with ANSI/IES RP-8-18. Short tunnels are tunnels where the exit portal is visible from the entrance portal, and the tunnel length is less than or equal to the design stopping sight distance as defined in Chapter 1260. Some short tunnels may not require daytime lighting, depending on tunnel characteristics and the requirements of ANSI/IES RP-8-18. Where daytime lighting is not required, nighttime lighting is also not required unless it is part of another required design area or within a designated continuous lighting area. Short tunnels in urban areas where a non-state highway roadway passes through the tunnel may require lighting by the local agency, even if not required by ANSI/IES RP-8-18. Consult with the local agency for tunnel lighting requirements for local roadways.

1040.05(3)(a) Daytime Light Levels for Tunnels Tunnels long enough to warrant daytime lighting present a difficult situation for users. Without daytime tunnel lighting, users would be required to have their eyes adjust from a high light level (daylight) to a much lower light level (near darkness) within the tunnel very quickly. Where users’ eyes cannot adjust fast enough, they may not be able to see a hazard or obstruction in front of them in time to avoid a collision and may slow down significantly because they cannot see far enough ahead. Transitional lighting allows for a more gradual adjustment and can minimize the “black hole” effect of a rapid transition from a bright space to a dark space, reducing the risk of a collision and the likelihood of users to slow down upon entering a tunnel. Depending on the length and direction of the tunnel, the opposite condition may be true for exiting the tunnel resulting in daylight blindness at the exit. ANSI/IES RP-8-18 provides detailed lighting requirements for tunnels. In support of those requirements:
•
•
•
•
•
•
All tunnel lighting designs are required to be reviewed and approved by the State Traffic Engineer. Long tunnels are divided into zones in accordance with ANSI/IES RP-8-18, using the calculations methods described there. Long tunnel lighting designs are required to use the Lseq (Equivalent Veiling Luminance) calculation method. Lseq values obtained from this calculation shall be used to adjust the Suggested Daytime Maintained Average Pavement Luminance Levels where indicated. Lighting analysis shall include the required portions of the tunnel walls. Additional lighting is required outside the tunnel on the roadway approaching and exiting the tunnel. This area shall be illuminated at night for a distance no less than the stopping sight distance as defined in Chapter 1260. The light levels for these areas shall be no less than one third of the tunnel interior nighttime light level. Fire protection and safety equipment, such as fire alarm pull stations, phones, and emergency exits, shall be illuminated (see NFPA 502 for additional information).
1040.06 Work Zone and Construction Lighting Lighting is required within Work Zones and construction areas, both to illuminate standard lighting design areas and unusual conditions or features within the project limits. Lighting of existing required design areas is required to be maintained operational at all times. This may require temporary (timber) light poles in place of permanent equipment. If a new or temporary required design area is created as part of the project, such as a temporary ramp relocation or a new temporary intersection, lighting shall be provided for the new or temporary lighting design area as required for a permanent location in accordance with this Chapter. This includes traffic splits around obstructions, even if they are on non-freeway roadways.
1040.06(1) Roadways Constrained by Barrier Where the roadway will have barrier protection (guardrail or concrete barrier) along the roadway shoulder, temporary lighting is required if any of the following conditions apply:
•
•
The distance from the edge of the active lane to the roadside edge of the attenuator is less than 4 feet and the roadway has a posted speed of 45 MPH or higher, is a freeway on-ramp, or is within the first 500 feet from the gore nose (see Exhibit 1360-13) of an off-ramp. The distance from the edge of the active lane to the roadside edge of the attenuator is less than 2 feet and the roadway has a posted speed of 30 MPH to 40 MPH (inclusive).

Where none of these conditions apply, lighting for the barrier protected section of roadway is not required if reflective barrier mounted delineators are provided for the entire length of the barrier. Where temporary lighting for barrier protection is required, the roadway shall be illuminated for a 200-foot distance starting from 100 feet before the start of the barrier to 100 feet after the start of the barrier. Where barrier is present on both sides of the roadway, such that barrier on the left side of the roadway is within clear zone of the leftmost side of any lanes in that direction of travel, lighting of the start of this barrier is also required. See Exhibit 1040-40 for basic barrier constrained roadway lighting requirements. For multilane roadways, at a minimum the two lanes adjacent to the barrier must be illuminated.
Exhibit 1040-40 Barrier Constrained Roadway Lighting Design Areas
1040.06(2) Two-Way One-Lane Signal Controlled Roadways For two-way, one lane traffic control using a temporary or portable signal system, lighting is required from 50 feet before the stop line for the temporary traffic signal to a point 25 feet beyond the temporary signal displays. Lighting is required at each end of the signal system. Where there is an intermediate signal-controlled access point to the one lane section, such as a cross-street or commercial driveway, at least one 200W class light is required at the stop line for the cross-street. An additional 200W class light shall be provided at the intersection. The same light can be used for both locations if the stop line for the cross-street is no more than 75 feet from the edge line of the main roadway. See Exhibit 1040-41.

1040.06(3) Other Temporary Lighting Conditions Flagging stations are normally illuminated by temporary light plants. Flagging station lighting can be provided by other required temporary lighting, if the flagging station is within a required lighting design area, or by a single 250W class luminaire installed at a 30-foot mounting height and 20 feet in advance of the flagging station. Temporary lighting should be considered for other non-standard or unexpected roadway conditions, such as substandard lane widths, corners, lane shifts, or vertical alignment changes. Where high-mast temporary lighting is used, it is generally beneficial to try and illuminate as much of the work area as possible along with any required lighting design areas. For freeway applications with multiple stages of traffic control where required design areas may shift multiple times, it may be preferable to illuminate the entirety of the potential roadway limits to allow for required design areas to move multiple times without having to add, remove, or relocate lighting to ensure that required areas remain covered in all stages.
1040.07 Parking Lots Parking lots are illuminated to support both user safety and security. Parking lots involve significant interaction between multiple modes of travel, such as vehicles and pedestrians, and present unique challenges in relation to potential criminal activity. Parking lots are divided into two classifications: major and minor. Major parking lots are locations with usage exceeding 50 vehicles during hours of darkness, such as larger park and ride lots. Lighting for major parking lots covers the entirety of the lot, including all parking stalls and interior sidewalks and walkways (see Exhibit 1040-42). Transit stop areas shall be illuminated in accordance with Section 1040.04(4). Lighting for the parking lot shall be designed to allow for the overall light level to be reduced to approximately 25% of required light levels during hours of darkness outside of normal usage, such as from one-half hour after the last bus of the evening to onehalf hour before the first bus of the following morning. This lighting reduction shall be accomplished through the selective shut off of lights around the parking lot, through the use of separated circuits, to simplify circuit design and operation.

Minor parking lots are the remaining parking lots with significantly less general use. Lighting for minor parking lots is only required to cover the entrance and exit areas of the parking lot but should also cover as much of the lot as possible (see Exhibit 1040-43). Lighting of the entire parking lot may be desirable for safety or security purposes and will often not significantly increase the size of the lighting system.

1040.08 Pedestrian Facility Lighting Lighting provided specifically for pedestrian type modes of transportation (walking and rolling) is dependent on the type and features of the facility. Lighting of sidewalks and shoulders is required for any location listed in Section 1040.02, with the exception of weigh sites. The required design area shall be expanded to include the full width of the adjacent sidewalk, or the full width of the roadway shoulder where sidewalk is not present. Where lighting is provided in accordance with Section 1040.03(2), include the full width of the sidewalk or shoulder in the lighting design area. Separate pedestrian level light poles (standards) may be required or requested by a local agency requesting continuous lighting of a non-freeway state highway. WSDOT does not provide illumination for separated pedestrian facilities such as isolated sidewalks or shared use paths with the exception of specific tunnels. If illumination of a separated pedestrian facility is desired, a local agency must be engaged to take responsibility for the pedestrian level lighting system. Dedicated pedestrian facilities adjacent to state highways, such as shared use paths along freeways, may be illuminated by roadway lighting. Where a shared use path is on a bridge that does not have roadway lighting, approved embedded concrete barrier lighting may be used. Tunnels specifically for shared use paths shall use flush ceiling mounted luminaires with vandal resistant and other protective features to minimize the risk of damage to the fixtures or any part of the supporting electrical system. Additional protective measures are necessary for isolated pedestrian facility lighting, as these areas are more susceptible to vandalism and wire theft.

Chapter 1040
Illumination
1040.09 Adjacent Lighting Areas In some cases, multiple required lighting design areas may be close together but not touching or overlapping. If these areas are addressed independently, they create a light-dark-light transition that makes it difficult for users’ eyes to adjust back and forth quickly, with the dark section between the two light areas being hardest to see in. This is aggravated by traveling speed and the increased brightness of LED luminaires. Where two lighting design areas are within 500 feet of each other, the two lighting design areas shall be combined into a single area. If different light levels are required for the merged areas, the higher light levels shall be used. This may result in multiple lighting design areas combined into a single large analysis area. In general, a gap of up to 500 feet between lighting design areas is usually able to be covered by no more than two additional lights.
1040.10 Light Level Criteria Light levels vary slightly with the type of highway, the functional classification of the highway, development of the adjacent area, and nighttime levels of vehicle and pedestrian activity. Light level activity classifications fall into three categories:
•
•
•
High Activity. These are areas where more than 100 pedestrian crossings occur over a one-hour period during hours of darkness at any time of the year. These are typically urban core retail or event areas such as shopping districts, stadiums, concert venues, major transit centers, and their associated parking areas. This classification corresponds with ANSI/IES RP-8-18 High Pedestrian Conflict Areas. Medium Activity. These are areas where 11 to 100 pedestrian crossings occur over a one-hour period during hours of darkness at any time of the year. Most basic urban and suburban areas with less dense commercial districts fall into this category. This category is the default standard unless justification can be provided for using the High or Low Activity classifications. This classification corresponds with ANSI/IES RP-8-18 Medium Pedestrian Conflict Areas. Low Activity. These areas are where 10 or fewer pedestrian crossings occur over a one-hour period during hours of darkness at any time of the year. These are typically low density suburban or rural areas with low housing density, little retail activity, or farms. This classification corresponds with ANSI/IES RP8-18 Low Pedestrian Conflict Areas. Lighting design areas with sidewalks or marked crosswalks cannot be classified as Low Activity Areas.
Four light levels are measured for each design area:
•
•
•
•
Minimum light level, in footcandles (fc). For any lighting design area, no point within the calculation area may be less than 0.2 footcandles (fc). Minimum average light level, in fc. This is the average light level over the entirety of the design area. Uniformity ratio (no units). This is how even the light levels are over the entirety of the design area and is calculated by dividing the average light level by the minimum light level. Uniformity ratio requirements only apply to locations with more than one light. Maximum veiling luminance ratio (no units). This is a measurement of disability glare resulting from the lighting system and is calculated by dividing the maximum veiling luminance by the average luminance. Veiling luminance calculations are only required in locations that are tangent for at least 322 feet and have little to no change in grade and can only be calculated for points starting 272 feet after the start of the tangent section. Veiling luminance is not calculated on sidewalks or roadway shoulders.

Illumination
Requirements for minimum average light levels, uniformity ratios, and maximum veiling luminance ratios are dependent on the roadway type and activity classification and are provided in Exhibit 1040-44 through Exhibit 1040-46. Crosswalks at roundabouts and midblock crossings (without intersection lighting) shall also have a vertical average light level of 0.9 footcandles (fc) at a height of 5 ft above the roadway, evaluated at 1.5 ft intervals and oriented relative to oncoming traffic for each lane.

Light levels for local agencies shall be in accordance with local agency requirements. Some local agencies do not use lighting analysis but instead use a set spacing criterion. Confirm placement and light level requirements with the local agency. Where the local agency does not have light level or spacing requirements, WSDOT light level requirements are used. Guidance for conducting light level analysis is available from https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineeringstandards/design-topics/traffic-illumination-traffic-signals-and-intelligent-transportation-systems-its
1040.11 Basic System Design When working on an existing illumination system, address items based on the following:
•
•
•
•
•
Existing wiring that is not being affected by the work can remain. Additional circuits may be affected beyond those for the circuit where work is planned in cases where there is a conduit failure or wiring needs to be removed and reinstalled. Grounding and bonding must be addressed from the equipment being worked on back to the service cabinet. Any junction boxes within the project limits that are part of a system included in the contract work must be replaced if they do not have locking lids as shown in the Standard Plans and defined in the Standard Specifications, and if they have locking lids but are damaged or are no longer able to be secured. ADA projects require replacement of all junction boxes in sidewalks with new boxes with slip-resistant lids and frames. Poles and foundations only need to be addressed if the pole is included in the work, or the required grading is not present for a slip-base luminaire. Luminaires only need to be addressed where poles are being relocated or if they are contributing to a project lighting design area.

Illumination
Service cabinets within the project limits that are part of a system being worked on are required to be replaced if they do not meet current standards as shown in the Standard Plans and defined in the Standard Specifications. Service cabinets that meet these requirements are not required to be replaced unless they require modifications that cannot be supported by the existing service cabinet (such as not enough room for additional circuits).
New system construction is usually simple and straight-forward. New construction still requires coordination with other design disciplines to manage systems in near proximity that are in the ground, as well as tracking any changes to roadway geometrics which may affect design area locations. Additional widening is required to support slip-bases for light standards and must be included in any roadway section plans. Early and regular coordination with drainage, earthwork, roadway design, work zone traffic control, among others, is critical to development of a buildable and maintainable system. Modifications of existing systems are more complex. Any existing system that is worked on is required to be updated to current system design and NEC requirements. This may require modifications such as adding ground wires to conduits, replacing junction boxes and/or conduits, modifying light standard foundations and grading to support proper slip base function, or replacing wiring and splices. The following items need to be addressed when working on an existing system:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Bring existing circuits into compliance with current NEC. Bring materials into compliance with current material standards. Bring service cabinets up to current standards. Replace existing junction that do not meet current standards, including thicker bolt-down lids. Boxes in sidewalks must have slip-resistant surfacing to be compliant. Replace conductors that are no longer in serviceable condition. Bring grounding and bonding system up to current standards, including adding ground conductors where missing, bonding junction box lids, etc. Replace conduits where conduits have failed (existing conductors will not move) or are too small to support necessary system updates (adding new wires). Update light standard foundations and grading to current standards for slip-base luminaires, to support proper breakaway function. Replace non-standard foundations, anchor bolt sizes, and anchor bolt patterns (ex: 4-bolt ground installations) with foundations and anchor bolt arrangements meeting current standards. Replace light standards not meeting current pole standards, such as 4-bolt bases, aluminum poles, or poles with overbrace or underbrace supported arms. Replace non-LED luminaires with LED luminaires meeting current standards.
When working on an existing illumination system, address items based on the following:

Existing wiring that is not being affected by the work can remain. Additional circuits may be affected beyond those for the circuit where work is planned in cases where there is a conduit failure or wiring needs to be removed and reinstalled. Grounding and bonding only needs to be addressed from the equipment being worked on back to the service cabinet. Only junction boxes where work is being performed within (new conduit and/or wiring) need to be replaced unless the project includes ADA work. ADA projects require replacement of all junction boxes in sidewalks with new boxes with slip-resistant lids and frames.

Illumination
Poles and foundations only need to be addressed if the pole is included in the work, or the required grading is not present for a slip-base luminaire. Luminaires only need to be addressed where poles are being relocated or if they are contributing to a project lighting design area. Service cabinets are only required to be replaced when being modified new equipment is being installed (such as new wiring, new conduit, new circuit/breaker, etc.), as directed by the Region Signal Maintenance Manager. Older service cabinets do not have full coverage dead front panels and do not meet current safety requirements.
Coordinate with HQ and Region illumination design and maintenance staff starting with project scoping to ensure that the project is addressing any deficiencies in affected equipment and the project can support the necessary work. Lighting design areas are required to be illuminated at all times, even during a project, unless a shutdown has been approved for modification or final removal of an existing system.
1040.11(1) Light Standards Light standards are the poles that support luminaires above the roadway. For new construction, WSDOT only uses Type 1 davit arm light standards as shown in Standard Plan J-28.10. WSDOT does not use any decorative pole types for new construction but may use poles powder-coated in a corridor specific color or when located within National Forests or similar natural areas. Existing non-standard poles may remain in service until their end of useful life. High-mast lighting using high-mast type poles shall not be used for new construction. High-mast systems place poles in locations that are inaccessible to maintenance, require significantly more resources to operate and maintain, require barrier protection, and in many cases cast half or more of their light off the roadway where it affects locations like natural areas and private residences. Existing high-mast lighting may remain in service until their end of useful life but may not be relocated or replaced. Where the roadway geometry is changing such that the high-mast lighting is not covering a required design area, it shall be replaced with conventional light standards. Light standards may be incorporated into signal standards for traffic signals and ramp meters (Type III signal standards). Where a Type III signal standard is used for a ramp meter, the light must be powered from the same direct source – service cabinet or transformer cabinet – as the ramp meter signals, such that the entire signal standard can be shut off from the same breaker panel. Slip bases are always required unless a fixed base is justified as described in Chapter 1610. Light standards that are 50 feet or taller with double mast arms, Type III signal standards, and high-mast type light standards cannot be made breakaway and require barrier protection, with the sole exception of Type III signal standards at intersections (see Chapter 1330).
1040.11(1)(a) Light Standard Sizes WSDOT light standards are available in standard heights of 20, 30, 40, and 50 feet. 20-foot heights are restricted to special cases and require approval from the HQ Traffic Office. Luminaire arms are available in lengths of 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 feet, and both single and double (180-degree offset) arm configurations. Slip bases cannot be used on 50-foot poles with double arms longer than 8 feet (each) in length. Starting configurations are 30-, 40-, or 50-foot-tall poles with 12- or 16-foot luminaire arms. Custom heights may only be used where a light standard is attached to the top of a wall, in order to provide the correct height above roadway for the luminaire. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1040-43
Chapter 1040
Illumination
Barrier mounted light standards use standard heights, with adjustments made in the lighting analysis to account for additional luminaire height above the roadway.
1040.11(1)(b) Light Standard Placement Light standards hall be placed as far away from the traveled way as possible to minimize the risk of a collision or other damage. Light standards shall be placed such that the luminaire is directly over the roadway edge line, plus or minus 4 feet maximum. This offset distance may be exceeded with approval from the HQ Traffic Office, provided that required light levels are met. Type III signal standards may be placed where luminaires will be more than 4 feet from the roadway edge line. WSDOT light standards shall be placed on the right shoulder of the roadway. Light standards may be placed on traffic barrier separating two roadways, provided that the barrier is on the right shoulder of at least one of the roadways. Light standards may be placed on the left shoulder of a single lane roadway or ramp with approval from the HQ Traffic Office. Light standards shall not be placed in medians, on median traffic barrier, or in traffic islands. Type III signal standard locations shall be in accordance with Chapter 1330 or ramp meter system design requirements as applicable. Where light standards are placed along roadways with curb and sidewalk, light standards shall be placed at the back of the sidewalk to provide adequate lighting of the sidewalk and improve visibility of pedestrians. Light standards shall not be placed in planter or similar strips between the sidewalk and the roadway, as they place the lights too close to the roadway and increase the risk of even minor collisions or sideswipes. Where pole bases encroach on the sidewalk, the available sidewalk width passing the pole baseplate shall be in accordance with Chapter 1510. Where light standards will be placed on a bridge, coordination is required with the WSDOT Bridge office to ensure that the structure can support the light standard and that an adequate anchorage can be provided. Standard bridge mounting uses elbow mounts as shown in the Standard Plans. Light standards shall not be placed such that a luminaire will be within 50 feet of a bridge if the luminaire will be above the top of the solid concrete bridge barrier, or above the top of the bridge deck where open barrier is used. Placement of new light standards near overhead sign structures is subject to the following requirements:
•
•
•
New light standards shall not be placed between 5 and 50 feet in front of any overhead sign, due to the higher reflectivity of newer overhead sign faces. New light standards may be placed between 5 and 50 feet of the back of an existing overhead sign if lighting analysis includes the sign as an obstruction and shows that required light levels are met. New light standards may be placed within 5 feet of an overhead sign structure (in front of or behind) without analyzing the sign structure or addressing reflectivity of the sign face. The light is too directly above the sign to reflect into users’ eyes or for the sign to provide a significant lighting obstruction.
Existing light standards within 50 feet of an overhead sign are not required to be relocated unless there is a known problem caused by the proximity of the light and the sign, or the light is being relocated for other reasons. Light standard placement must be a minimum of 10 feet horizontally from any overhead power line, including neutrals and aerial service connections. Even if a location may be more than 10 feet from the wire, 10 feet of horizontal clearance is required for crane operations to place the pole. Depending on the line voltage of the power line, the horizontal clearance distance may be greater than 10 feet, such as in cases of high voltage transmission lines.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1040-44
Chapter 1040
Illumination
For overhead line voltages in excess of 50,000 volts (50 kV), the minimum required offset distance from the lines shall be increased by 0.4 inches for every additional 1 kV in accordance with WAC 296-24-960. Consideration should also be given to crane clearances as described in WAC 296-155-53408 Table 4.
1040.11(1)(c) Light Standards for Local Agencies Light standards for local agency owned and maintained systems shall meet local agency requirements, including pole types. Local agency pole types may be of a different material such as aluminum, fiberglass, or concrete, may include decorative features such as fluted poles, decorative mast arms, or banner arms, and may be powder coated a specific color. Local agency light standards may be placed in accordance with local agency requirements, provided that they meet clear zone requirements for the roadway. Some local agency clear zone requirements differ from WSDOT requirements and shall be verified before placing light standards. Local agencies may place poles within medians or shoulder planter strips at their discretion.
1040.11(1)(d) Temporary Light Standards Temporary light standards are normally timber pole light standards used to provide lighting during a temporary condition or until permanent lighting can be placed in operation. The most common uses of temporary lighting include:
•
•
Conditions where the roadway geometrics are temporarily changed to support construction work but will be restored to the original condition upon project completion. Conditions where the roadway geometrics are being permanently modified, but the permanent lighting will not cover temporary locations of required design areas or cannot be made operational early enough to cover required design areas.
Timber light standards are available in any mounting height from 20 to 90 feet in height. The type of luminaire and arm depends on the mounting height used. Both types of arrangements are shown in Standard Plan J-15.10. Timber light standards with mounting heights up to 60 feet can support up to three luminaire arms, with lengths of 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16 feet. Longer arm lengths of 18 and 20 feet may also be available, but they are less common and should be avoided if possible. Multiple luminaire arms are normally installed at increments of 90degrees from each other, with a standard 180-degree double-arm configuration being most common. Timber light standards with mounting heights of 60 feet and higher use high-mast type luminaires and arms. These luminaire arms are a “wagon wheel” type design with six 3-foot arms arranged at 60-degree intervals. Up to six luminaires may be installed in any configuration, but typical arrangements use 2, 3, 4, or 6 luminaires. Where three or four luminaires are used, it is recommended that they all be on the same side of the pole when shielding is necessary or only one side of the pole requires lighting, rather than evenly spread around the pole. See Exhibit 1040-47 for typical high-mast light arrangements.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1040-45
Chapter 1040
Illumination
Exhibit 1040-47 Typical Temporary High Mast Light Arrangements
Timber light standards require a crane for installation, so overhead clearances are critical. Timber light standards are normally installed in the ground using direct burial, at a depth of 10% of total pole height plus 2 feet. For example, a 60-foot timber pole requires a burial depth of 8 feet (10% of 60 feet = 6 feet, plus 2 feet). Specify the mounting height rather than the pole height, to allow for contractors to determine the length of pole needed. Where the ground has a lateral bearing pressure of less than 1000 psf or a friction angle of less than 26 degrees, standard direct burial installation cannot be used. Contact the HQ Traffic Office for design support where poor soil conditions are present. Timber light standards do not require guy wires by themselves, but they may be necessary when aerial circuits are used depending on how they are attached to the pole.
1040.11(2) Luminaires WSDOT standard luminaires are Light-Emitting Diode (LED) type cobra-head type fixtures with IESNA Type III distribution patterns. These luminaires are classified by their High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) equivalent wattage, even though they are LED. The standard wattage classifications are 200W, 250W, 310W, and 400W. Lighting analysis is done using a standard benchmark luminaire for each wattage class, which allows for any approved LED luminaire of that class to be used. WSDOT uses high-mast type luminaires for Type V distribution applications, where more of an area light may be needed instead of a roadway (more rectangular) light pattern. These luminaires may be used where lights may be installed between roadways or are required to light a longer distance across the roadway. Type V distribution lights are only available in 400W and 750W classes for permanent systems, and 1000W class is available for temporary installations.

Chapter 1040
Illumination
Wall mount and ceiling mount (tunnel) type fixtures are available as well, but their use has become more complicated as manufacturers have moved from HPS light sources to LED. Contact the HQ Traffic Office for assistance with wall and ceiling mount type luminaires. Wall mount luminaires may be installed on the faces of walls, on bridge piers, or on bridge pier crossbeams. Ceiling mount luminaires may be attached to ceilings, the underside of bridge decks, or supported on metal hanger systems. No luminaire may be attached directly to a bridge girder, with the exception of box girders with pre-approval from the WSDOT Bridge Office. Any attachment to a structure requires coordination with the WSDOT Bridge Office. No WSDOT lighting system may include decorative luminaires. Decorative luminaires may be used at the discretion of local agencies on systems that they will own and maintain.
1040.11(3) Electrical Design Lighting system electrical design is part of the roadside power distribution system and may be concurrent with power supplies to other equipment such as traffic signals or intelligent transportation system (ITS) equipment. General electrical system design shall follow the requirements of the WSDOT Roadside Power Distribution Manual available from https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/traffic-illumination-trafficsignals-and-intelligent-transportation-systems-its. Electrical systems may not be owned and maintained by multiple agencies. For example, one agency cannot own the lights and poles with a second agency owning the boxes, conduit, wiring, and service cabinets. The entirety of each electrical system must be owned and maintained by a single agency and designed to that agency’s standards.
1040.11(3)(a) Basic Circuit Layout Where four or more luminaires are installed, there shall be at least two lighting circuits to provide a minimum level of system redundancy. Where circuits are split, they shall be split so that a separate circuit is on each side of the roadway. For larger systems, they shall be split into a minimum of quadrants based on the interchange or intersection configuration or based on the service cabinet location if there is not an interchange or intersection. See Exhibit 1040-48 for basic circuit arrangements. Circuits are designated starting at the lowest SRMP on the increasing MP side of the highway, continuing in the increasing MP direction on that side of the highway first, then continuing at the lowest SRMP location on the decreasing MP side of the highway and continuing in the increasing MP direction on that side. Where two highways intersect, use the higher classification highway (such as the freeway and not the crossing highway or the US Highway over the State Highway).

Illumination
Exhibit 1040-48 Basic Lighting Circuit Divisions
WSDOT does not use adaptive lighting systems due to the design of the lighting systems and their typically linear nature, rather than being spread out over more of a grid system, and standard luminaires do not include photocell sockets. To allow for management of continuous lighting systems, lighting that is needed to cover basic required lighting design areas shall be installed on separate circuits from any additional lighting, such that lighting beyond the basic required may be switched off as needed without compromising minimum lighting requirements.
1040.11(3)(b) Conduits, Junction Boxes, and Vaults The basic power distribution system is composed of conduits and junction boxes or vaults. For the purposes of this section, the term box is used for all junction box types including in-ground standard duty and heavy-duty junction boxes and both surface and concrete embedded NEMA junction boxes, and the term vault is used for all closed-bottom in-ground pull boxes and cable vaults. Small cable vaults cannot be used for electrical distribution, and standard cable vaults are rarely if ever used for power distribution.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1040
Illumination
Box and vault spacing depends on the nearby equipment and the geometry of the conduit runs connected to them. Basic box and vault spacing is as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
A box or vault is required within 10 feet (5 feet is preferable) of any light standard and within 5 feet of any system connected cabinet (includes service and transformer cabinets). Boxes or vaults are required within 10 feet of a transition to or from barrier (bridge rail, cast in place barrier, etc.) on both sides of the transition. The box on the structure side of the transition may be adjusted to fit barrier joint spacing. Coordination with the WSDOT Bridge office is required. Basic spacing between boxes and vaults is 200 feet for all box types, including structure mounted and barrier embedded boxes. In-ground and surface mounted box spacing may be increased to 300 feet between boxes where the conduit path does not include more than a total of 30 degrees of bends. This does not include the 90degree conduit sweeps into the boxes themselves. This also applies to any conduit run connecting a box to a vault. Vault spacing may be increased to 750 feet between vaults where the conduit path does not include more than a total of 30 degrees of bends. Extended vault spacing of 1000 feet may not be used for power circuits. This spacing is restricted to fiber-optic or copper communications lines only.
Conduit sizes are limited to full inch sizes, with certain limited exceptions. Locations where specific conduit sizes are allowed or required include:
•
•
•
1-inch conduit is required between the light standard foundation and its supplying box or vault, due to limitations on the size of conduit entering the foundation and to ensure proper operation of the fused disconnect in slip-base light standards. ¾-inch rigid or flexible conduit may be used for the connection between a wall or ceiling mounted luminaire and its supplying box. All other conduits shall be at least 2-inch diameter or larger, unless otherwise approved by maintenance.
1040.12 Documentation Lighting design documentation includes the lighting analysis, line loss calculations, conduit fill calculations, and any associated breaker schedule calculations (for either service or transformer cabinets). Document justification for inclusion of any additional illumination, such as continuous illumination and illumination that is only recommended or to be considered. Maintenance approval, when required, may be an e-mail or memo from the Region Signal Maintenance Supervisor/Superintendent.

1050.01 General Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have the potential to reduce crashes and increase mobility of transportation facilities. They also enhance productivity through the use of advanced communications technologies and their integration into vehicles and the transportation infrastructure. These systems involve a broad range of wireless and wire line communications-based information, electronics, or information processing technologies. Some of these technologies include cameras, variable message signs, ramp meters, road weather information systems, highway advisory radios, traffic management centers, and adaptive signal control technology (ASCT). ASCT is a traffic signal system that detects traffic conditions and adjusts signal timing remotely in response. More information on ASCT can be found at: www.fhwa.dot.gov/everydaycounts/technology/adsc The purpose and direction of ITS for the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) can be found in the Statewide Intelligent Transportation Systems Plan, which is available upon request from the Headquarters (HQ) Traffic Operations Office. The plan identifies the current and long-term ITS needs to meet the objectives identified in Moving Washington, WSDOT’s program to fight traffic congestion. The Statewide ITS Plan is a comprehensive document that discusses:
•
•
•
•
•
•
The history of ITS deployment in Washington. How ITS meets WSDOT’s transportation vision and goals. The current state of ITS deployment. WSDOT’s near-term ITS plans. How projects are prioritized. What long-term ITS issues WSDOT needs to begin planning for.
Due to the dynamic nature of ITS, printed guidance is soon outdated. Detailed design guidance and current practices are located on the following websites.

1050.03 Systems Engineering Systems engineering is a typical part of any ITS project development process. It is required on any federal-aid project that has an ITS work element, per 23 CFR 940.11. Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary step-by-step process for complex projects (such as ITS projects) to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Assess a system’s needs and its relationship to the regional architecture. Plan a project that meets those needs as well as stakeholder needs and expectations. Define other specific requirements for the project/system. Develop and implement the project/system. Define the operations and maintenance requirements for the system. Plan for the refinement or replacement of the system.
Using systems engineering on ITS projects has been shown to increase the likelihood of a project’s success. A successful project is one that meets the project scope and stakeholder/ project sponsor expectations, is completed on time and within budget, and is efficient and cost-effective to operate and maintain. The level of systems engineering used for a project should be on a scale commensurate with the scope, cost, and risk of the project. Complete the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Systems Engineering Analysis Worksheet in Exhibit 1050-2, or a document with the same information, for all federal-aid projects that include ITS elements. Completing the Worksheet will meet the minimum requirements in 23 CFR 940.11 for systems engineering, determine the project’s risk, and determine if a more in-depth systems engineering analysis is required. The Worksheet and the four systems engineering documents outlined below are to be completed with coordination between the project engineer and region Traffic Engineer. As shown in the Worksheet, a more in-depth analysis requires that the following four documents be completed and used to implement the project. These documents are produced as the result of the steps in the systems engineering process. 1. Concept of Operations: This document defines the problem, the project’s goals, stakeholder needs and expectations, constraints, and the way the ITS system is required to operate and be maintained. 2. System Requirements: This document contains specifications of what the system is required to do, how well it is required to do it, and under what conditions. These requirements are based on the goals, stakeholder needs and expectations, constraints, and operation and maintenance requirements documented in the Concept of Operations. 3. System Verification Plan: This document describes how the agency will verify that the system being built meets the requirements in the System Requirements document. The agency will implement the System Verification Plan to ensure all system requirements are verified before it accepts the system.

Chapter 1050
Intelligent Transportation Systems
4. System Validation Plan: This document describes how the agency will assess the system’s performance against the goals, stakeholder needs and expectations, constraints, and operation and maintenance requirements documented in the Concept of Operations. The goal is for the agency to understand and review the strengths and weaknesses of the system and identify any new opportunities and needs if appropriate. The agency will implement the System Validation Plan after it accepts the system. This evaluation sets the stage for the next time the system/project is changed or expanded. For specific guidance on developing the four systems engineering plans listed above, see the plan templates in the USDOT/CalTrans document, Systems Engineering Guidebook for Intelligent Transportation Systems, Version 3, .

As each phase of an ITS project is completed, a report is to be submitted by the Project Engineer to the region Traffic Engineer describing how the project is meeting the requirements outlined in the above systems engineering plans. Approvals for ITS projects are dependent upon project complexity and cost. (See Chapter 300 for ITS project approval requirements.) Systems engineering costs are to be estimated and incorporated into the construction engineering (CE) and project engineering (PE) portions of the construction estimate. For further project development guidance related to procurement and administration of Federal-Aid Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) contracts, see Section 1050.04.
1050.03(1) Systems Engineering Process “V” Diagram The systems engineering process contains a number of steps that are not included in a traditional project delivery process. The systems engineering process is often referred to as the “V” diagram (see Exhibit 1050-1). An ITS project begins on the left side of the “V” and progresses down the left side and then up the right side. Then the project is evaluated by validating and verifying the elements on the right side of the “V” with the elements on the left side. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and WSDOT are in agreement that, for project development and delivery, the most critical portions of the systems engineering process are the Concept of Operations; System Requirements; System Verification; and System Validation. As a result, the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Systems Engineering Analysis Worksheet in Exhibit 1050-2 is focused on these core areas.

1050.04 FHWA Washington Division ITS Project Contracting Guidance 1050.04(1) Purpose The purpose of this document is to provide basic guidance related to the procurement and administration of Federal-Aid ITS contracts.
1050.04(2) Scope This document is intended to be used by the FHWA Washington Division Office, WSDOT, and local agencies as a guide on the proper types of procurement methods for various types of ITS projects. This guidance is not allencompassing, as ITS projects can vary significantly in scope. However, it should provide adequate information to address a majority of situations. Specific questions about an individual ITS project should be directed to the Washington Division Office.
1050.04(3) Construction versus Non-Construction ITS improvements may be incorporated as part of a traditional federal-aid construction contract, or the contracting agency may elect to procure ITS services under a separate contract (i.e., stand-alone ITS projects). When procured as a separate contract, the scope of an ITS contract will determine the applicability of federal procurement requirements. Title 23 United States Code 101(a)(4) provides a broad definition for construction for federal-aid eligibility purposes. FHWA generally interprets the definition broadly, resulting in many types of projects being classified as construction.

Chapter 1050
Intelligent Transportation Systems
Very simply, a contract that incurs costs incidental to the construction or reconstruction of a highway, including improvements that directly facilitate and control traffic flow (e.g., traffic control systems) are by definition construction contracts. This includes rehabilitation of an existing physical ITS infrastructure. Construction contracts must follow the regulatory requirements of 23 CFR 635 or 23 CFR 636 in the case of Design-Build. Non-construction-type ITS contracts will be either Engineering Contracts or Service Contracts. Engineering is defined as professional services of an engineering nature as defined by state law. If the ITS contract primarily involves engineering, then qualifications-based selection (QBS) procedures, in compliance with the Brooks Act, must be followed. Service contracts (non-construction, non-engineering in nature) are to be procured in accordance with the Common Rule for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to States and Local Governments found at 49 CFR 18.36.
1050.04(4) Types of ITS Projects Stand-alone ITS projects can generally be categorized into one of the following types of ITS projects: (1) planning/research, (2) preliminary engineering/project development, (3) software development/system integration, (4) system deployments, (5) traditional construction, and (6) operations and maintenance. All Federal-Aid ITS projects, regardless of the type, are directed in 23 CFR 940 to follow a systems engineering process. Exhibit 1050-3 provides further information about each of these ITS project types.
1050.05 Documentation Include all ITS systems engineering documentation in the Design Documentation Package (DDP). All systems engineering documentation requires region Traffic Engineer approval.

Additional systems engineering documents (Concept of Operations, System Requirements, Verification Plan, and Validation Plan)[2] are recommended.[1]
Additional systems engineering documents (Concept of Operations, System Requirements, Verification Plan, and Validation Plan)[2] are required.
Notes: [1] A decision not to complete the additional systems engineering documents for high-risk projects that have less than $1,000,000 of ITS elements requires FHWA concurrence prior to submitting a construction authorization request. [2] See definitions in Section 1050.03. [3] Use the amount from question 4. What is the name of the regional ITS architecture and which portions of the architecture will be implemented? Is the project consistent with the architecture? Are revisions to the architecture required? Also, which user services, physical subsystem elements, information flows, and market/service packages will be completed, and how will these pieces be part of the architecture? Click here to enter text. Identify the participating agencies, their roles and responsibilities, and the concept of operations. For the elements and market/service packages to be implemented, define the high-level operations of the system. This includes where the system will be used, its performance parameters, its life cycle, and who will operate and maintain it. Discuss the established requirements or agreements on information sharing and traffic device control responsibilities. The regional ITS architecture operational concept is a good starting point for discussion. If this is a high-risk project and a more extensive Concept of Operations document is being prepared for this project (see question 7), this answer can be a simple reference to that document.

Chapter 1050
Intelligent Transportation Systems
Define the system requirements. Based on the concept of operations, define the “what” and not the “how” of the system. Define the detailed requirements for eventual detailed design. The applicable high-level functional requirements from the regional architecture are a good starting point for discussion. A review of the requirements by the project stakeholders is recommended. If this is a high-risk project, and a more extensive System Requirements document is being prepared for this project (see question 7), this answer can be a simple reference to that document. Click here to enter text. Provide an analysis of alternative system configurations and technology options to meet requirements. This analysis should outline the strengths and weaknesses, technical feasibility, institutional compatibility, and life cycle costs of each alternative. The project stakeholders should have had input in choosing the preferred solution. Click here to enter text. Identify procurement/contracting options. Since there are different procurement methods for different types of projects, the decision regarding the best procurement option should consider the level of agency participation, compatibility with existing procurement methods, the role of the system integrator, and life cycle costs. Some options to consider include: consultant design/low-bid contractor, systems manager, systems integrator, task order, and design/build. If the ITS portions of the project significantly meet the definition of construction, then construction by low-bid contract would be used. Non-construction ITS portions of the project, such as services for software development, systems integration, systems deployment, systems management, or design, will be either engineering or service contracts. In these cases, a qualifications-based selection (QBS) or best value procurement may be more appropriate. For guidance on procurement options for ASCT systems, refer to Pages 15-20 of USDOT’s Model Systems Engineering Documents for Adaptive Signal Control Technology (ASCT) Systems, FHWA-HOP-11-027, . Click here to enter text. Identify the applicable ITS standards and testing procedures. Include documentation on which standards will be incorporated into the system design. Also, include justification for any applicable standards not incorporated. The standards discussion in the regional architecture is a good starting point for discussion. Click here to enter text. Outline the procedures and resources necessary for operations and management of the system. In addition to the concept of operations, document any internal policies or procedures necessary to recognize and incorporate the new system into the current operations and decision-making processes. Also, resources necessary to support continued operations, including staffing and training, must be recognized early and be provided for. Such resources must also be provided to support necessary maintenance and upkeep to ensure continued system viability. Click here to enter text.

Worker Fall Protection
1060.01 General 1060.02 Design Criteria 1060.03 Design Solutions 1060.04 Documentation 1060.05 References
1060.01 General During the design phase, evaluate worker fall protection issues related to eventual maintenance and operations activities that will be required in the final, constructed configuration, determined through consultation with responsible region and HQ maintenance, landscape restoration and/or monitoring, and other WSDOT staff that require long term access to a site (see Chapter 301). Examples of activities to include in this evaluation include routine facility upkeep, debris removal, and planting maintenance. Although it provides advantages to those engaged in maintenance activities, it is often not feasible to eliminate, through design, situations where workers will be in close proximity to the kind of drops or steep slopes described in WAC 296-880. Therefore, evaluate the need for, and the feasibility of, permanent passive systems, such as physical barriers, rails, and covers. Where installation of a passive system is not practicable, provide permanent anchors that workers can use in combination with personal fall restraint or fall arrest systems.
1060.02 Design Criteria Design and install permanent fall protection in accordance with WAC 296-880-20005 and 40005 under the following conditions:
•
•
•
along constructed features within the project limits that are a vertical face or steep slope, defined as one upon which normal footing cannot be maintained without the use of devices due to the pitch of the surface, weather conditions, or surface material (normally 3H:1V and steeper unless more detailed information can be documented), and where maintenance, operations, or environmental staff have indicated that there will be regular, periodic, or sporadic maintenance or operations activities required during the service life of the installation, and where staff are engaged in these activities and are subject to a potential fall 4 feet or more, and access to the top of the feature is intended solely for the use of maintenance, operations or environmental personnel.
Note that if the location is intended to be used by the public, provide fall protection in accordance with Chapter 1510, Pedestrian Facilities instead.
1060.02(1) Fall Protection Treatment Selection for Vertical Faces For vertical faces that meet the above conditions, install a fall protection rail (referred to as a “guardrail system” in WAC 296-880-40005). Where a fall protection rail is not feasible, or maintenance, operations, or environmental personnel have indicated that a fall protection rail is not desired because of the nature of the work or site-specific conditions, provide permanent anchorage points instead. A permanent anchorage point is defined as a secure point of attachment for lifelines, lanyards, or deceleration devices which is capable of withstanding the forces specified in WAC 296-880-40020; examples include vehicle barriers, or features designed and installed to serve specifically as anchorages.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1060-1
Chapter 1060
Worker Fall Protection
In situations where it’s determined that neither fall protection rail nor permanent anchorage point(s) are feasible, then installation of permanent fall protection is not required, and instead temporary fall protection measures will be provided in the future each time worker activity is performed.
1060.02(2) Fall Protection Treatment Selection for Steep Slopes At the top of steep slopes that will require staff to perform ongoing maintenance, determine whether there are any locations for which temporary fall protection measures will be insufficient or are infeasible. If so, install permanent anchorage points (as defined above) that are located and designed to serve the ongoing maintenance activity.
1060.03 Design Solutions Allowable fall rail systems are:
•
•
•
•
Wire rope railing with top and intermediate rails of ½-inch-diameter steel wire rope, or Steel pipe railing with 1½-inch nominal outside diameter pipe as posts and top and intermediate rails, or A custom chain link fence design, or Concrete traffic barrier as an extension of the height of the retaining wall.
Design fall protection rail to be 42 inches high, plus or minus 3 inches, measured from the top of the finished grade, and capable of withstanding a 200 lb force applied at the top of the system, from any direction, while allowing no more than the maximum deflection provided in WAC 296-880-40005(g)(ii). Except for traffic barrier designs, provide an intermediate cable or rail halfway between the top rail and the finished grade, a toe board with a minimum height of 4 inches, and post spacing no more than 8 feet on center. A toe board may be omitted if persons are not expected to be working or passing below the rail. Fabricate permanent fall protection rail systems using galvanized steel and locate them no further than 3 feet from the protected edge. Where a rail system is co-located with a vehicle barrier, locate the system outside the deflection distance for the barrier shown in Exhibit 1610-3. Where it’s been established that anchorages are required, determined anchor point locations and project specific designs in consultation with region and/or landscape maintenance staff, HQ Bridge, and HQ Geotechnical Offices to develop project specific designs. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for design details for any retrofit to an existing retaining wall and for any attachments to a new retaining wall. Refer to the WSDOT Construction Manual for more information about the process for determining the need for fall protection during project construction.

1100.01 General (Section Rewritten 2023) The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is committed to context- appropriate, functional, accessible, and complete active transportation networks. WSDOT’s goal is to optimize existing system capacity and safety and reduce the environmental impacts of the transportation system by encouraging and supporting a full array of modal choices. To accomplish this goal and to meet the needs of users of all ages and abilities, WSDOT works with community partners to identify changes needed across all jurisdictions to improve safety, mobility, and connectivity for active transportation users. The design process accounts for the fact that 100% of Washingtonians use active transportation at some point during their trip whether walking to a transit hub or from a parked car to the store, bicycling to work, or rolling home from a ferry terminal. Active transportation facilities designed in alignment with industry practice contribute to the safety and mobility of all roadway users and ongoing development of a truly multimodal network. A performance-based, practical design approach is used to guide the WSDOT design process, utilizing appropriate performance metrics, stakeholder input, and agency risk management practices to establish the most effective design. This chapter provides an overview of practical solutions, practical design and the different elements that are examined and documented in design decisions.
1100.01(1) Design and Pre-design Phase (New Section 2023) Preliminary Engineering, also known as project design phase, begins after a project is scoped. In some cases, a pre-design phase may be initiated to refine or validate project scope, schedule and budget for projects identified to have, or are likely to have, design element changes. The work described in Chapter 1100 – 1106 may take place during this pre-design phase and the decisions and analyses conducted are documented in an update to the Project Summary (CPDM approval), and in the Basis of Design (See Exhibit 300-2). Once the Basis of Design has been completed and approved along with an updated estimate, the pre-design phase is concluded, and the design phase begins. Separate instructions for pre-design are available and occasionally updated to provide additional guidance to region staff. Contact HQ Design for more information. When design element(s) are expected to change and a BOD is typically required, exemptions from a pre-design phase can be approved by the ASDE.

Design Process
1100.01(2) Responsibilities (New Section 2023) The Project Engineer or region designee assigned to the project is responsible for carrying out the design process in accordance with policies and guidance in this manual. Furthermore, the Project Engineer or region designee is accountable for deliverables and decisions made during that process, and overseeing the required work in accordance with their professional responsibilities per RCW 18-43. The Project Engineer or region designee is supported by the members of their project and advisory teams (see Section 1100.04(2)), as well as other subject matter experts and administrative staff throughout the agency or under contract who contribute and participate in accordance with their own professional and legal responsibilities.
1100.02 Design Principles 1100.02(1) Practical Solutions The Practical Solutions approach prioritizes innovative, timely, and cost-effective decisions that are made in coordination with stakeholders and partners. It considers each situation and encourages incremental, flexible, and sustainable investment decisions by focusing on identified performance needs and engaging stakeholders at the right time. Practical Solutions is applicable to everything the agency does, including the way programs and services are administered, managed, planned, programmed, designed, constructed, operated, and maintained. It is a performance-based approach to transportation and organizational decision making (see Executive Order (EO) E 1090.01 for more information). It is specifically reflected in the processes and procedures described in this Chapter, and the Basis of Design documentation template. It is also a data-driven approach that uses tools, data analytics, performance measures, and stakeholder input to (1) seek lower-cost approaches and efficiencies in expanding and operating the multimodal transportation system to reduce travel demand and the need for building costly new infrastructure, (2) identify, evaluate, analyze, and manage risk to WSDOT’s strategic objectives, and (3) identify and implement agency efficiencies. Practical Solutions includes one or a combination of strategies, including, but not limited to, Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO), off-system solutions, Transportation Demand Management (TDM), and incremental strategic capital solutions. The goal is to identify and solve needs and problems as quickly and cost-effectively as possible.
1100.02(2) Safe System Approach (New Section 2023) The Safe System Approach to road safety is a holistic approach based on the following elements: safe roads, safe speeds, safe vehicles, safe road users, and post-crash care. In the Safe System Approach, WSDOT has a primary responsibility of road infrastructure planning, design, and operations. This includes speed management, multimodal context-sensitive geometric design, traffic systems management and operations, roadside features and road user actions affected by road infrastructure design and operations (such as signage, lighting, and striping), and the safety management systems that support analysis and decision making. Within these elements, the Safe System Approach applies the following principles:
•
•
Eliminate death and serious injuries: While no crashes of any type are desirable, the Safe System Approach prioritizes elimination of crashes that result in death and serious injuries. Support safe road use: Road users will inevitably make mistakes that can lead to crashes. The transportation system and vehicles can be designed and operated to reduce the injury outcomes from those errors. A forgiving system accommodates reasonable and predictable human limitations and behavior (such as diligence, perception, and attention). Roads that are developed in this manner as

•
Design Process
“self- enforcing and self-explaining roads” make it more difficult for errors to occur, and when the errors do occur, they result in fewer fatal and serious injuries. Reduce large crash forces: Road users have limits for tolerating crash forces before death or serious injury occurs. Therefore, it is important within the Safe System Approach to manage the transfer of kinetic energy through adoption of design and operational elements that account for and reduce crash speeds and impact angles to be within survivable limits. Responsibility is shared: All stakeholders (such as transportation system designers, managers, road users, vehicle manufacturers, and policy makers) commit to reducing fatal and serious injury crashes and to working together. The focus is placed on the larger context and network of contributing factors and characteristics from which traffic death and serious injury arise, instead of the individual road users. Strengthen all parts: All parts of the transportation system are strengthened to reinforce each other so that if one part fails, the other parts still protect road users. In this way redundancy is provided for the elements that make up the safe system. Safety is proactive: Proactive (systemic safety) approaches address context, contributing factors, and crash types and help to reduce the potential for fatal and serious injury crashes. These approaches complement traditional, reactive crash reduction programs that focus on individual sites and segments with a history of observed crashes using the methods outlined by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Highway Safety Manual.
1100.02(2)(a) Safe System Roles and Responsibilities (New Section 2023) Executive order E1085.01 directs WSDOT executives and employees to incorporate the Safe System Approach into WSDOT practices to align with the Safe System Approach to road safety. Implementing the Safe System approach includes:
•
•
•
•
•
Working collaboratively with internal and external safety stakeholders to analyze safety performance and develop strategies that move us toward zero fatal and serious injury crashes. Aligning and maintaining a quantitative approach to analysis across project development functions that complies with the intent, methods, and tools defined by the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual, where they are practicable. Incorporating an equity analysis in accordance with findings from modal crash data and the environmental justice requirements of the Healthy Environment for All (HEAL) Act. Prioritizing design and operational decisions that support safety for all users based on the context of the road, particularly in locations affected by legacy state transportation facilities and where gaps in walking and biking facilities exist, as outlined by the Active Transportation Plan. Explicitly identifying and addressing a project’s expected effects on crash exposure and network connectivity for vulnerable road users. This acts to prevent increased exposure to fatal and serious injury crashes through needed multimodal facility and operational improvements. Where prevention is not possible, provide mitigation to reduce crash severity and propose future solutions to further reduce exposure.
1100.03 Complete Streets (New Section 2023) Projects with Complete Streets are designed and operated to promote use and mobility for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, or transit riders. Complete Streets prioritizes more comfortable and equitable, context sensitive network connectivity for all roadway users through close coordination with our local partners and stakeholders. This is aligned with WSDOT’s policy and commitment to develop and maintain an interconnected and integrated multimodal transportation system that provides all Washington travelers with reasonably safe, WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1100-3
Chapter 1100
Design Process
sustainable, and equitable access. A project is determined to have complete streets need, and may incorporate complete streets elements, when identified through a screening process (see Section 1103.03(3)).
1100.03(1) Goals and Objectives (New Section 2023) WSDOT complete streets designs are developed in cooperation with the affected community through community engagement to accomplish the following:
•
•
•
•
•
Address unique Complete Streets concerns of overburdened communities. Address active transportation network gaps that have been identified through a WSDOT or local plan and/or through community engagement. Provide bicycle and pedestrian facilities that offer the required Level of Traffic Stress and Route Directness Index (See Chapter 1101 and Section 1231.05). Provide a separation from vehicular traffic that involves a vertical element when it is determined that a posted speed must be maintained at greater than 30 mph (see Chapter 1510, Chapter 1520). Provide adequate access to transit, including specific improvements for bicycles and pedestrians in High-Capacity Transit areas (refer to the WSDOT HCT Improvements Guide for more information).
Evaluate the use of Transportation System Management and Operations (or TSMO) solutions first to address project related needs, before committing to capital or constructed improvements.
1100.03(2) Complete Streets Teams (New Section 2023) Region Complete Streets (or CS) Teams provide multidisciplinary, subject matter expertise input throughout project development of Complete Streets strategies and designs through their participation in planning, scoping, pre-design, design phases. CS Teams bring together staff with active transportation expertise and other knowledge relevant to complete streets from disciplines that may include, but are not limited to, region planning, public transportation, active transportation, transportation operations, transportation safety, engineering services/project development, maintenance, programming, construction, and communications. WSDOT Headquarters (HQ) staff with appropriate expertise may be called upon to supplement region teams as needed. Region CS Teams have specific responsibilities when working as members of a project advisory team (see Section 1100.04(2))
1100.03(3) Project Screening (New Section 2023) Complete streets requirements are normally determined during a screening process that takes place in advance of project design or pre-design. New projects of all types with a total project cost of $500,000 or more are subject to this screening process to determine whether the project will be designed and developed as a complete street or deferred in alignment with established processes. This screening process accounts for whether projects are in incorporated cities, in other designated population centers (See WSDOT Population Centers Map) where active transportation gaps have been identified in WSDOT or local plans, or in population centers that are overburdened communities, designating those projects for complete streets design unless a documented justification to defer is approved by the Region Administrator or designee (see Section 1104.05. Note that complete streets screening also applies to projects on state limited access highways, on city streets that are not designated as state highway that pass through a state limited access facility (e.g., overpasses and underpasses), and on state routes within counties.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1100-4
Chapter 1100
Design Process
1100.03(4) Project Organization (New Section 2023) Once a project has met the requirements of the screening process described above, that project incorporates a Complete Streets need into the design process per Section 1101.03 unless otherwise deferred by the Regional Administrator or designee. If Complete Streets needs are incorporated into a project, a Basis of Design is developed per Section 1100.05(1) unless approved by the ASDE. Complete streets projects generally proceed using the process laid out in this chapter and the chapters that follow. Any differences in process or other requirements compared to other project types are called out in the appropriate guidance sections.
1100.04 Practical Design Practical design is the design phase component of practical solutions, addressing the transportation-related need that’s identified or evolves during the planning, scoping or design phase of a project. Practical design is data driven, employing performance metrics to seek low-cost approaches and efficiencies in expanding and operating the multimodal transportation system to reduce travel demand and the need for building costly new infrastructure that are identified in collaboration with other agencies, communities, and stakeholders. The objective is to identify low-cost solutions that meet the need(s), while considering benefits to the system as a whole and the role of incremental solutions as a way to address uncertainties identified in future scenarios. The Basis of Design (BOD) is a template for the process WSDOT uses to document the practical design approach and may be employed during the project scoping, pre-design, or design phase. The process consists of the following seven steps: 1. Assemble a project advisory team as needed (see Section 1100.04(2). 2. Clearly identify the baseline need. Define it in terms of performance, contributing factors, and underlying reasons for the baseline need (see Chapter 1101). 3. Identify the land use and transportation context (which includes environmental use and constraints) for the location (see Chapter 1102). 4. Select design controls compatible with the context (see Chapter 1103). 5. Formulate and evaluate potential alternatives, including TSMO strategies, that resolve the baseline need for the selected context and design controls (see Chapter 1104). 6. Select design elements that will be included in the alternatives (see Chapter 1105). 7. Determine design element dimensions consistent with performance needs, context, and design controls (see Chapter 1106). See Section 1100.05(1) for more information about the BOD.
1100.04(1) Community Engagement WSDOT staff engages the community affected by a project in order to inform decision-making, strengthen partnerships, increase credibility, and drive priorities. Community input informs the project development process from planning to design. Engaging with the community helps us more fully understand:

Chapter 1100
Design Process
Refer to Chapter 210 Public Engagement and the WSDOT Community Engagement Plan for more information, and document the findings of community engagement efforts (see Section 1100.05(5)).
1100.04(2) Project and Advisory Teams Collaborative decisions contribute to more successful delivery of the project. Engage external and internal stakeholders providing consent-based outcomes early in project development. Once a Project Engineer and Project Team have been identified to lead the project development, an Advisory Team is convened by them with the appropriate subject matter expertise to inform design decision-making. In the case of a Complete Streets project, also consult region Complete Streets Team.
1100.04(3) Need and Performance Identification The need for the project is the primary reason the project has been programmed at the location. Determine performance metrics and targets based on an assessment of this project’s specific need, and other contextual needs developed through external partner and community engagement. Perform a contributing factors analysis that refines the identified need so more precise performance gaps and metrics can be identified. Include the specified baseline needs and the metrics associated with Complete Streets when applicable (see Chapter 1101). Refer to Chapter 1101 and the Performance Based Design guidance document for more information: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/design/ASDE/Practical_Design.pdf
1100.04(4) Context Determination Context determination refers to the characteristics, activities, and functions within a geographical area. WSDOT’s context determination process involves two interrelated topics: land use and transportation, referencing both the existing and future conditions. Chapter 1102 provides guidance for determining context.
1100.04(5) Design Control Selection Design controls provide fundamental constraints for highway design. Five design controls are used to help guide design decisions:
•
•
•
•
•
Design Year Modal Priority (except for Complete Streets projects) Access Control Design Speed Terrain Classification
Chapter 1103 presents guidance related to choosing design controls.
1100.04(6) Alternative Formulation and Evaluation The goal during the design phase is to carry out the scope identified from pre-design or develop a solution that addresses the baseline need at the lowest cost. Other known or identified needs, termed “contextual needs”, can be addressed in these solutions as well. Chapter 1101 provides a discussion on baseline and contextual needs, and Chapter 1104 discusses using these needs to develop and evaluate alternatives, as well as the role of the CS Team in alternatives development for Complete Streets. When formulating solutions, provide alternatives that employs lower-cost approaches such as Transportation Systems Management and Operations (or TSMO). TSMO alternatives will address all or part of the baseline need
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1100-6
Chapter 1100
Design Process
and provide efficiencies that benefit multimodal transportation, reduce vehicle travel demand, while reducing the need for building costly new infrastructure. In some cases, work performed during planning will identify strategies that can help guide the development of TSMO alternative(s). The Alternative Strategies and Solutions subsection of the Guidance Documents discusses primary TSMO strategies and examples of solutions within those strategies. Direct link to the Design Support Webpage Direct link to the Guidance Documents Direct link to Transportation Systems Management and Operations
1100.04(7) Design Element Selection and Dimensions The selection of design elements is based entirely on the alternative selected to address the baseline need while balancing performance trade-offs. Chapter 1105 provides instruction for design element selection. Chapter 1106 provides information related to choosing dimensions for design elements.
1100.05 Documentation Tools Basis of Design (BOD), Basis of Estimate (BOE), Design Parameter Sheets, and Alternative Comparison Tables are all documentation tools used to record decisions and analyses needed in development of a solution that is consistent with WSDOT’s practical design approach. The tools can be found at: Design guidance & support | WSDOT (wa.gov)
1100.05(1) Basis of Design The BOD organizes information around the practical design procedural steps (see Section 1100.04) necessary to support WSDOT’s practical design approach. It provides a template for documenting each step in the process. The BOD includes the following information and sections:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Planning Document Summary General Project Information Section 1 – Project Needs Section 2 – Context Section 3 – Design Controls Section 4 – Alternatives Analysis Section 5 – Design Element Selection
Exhibit 1100-1 shows the major activities associated with WSDOT’s practical design approach and corresponding Design Manual chapters and Basis of Design sections. Start compiling the BOD as early as possible. During planning or scoping, a BOD may be only partially completed. Information documented on the BOD provides an opportunity for greater consistency between strategies developed in planning and solutions developed in scoping and design. Information documented in the BOD comes through use of consent-based recommendations (see Section 1100.04(2)). Contact the region Program Management regarding the need to initiate a BOD during the project-scoping phase. Since the BOD is ultimately a document that supports design decisions, the approval of a BOD, which ideally takes place at 30% design level or earlier, is a part of, and included in, the project Design Approval process (see
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1100-7
Chapter 1100
Design Process
Chapter 300). Note that if a BOD has been prepared for a project and no design elements were changed, ASDE approval of the BOD is not required. Basis of Design: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/design-tools-and-support#Tools
1100.05(1)(a) Basis of Design Exemptions See Section 1100.04 for guidance regarding when a BOD is required for scoping projects. For design-phase projects, a BOD supports design decisions and is required on all projects where one or more design elements are changed (see Chapter 1105). The need for a Basis of Design (BOD) may be waived, if the only design elements changed by a project are listed below, or the changed elements are described and documented in an approved intersection control evaluation (ICE) or crash analysis report (CAR), with approval of the Assistant State Design Engineer (ASDE).

In any request from the ASDE for an exemption, describe how the circumstances presented by the project make a BOD unnecessary. Only ICE or CAR documents that describe the project need(s), alternatives considered, and performance tradeoffs used in the alternative selection will be considered documentation suitable to support a BOD exemption. Each request is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Note that if the project is a preservation program project, a Basis of Design is not required if the only design elements changed are listed in Chapter 1120, and the criteria/guidance provided in Chapter 1120 is followed. This exemption does not require approval and is documented in the DDP.
1100.05(2) Basis of Estimate A Basis of Estimate is required for all project estimates and is updated throughout all phases of project development. Refer to the Cost Estimating Manual for WSDOT Projects for additional information on estimating and the Basis of Estimate.
1100.05(3) Alternatives Comparison Table The Alternative Comparison Table (ACT) provides solutions evaluated in accordance with WSDOT’s Practical Solutions approach. This table allows comparison of alternatives to identify the optimum solution. The table enables discussions of performance trade-offs. The Alternative Comparison Table is incorporated in Section 4 of the BOD form.
1100.05(4) Design Parameter Sheets When a Basis of Design has been completed, prepare Design Parameter Sheets that document the dimensions selected for the various design elements chosen, and as also noted in Section 5 of the Basis of Design.

1101.01 General Practical design starts with identification of issues associated with the performance of a transportation facility. A need is defined as a performance gap that is used to guide the development of design alternatives to be considered for the project. The process typically starts in the planning phase or during project scoping, when the needs are identified that must be addressed by the project. These needs are typically associated with larger agency objectives, such as safety, economic vitality, equitable access, state of good repair, etc., and become the baseline need(s) for the project. Other needs related to the project location will emerge in advance or during alternatives development, and these are called contextual needs. Contributing factors analysis can be used to improve the accuracy and precision of need statements that guide the development of performance metrics and targets. This chapter provides:
•
•
•
•
Instruction on the different types of needs—baseline and contextual. A method to diagnose and analyze the contributing factors of the identified need. Instruction on how to determine performance metrics and targets for each of the identified needs. How to develop project need statements.
Decisions about project related needs, metrics, targets, and related activities described in this chapter are all performed and documented as a coordinated exercise led by the Project Team in consultation with the Advisory Team (see Section 1100.04(2)).
1101.02 Baseline Needs A baseline need is the primary reason a project has been proposed at a location. The baseline need usually evolves from a WSDOT planning and/or priority programming process. There can be more than one baseline need such as when an agency partners with WSDOT on a project and the partner’s need becomes another baseline need. Example: A local agency desires to fund a revitalization project for a community bordering a state highway. The local agency’s baseline need in this case is the local land use’s economic vitality. If WSDOT also happens to have a prioritized and funded baseline need at the same location, and the two parties decide to partner in a combined project, that project will have at least two baseline needs. The two parties will work to develop solutions compatible for both baseline needs. Develop project need statements for each identified baseline need (see Section 1101.05). To determine, develop, and refine the project’s baseline need(s) and finalize the associated need statement(s), examine the conditions surrounding the original project identification, which was completed in the priority programming phase, and apply contributing factors analysis (see Section 1101.04). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1101-1
Chapter 1101
Need Identification
After developing and refining the baseline need(s), define the baseline performance metrics. See Section 1101.04) and determine the baseline need targets (see Section 1101.04(3).
1101.03 Complete Streets Needs Projects that are required to incorporate Complete Streets, following the screening process described in Section 1104.04(1), are assumed to have a “Complete Streets need” in addition to the baseline need and contextual needs.
1101.04 Baseline Performance Metrics Baseline performance metrics are those “measurables” used to check that the project satisfies the need(s). Baseline performance metrics are also used in the development of the project need statement. Project alternatives must address the identified baseline performance metric(s). Performance metrics are used in the priority programming process to screen the full state network under each performance category (for further information on performance metrics and performance categories, see the guidance document Performance-Based Decisions: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/designtopics/design-tools-and-support#Tools). The baseline performance metric for preservation category projects is predetermined and is the same as the threshold performance metrics determined by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and HQ Capital Program Development and Management (CPDM) Office. The baseline performance metrics for a mobility or economic vitality category project may be different from the threshold performance metrics. However, the baseline metric chosen is to be consistent with the priority programming performance category that identified the location to be evaluated. Example: A routinely congested corridor has been screened to identify locations with a potential mobility performance gap. Screening used a threshold performance metric of estimated operations at 70% of posted speed during the peak hour. After considering the context of the location, and the relevance of the threshold performance metric to the site-specific conditions and operations, the advisory team recommends that travel time reliability is a more appropriate metric for the location.
1101.04(1) Safety Performance WSDOT’s practical design approach is committed to multimodal safety as identified in Washington State’s Strategic Safety Plan (see www.targetzero.com/plan.htm). To meet this commitment, projects are required to include a baseline performance metric for evaluating the number of fatal and serious injury crashes in safety, mobility and economic vitality category projects. Other safety metrics to address the specific community or partnering agency needs may be included as contextual needs. Safety projects are expected to continue project development as directed by the Multimodal Safety Executive Committee (MSEC) and described in Exhibit 1101-1 Safety Scoping Flowchart and Chapter 321. Other projects are to coordinate up front with the HQ Safety Technical Group to determine the scale and scope of crash analyses appropriate for different types and sizes of projects. For additional information see Chapter 321 and the safety analysis guide.

1101.04(2) Complete Streets Performance (New Section 2023) Projects that have been identified as having a Complete Streets Need (see above) are required to apply five categories of metrics, in addition to any other baseline needs as described above, to help assess design alternative performance with respect to the Complete Streets need.
1101.04(2)(a) Bicycle and Pedestrian Movement (New Section 2023) Measure the prospective performance of biking, walking and other pedestrian movement through the project using Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) and route directness (RDI). LTS is a metric that is used during planning and design to provide an indication of the relative stress experienced by bicycle riders and pedestrians. LTS is a numeric rating from 1 to 4, where a lower number indicates lower stress for a bicyclist (expressed as BLTS) or for a pedestrian traveler (expressed as PLTS). At a minimum, the numeric LTS rating is based on Average Annual Daily Traffic (more commonly known as AADT), posted speed and the number of travel lanes of the highway segment. Other roadway characteristics can be used to refine an LTS designation. LTS can be used to summarize a highway’s essential characteristics, including design elements, features, dimensions, and configuration. Route directness refers to the amount of out of direction travel pedestrians and bicyclists must engage in to travel between destinations. It is measured in terms of a Route Directness Index (RDI). More information and requirements about LTS and RDI can be found in Sections 1310.03(1), 1510.02(5), and 1520.03(3).

1101.04(2)(b) Concerns of Overburdened Communities (New Section 2023) An overburdened community is a geographic area where vulnerable populations face combined, multiple environmental harms and health impacts and includes, but is not limited to, highly impacted communities that are designated by the department of health based on cumulative impacts analyses or a community located in census tracts that are fully or partially on "Indian country”. Vulnerable populations are groups that are more likely to be at higher risk for poor health outcomes in response to environmental harms (see Glossary). The identification and evaluation of the needs of vulnerable populations living in overburdened communities is determined by the Project Team in cooperation with the local community during community engagement. The project Advisory Team, in advance of and during community engagement, are tasked with establishing community-centered, measurable outcomes for the project that reflect the needs determined through the engagement process.
1101.04(2)(c) Active Transportation Network Gap(s) (New Section 2023) Active transportation network gaps are identified in the WSDOT Active Transportation Plan (ATP) become a design issue based on an assessment of how well design solutions address the description of the gap in the plan. This metric is based on work performed by the CS Team, who provide a specific list of identified gaps, based on their review of the ATP, that can be addressed as described above, and coincide with or are immediately adjacent to the project limits such that it is reasonable for the project to address the gap.
1101.04(2)(d) Access to Transit (New Section 2023) Designing for access to transit involves establishing the need for new or improved facilities and features that provide convenient access to transit, rail, ferries, or aviation by active travel modes. When people are able to make efficient intermodal connections using active transportation for part of their trips, they are less likely to rely solely on a personal motor vehicle. Consider the following steps to determine the presence and incorporation of access to transit facilities:
•
•
•
•
Determine the presence of modal routes, stations, and stops within the project limits. Identify routes that active transportation users will use to access these locations. Identify facilities needed to accommodate active transportation users, based on an assessment of local context, and LTS, as applicable. Incorporate those facilities into design alternatives for evaluation and selection (Chapter 1104).
Provide specific improvements when projects lie within High-Capacity Transit areas (refer to the WSDOT HCT improvements guide for more information).
1101.04(2)(e) Comfortable Roadside Environment (Street Trees) (New Section 2023) Complete Streets are intended to provide for a comfortable environment for pedestrians and bicycles. Street trees are a common treatment associated with Complete Streets used to accomplish this urban environment goal. Street trees provide shade and help indicate an appropriately-scaled urban context to travelers. Consult with the CS Team to determine the need for trees in order to establish the desired urban environment. Also consult with subject matter expert(s) to determine the appropriate locations, types, and applications, with the limitation that trees may only be placed where 6” curbing is installed between the traveled way and the trees so not to incumber traveled ways. Work in collaboration with the local jurisdiction to establish the responsible party for maintaining street trees. Note that the project documentation required for approving installation of trees that lie within the design clear zone varies depending on whether the project lies inside or outside an incorporated city (see Section 1600.02).

The extent to which alternative designs meet these targets provides the primary basis for alternative development – alternatives do not move forward for evaluation unless they meet each of the specified baseline or complete streets performance targets (see Chapter 1104). Targets can be a single value, a range of values, or a performance outcome as defined by the Project Team in consultation with the Advisory Team. There may be situations where the targets cannot practicably be met by any alternative or where it’s been determined and documented that there would be unacceptable performance trade-offs in other performance categories. In these situations, it may be appropriate to identify trade-offs among the project’s baseline performance metrics to balance competing needs and outcomes. In these situations, determine and document a refined performance target to be carried forward into alternatives evaluation (see Chapter 1104).
1101.05 Contextual Needs During project development, opportunities often arise to address other needs that may be identified. These other needs are classified as “contextual needs,” as they reflect the context within which the project will take place. Potential sources of contextual needs include:
•
•
•
•
•
Performance gaps identified through the priority network screening that did not prioritize under a statewide biennial prioritization and budget exercise, but still exist at the project location. Needs identified through community engagement or identified by a partnering agency. Needs based on identified environmental regulations and constraints. Needs identified through coordination with WSDOT maintenance including life cycle operating and maintenance costs (see Chapter 301 for additional information). Needs and agency risks identified through increased knowledge of the project site and context.
Contextual needs serve a different role than baseline needs. Baseline needs primarily shape the alternatives developed, while contextual needs contribute to the analysis of performance trade-offs and comparison of alternatives (see Chapter 1104). Although metrics associated with contextual needs can be either quantitative or qualitative, use an objective statement to describe the need in a way that the outcome is measurable. By definition, there is no requirement that contextual needs be addressed by a project. Contextual needs are not expected to add significant project cost. ASDE and CPDM approval is required when a preferred alternative incorporates contextual needs that increase the project cost beyond addressing the baseline need(s) and Complete Streets needs where applicable. Develop metrics for contextual needs to compare alternatives. Interpret and translate each issue into a statement that is measurable, to the extent feasible. Contextual need metrics can be either quantitative or qualitative.
1101.06 Contributing Factors Analysis Contributing factors analysis (CFA) is a process by which subject matter experts on the advisory team evaluate the contributing factors associated with performance gaps in order to identify the root reasons for each gap. In the transportation field, contributing factors are any geometric, operational, context-based, or human factor that can reasonably be attributed to a performance need through data analysis and engineering judgment. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1101-5
Chapter 1101
Need Identification
Practical design relies on CFA to find the root reason(s) a need exists, rather than focusing on a symptom that may only temporarily or partially resolve the need. Note: It is recognized that completely solving a problem may not be possible by a single corrective action due to the number of contributing factors or because of constraints. The CFA method will:
•
•
Organize and identify multiple contributing factors and underlying root reasons. Formulate a number of potential countermeasures to solve the need as thoroughly and efficiently as possible.
Diagnosis of contributing factors yields the best results when data is available for the analysis. Comprehensive crash data, organized by travel mode, is important when considering safety performance. In other performance categories, where quantitative data is not available, qualitative analysis may be used to reveal the underlying contributing factor(s). Contributing factor analysis is only required for evaluation of baseline performance needs. However, it may be relevant to perform CFA for contextual performance metrics. Diagnosing contributing factors using CFA is not necessarily a simple linear process. It’s possible to find that a contributing factor identified by one discipline is the root cause of another discipline’s contributing factor. In some cases, mapping the contributing factors in a network or fishbone diagram can help identify these relationships more clearly (see the Guidance Document: Contributing Factors Analysis: Design guidance & support | WSDOT (wa.gov)).
1101.07 Project Need Statement A project need statement (or statement of need) uses the baseline needs (see Section 1101.02) and results of contributing factors analysis to succinctly describe the real root project need(s). The objective is to provide a clear, accurate plain talk description of the root needs that will facilitate the development of efficient, focused project alternatives. A need statement should:
•
•
•
•
Identify the objective, in simple, direct terms. Identify the performance metric(s) involved. Include one or more quantifiable statements. Exclude any description or discussion of potential solutions.
Consider other processes applicable to their projects that may require need statements such as: value engineering, NEPA/SEPA, and Access Revision Reports. Consider timing of these processes as well as integration and alignment of the need statements with the processes required for the project. For more information and examples of need statements, see the Writing Effective Needs Statement chapter in the Guidance Document: Design guidance & support | WSDOT (wa.gov)

Context Determination Exhibit 1102-1 Factors for Determining Initial Land Use Context
1102.01 General Overview Context refers to the environmental, economic, and social features that influence livability and travel characteristics. Context characteristics provide insight into the activities, functions, and performance that can be influenced by investments in the multimodal transportation system including the roadway design. Context also informs designs, including the selection of design controls, such as target speed and modal priority, and other design decisions. For the purposes of transportation planning and design, WSDOT divides context into two categories: land use and transportation. Each of these contexts is further defined and categorized in this chapter. Note that context categories, and the information pertinent to deriving them, may have been documented in a planning study. The concepts and method described in this chapter are adapted from National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 855: “An Expanded Functional Classification System for Highways and Streets.”
1102.02 Land Use Context This section describes the procedure for determining the land use context category on non-freeway facilities. The guidance in this section does not apply for freeways (see Chapter 1232 for the definition of a freeway). For freeways, Section 2 of the Basis of Design is used only to document the urban/rural designation as listed for the route on the State Route Log. On larger projects, more than one land use category may apply within project limits. Step 1. Determine an initial land use context category (current state) Land use context categories are described in detail in Section 1102.02(1). These categories represent distinctive land use environments beyond simply “rural” and “urban” to help determine a more accurate context. These categories influence roadway design, including determining appropriate operating speeds, mobility and access demands, and modal users. The land use categories are:
•
•
•
•
Rural Suburban Urban Urban Core
Use the following factors to determine your initial land use context category: 1. Land uses (primarily residential, commercial, industrial, and/or agricultural) 2. Density 3. Setbacks Quantify these factors through an assessment of the area adjacent to the existing or planned roadway (see Exhibit 1102-1).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1102-1
Chapter 1102
Context Determination
Step 2. Determine an initial land use context category (future state) Using the same factors and categories, consult with local agency staff, and review state, regional, and local planning documents to consider and document potential or anticipated changes to land use context. Sources of information include the local comprehensive plan, WSDOT Highway System Plan, WSDOT corridor sketches, and WSDOT planning studies in the corridor. Exhibit 1102-1 Factors for Determining Initial Land Use Context
Factor Land Use Density Density Density Density Setback Setback
Criteria Land uses within ½ mi of roadway Housing units / acre Jobs / acre Intersections per sq. mi. Typical building height Typical building setback Parking (on street or off street)
Specific metrics guiding the use of these criteria in determining the initial land use context category (both current and future) are provided on the WSDOT Design Office website. Step 3. Select final land use context category (current and future state) Once an initial land use category is determined, additional (primarily qualitative) considerations are used to verify that the selected category is appropriate. Because data used in the initial determination may be incomplete, conflicting, or difficult to interpret, it’s expected that professional judgment is used to confirm the context result. Even when the overall assessment is clear, discontinuities or transitions between categories may exist and require further interpretation. Confirm or make adjustments to the initial context category based on a qualitative analysis. Use information gathered from consultations with local agency staff, as well as the project’s community engagement processes, to validate a final determination about current and future context. Information about topography, soil type, land value, population density, average building square footage, visual assessments, aerial photos, zoning, and other local agency land use data and/or maps may also be used in this step. Document the process used to make this final context determination. Include the data used, interdisciplinary input, and issues encountered and resolved in the process. Conclude with a final land use context determination that confirms, or adjusts, the initial category(s) for the project, and seek the endorsement of this final determination from the project advisory team (see Chapter 1100).
1102.02(1) Land Use Categories The land use categories used to inform project design are described below.
1102.02(1)(a) Rural The rural category ranges from no development (natural environment) to some light development (structures), with sparse residential and other structures mostly associated with farms.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1102-2
Chapter 1102
Context Determination
The land is primarily used for outdoor recreation, agriculture, farms, and/or resource extraction. Occasionally non-incorporated communities will include a few residential and commercial structures. Rural characteristics also include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
No or very few pedestrians – except those locations used for outdoor recreation and modal connections, and where socioeconomic factors suggest that walking is likely to serve as an essential form of transportation. Bicycle use mostly recreational– except for tourist destinations, modal connection locations and between communities where bicycle commuters may be expected or where socioeconomic factors suggest that bicycling is likely to serve as an essential form of transportation. Low development density. Isolated residential or commercial activities. Commercial uses include general stores, restaurants, and gas stations, normally at crossroads. Setbacks for structures are usually large, except in the immediate vicinity of small settlements. Transit service availability is often absent or highly limited but varies widely depending on the jurisdiction. On-demand service is typically found to provide specialized transportation services.
1102.02(1)(b) Suburban Locations classified as suburban include a diverse range of commercial and residential uses that have a low or often, medium density. Suburban areas are usually (but not always) connected and closely integrated with an urban area. The buildings in medium density tend to be multi-story with off-street parking. Sidewalks are usually present and bicycle lanes may exist. Suburban areas include mixed use town centers, commercial corridors, and residential areas. Big box commercial and light industrial uses are also common. The range of uses encompasses health services, light industrial (and sometimes heavy industrial), quick-stop shops, gas stations, restaurants, and schools and libraries. Suburban characteristics also include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Heavy reliance on passenger vehicles. Transit may be present. Residential areas may consist of single and/or multi-family structures. Building and structure setbacks from the roadway vary from short to long. May have well planned and arranged multi-uses that encourage walking and biking. Planned multi-use clusters may integrate residential and commercial areas along with schools and parks. Some highways that fit this category may be designated by WSDOT as “Main Street Highways.” See Identification of State Highways as Main Streets: Appendix B.
1102.02(1)(c) Urban Urban locations are high density, consisting principally of multi-story and low to medium rise structures for residential and commercial use. Areas usually exist for light and sometimes heavy industrial use. Many structures accommodate mixed uses: commercial, residential, and parking. Urban areas usually include prominent destinations with specialized structures for entertainment, athletic and social events as well as conference centers.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1102
Context Determination
Urban characteristics also include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Various government and public use structures exist that are accessed regularly. Building setbacks are both short and long. Most streets have on-street parking. Wide sidewalks and plazas accommodate more intense pedestrian traffic. Bicycle lanes and transit corridors are frequently present. Last mile delivery vehicles and drop-off/pick-up areas on some streets. Off-street parking includes multi-level structures that may be integrated with commercial or residential uses. Some highways that fit this category may be designated by WSDOT as “Main Street Highways.” See Identification of State Highways as Main Streets: Appendix B.
Due to the differences in developmental scale among urban areas as well as growth demand urban-urban core, context boundaries change over time with the urban core area expanding in high growth situations and possibly contracting in low or no growth situations.
1102.02(1)(d) Urban Core Urban core locations include the highest level of density with its mixed residential and commercial uses accommodated in high-rise structures. There is commonly on-street parking, although it is usually time restricted. Most parking is in multi-level structures attached or integrated with other structures. The area is accessible to automobiles, commercial delivery vehicles, biking, walking, and public transit. Urban Core characteristics also include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Sidewalks and pedestrian plazas are present. Bicycle facilities and transit corridors are common. Typical land uses are mixed commercial, residential, with some government or similar institutions present. Commercial uses predominate, including financial and legal. Structures (predominantly high rises) may have multiple uses. With the highest land value of any category, setbacks from the street are small. Some highways that fit this category may be designated by WSDOT as “Main Street Highways.” See Identification of State Highways as Main Streets: Appendix B.
1102.03 Transportation Context This section describes the procedure for determining the current and future transportation context for the roadway. On larger projects, more than one transportation context may apply within project limits. Network connections are also useful in understanding the transportation context. Each transportation context is to be described in terms of the following categories and considerations:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Roadway type Bicycle route type Pedestrian route type Freight route type Transit use considerations Complete streets and Main Street highways
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1102
Context Determination
Seek endorsement from the project advisory team (see Chapter 1100) for determinations of these transportation context types and considerations, including input from local agency (local jurisdictions and transit agencies) and stakeholders. Document determination of each of these transportation contexts for both current and future states in Section 2 of the Basis of Design and carry these results forward into determination of modal compatibility and modal priority (Chapter 1103). Additional information supporting work described in this section is provided on the WSDOT Design Office website.
1102.03(1) Roadway Type The initial roadway type is defined by the designated functional classification on the WSDOT State Route Log for the route as listed below for non-freeway facilities. A final roadway type determination is based on an assessment of whether a different functional class description (given below) corresponds better to the current and future state of the facility, compared to the designated functional class for the facility. The future state is determined after an assessment of the future modal route types described below. Justify the selection of a final roadway type whether it is the same or different from the designated functional class. Freeways (including Interstate freeways) are defined in Chapter 1232. These routes typically are limited access facilities. The roadway type for freeways is freeway. Roadway types for non-freeway facilities are described as follows.
•
•
•
•
Principal Arterial – Corridors of regional importance connecting large centers of activity. These routes may be limited access facilities. Minor Arterial – Corridors of regional or local importance connecting centers of activity. Collector – Roadways of local importance providing connections between arterials and local roads. Local – Roads with no regional importance for local circulation and access only
1102.03(2) Bicycle Route Type Bicycle routes are categorized based on the purpose of the trip and the network connectivity a facility provides. Use quantitative and qualitative information about bicycle connections associated with the project location to determine the current and future bicycle route type using one of these four classifications:
•
•
•
•
Population Center Connector (PCC) The route connects closely spaced population centers (see Section 1101.04(3)) via a regional route or a route specific to adjacent population centers. These routes have the potential to attract a high volume of use by allowing access to housing, employment, and service options that are not otherwise available in one of the population centers. These routes are typically associated with partial limited access arterials. Citywide Connector (CC) — The route is part of a citywide network, provides a connection to major activity centers, or is a regional bike route stretching over several miles that attracts a high volume of use, serving a primary destination access, commute, or recreational purpose. These routes are typically associated with arterials and collectors. Neighborhood Connector (NC) — The route provides a neighborhood or sub-area connection, making connections to higher order facilities or more local activity centers, such as neighborhood commercial centers. These routes are typically associated with minor arterials and collectors. Local Connector (LC) — The route provides local connections of short lengths, providing internal connections within neighborhoods, or linking neighborhoods to higher order facilities. These routes are typically associated with collectors and local roads.

Chapter 1102
Context Determination
1102.03(3) Pedestrian Route Type Pedestrian use is described in terms of estimated volumes (current and potential future). The amount of pedestrian traffic impacts several factors, including pedestrian facility capacity, vehicular delays at signalized intersections, and most importantly, the level of risk associated from pedestrians in the travelled way. The four pedestrian route types are based on volume as follows:
•
•
•
•
P-1: rare or occasional use P-2: low volume – best measured in pedestrians per day P-3: medium volume - best measured in pedestrians per hour P-4: high volume - best in pedestrians per hour, where sub-hour peak periods are typical
1102.03(4) Freight Route Type Freight routes may not require significant additional facilities beyond those provided for other motorized vehicles if mobility and speeds of vehicular routes are consistent with freight movement. Special design consideration is commonly related to the Freight and Goods Transportation System classification. Document the classification for the project area. Contact Rail, Freight, and Ports Division for help identifying freight classifications, industry needs and truck operations. Truck route classifications can be found here: Freight Transportation System in WA (arcgis.com) Additional information: Freight plans | WSDOT (wa.gov)
1102.03(5) Transit Use Considerations Transit can provide service on any roadway type. The purposes of transit trips are similar to those of automobile trips and include commuting, work related business, shopping, personal errands, and social/recreational. The facilities and design considerations for transit uses depend on the type of transit service being provided. Note that special design consideration is required for projects that involve one or more of the following elements:
•
Fixed route type: there are three primary types of fixed-route transit service, operating along designated routes at set times (Local, Limited, and Express). If one of these services exists on the project, determine the route type using criteria shown in the illustration below and the following bullets:
Source: TRPC Report 165: Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual.
•
•
•
Local routes serve many stops along a route and emphasize access to transit over speed. Limited stop routes (also known as frequent routes, including bus rapid transit) balance transit access with speed. These routes run frequently and serve higher volume stops (e.g., major activity centers and transfer points). Express routes emphasize speed over transit access and are often used for longer distance trips.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1102-6
Chapter 1102
Context Determination
Note that in addition to fixed-route service, many agencies provide demand-response paratransit services that provide specialized transportation services in both rural and urban areas.
•
•
•
•
•
Bus rapid transit or light rail Transit signal priority installation Planned transit facilities and routes In lane bus stops and/or potential bus pullouts Facilities for people with specialized transportation needs (e.g., hospitals, senior centers, schools, transit-dependent communities, etc.)
When evaluating transit needs and the potential for transit to improve highway performance in the project area, document relevant information or data about current transit capacity and quality of service (as defined in the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual) and current and potential future use and travel markets. Include consideration for people walking and biking to/from transit connections. Contact the Public Transportation Division for help or for more information about identifying and coordinating with transit agencies and local jurisdictions that serve the project area (wwwi.wsdot.wa.gov/PubTran/).
1102.03(6) Complete Streets and Main Street Highways Complete Street contexts consider all transportation modes and provide equal priority to all modes during the alternative evaluation process. Projects that will be developed as Complete Streets are identified during a screening process (Section 1100.03(3)) and may be associated with any of the land use contexts described in this chapter.
1102.04 Documentation Document the following in Section 2 of the Basis of Design:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Land use category Roadway type Bicycle route type Pedestrian route type Freight route classification Transit use considerations Main Streets designation
Describe the process that was followed to reach these designations. If the work involved review and verification of previous work, document that process as well. If characteristics vary within project limits include the milepost ranges to which each of the designations apply. The Context and Modal Accommodation Report is a template available for use in this documentation process (see https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/designtopics/design-tools-and-support#Tools).

Design Control Selection
1103.02 Control: Design Year Design year is the forecast year used for design. The year of opening is when the construction will be complete, and the project location is fully operational. Design year selection is dependent on a decision to design for the year of opening, or for a future year based on forecast or planned conditions. Design year has historically been associated with a 20-year vehicle traffic forecast used in development of large mobility and capacity expansion projects. This is the origin of the term horizon year. Horizon year is typically considered to be 20 years from the year construction is scheduled to begin. WSDOT policy on design year is intentionally flexible. The design year can be any interim year selected between the project year of opening year and the horizon year. Many lower-cost projects result in immediate performance improvements when construction is completed. Safety projects are an example of this where the basis of design may show design year as the year of opening. Some projects may require horizon year analysis of an alternative regardless of the selected design year. A project may be required to evaluate alternatives based on the horizon year (20 years from the scheduled beginning of construction) if the project:
•
•
•
Involves a federal nexus (federal funds involved, involves federal lands, or requires federal approvals or permits) Is a Project of Divisional Interest (See Chapter 300) Is a new/reconstruction project as defined in Chapter 300
Contact the region ASDE if there are questions.
1103.03 Control: Modal Priority The concepts and method described in this section are adapted from National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 855: “An Expanded Functional Classification System for Highways and Streets” (see www.trb.org/NCHRP/Blurbs/176004.aspx)
1103.03(1) Design Users “Design users” refers to the modes that are legally permitted to use a facility. The intent in identifying design users is to highlight all user needs, recognize modal interactions, and develop an integrated system for all users. Identifying the design users is the first step in determining which modes to accommodate and prioritize. On the Basis of Design, list design users with sufficient descriptive detail. Include consideration for all ages and abilities. Division III of the document Understanding Flexibility in Transportation Design – Washington is a key resource for understanding the needs and characteristics of various design users.
1103.03(2) Modal Accommodation Modal accommodation refers to the level to which a travel mode will be addressed in the design. It is expressed on a scale of low, medium, and high, where a higher accommodation level is associated with the use of design features or criteria that tend to improve the performance of that mode compared to a lower level. Once established, the modal accommodation level is used to inform the decision on modal priority (See Section 1103.03(3)). Complete Streets projects are not required to establish modal accommodation levels nor complete a Context and Modal Accommodation Report, as they are assumed to accommodate all modes. For other projects, determine the modal accommodation level for both the current year (prior to opening) and the design year. These are referred to as existing and future conditions in the guidance that follows. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Design Control Selection
Note that in many cases, the planning documentation, data, or information in the project vicinity may not be available for the project’s design year. In those cases, identify the forecast or horizon year used by the local agency or planning organization in its work and planning products, and document the use of that year as the future year for purposes of determining the modal accommodation level. 1. An initial modal accommodation determination, for both the current and design years, are made using Exhibit 1103-2. The initial determination uses the roadway type and land use contexts that were determined earlier and documented in Section 2 of the Basis of Design (See Chapter 1102). 2. A final determination for both the current and design years is made using additional information and evidence to validate or modify the initial determination. Make the final modal accommodation determination for each mode in consultation with the project advisory team and/or subject matter expert(s), as they may recommend modifications to the initial determinations (see Section 1100.04(2) for more information about working with the project advisory team). Exhibit 1103-3 provides examples of land-use and transportation characteristics that a project advisory team or subject matter expert(s) may consider in adjusting accommodation up or down for any particular travel mode. These characteristics can represent either the current suitability of a facility to accommodate a mode, or its future strategic role with respect to accommodating that mode. Note that the Context and Modal Accommodation Report provides a template for making and documenting decisions about modal accommodation. Exhibit 1103-2 Initial Modal Accommodation Level

1103.03(3) Modal Priority Accommodate means that the roadway will be designed so that the chosen modes can use it, while accommodation level refers to the extent to which that accommodation may be required. Priority refers to the decision to optimize the design based on the performance of one or more travel modes. Modal priority is used as input to choose the appropriate geometric cross section (see Chapter 1230). Complete Streets projects are not required to establish modal priorities, as they are assumed to accommodate all modes, with none taking priority. For other projects, determine modal priority for all modes expected to use the facility using the accommodation level results, as well as other relevant information about freight, transit, and any other modes considered and documented in the Context and Modal Accommodation Report and Basis of Design. Engage the project advisory team as provided in Section 1100.04(2). If the modal priority is inconsistent with assumptions made about the project during a planning or scoping phase, work with program management staff to consider the need for any changes to project scoping documentation, including scope, schedule, and budget. Document the modal priority on the Basis of Design for both the current and future conditions.
1103.03(4) Intersection Design Vehicle WSDOT policy provides flexibility when choosing the intersection design vehicle. The purpose for this policy is to balance user needs and avoid the unnecessary expense and increased active transportation user exposure associated with oversizing intersections. Considerations include frequency of the design vehicle and effects on other design users, specifically pedestrian crossing distance and times, and bicycle turning and through movements. Consider managing vehicle turning speeds and providing more protected intersection treatments for pedestrians and bicyclists to mitigate turning conflicts. Also consider implementing mountable truck aprons to encourage slow passenger vehicle turns while still accommodating larger vehicle. An intersection design vehicle is a specific selection made at each intersection leg. Select a design vehicle that allows the largest vehicles commonly encountered to adequately complete a required turning maneuver. The objective is not necessarily to size the specific intersection curb radius (unless there is a baseline need associated with the larger vehicles), but rather to account for a reasonable path that allows the largest vehicle commonly encountered to turn without conflicts (see Chapter 1310). Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to analyze turning movements. Select low turning speeds for turn speed simulation at locations where pedestrians and bicyclists may be present. Example: At an intersection with a pedestrian modal priority that experiences infrequent turning movements by a WB-67, a smaller curb radius would benefit pedestrians due to shorter crossing times and reduced exposure to vehicles. Using turn simulation software, a practicable path for the WB-67 can be identified, even though the vehicle’s path may intrude into the second same direction lane may be necessary. Conversely, if the crossroad was identified as being within a Freight Economic Freight and Goods Transportation System Truck Corridor, with frequent turning movements from larger vehicles, it would be appropriate to size the intersection to prevent the second lane incursion. If there are pedestrians and cyclists present or latent demand at this same location, a mountable truck apron at the intersection may slow passenger vehicle turns while still accommodating larger vehicles. Consider origins and destinations of large vehicles to understand their needs at specific intersection locations. Also, consider alternatives that may help lower turning speeds and minimize pedestrian exposure.

Work with stakeholders, businesses, and service providers to understand their needs (like transit, school bus and emergency vehicle movements) and define the frequency of use at specific intersections. Municipalities may have established truck routes or restrictions that govern local freight patterns.
1103.04 Control: Access Control Access refers to the means of entering or leaving a public road, street, or highway by travelers with respect to property that abuts the facility, or by another public road, street, or highway. The regulation or control of this access (see Chapter 520) affects accessibility to the facility, and also impacts the types of activities and functions that can occur on a facility. Highway improvement projects consider the current and/or planned access control and classification in order to determine whether a change would support project baseline or contextual needs (see Chapter 1101). During the original development of the state highway system, access management functioned to preserve the safety and efficiency of regional highways. However, the level of access management can also significantly affect accessibility to land uses, modal mobility needs and the economic vitality of a place. Unless access control has already been acquired by the purchase of access rights, it is necessary to select the appropriate type of limited access control or managed access control during planning and design. Appropriate access control should be considered so as not to hinder bicycle and pedestrian accessibility, mobility, and safety. A choice to change the current or planned access control is a major decision and is to be consistent with the context, desired performance targets, and modal priorities for a location. Example: The area around a managed access Class 2 route has incurred significant development, increasing the number of local trips on a segment of the route. Over time, additional intersections and access connection permits have been granted. In this situation, it may be appropriate to consider selecting managed access Class 4 or 5 because of the changes in functions and activities along the segment over time. Conversely, a route that does not contain bicyclist or pedestrian generators within it may have a need to improve motor vehicle travel time performance, and managed access Class 1 may be appropriate. A through route solution for active travelers, such as a shared use path, may still be needed for managed access Class 1 routes. If an alteration to current or planned access is determined necessary, consult the Headquarters Access and Hearings Manager for preliminary approval for the selection, and document on the Basis of Design (see Chapter 1100). For additional information on access control and access management, see Chapter 520, Chapter 530, and Chapter 540.
1103.05 Control: Design Speed WSDOT uses a target speed approach for determining design speed. The objective of the target speed approach is to establish the design speed at the desired operating speed. The target speed selection is derived from other design controls, as well as transportation and land use context characteristics. Exhibit 1103-4 shows possible (planning level) target speeds for the various roadway types and land use contexts discussed in Chapter 1102. The target speeds shown in the exhibit are suggestions only, and the target speed for the specific location may vary from those shown in the exhibit.

Engage the public, local agency staff and officials, and transit agencies prior to selecting the target speed. Once the target speed has been selected, it becomes the design speed for the project. The goal of the target speed approach is that the speed ultimately posted on the completed project is the same as the design, and ultimately, the operating speed. In order to achieve this outcome, consider:
•
•
•
•
•
The impact of existing or proposed contextual characteristics Modal priorities Access control selection Performance need(s) Contributing factors analyses that have been developed for the project
Lowering target speed: When selecting a target speed lower than the existing posted speed, or where excessive operating speeds were identified from contributing factors analysis of the baseline performance need, consider the use of roadway treatments that will help achieve the selected target speed (see Section 1103.05(2)) during alternatives formulation. Speed management treatments are used to achieve lower vehicle speeds. When speed management treatments are proposed to accomplish a desired target speed operation, obtain concurrence from the Region Traffic Engineer and ASDE. When a design speed is proposed for a project that is lower than the existing posted speed, the approval of the State Traffic Engineer is also required. See Section 1103.05(2) below for more on speed management. Raising target speed: When selecting a target speed in excess of the existing posted speed, measures such as greater restriction of access control and segregation of modes may be necessary to reduce conflicts in activities and modal uses. Wider cross-sectional elements like lanes and shoulders are used with higher speed facilities. Careful consideration of other modal needs should be evaluated before raising target speeds. Setting the posted speed: Use caution when basing a target speed on one or more contextual characteristics that are proposed to take place after project opening, as the goal of ending up with a posted speed equal to the design speed at opening may be jeopardized. The Region Traffic Engineer is responsible for setting the posted speed on the highway once the project is completed. Target speed is only one of the considerations used when establishing posted speed. Engage and include the Region Traffic Engineer and Traffic Office staff in key decision-making that will affect the target, design, and operating speed selection. Incorporate consideration of traffic calming measures as needed. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Design Control Selection
1103.05(1) Low, Intermediate, and High Speeds To provide a general basis of reference between target speed and geometric design, WSDOT policy provides three classifications of target speed as follows: 1. Low Speed is 35 mph and below. A low target speed is ideal for roadways with pedestrian and bicycle modal priorities. Locations that include frequent transit stops, intermodal connections, moderate to high intersection density, or moderate to high access densities may also benefit from lower speed environments. Low speed facilities in urban areas typically use narrower cross section elements. 2. Intermediate Speeds are 40 mph and 45 mph. An intermediate target speed is ideal for speed transitions between high and low target speed environments. Locations with low access densities and few at-grade intersections are also examples of where intermediate speed may be appropriate. In these locations consider a higher degree of separation between motor vehicles and bicycles and pedestrians. 3. High Speed is 50 mph and above. A high target speed is ideal for motor vehicle-oriented roadways such as freeways and highways, often serving regional or longer-distance local trips. Rural connector roadways with infrequent farm or residential accesses are also consistent with the use of high target speeds. In high target speed locations consider the highest degree of separation between motor vehicles and bicycles and pedestrians. Highways with high speeds are associated with wider cross section elements.
1103.05(2) Speed Management In order to effectively achieve a target speed, a project needs to be designed to match the intended future land use context. It is usually not enough to change the operating speed of a corridor by simply changing the speed limit signs. The design of the corridor needs to match the target speed and thus match the regulatory speed (AKA speed limit). Physical changes to the characteristics of a corridor can help manage speed. When the characteristics of the corridor match with the target speed, then operating speeds are reduced to the regulatory speed. When target, operating, and regulatory speeds align, then the corridor can realize safety performance improvements and reduce the need for enforcement. The strategies presented in this section are called speed management strategies and can be deployed on a project to achieve a roadway that matches the intended context of the corridor, reduces speeds, and gets the three speed types to align. Speed management has the potential to reduce the number and severity of crashes for all users. While there are not specific crash modification factors for every speed management strategy, it is reasonable to conclude that lower speed means less kinetic energy and that can equate to less severe injury in the event of a crash. Therefore, appropriately applying speed management strategies to encourage lower speeds, may improve safety performance of a roadway. In addition, lowering speeds will also decrease the design clear zone distance as noted in Section 1600.02. Each speed management strategy (see Exhibit 1103-5) has varied effectiveness for lowering speed, while maintaining roadway function, depending on where they are installed and how they are installed. As a result, it may not be possible to say that one strategy works better than another. In addition, speed management efforts often follow an iterative approach as corridor designs evolve and some strategies work better than others at different stages of a roadway’s progression toward achieving a target speed.

Chapter 1103
Design Control Selection
Speed management strategies applied independently, in combination, or in series may be beneficial depending on the type and use of the strategies. Many speed management strategies have demonstrated varied effectiveness for single applications, however multiple strategies in series and parallel that build upon the context are more effective. Though not fundamentally speed management devices, crosswalk enhancements and bicycle strategies can help create the desired environment to achieve lower speeds based upon the contextual cues they offer to drivers. However, the speed reduction benefits of crosswalk or bicycle improvements are secondary. It should be recognized that there are usually multiple goals for improving multimodal travel on a given corridor, with speed management being one. Other goals may involve increasing vulnerable user conspicuity, providing mode specific travel space, and reducing crash exposure. Many speed management tools can address more than one goal, and lowered speeds can reduce the complexity and cost of other safety and mobility strategies for vulnerable users. For this reason, it is important to consider the final multimodal function of each corridor. The effective use of speed management strategies requires extensive collaboration with stakeholders inside and outside the WSDOT. These may include individuals from headquarters, regions, local agencies, community group, and business groups. Changes to posted speed limits require the approval of the State Traffic Engineer. Reducing the speed of a corridor can have the side effect of diverting traffic off the street where the speed management has been deployed. As a result, many agencies apply speed management across broader areas. When deploying a strategy on a state highway, coordinate with adjacent local agencies to evaluate the traffic network as a whole and to consider the possibility of traffic diversion and ways to mitigate it. Several speed management strategies are listed in Exhibit 1103-5. Each strategy has information about the typical application. Designers should consider each strategy uniquely for their project and match the strategy with the desired context. Do not apply speed management strategies as a one-size-fits-all approach. Each corridor has unique needs and therefore will deploy different strategies. Experts in other fields of study like active transportation, traffic, and maintenance should be consulted for input. The selection of a strategy should be documented in the Basis of Design (BOD) as a baseline or contextual need. In the alternatives section of the BOD, describe the strategies considered and why they were selected for the project. Some of the most effective self-enforcing speed management strategies present concerns on roads where vehicle speeds are already high. An example is a speed hump which is highly effective at lowering speed, but can create other unintended effects, like damage to a vehicle, if used where motorists are driving at higher speeds. In those locations use an iterative approach where one speed management strategy is used to begin lowering speeds and as speeds go down other strategies are used to continue lowering speeds until eventually the desired target speed is achieved. The strategies in Exhibit 1103-5 are typically highway strategies. In areas not on the state highway system, there are other strategies that can be deployed that are not listed in this exhibit. Ideas for these locations can be found in the resources listed at the end of this chapter. The strategies in Exhibit 1103-5 are grouped into categories (e.g., delineation, horizontal deflection, pinch points) and further described by their attributes. Each strategy group is explained as follows:
•
Delineation: These speed management strategies can add or change roadway delineation. They can be paint or plastic markings and may include raised pavement markings or tubular markers/flexible bollards. These strategies do not modify the pavement. When stripes are reapplied, consider the use of a wide line to add emphasis to the strategy.

Horizontal Deflections: These strategies may be achieved with curbed features, planter strips, pavement markings, or with additional fixed delineators. These strategies are more appropriate on intermediate speed or low speed facilities. When introducing this strategy on high-speed facilities, the strategy should utilize paint striping, in addition to using other strategies preceding the deflection, rather than constructing hardscape features. Horizontal deflections are commonly installed at the entrance to roundabouts. Vertical Deflections: This speed management strategies change the roadway elevation. They are designed to meet the target speed. The Institute of Transportation Engineers have written a recommended practice on speed humps, see A Guide to Speed Reduction Techniques, Planning and Design of Speed Humps, Speed Tables, and Other Related Measures (Institute of Transportation Engineers, 2022). Raised crosswalks and intersections are where the crosswalk or the entire intersection is raised. Vertical deflections are not appropriate for high-speed segments. Pinch Points: This strategy uses striping, roadside features, or curb extensions to temporarily narrow the vehicle lane. Pinch points are commonly applied at intersections as bulb-outs. Gateways can be installed along a corridor to introduce a change in context. Circular Intersections: Roundabouts (compact, mini, and modern) are designed to a particular circulatory speed and have warning signs that indicates this speed. Because of their low circulatory speed, they can have speed management effects on the corridor in proximity of the roundabout. They can be applied in a variety of locations and a variety of speeds. Design criteria for roundabouts are contained in Chapter 1320. The neighborhood traffic circle is a small island in the center of an intersection. As the name implies, these are intended for neighborhoods and are not applicable on state highways. ITS: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) uses technology for transportation applications. Some ITS can affect drivers’ travel speed choices. They can be applied in various speed situations and in various contexts. Application of ITS for speed management should be coordinated with your Region Traffic Office. Streetscape: Streetscapes can be installed on the side of the street or in the median. Streetscapes encourage lower speeds by emphasizing a multimodal context and creating a feeling of confinement for drivers. There is a lot of variety in what constitutes a streetscape, including the nontransportation functions they perform. Streetscapes are often created in collaboration with a local agency, citizens group, or business district. They may require a lot of maintenance to remain effective. Work with the partners who help design the streetscape to determine who will be responsible for maintenance. Streetscapes are typically applied in low-speed environments. Deploying streetscapes in intermediate or high-speed roadways may require barrier protection and as such will not have as significant of a speed management effect. Roadway Reallocation: Roadway reallocation means to change the roadway surface to dedicate some of the surface to other modes, parking, or traffic movements. Each of these speed management measures repurpose the road to give less priority to the through vehicle. The action of vehicles slowing to turn, or park, causes “friction” with the through vehicles which cause the drivers to adjust their speed accordingly. The design criteria are found in other chapters of the Design Manual based upon the design elements that you are modifying. Roadway reallocation is usually done by changing the striping, however sometimes you can change curbing or install physical separation.

The list of strategies in Exhibit 1103-5 is not an all-encompassing list. There may be new and emerging strategies that can be applied on a project as a trial or pilot study. When new strategies are applied, it is important to communicate and collaborate with the fields of expertise like Active Transportation, Region Traffic, HQ Transportation Operations, HQ Design, and Maintenance. Each strategy is described with respect to a series of attributes that are the headers along the top of Exhibit 1103-5. These attributes can help a designer understand more about the strategy and whether it would be beneficial (or appropriate) on their project. These attributes are guidelines and engineering judgment must be applied when a strategy is selected for inclusion in a project. The attributes shown in the headers across the top of Exhibit 1103-5 can be described as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
Speed: These are the speeds for which the strategy is typically applied. The definition of these speeds is found in Section 1103.05(1). Land Use: The land use context describes where the strategy is typically applied and reflects the future land use context. To successfully change context requires partnering with the stakeholders. For further information on land use context, see Chapter 1102. Hard/Soft Infrastructure: Hard infrastructure is a physical change that is relatively permanent. Soft infrastructure are items that can be easily changed or removed. Some items that are listed as soft can also be hard but are usually deployed as soft due to cost. Cost: Initial cost is what the items typically cost when first installed. The ongoing cost is what it would cost on an annual basis for maintenance. Ongoing cost does not cover if the item is damaged, vandalized, or stolen. These numbers should be adjusted for your location because project specific issues can impact the cost. Partners can contribute to either initial or ongoing maintenance cost through written agreements. Maintainability: The maintainability rating is based upon a scale of easy to hard and reflects the ease to conduct maintenance such as snow plowing, weed control, sweeping, restriping, setting up traffic control, and landscaping. Some of this work can be done by local agencies or private entities through written agreement. Consult with the people who will be conducting the maintenance to determine if there are design options that can decrease the need for maintenance.

1103.06 Control: Terrain Classification Terrain may limit operational and safety performance for particular modes. While terrain impacts may be addressed at specific locations, it is not cost beneficial to modify terrain continually throughout a corridor. The type of terrain, context, and speed influence the potential operating conditions of the highway and should be a consideration when selecting mobility performance targets (See Chapter 1101). For more information on grades, see Chapter 1220. To provide a general reference between terrain and geometric design, three classifications of terrain have been established: 1. Level: Level to moderately rolling, this terrain offers few or no obstacles to the construction of a highway having continuously unrestricted horizontal and vertical alignment. 2. Rolling: Hills and foothills, with slopes that rise and fall gently; however, occasional steep slopes might offer some restriction to horizontal and vertical alignment. 3. Mountainous: Rugged foothills; high, steep drainage divides; and mountain ranges. Designate terrain as it pertains to the general character along the alignment of a corridor. Roadways in valleys or passes in mountainous areas might have the characteristics of roads traversing level or rolling terrain and are usually classified as level or rolling, rather than mountainous. See the Highway Log for terrain classification.

1104.01 General Washington State Department of Transportation practical design policy requires formulating and evaluating alternatives while considering acceptable performance trade-offs to meet the need(s) of a project at the lowest level of investment. This chapter discusses how:
•
•
Information determined from planning phases and Chapter 1101, Chapter 1102, and Chapter 1103 is utilized in alternative solution formation To evaluate the alternative solutions developed
1104.02 Environmental Documentation Considerations This chapter presents methods for developing alternatives. For projects requiring an Environmental Assessment (EA) or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), a final proposed alternative may only be determined through the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process and/or the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) process (see Chapter 400 of the Environmental Manual for more information). If an EA or EIS has not been initiated under NEPA/SEPA, follow the procedures in this chapter. To help advance the project, consider and use appropriate NEPA/SEPA terminology. Perform public and agency outreach and document all information regarding alternatives development for use later in the NEPA/SEPA process, according to 23 USC 168 (d). Terminology used in this chapter assumes that NEPA/SEPA have not been initiated. In the event that the NEPA/SEPA process has been initiated and an EA or EIS will be required, coordinate with the region Environmental Office staff to make sure that this alternative formulation and evaluation is performed in accordance with NEPA/SEPA guidance.
1104.03 Alternative Solution Formulation Identify alternatives that address the baseline need while balancing the performance trade-offs identified in the process. This performance-based, data-driven approach can include analysis of multimodal trade-offs and the formulation of multimodal/intermodal solutions, potentially reducing travel demand. Reference need identification and contributing factor analysis (CFA) in the alternative solution formulation (see Chapter 1101 and Contributing Factors subsection of the Guidance Document for more information). Beyond the no-build option, conduct alternative solutions formulation according to the following principles:
•
•
•
•
Formulate alternatives that are compatible with context and design controls. Provide at least one alternative for evaluation that employs lower-cost approaches and efficiencies, such as Transportation Systems Management and Operations strategies (see Section 1100.04(6)). Consider incremental, phased solutions. Formulate alternatives that address, but do not exceed, the specific needs and problems. Consider possible forward compatible alternatives to better allow for future improvements.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1104
•
Alternatives Analysis
Form solutions around contributing factors or the underlying root reason(s) identified from CFA. Address the underlying root reason(s) determined from CFA in at least one alternative.
Evaluate the relative benefit between each alternative against the baseline (typically the no-build option) and contextual performance metrics to determine the optimally performing solution for the least cost. (See Section 1104.04(3) for information on calculating the benefit/cost of alternatives.) Document the multimodal, environmental, operations, safety, maintenance and other impacts of the alternatives as appropriate. Planning phase corridor sketches or studies may be used to identify WSDOT’s strategy for the corridor. If a planning phase has occurred, develop at least one alternative based on the strategy identified in the planning report. See the Alternative Strategies and Solutions subsection of the Guidance Document for more information regarding different strategies that may be considered. If a planning study has developed specific alternatives, and those alternatives are still relevant, carry those alternatives into the alternative evaluation process.
1104.03(1) Complete Streets Alternatives (New Section 2023) In addition to the preceding guidance to consider during alternatives formulation, the following additional requirements apply to Complete Streets projects and are generally the responsibility of the Project Engineer in consultation with the Complete Streets (CS) Team, with support from subject matter experts such as Region Traffic office. During the alternatives formulation process, develop and recommend several Complete Streets alternatives that specifically address and are in alignment with one or more of the following strategies:
•
•
•
•
minor investments in existing facilities that can serve in place of additional investment on the state route reallocation of existing space to active transportation modes (See NCHRP 1036 Guide for Roadway Cross Section Reallocation for more information) expanding the cross section to accommodate active transportation modes, and measures to reduce vehicle speeds increase separation in order to achieve the target level of traffic stress
Once alternatives have been developed, seek feedback from the affected community, through a specific and targeted outreach effort, on the concepts developed during the alternatives formulation process described above. Incorporate feedback as appropriate to modify and improve the alternatives. Once feedback has been considered and incorporated, capture the findings in the BOD.
1104.04 Alternative Solution Evaluation Alternative solution evaluation involves analyzing the design year performance benefits provided by a solution with respect to the amortized cost. It is the intent of the alternative solution evaluation process to:
•
•
•
•
Compare solutions that resolve the baseline need(s) in consideration with the benefits or impacts associated with the contextual needs. Analyze the relative value of each alternative, including associated performance trade-offs. Considerations should also include agency risks, resource constraints, and life cycle operating and maintenance costs. Mitigate unacceptable performance trade-offs with proven countermeasures. Refine targets if mitigation measures applied yield unacceptable performance trade-offs.

Chapter 1104
Alternatives Analysis
1104.04(1) Alternatives Comparison WSDOT’s alternatives comparison process is intended to align with performance-based decision-making. The process is complementary to a practical design approach. The process centers around achieving the basic performance need, while understanding and when necessary, mitigating for the potential effects to other performance areas. Use the Alternative Comparison Table (ACT) within the BOD to assist in evaluating alternatives with respect to the anticipated performance of each identified baseline and contextual needs, as well as other identified impacts to the project location associated with each alternative. The intent of comparing alternatives is to:
•
•
•
•
•
Obtain an alternative solution for the least cost while understanding associated performance trade-offs. Compare alternatives against their ability to accomplish the baseline need. Evaluate alternatives against their relative effects on contextual needs. Provide the opportunity to incorporate mitigation or countermeasures. Document alternative formulation and evaluation outcomes that are consistent with the environmental process and expectations.
Note that if there are a large number of contextual needs and other impacts under consideration, it may be beneficial to prioritize or use a weighted evaluation of the contextual needs in order to expedite the alternative evaluation. As discussed in Section 1104.03, at least one alternative based on the outcome of Contributing Factors Analysis should be compared against other alternatives.
1104.04(2) Performance Trade-off Decisions In performance trade-off decisions, the intent is to give priority to the project’s baseline needs. However, there will be situations where evaluations reveal that trade-offs are too significant, and there is an inability to adequately resolve them with low-cost countermeasures, phased solutions, or general acceptance of the performance trade-off. In these situations, it is appropriate to consider alternatives that still optimize the baseline performance metric, but do not necessarily obtain initial performance targets. Document refined performance targets on the Basis of Design. Whether a design alternative achieves a particular contextual performance target is a consideration during the tradeoffs analysis. When no alternative adequately balances performance, lower-cost countermeasures can be employed to help mitigate performance issues and improve the viability of alternatives. Modifications to one or more design controls are another approach that can be used to achieve performance targets (see Chapter 1103), without adding cost. If all alternatives fail to find an acceptable performance balance targets may be refined. Document changes to performance targets using the Basis of Design.
1104.04(3) Benefit/Cost Analysis The overall benefit/cost for the alternatives proposed is inherent with understanding the performance tradeoffs being considered. Although a factor for all potential alternatives, in some cases, decisions will be based on quantifiable life cycle operating and maintenance costs, as discussed in Chapter 301. Some perceived benefits are a challenge to quantify and will need analysis such as that discussed in NCHRP Report 642: Quantifying the Benefits of Context Sensitive Solutions: www.trb.org/Publications/Blurbs/162282.aspx

Alternatives Analysis
1104.05 Preferred Alternative The Project Team consults with the Advisory Team for input on the appropriate tools to employ when selecting the alternative to move forward and review the Alternatives Comparison Table and any other relevant documentation related to the alternatives evaluation. The goal is to select the alternative based on documented input from of all team members, included any changes, mitigation, tradeoffs to incorporate into the selected alternative as a result of this review. The Project Engineer provides the final approval of the selected alternative, and also assumes responsibility for the alternative selection decision. Projects identified to implement Complete Streets may develop alternatives that propose to defer scope or Complete Streets elements, in part or whole, to a future project. The decision to defer work is approved by the Region Administrator or designee (See Design Bulletin #2023-01).
1104.06 Documentation The Alternative Comparison Table (ACT) is used to assist in evaluating alternatives. Alternative formulation and evaluation will also be documented through the NEPA process. Environmental staff will help account for consistency with the environmental process, expectations and requirements throughout any alternative formulation and evaluation that occurs within project development.

Design Element Selection Exhibit 1105-1 Required Design Elements
1105.01 General Design elements are specific components associated with roadway design, such as lane widths, shoulder widths, alignments, clear zone, etc. Design controls (see Chapter 1103) are carefully chosen and used to determine the dimensions of design elements. The relative effect that a given design element will have on performance will depend on the selected design controls and context identification. For more information, see the guidance document section titled The Research Summary of Different Design Elements on Performance.
1105.02 Selecting Design Elements Design elements that are included in a project are documented in the Basis of Design. Include the design elements that are changed by the project. (See Chapter 1100 for more information about Basis of Design.) An element is changed if one of the following applies:
•
•
•
A new element is added An existing element is removed or relocated A dimension - such as a width - is modified
A design element that is not changed is not documented in the Basis of Design. The next step after selecting design elements is to choose the appropriate dimension for each element. (See Chapter 1106 for information on selecting design element dimensions.)
1105.02(1) Required Design Elements and Criteria There are also additional legal and policy-based considerations that require a decision of whether or not to include certain design elements in a project; this depends on the program or sub-program. See Exhibit 1105-1 for additional information regarding whether or not to include these design elements in a project.

Design Element Selection
Exhibit 1105-1 Notes: [1] Include the element in the project and apply policy and guidance provided in the Design Manual chapter(s) or section(s) listed in the cell. [2] Include the element in the project and apply the policy and guidance provided in the Design Manual chapter(s) or section(s) listed in the cell only when the element is changed as described in Section 1105.02. [3] Consult the Assistant State Design Engineer (ASDE), evaluate the site specific need to determine whether to apply the policy and guidance provided in the Design Manual chapter(s) or section(s) listed in the cell.* [4] Include the element in the project when it is changed as described in Section 1105.02. If the element is to be included, apply the policy and guidance provided in Chapter 1120, as well as that provided in the Design Manual chapter(s) or section(s) listed in the cell. * The ASDE is responsible for bringing in other expertise as needed from appropriate HQ units such as Traffic, Programming, Planning, etc. to collaborate in the decision to include the element in the project.
1105.03 Related Elements Design elements can be interrelated. Even if a specific design element has not changed in accordance with the definition in Section 1105.02, consider whether or not the preferred alternative has changed the conditions in a way that may affect the performance of an unchanged element, considering all modes. Example: A project team proposes to provide a left-turn lane along a portion of their project in order to address a baseline need related to safety for turning traffic, by reducing the width of each highway shoulder. By reducing the shoulder width, the traveled way will be closer to the roadside than in the existing condition. The project team determines whether the project would adversely affect safety performance due to roadside conditions such as steep slopes or objects in the clear zone along with considering impacts to bike and pedestrian use.
1105.04 Documentation Document design elements that are changed in Section 5 of the Basis of Design (BOD) form unless the exemptions listed in Section 1100.05(1) apply. As a design alternative matures over time, it is likely that design elements may be added or dropped through the iterative process inherent with design. It is important to update the Basis of Design documentation with these changes at the various documentation and approval milestones. The Basis of Design is available to download here: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/designtopics/design-tools-and-support#Tools

Design Element Dimensions Exhibit 1106-1 Dimensioning Guidance Variations Exhibit 1106-2 Mode/Function/Performance Approach
When choosing any dimension, read the guidance for the specific facility type (for example, for ramps see Chapter 1360) and also read the guidance for the specific element (for example for side slopes see Chapter 1239). When a range of dimensions is given, consider modal needs, required function, and desired performance (Section 1106.03) and, where possible, use quantitative tools to help choose a dimension within the range.
1106.01 General Practical design resolves the project need with the least investment. Flexibility in the choice of design element dimensions helps accomplish this. For guidance related to geometric cross-section elements, first see Chapter 1230. For guidance related to all other design elements, see the appropriate chapter.
1106.02 Choosing Dimensions Depending on the facility type, Design Manual guidance may come in the form of a single dimension or a range of dimensions to choose from. See Exhibit 1106-1. For some roadways, the optimum solution is very dependent on the location (context) of the roadway. In these cases, you will likely see a range of widths to choose from. For example, the geometric cross section guidance chapters for highways (Chapter 1231) and freeways (Chapter 1232) show cross-sections that list ranges to choose from for lane and shoulder widths. The mode/function/performance approach described in Section 1106.03 is the tool to be used to choose the appropriate width from the range given.

Design Element Dimensions
Exhibit 1106-1 Dimensioning Guidance Variations
Example: Exhibit 1360-21 calls out one specific dimension for the lane width of this section of a parallel off connection.
Example: Exhibit 1231-2 calls out a range of dimensions for the lane width. When a single dimension is given: If the decision is to use the dimension shown, no further evaluation is needed; just document the dimension choice on the Design Parameter Sheets. If a particular roadway warrants use of a dimension that is different than the value given, the mode/function/performance approach described in Section 1106.03 can be used to determine the appropriate dimension. Results will need to be documented in a Design Analysis. When a range of widths is given: Understand any width considerations specific to the design element (for example, lane width considerations are described in Chapter 1231). Use the mode/function/performance approach described in Section 1106.03 to choose the appropriate value within the range. If the dimension chosen is within the range given in the Design Manual, document the reasoning in the Design Parameter Sheets. If the value chosen is outside of the given range, document the decision in a Design Analysis. Some dimension choices can be complex, and involve trade-off evaluations, including comparisons of alternatives, benefit/cost analysis, etc. In these instances, it may be appropriate to record the dimension choice on the Design Parameter Sheets and reference any related documents that support the dimension choice.
1106.03 The Mode/Function/Performance Approach The mode/function/performance approach is the primary methodology to apply when a range of dimensions is given. Utilizing this approach ensures that modal needs, the function of the design element, and safety and mobility performance have all been considered. For example, lanes and shoulders have to accommodate the modes that use the roadway, provide functions that are appropriate for the specific roadway, and provide appropriate safety and mobility performance.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1106-2
Chapter 1106
Design Element Dimensions
Modes, function and performance overlap and are interrelated. These considerations are part of a tradeoffs discussion. Cost is always a consideration in a tradeoffs discussion. Engineering judgment and stakeholder involvement will be required. Exhibit 1106-2 Mode/Function/Performance Approach
Modal accommodation: It is important to understand the modal needs for a roadway. Accommodating a specific mode (or modes) may influence the dimension choice. For example, it is important to understand the vehicle mix that will be using the lanes and to understand the modes that will be using the shoulder. For lanes, a significant number of trucks and oversized vehicles may affect the lane width choice, especially if the alignment is not tangent. Read Chapter 1231 when choosing lane widths. For shoulders, it is important to understand bicyclist and pedestrian use. The width requirements that come with accommodating various modes are discussed in Chapter 1239. Function(s): Function is closely related to modal accommodation. Providing a specific function may drive the dimension choice. For example, the shoulder width requirements that come with providing various functions bring a wide range of associated widths (see Exhibit 1239-2, Shoulder Function & Modal Accommodation Width Considerations). Performance: When choosing a dimension from a range of possible choices, consider safety performance and mobility performance. Meeting safety or mobility performance targets may drive the dimension choice. When evaluating performance, the use of quantitative engineering methods and tools is encouraged whenever possible. See Section 1106.05 for more information on quantitative tools and methodology for evaluating safety and mobility performance. An important consideration of performance evaluation is whether or not the project has an identified baseline (or contextual) safety need. If safety need has been identified, performance metrics and targets may play a major role in choosing dimensions. See Chapter 1101. For some projects, modal accommodation needs may drive lane and shoulder width decisions. In other cases, the need to provide a specific function may drive width decisions. And, in some cases, meeting established performance targets may drive width decisions. Regardless of whether modal accommodation, function, or performance drives the dimension choice, the effect of the decision on mobility and safety performance has to be considered.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1106-3
Chapter 1106
Design Element Dimensions
Accommodating modal needs, providing specific functions, or achieving specific performance targets may require widths that can bring significant investments. Consider the cost and associated trade-offs, and document why it is worthy of the associated investment. In addition to being the primary method to choose a dimension when a range of dimensions is given, the mode/function/performance approach can also be used in support of a Design Analysis.
1106.04 Design up Method When a range of dimensions is given, guidance may specifically require a “design up” approach. For example, Chapter 1231 requires a design up approach for state highways other than freeways. Design up means considering the smallest dimension first. Increasing dimensions are then considered until the smallest dimension is identified that accommodates modal needs, provides the desired functions, and provides appropriate safety and mobility performance. Using the mode/function/performance approach described in Section 1106.03 is an important part of design up.
1106.05 Quantitative Analysis Methods and Tools Currently, two primary tools exist to quantitatively evaluate performance; the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) for evaluating modal safety performance and the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) for evaluating traffic operational mobility performance.
1106.05(1) Highway Safety Manual and Safety Modeling Safety is and always has been a primary performance category for WSDOT. Past design policy relied on the assumption that the application of design criteria equated to a desired level of safety performance for the expenditure. This assumption may not have always been true for all locations given their operational and geometric characteristics. The strict application of criteria to achieve safety performance is known as “nominal safety.” To achieve a more reliable safety performance, scientific estimation of crashes using site conditions is necessary and is termed “substantive safety.” A new understanding of safety performance, crash modification factors, and roadway functions has led to a growing body of knowledge about the relationship between roadway characteristics and safety performance. The application of the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) and its companion tools provides an understanding of how a particular design can perform with respect to safety. This enables analysis of safety-specific performance metrics that may be more critical to address. The HSM covers multiple transportation road types and can be a valuable tool to analyze various geometric alternatives in any program type. For guidance regarding whether or not to include a baseline safety need see Chapter 1101. For more information on sustainable highway safety tools and analysis, see Chapter 321.
1106.05(2) Highway Capacity Manual and Traffic Modeling The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) provides quantitative methods for evaluating mobility operational performance. However, some quantitative outputs from some HCM methods are specific to free-flow speed operations or level of service, and may not be appropriate for use given the baseline mobility performance metric selected for a specific location. Traffic modeling software provides a more relevant method for understanding the mobility operational performance; however, the reliability of the outputs varies given the traffic forecasting for design years further in the future. Utilize traffic modeling to ascertain potential mobility operational performance whenever feasible. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Design Element Dimensions
1106.06 Documenting Dimensions While a primary function of the Basis of Design is to document the design elements selected to be included in a project, another primary function of the Design Parameter Sheets is to document the dimensions chosen for the various design elements included in a project. Important Note: If the dimension for an existing design element does not change, no documentation is required on the Design Parameter sheets. A Design Parameter Sheet entry left blank means that the element was not selected to be included in the project. (See Chapter 1105 for design element selection guidance.) A Design Parameter Sheet template can be found here: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/designtopics/design-tools-and-support#Tools.
1106.07 Design Analysis A Design Analysis is required when a dimension chosen does not meet the value, or fall within the range of values, provided for that element in the Design Manual (see Chapter 300.) The considerations described in Section 1106.03 may be useful when completing a Design Analysis.

The elements listed here may be in addition to the project need identified in the Project Summary or Basis of Design. See Sections 1120.02(12) for P1 projects, or 1120.03(1) for P2 and P3 Projects. Preservation projects may also provide opportunities for project partnering and retrofit options involving additional elements (for example see Section 1231.08). In addition to the guidance in this chapter, preservation projects with total costs greater than $500,000 will be analyzed and screened to determine whether the project will be required to incorporate the principles of Complete Streets. Projects requiring Complete Streets must complete a Basis of Design to address and document the Complete Street design requirements (geometric, cross section, intersection, etc.). Follow all guidance provided for that purpose (Chapter 1100 – 1106, and other relevant geometric design chapters). Preservation projects are funded in three sub-program areas: Roadway Preservation (P1) projects preserve pavement structure, extend pavement service life, and restore the roadway for reasonably safe operations of the travel modes accommodated by the facility. Structures Preservation (P2) projects preserve the state’s bridge network through cost-effective actions. There are numerous types of bridge preservation actions including: deck rehabilitation, seismic retrofit, painting steel bridges, scour repair, and others. Other Facilities (P3) projects preserve the function of guardrail and signing, major drainage, major electrical, unstable slopes, and other assets. For required design elements in these programs see Exhibit 1105-1. Existing roadside safety devices (see Section 1600.01) may remain in place unless a project scope specifically identifies it for replacement. Specific guidance for repair of certain existing devices is also provided (see Section 1120.02). When a roadside safety device replacement is required, and a policy specific to the device is not found in this chapter (or in scoping instructions for P2 and P3 projects), apply the most recent standard described in Division 16 when selecting a replacement.
1120.02 Roadway Preservation (P1) This section applies to features and design elements to be addressed on Roadway Preservation (P1) projects. See Section 1120.02(12) for instructions on using the Basis of Design to document design elements that are changed by the project.
1120.02(1) Adjust Existing Features Adjust existing features such as monuments, catch basins, drainage grates, and access covers that are affected by resurfacing. Where drainage grates and gutter pans require adjustment or replacement, replace with designs that accommodate bicycle traffic (see Drainage Grates and Manhole Covers in Chapter 1520). For guidance on existing curb see Chapter 1239. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Preservation Projects
1120.02(2) ADA requirements Address ADA requirements according to WSDOT policy (see Chapter 1510 and any active project delivery memorandums or design memorandums).
1120.02(3) Cross slope lane Rebuild the cross slope to a minimum 1.5% when the existing cross slope is flatter than 1.5% and the steeper slope is needed to provide adequate highway runoff. See Chapter 1250 for more information about cross slope.
1120.02(4) Cross slope shoulder When rebuilding the lane cross slope, evaluate shoulder cross slope in accordance with Chapter 1250.
1120.02(5) Vertical clearance Paving projects, seismic retrofit, and other project work can change the vertical clearances of structures. For preservation projects other than bridge replacement that have no widening on or under the bridge, the minimum structure clearance is 14.5 feet. Existing structures with a vertical clearance less than 14.5 feet require a Design Analysis. If the vertical clearance of a structure will be changed by the project, use Sections 720.03(5)(c) and 1020.03(2) for vertical clearance requirements. Include vertical clearance and any other changed geometrics in the Basis of Design, the Design Parameters sheets, and the Design Documentation Package. See DM Section 720.03(5)(c) for details about bridge clearances for existing structures and Section 1020.03(2) for vertical clearance of overhead sign assemblies. Contact the Commercial Vehicle Services Office when changes to vertical clearance are planned.
1120.02(6) Delineation Install and replace delineation in accordance with Chapter 1030 (this includes pavement markings, guideposts, and barrier delineation).
1120.02(7) Barrier and Terminal Heights When the preservation project design, other than a chip seal or BST, will affect the elevation of the pavement adjacent to a guardrail, terminal, and/or transition, measure the height of those systems within the project limit and adjacent to pavement edges, curbs, or sidewalks prior to construction.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1120-2
Chapter 1120
Preservation Projects
Measure the height to the top of the rail element from the outside paved shoulder edge when no curb is present, from the gutter line when guardrail is set above a curb, or from the sidewalk elevation if set behind a sidewalk. Guidance for this situation:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
When the height of existing Type 1 guardrail, crashworthy terminals, and/or transitions will fall outside the height range from 26.5” to 31” (26.5” to 30” for terminals) in the project’s completed condition; the existing guardrail, terminals, and/or transitions must be adjusted to a minimum height of 28” up to a maximum height of 30”. This includes buried terminals that slope down such that the guardrail height is reduced to less than 26.5-inches (measured in relation to a 10H:1V line extended from the breakpoint at edge of shoulder). See Section 1610.04(3) for acceptable options to raise standard runs of guardrail, and Section 1610.04(5) for raising guardrail terminals. Replace the Type 1 guardrail system with a Type 31 guardrail system if its height cannot be adjusted to fall within the specified range. When the height of existing Type 31 guardrail, crashworthy terminals, and/or transitions will fall outside the height range from 28” to 32” in the project’s completed condition; the existing guardrail, terminals, and/or transitions must be adjusted to a height of 31”. This includes buried terminals that slope down such that the guardrail height is reduced to less than 28-inches (measured in relation to a 10H:1V line extended from the breakpoint at edge of shoulder). See Section 1610.04(3) for acceptable options to raise standard runs of guardrail, and Section 1610.04(5) for raising guardrail terminals. Replace the existing Type 31 guardrail system with a new Type 31 guardrail system if its height cannot be adjusted to fall within the specified range. When non-crashworthy terminals need to be raised, replace them with crashworthy terminals. Provide replacement terminals in accordance with Section 1610.04(5)(a or b). Non-crashworthy terminals and anchors that are effectively shielded by another barrier do not warrant replacement. When guardrail needs to be raised, evaluate the guardrail length of need in accordance with Chapter 1610. Notify Region Program Management if the length of need extension will be longer than 250 feet. Extending length of need further than 250 feet is beyond the scope of the pavement preservation. Note that removal is an option if guardrail is no longer needed based on the guidance in Chapter 1600 and Chapter 1610. Document the location of removal and the reasoning for removal in the Design Documentation Package. When adjusting terminals that are equipped with CRT posts, the top-drilled holes in the posts need to be at the surface of the ground. When designing a pavement overlay in front of concrete barriers (Type 2, Type F, Single Slope), follow policy guidance shown Section 1610.06(2) for allowable barrier minimum heights after the overlay. Contact HQ Bridge for allowable bridge barrier minimum heights resulting from a pavement overlay.
1120.02(8) Barrier Condition (New Section 2023) Remove and replace existing barrier that has been determined to not be in serviceable condition. See Section 1610.03(2). If a roadside safety device within the project limits does not meet NCHRP 350 or MASH testing standards, then replace the device with a comparable MASH device. See Section 1610.03(2).

Preservation Projects
1120.02(9) Barrier Removal or Replacement (New Section 2023) When raising barrier height or addressing barrier condition per Sections 1120.02(7) or 1120.02(8), barrier removal is also an option if the barrier is no longer needed based on the guidance provided in Chapter 1600 and Chapter 1610. In the case of a decision to remove barrier, document the location of the barrier removal and the reasoning in the Design Documentation Package.
1120.02(10) Pavement Edge Treatment Adding a pavement edge treatment is a low-cost feature to improve safety performance for errant vehicles that depart and try to reenter the roadway. A pavement edge treatment can also help maintain the structural integrity of the roadway and pavement performance at the edge of the roadway by resisting the start of pavement cracking and/or pavement raveling. Where practicable, install a pavement edge treatment at locations where asphalt concrete pavement is applied to the outside edge of the existing pavement. Examples where pavement edge treatment may not be practicable include locations with roadside barrier and/or curb. After installing the pavement edge treatment, trim shoulders with material that is graded back over the edge treatment and flush with the paved roadway surface. Where the project does not affect the existing shoulder edge condition, such as during chip seal applications or “mill and fill” activities, and there is an existing vertical drop at the outside edge of the paved shoulder, apply crushed surfacing material to eliminate the edge and provide a smooth surface. For more information about pavement edge treatment, contact the HQ Design Office, and visit the FHWA website at: www.fhwa.dot.gov/innovation/everydaycounts/edc-1/safetyedge.cfm
1120.02(11) Rumble Strips Potential new rumble strip locations are identified using a benefit cost analysis performed by HQ Design. Refer to sections 1600.05(1), 1600.05(1)(b), and 1600.05(1)(c) when notified by HQ that rumble strip installation or rehabilitation needs to be considered during scoping or design. These sections will also provide guidance on whether a low-noise design is appropriate for the location. Bituminous Surface Treatment (BST or chip seal) applications have been observed to reduce the depth of rumble strip millings by approximately 1/8” per application. Although rumble strips have a minimum depth shown on the applicable standard plan during original installation, research has shown that a rumble strip minimum depth of ¼” can still be considered functional. Therefore, only re-install rumble strips when a pavement preservation project is anticipated to reduce the depth of a rumble strip to less than ¼” during the course of project activities (such as a BST application). Existing rumble strip depth may be determined by direct measurement or through BST history (contact the region Materials Engineer). When re-installing rumble strips, contact the region Materials Engineer to review options and determine the best approach to rumble strip re-installation and sequence. Methods for determining milling depth in the field, and reliably establishing route BST history are still in development. Contact your ASDE for more information.
1120.02(12) Horizontal Chain-Link Fence Rails (New Section 2023) Replace or modify existing chain-link fence located within the Design Clear Zone per Section 1600.03(2)(i).

1120.02(13) Documentation (P1) For Roadway Preservation (P1) projects, use the Basis of Design and Design Parameter Sheets to document decisions when the project changes design elements that are not listed in Section 1120.02(1) through 1120.02(12).
1120.03 Structures Preservation (P2) and Other Facilities (P3) For Structures Preservation (P2) and Other Facilities (P3) projects see the scoping instructions specific to the sub-program and type of work to determine the likely design elements to be addressed by the project. If there are questions about project scope or policy requirements, consult your Assistant State Design Engineer (ASDE).
1120.03(1) Documentation (P2 and P3) See Chapter 300 for documentation requirements. If the project changes a geometric design element, replaces an existing bridge, or installs a new bridge additional documentation may be required; contact your ASDE to discuss appropriate documentation.

1130.01 Overview This chapter pertains to WSDOT’s Development Services involvement with land use development proposals and projects led by local jurisdictions, transit agencies, tribes, and developers. This chapter provides policy and instruction to WSDOT Region Development Services staff. It is also intended as a reference for SEPA lead agencies and developers WSDOT engages with on land use reviews and transportation mitigation. WSDOT staff engage with these partners to identify the impacts and the opportunities that come with land use changes, seeking informed, contextually balanced multimodal mitigation through the SEPA lead agency. Mitigation means to reduce significant adverse impacts, to help preserve the state multimodal transportation system. Our Development Services program is administered by Region staff who have knowledge of state highways, including maintenance and operations, infrastructure, and other needs of the multimodal transportation system. Regions have established contacts with lead agencies that permit development. Regions review land use developments for impacts to the state transportation system, process permit applications, administer state highway access connections, and have a role in mitigation for developments. WSDOT’s goal is to provide a safe, sustainable, and integrated multimodal transportation system for all Washington travelers, regardless of age, ability, income, ethnicity, or mode of transportation. Added automobile trips to and from new development often result in impacts to the transportation system which can be costly to mitigate while also inducing more auto-based travel. WSDOT encourages partners to promote solutions that better support multimodal options. Development that supports access by walking, bicycling, and transit is essential towards reaching this goal. This chapter:
•

Lists the common types of development mitigation. Describes the nexus between WSDOT’s Development Services program and state law, specifically the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) and the Growth Management Act (GMA). Describes parties’ roles and responsibilities in the development process. Presents multimodal data and threshold criteria needed to conduct professional reviews and analyses of proposed developments. Guides staff and partners in the agreement-making and permit processes. Describes WSDOT policy, procedures, manuals, and forms required to successfully design and construct a mitigation project on the state highway system. Describes the construction document preparation process. Describes the construction oversight and final inspection/acceptance process. Defines requirements for documentation.

Aside from this chapter, Region Staff and partners are directed to other chapters of this Design Manual, Development Services web-based guidance, and WSDOT manuals needed to successfully carry out this work. References are provided throughout. Types of development mitigation include:
•
•
•
Developer funded and constructed transportation improvements; Financial contributions to programmed WSDOT or local agency projects; and/or Dedication of property for right of way.
Developer Community Engagement The Developer should plan and budget for leading outreach and community engagement for development mitigation projects on the state transportation system.
1130.02 WSDOT Development Services Policy Our policy is to engage with our partners during planning and project development processes, to be part of the land use and transportation decision making. Our goal is to collaborate, to review and identify traffic impacts of new development as well as opportunities to reduce vehicle miles travelled. Region Development Services is our agency’s contact for SEPA reviews. Staff exercise WSDOT’s legal authority and interest to engage local agencies, tribes, and developers on land use development proposals and seek mitigation for significant adverse impacts to the state multimodal transportation system resulting from development. SEPA is discussed in Section 1130.04. Regions have local knowledge about development trends and multimodal highway operations and performance needs, planning study recommendations, and other considerations that influence analysis and identification of mitigation alternatives. Development Services staff engage region experts including planning, maintenance, traffic, environmental, design and construction, active transportation, utilities, hydraulics, local programs, real estate, and others to support the process and to inform analysis and decision making about mitigation. WSDOT Regional Development Services staff collaborate with and support jurisdictions with land use authority and developers through these activities:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Serve as a project manager for the project’s progress through the necessary WSDOT processes to contribute to project success. Promote greater consideration of the state’s transportation systems and modal assets during local land use planning and decision-making. Review and provide technical input on various proposals (SEPA documents, Transportation Impact Assessments (TIAs), and other documents) on how development plans may affect the Highway System Plan, active transportation connectivity and crossings, comprehensive plans, operations, safety, and region surplus property reviews. Evaluate appropriate contextual mitigation strategies. Make binding decisions while negotiating with developers and local agencies to resolve issues related to land use development plans impacting state facilities proposed by private developers and land owners, local agencies, tribes, transit and human services transportation agencies, and ports. Understand application of local regulations, WSDOT policies, threshold criteria, state laws and statutes, and administrative rules related to SEPA and GMA. Explain different possible ways to mitigate effects and provide multimodal options.

Facilitate successful mitigation projects by guiding developers through our processes, explaining the data and information we need to successfully support their projects. Provide developers with WSDOT compliance and standards for design and construction; help expedite their mitigation projects on the state transportation system. Serve as WSDOT’s representative for land use related hearings and processes. Administer the state’s access management program.
1130.03 Local Agency and WSDOT Authority 1130.03(1) Local Decision-Making Authority Under SEPA and GMA, a local government makes local land use decisions. The local decision-making authority is typically delegated to a hearings officer, planning commission, city council, board of commissioners, or an administrative body such as a Variance Committee or Design Commission. Each type of land use action has prescribed procedures. Different kinds of procedures are subject to different requirements regarding public notice, participation, approval criteria, hearings, and appeal deadlines. WAC 197-11-050 specifies that the lead agency shall be the agency with main responsibility for complying with SEPA's procedural requirements and shall be the only agency responsible for:
•
•
The SEPA threshold determination; and Preparation and content of environmental impact statements.
1130.03(2) WSDOT’s Role in Development Review WSDOT’s authority to review land use proposals and request or require mitigation is founded in state law, specifically the State Environmental Policy Act, the Growth Management Act, and through our state managed and limited highway access connections laws, policies and procedures.
•
•
•
•
•

WAC 197-11-920 regards WSDOT as possessing special environmental expertise relating to transportation; and as an agency with expertise in the local development review process similar to local and state water, sewer, or fire protection agencies. As an agency that possesses special expertise in the state transportation system, WSDOT has established standards, policies, and mitigation thresholds for system function, safety, and performance, particularly for driving trips. These standards, policies, thresholds, and local approval criteria are applied to the applicant’s development proposal to form WSDOT’s mitigation recommendations to the local government. When developers request connections to the state system, WSDOT may require improvements to the transportation system as a condition of issuance of a highway access permit. Any such requirement must be appropriate and reasonable to mitigate the impact to the transportation system resulting from the development. In other cases, WSDOT works with the lead agency and developer to request recommended development mitigation that is appropriate and reasonable. The responsibility for a land use decision is with the local governing body. Like other interested parties, when there is legal standing, WSDOT can appeal the local land-use decision.

1130.04 State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) The State Environmental Protection Act (SEPA) requires state agencies, counties, cities, and public corporations to evaluate and determine mitigation for the environmental impacts of land use proposals. Provisions of SEPA require the lead agency to involve other agencies, tribes, and the public in most review processes prior to a final decision being made. Region Development Services staff review and comment, when warranted, on all (non-WSDOT) SEPA proposals forwarded to WSDOT for review and comment by lead agencies. WSDOT is considered an agency with transportation expertise and reviews all proposed development projects that are not exempt and that could possibly have significant adverse impacts on the state highway system. The following is from the Department of Ecology’s SEPA FAQ: Q: What is a "significant" adverse environmental impact? A: State SEPA rules defines "significant" as "a reasonable likelihood of more than a moderate adverse impact on environmental quality." The term “reasonable likelihood” means it is not remote or speculative. The phrase “more than moderate” is based on intensity and severity; intensity depends on the magnitude and duration of an impact while severity is weighed along with the likelihood of its occurrence. An impact may be significant if its chance of occurrence is not great, but the resulting environmental impact would be severe. The transportation thresholds in this chapter are what WSDOT identifies as significant so that mitigation can be requested and provided. While these are predominantly auto-based thresholds, WSDOT is a multimodal agency, and development of new performance metrics, and thresholds is expected. When WSDOT is permitting a development access connection to a state highway or is the permitting authority for another developer purpose on WSDOT right of way, WSDOT can require developers to mitigate impacts created by their developments. Otherwise, WSDOT works through the SEPA lead agency to fashion developer mitigation requirements.
1130.04(1) SEPA Proposals Under SEPA a proposal means a proposed action. A proposal includes both actions and regulatory decisions of agencies as well as any actions proposed by applicants. Proposals can be:
•
•
Project Action, such as new construction, demolition, landfills, and exchange of natural resources. Non-Project Action, such as comprehensive plans, zoning changes, and development regulations.
WSDOT involvement and SEPA review at the non-project stage can realize more benefits to the transportation system, as this is when there is the most latitude for adjustments.
Types of SEPA Proposals While some proposals are brought to the attention of WSDOT by the proponent or by Development Services staff reviewing the DOE SEPA Register, most project proposals are submitted to WSDOT by the applicable SEPA lead agency. The following are some of the typical submittals WSDOT receives: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

SEPA Exemptions Not all proposals require a SEPA review. Some project proposals will be categorically exempted from SEPA review if their size or type of activity is deemed unlikely to cause a significant adverse impact. WSDOT does not typically review projects with a CE SEPA determination. However, the agency does work with the project lead if there are non-SEPA WSDOT approvals or other actions needed. WAC 197-11-800 Categorical Exemption provides that some proposals can be exempted from SEPA reviews because the development falls within the established minimum SEPA thresholds. See this WAC for examples of exempt proposals. For more information about SEPA and requirements, see the WACs and Department of Ecology’s SEPA website. https://ecology.wa.gov/regulations-permits/SEPA-environmental-review Note that multiple exempted projects could affect WSDOT’s ability to review impacts fairly and accurately, and in the cumulative, could create an unforeseen adverse impact on the state transportation system. Consider developing an interlocal agreement with the lead agency, or other options.
1130.04(2) SEPA Development Proposals of Interest to WSDOT The type, location, and scale of a proposed development influences how WSDOT evaluates an individual project, and if mitigation is recommended, what forms that should take. WSDOT has high interest in proposals that would impact:
•
State transportation system operations and safety for all modes, including access to and from the state system.
•
Stormwater systems within WSDOT rights of way.
•
Utilities within WSDOT rights of way.
However, other impacts to the state highway system may occur, such as noise, light and glare, fencing requirements, legal load limits, or off-premises outdoor advertising impacts. Because of potential impacts, WSDOT has interest in many types of land use developments, including but not limited to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Site adjacent to or proposes access to state highway. Site not adjacent to the state highway but would contribute a “significant” number of trips to the highway. Land divisions or lot line adjustments for property with frontage on or proposed access to a state highway. Site located in footprint of future state highway or trail alignment. Proposed noise-sensitive land uses adjacent to state highways. Site located adjacent to a railroad right of way or could affect a state highway rail crossing. Site located adjacent to a trail, shared-use path, or sidewalk, or could affect a state highway crossing for active transportation users.Airport expansions. Land use/development proposals that could affect state airport expansions, such as cell towers, or noise-sensitive land uses in the vicinity of public use airports.

Utility connections or corridors on WSDOT rights of way Comprehensive plan amendments and zone changes, including map and text amendments.
Multimodal Transportation and Contexts WSDOT is interested in how development can accommodate active transportation modes. Mixed use development could have a positive effect on multimodal trip generation, meaning reduced trips by automobile and increased trips by bicycling and walking. Review the multimodal considerations presented in Section 1130.09, as well as other chapters in this manual.
1130.04(3) Land Use Appeals Contact the HQ Access and Hearing office when considering a decision to appeal a land use determination by a local agency. WSDOT should also consult with the Washington State Attorney General’s Office. There are short timelines in which to file appeals. A time delay could prejudice WSDOT’s right to appeal.
1130.05 Growth Management Act (GMA) The GMA was adopted to address ways to accommodate growth while preserving and advancing a high quality of life in Washington. It requires many cities and counties, and other jurisdictions that choose to opt in, to complete comprehensive plans and establish development regulations. WSDOT’s interest in GMA and land use is as a tool to manage demand on the transportation system to contribute to the creation of productive, equitable, and sustainable places. Below are selected points in state law that recognize WSDOT and the state transportation system. This is not all inclusive and staff should have working knowledge of laws and rules. RCW 36.70A.020 Planning goals. The following are some of the stated goals to guide development and adoption of comprehensive plans and development regulations of those counties and cities that are required or choose to plan under RCW 36.70A.040.
•
•
•
Urban growth. Encourage development in urban areas where adequate public facilities and services exist or can be provided in an efficient manner. Reduce sprawl. Reduce the inappropriate conversion of undeveloped land into sprawling, low-density development. Transportation. Encourage efficient multimodal transportation systems that are based on regional priorities and coordinated with county and city comprehensive plans.
RCW 36.70A.040 Who must plan. Specifies which agencies must plan and allows others to choose to opt into the planning process. This process includes preparing and updating comprehensive plans. RCW 36.70A.070 Comprehensive plans—Mandatory elements. This state law requires certain elements to be addressed in plans, including transportation. The comprehensive plan of a county or city that is required or chooses to plan under RCW 36.70A.040 shall address transportation. The following points about transportation elements are based on RCW 36.70A.070(6).

A transportation element implements, and is consistent with, the land use element. A transportation element must also contain subelements:
•
•
•
Land use assumptions used in estimating travel. Estimated traffic impacts to state-owned transportation facilities resulting from land use assumptions to assist in monitoring the performance of state facilities, to plan improvements for the facilities, and to assess the impact of land-use decisions on state-owned transportation facilities. Facilities and services needs.
The Facilities and Services requirements of comprehensive plans contain multiple provisions, many of which are described here:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
An inventory of transportation facilities and services, including transit alignments, and state-owned transportation facilities within city or county jurisdictions. Level of service standards for all locally owned arterials and transit routes to serve as a gauge to judge performance of the system. These standards should be regionally coordinated. Address state-owned transportation facilities, level of service standards for highways, as prescribed in chapters 47.06 and 47.80 RCW, to gauge the performance of the system. LOS standards are used to monitor performance of the state system, to evaluate improvement strategies, and to facilitate coordination between governments. Concurrency requirements generally do not apply to transportation facilities and services of statewide significance. Specific actions and requirements apply to locally owned transportation facilities or services that are below an established LOS standard. Ten-year traffic forecasts based on the adopted land use plan are used to inform on the location, timing, and capacity needs of future growth. Identification of state and local system needs to meet current and future demands, consistent with the statewide multimodal transportation plan required under Chapter 47.06 RCW. Collaborative efforts to identify improvements for pedestrian and bicycle facilities and corridors as well as TDM solutions to transportation needs.
GMA requires concurrency for transportation facilities. For transportation, concurrency means improvements or strategies are in place at the time of development, or that commitment is in place to complete the improvements or strategies within six years. The purpose of concurrency is to ensure that the public facilities and services necessary to support development are adequate to serve that development at the time it is available for occupancy and use, without decreasing service levels below established minimum standards. Level of Service (LOS) and Local Planning. The GMA requires local agencies to include the LOS standards for highways of statewide significance (HSS) within their comprehensive plans. These LOS standards can then be used as one method to assess the need for transportation mitigation measures. The Legislature enacted RCW 47.06.140 in 1998 - the “Level of Service Bill.” The main elements of the law are: Local agencies must include transportation facilities of statewide significance (including interstate highways, interregional state principal arterials, and statewide ferry service) in their comprehensive plans consistent with the statewide transportation plan. WSDOT, in consultation with local governments, shall set level of service standards for state highways and state ferry routes of statewide significance. For regionally significant state highways (Non-HSS), the LOS is set through a collaborative process with Regional Transportation Planning Organizations (RTPOs) and local governments.

Chapter 1130
Development Services
Improvements to facilities and services of statewide significance identified in the statewide multimodal plan are essential state public facilities under RCW 36.70A.200 (refer to RCW 47.06.140). No local comprehensive plan or development regulation may preclude the siting of essential public facilities (RCW 36.70A.200(5)). Note: SEPA applies to jurisdiction even if they do not plan under RCW 36.70A.040.
1130.06 Highway Access Connections When reviewing requests for access connections onto a state highway, identify the type of access control for the route and apply policy and procedures accordingly. Some main points:
•
•
•
•
If a developer seeks a highway connection, WSDOT can require mitigation. This is done when WSDOT conditions improvements to the transportation system during issuance of highway access permits. WSDOT may deny a connection due to safety, operational, or other reasons. An Intersection Control Evaluation (consult Chapter 1300) may be required for new access points, or substantial changes in traffic volume on existing access points.
1130.06(1) Managed Access Control Chapter 47.50 RCW, Chapter 468-51 WAC, and Chapter 468-52 WAC define WSDOT authority, standards, and procedures for the management of access to managed access state highways to maintain functional use, highway safety, and preservation of public investment consistent with adopted local comprehensive plans. Cities and towns permit access connections on managed access highways within their boundaries. WSDOT may provide guidance/recommendations/clarifications upon request. NOTE: A city/town is also responsible for having their own connection and must use standards that meet or exceed WSDOT standards per RCW 47.50.030(3). The WSDOT Region is the access connection permit authority for locations outside corporate limits. Connection Permits and fees vary (consult WAC 468-51-070)
•
•
•
•
Connection categories are based on projected use volumes and other characteristics. Category II and III connection proposals require a traffic analysis, signed by a professional engineer, licensed in accordance with Chapter 18.43 RCW. Connections are designed and constructed to WSDOT standards. Mitigation may be required involving construction on the state highway. WSDOT may require a Developer Agreement in addition to the connection permit (refer to Section 1130.10). The applicant completes DOT Form 224-694 Application for Access Connection Permit Managed Access Highways Only and provides the appropriate nonrefundable fee. WSDOT determines if the permit will be granted. For new connections, use Form 224-005, and for existing connections use 224-006 (internal website only).
Refer to Chapter 540 for more information.
1130.06(2) Limited Access Control Chapter 47.52 RCW, Chapter 468-54 WAC, and Chapter 468-58 WAC govern WSDOT authority, standards, and procedures for the establishments of limited access highways and the purchase of access, light, view and air rights from abutting property owners. Connections to limited access highways are administered by WSDOT HQ Access and Hearings. Refer to Chapter 520 and Chapter 530.

1130.07 Early and Ongoing Coordination The review process begins when the Region becomes aware of a project proposal. Often this occurs when the local agency sends the land use proposal to WSDOT for review. On some occasions the proponent will contact WSDOT first before formally submitting the project to the local agency. Developer Services staff can also proactively reach out to the local agency to inquire about proposed or planned projects. Early coordination is the formal or informal process developers use to identify the potential impacts for a land use proposal and to establish expectations of the interested agency requirements. Benefits of early and ongoing coordination include:
•
•
•
•
•
Advanced knowledge and awareness of land use and transportation plans and projects. Understanding the proposal’s impact on the state highway before mitigation design has progressed too far. Early coordination helps optimize multimodal outcomes. WSDOT / developer collaborating on the TIA document and proposed mitigation. Sharing/leveraging resources among local and state agencies. Time savings up front on work that would otherwise need to be done during the comment deadlines.
Development Services staff also monitor websites and plans including:
•
•
•
Department of Ecology’s Statewide SEPA register. County and city websites. Department of Commerce’s Plan View site.
Consult local agency comprehensive plans, WSDOT planning studies and statewide plans to help inform transportation system needs and mitigation. Examples include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Community Engagement Plans. Washington State Highway System Plan. Washington State Active Transportation Plan and local agency related plans such as parks, trails, and pedestrian and/or bicyclist master plans. Washington State Public Transportation and local/regional transit agency plans. Washington State Human Services Transportation Plans. Washington State Rail, Freight, Ferries, and Aviation Plans. Corridor and area planning studies. More information on WSDOT’s Planning process is available online at: https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/planning/default.htm
1130.08 Establishing Reimbursable Accounts Reimbursable accounts are used so that WSDOT can be compensated by the developer, local government or tribe for agency time invested in their project proposal. The reimbursable account is usually established prior to plan review and often prior to TIA review.
•
•
Administration of compensation for these review charges is through a reimbursable (Jx) account. Consult Chapter 9 of the Agreements Manual (Consultants: Please contact your WSDOT Project Manager for access to the Agreements Manual) and consult with Region Financial Services office for how to set these up. The developer is billed monthly for the outstanding balance in the account.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-9
Chapter 1130
•
•
•
Development Services
Reimbursable costs include: TIA reviews, plan for approval and construction plan reviews, agreement preparation and construction inspection, and administrative overhead. These costs vary depending on the complexity of the project, the number of required revisions to plans and the amount of time required for construction inspection. Use Project Review Reimbursable Agreement Form 224-102.
A quick review of the proposal and SEPA checklist will usually indicate the likelihood of impacts to WSDOT facilities. WSDOT normally does not charge for review time when:
•
•
•
•
There are very minor review requirements. The review only deals with a simple Access Connection Permit application to a farm, single-family residence, or a short plat. If the applicant is a local, state, or federal agency, cities, counties, tribes, or FHWA, and no work is being proposed within the WSDOT highway right of way. The amount of money chargeable is not worth the cost of collection. An example of this is a project that requires a single one-hour review of a TIA.
Each region should develop an objective set of guidelines that define when a developer should open a reimbursable account. For example, a region may require reimbursable accounts only from developments that are directly adjacent to a state route and generate 10 or more peak-hour trips.
1130.09 Review Procedures and Criteria The Development Services objective for land use proposals is to determine if Region will recommend or require mitigation to the lead agency, and if so, what options or form that should take. Note: WSDOT can require mitigation when we issue connection permits, or other permits to use WSDOT right of way. Review land use proposals from many contextual, operational, and performance driven perspectives. This includes multimodal transportation planning, safety, active transportation connectivity, motor vehicle traffic operations, system operation and maintenance, multimodal access and accommodation, and existing or proposed public transportation services. Apply the criteria in this section, or as agreed upon with the lead agency and developer, to make the determination. Note: Development Services Staff and local agencies negotiate the terms of each Interlocal Agreement. In these cases, the Interlocal Agreement would specify thresholds and other expectations (refer to Section 1130.11). If mitigation will be recommended, follow the procedures in Section 1130.10 to formalize an agreement. The Review Procedure begins with a land use proposal and accompanying documents. WSDOT Development Services staff:
•
Receive a land use proposal from the lead agency. The notice accompanies the SEPA document. For a DNS, a SEPA checklist is included.
Review the document and supporting information and data for quantifiable transportation impacts. Use the questions in Exhibit 1130-1 as a test to determine if the Region has no concerns or objections or if it needs to evaluate further. Follow the next set of questions in Exhibit 1130-2 and Exhibit 1130-3 to determine if mitigation is needed.
•
Determine if enough information has been provided, like a TIA, to fully evaluate the proposal.

Apply the WSDOT Threshold Criteria in Section 1130.09(2). Consider establishing a reimbursable account (See Section 1130.08).
1130.09(1) Evaluating Land Use Development Proposals Apply the following questions in Exhibit 1130-1 to determine if a proposal should be evaluated further or if region has no concerns with the proposal and will not request mitigation. Exhibit 1130-1 Preliminary Assessment Land Use Proposal Preliminary Proposal Assessment Filters

Y/N
If the answer is NO to all of the questions in Exhibit 1130-1, then there may be no probable significant adverse impact to the state highway system and no further WSDOT analysis or response is required. Note: WSDOT may submit an email to the local agency stating WSDOT has no comments. This confirms to the local government that WSDOT received notification and conducted a review. However, due to resourcing, WSDOT may not respond in these cases. If the answer is YES to ANY of the above questions, further review is necessary. Use the questions in Exhibit 1130-2 and Exhibit 1130-3 and the criteria in Section 1130.10 to further assess potential impacts to the state transportation system.

1130.09(1)(a) Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) When the review process concludes that a development has significant adverse impacts then mitigation is warranted. The Traffic Impact Analysis usually recommends conceptual improvements that will mitigate the impacts. A local agency will typically require that the developer satisfy WSDOT about the details of that mitigation. Such details are usually resolved in an agreement between the developer and WSDOT that permits construction of highway improvements (or traffic mitigation payment to a WSDOT project).
•
•
•
Lead agency typically requires proponent to prepare a TIA. If a TIA has not been prepared, ask that it be provided. Collaborate with the developer and lead agency on the TIA development, if possible. An Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) may be needed (refer to Chapter 1300).
Review TIA and test for Significant Adverse Impacts
•
•
•
•
A TIA should clearly describe trip generation estimation methodology, state assumptions, data collection methodology, and identify potential impacts to the transportation system, including state highways in terms of location, timing, and magnitude. Request TIA updates or additional information if needed. Assess traffic impacts on state highways and ferry routes in terms of the number of trips generated (per ITE Trip Generation Manual) as the result of a land use or policy change. In addition to motor vehicle trips, estimated traffic impacts should also include transit, bicyclist and pedestrian trips depending on context. Collaborate with multidisciplinary groups and the proponent. Consider all travel modes, needs and context including Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), network connectivity, safety, crossing treatments, and route directness considerations for active transportation users. Review available corridor planning studies. These studies and plans involved significant participation from members of local communities, so they are valuable resources for understanding what stakeholders want with respect to the state transportation system.

Refer to Chapter 320 for TIA procedures and details. Apply WSDOT Criteria below.
1130.09(2) WSDOT Threshold Criteria WSDOT’s goal is to provide a safe, sustainable, multimodal transportation system for all users. Our performance criteria will evolve as WSDOT develops new performance metrics. This section provides criteria used by WSDOT to determine if significant adverse impacts to the transportation system would be likely because of proposed land use development. Criteria include:
•
•
•
•
•
Projected number of added automobile trips to the state highway Level of service standards Channelization thresholds Safety performance for the traveling public, including active transportation and transit users. Considerations of bicyclist, pedestrian, and transit modes
When the criteria or considerations in this section indicate probable significant impacts, respond to the lead agency with request to formalize mitigation. This is the beginning of the developer mitigation agreement process presented in Section 1130.10. Development-generated motor vehicle trips are the most common cause of significant impacts. However, it is important to address all modes when establishing mitigation alternatives. Apply the criteria in the subsections below to determine 1) probable significant adverse impacts, 2) the need for additional information and analysis, and 3) potential mitigation design alternatives with all parties. WSDOT’s goal is to optimize mitigation such that all travel modes have been addressed. Interlocal agreements between WSDOT and Local Agencies may supersede some threshold criteria (consult Section 1130.11 Interlocal Agreements.)
1130.09(2)(a) Vehicular Trip Thresholds WSDOT identifies any proposal that meets or exceeds either or both of the following vehicular trip criteria to have a probable significant adverse impact to the state highway system. 1. Addition of ten (10) or more AM or PM peak-hour vehicle trips assigned to an individual approach leg to a state highway intersection. 2. Addition of twenty five (25) or more AM or PM peak-hour vehicle trips assigned to a state highway segment (2-way travel) or intersection (total 25 trips all legs).
1130.09(2)(b) Level of Service (LOS) Thresholds Level of Service Thresholds When a development would degrade a highway’s LOS below the applicable established threshold, the highway segment or intersection impacted would be identified as a probable significant adverse impact, and parties should seek to establish mitigation of the traffic impacts. Apply development-generated trips to the network volumes, to determine if an established LOS threshold would be exceeded. LOS thresholds are established per state law to gauge the performance of the system. Refer to Chapter 36.70A.070 RCW and Chapters 47.06 and 47.80 RCW for information. WSDOT cannot require mitigation when we are not permitting a connection to the state highway or providing another type of permit to use WSDOT rights of way. Work in good faith with the lead agency and developer to recommend mitigation.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-14
Chapter 1130
Development Services
General established LOS standards are as follows, however, check for exceptions or differences applicable to specific locations under consideration. Highways of Statewide Significance (HSS) including their ramp intersections:
•
•
Urban Areas: Rural Areas:
LOS “D” LOS “C”
Regionally Significant State Highways (non-HSS):
•
•
•
The LOS thresholds adopted by the local MPO/RTPO shall apply. In the absence of an adopted LOS threshold, the LOS for HSS shall apply. Where there is a specific Interlocal Agreement with WSDOT, the applicable LOS threshold levels as established by the agreement shall apply.
When LOS is already below established thresholds When a development affects a highway segment or intersection where the LOS is already degraded from the applicable threshold, any additional development related traffic would be identified as a probable significant adverse impact. The pre-development LOS is the condition to preserve through mitigation. The average vehicle time delay associated with the pre-development LOS is used rather than the otherwise applicable deficiency level. Example: If the pre-development and post-development LOS at an intersection is F, with the average vehicle time delay of 80 and 95 seconds respectively, then the appropriate mitigation is to make the necessary improvements to bring the average vehicle time delay back to 80 seconds or less. The LOS thresholds apply to intersections. The bases for evaluating LOS are the methodologies agreed upon between the developer and WSDOT. Automobile Congestion and delay can be evaluated using two different methods:
•
•
If using level of service (LOS): Are there segments of the highway that are below the LOS threshold or will fall below the LOS threshold as a result of the development? If using volume/capacity (v/c) ratio: Are there segments of the highway that already exceed or will exceed the v/c ratio-threshold as a result of the development?

1130.09(2)(c) WSDOT Channelization Thresholds Addition of twenty-five (25) or more AM or PM Peak-hour vehicular trips (2-way) to an intersection or access connection that meets or exceeds the Design Manual guidelines for channelization will be considered a probable significant adverse impact. Consider all potential users of the facility in the design of an intersection. This involves addressing the needs of a diverse mix of user groups, including passenger cars, heavy vehicles of varying classifications, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Turn channelization and especially slip lane additions make conditions more challenging for pedestrians and bicyclists. These changes increase crossing distances and intersection complexity and may increase driver turning speeds. Refer to Chapter 1310 for channelization guidance. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-15
Chapter 1130
Development Services
1130.09(2)(d) Safety Performance Thresholds Addition of ten (10) or more AM or PM peak-hour vehicular trips (2-way) to a highway location identified through an I-2 safety program will be considered a probable significant adverse impact. WSDOT primarily uses two screening methodologies to identify locations that require further safety analysis on state highways. These are the Collision Analysis Location/Collision Analysis Corridor (CAL/CAC) and the Intersection Analysis Location (IAL) programs. The regions use the CAL/CAC and IAL lists to prioritize safety improvement projects in developing their construction programs. When a development proposal impacts a CAL/CAC or an IAL, WSDOT may require reasonable mitigation even if the LOS thresholds are not exceeded or Design Manual channelization warrants are not met. Mitigation may take the form of developer-constructed improvements or traffic mitigation payment to a state project if one is programmed for the CAL/CAC or IAL location. Coordinate with Regional Traffic and Program Management staff to create a list of CAL/CAC and IAL projects from the biennial logbooks with reasonable solutions and cost estimates for improvements that would mitigate the deficiencies. This project list could provide the basis for mitigation assessments for development impacts. Refer to the WSDOT Safety Analysis Guide, Section 8.3 for guidance.
1130.09(2)(e) WSDOT Field Assessment Program WSDOT may consider other safety threshold requirements, including locations identified through the Field Assessment Program. Field assessments are a programmatic approach to review all state highways to identify safety improvement opportunities, evaluate potential benefits and risks, and develop lower cost spot safety enhancements. Safety is always considered when assessing traffic impacts. The effects of sight distance, roadway geometry, alignment, context, travel speed, turning speed, roadway width, access, and volume of turning movements should all be considered. While a TIA may conclude that the traffic impacts to a state highway will not exceed LOS thresholds or other criteria, the Region Traffic Engineer may still request reasonable intersection improvements based on safety concerns. If the Region Traffic Engineer does request a mitigation improvement that does not otherwise meet the thresholds listed in this chapter, then the Region Traffic Engineer must document the engineering basis and analyses for the improvement in an engineering study or other report that clearly justifies the reasons for requesting the mitigation improvement. Refer to the Traffic Manual Chapter 9 for more information on the Field Assessment Program.
1130.09(2)(f) Active and Public Transportation Both active transportation and transit provide essential travel options for those who do not choose to or who cannot drive themselves. Work with the developer, tribe, or lead agency to evaluate active and public transportation system impacts and needs to determine mitigation that provides safety, mobility, and accessibility for all users of the multimodal transportation system.
•
•
•
Review the TIA, SEPA document, Lead Agency and WSDOT planning documents, including the state Active Transportation Plan. Determine how needs for bicyclist and pedestrian infrastructure including network connectivity, route directness, safety, and level of traffic stress should be considered in the mitigation. Consult the WSDOT Active Transportation Plan for guidance. Consult with your Region’s Active Transportation Coordinator.

Active Transportation Facilities Active transportation refers to people engaged in human-scale and often human powered travel, such as walking or bicycling. A variety of small devices facilitate such travel, for example use of skateboards, scooters, and wheelchairs. Some devices provide low-power assistance or propulsion, such as electric bicycles. Active travel modes are more commonly employed in urban and town center contexts where distances between destinations and other factors make these modes efficient and desirable. Urban locations often make greater investment in safe and comfortable infrastructure like sidewalks, crossing enhancements and bicycle facilities. Some suburban highways also provide sidewalks, bike lanes, and shared use paths. However, as driving speeds and lane number and complexity increase, the need for lateral separation between vehicle and active modes and enhanced crossing features increases. Even in rural locations, active travelers may need to cross highways to access transit or school bus stops or travel along highways to complete trips. New developments may increase rural active travel trips or make existing trips more challenging. Refer to WSDOT Active Transportation Plan. Considerations should address:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
What is known about the current and planned state of the active transportation network in this location? Is this a context in which people walk or ride bicycles to everyday destinations like stores, schools, jobs, parks, and other places? Is the location near existing or planned transit stops, multimodal hubs, and multi-use trails? Are there person trip generators present or planned? Is there a need for certain facilities that afford access for all ages and abilities? Can people make a 15-minute walk or bike ride to nearby destinations? How can recommended mitigation improve access between destinations? Is it possible to increase the percentage of everyday short trips made by walking or bicycling? Are highway crossings safe and convenient, such that crossings provide a low level of traffic stress and adequate route directness? Do posted and design speeds provide drivers with sufficient time to see people crossing and stop?
Public Transportation Transit service helps provide travel options for those who do not choose to or cannot drive themselves. Do people in this setting have access to transit services? Is Transportation Demand Management (TDM) an option for mitigation?
•
•
If so, what is the frequency and type of service provided? In population centers consider designs and tradeoffs that provide safe and convenient access to transit enabling people to move along and cross highways to reach transit stops from new developments.

Use the procedures and instructions in this section to formalize agreement between WSDOT, the developer, the Lead agency, or both to fulfill agreed upon mitigation to the state multimodal transportation system. The basic process overview includes WSDOT and the Developer, and sometime the local agency:

•
•
•
Select a WSDOT Agreement form. Document improvement mitigation using Summary of Design (SOD) Developer Prepare preliminary plans for approval. Developer prepares contract plans and other documents. Upon review and approval those become part of the agreement. A financial guarantee such as a bond is established by the developer. The agreement is signed and executed.
1130.10(1) Developer and Construction Agreements When a mitigation determination results in a requirement for transportation improvements, the agreement process begins. A developer is typically directed by the SEPA lead agency to coordinate the construction details with WSDOT. The Developer’s TIA should recommend conceptual improvements that will mitigate the impacts. The lead agency typically requires that the developer satisfy WSDOT regarding the details of that mitigation. Such details are usually resolved in an agreement between the developer and WSDOT that permits construction of transportation improvements (or a mitigation payment toward a WSDOT project). Developer Agreements are contracts between WSDOT, the developer and sometimes a local agency, stating each party’s rights and responsibilities, and describing the proposed work. Agreements typically include a standard agreement form, right of way plan sheet(s), and a complete set of specifications and engineering plans. The developer agreement may include, but is not limited to: plans; specifications; maintenance requirements; bonding requirements; inspection requirements; division of costs by the parties, where applicable; and provisions for payment by the applicant of actual costs incurred by WSDOT in the review and administration of the applicant's proposal that exceed the required base fees in Chapter 468-51-070 WAC. Development mitigation is made in the form of:
•
•
•
Developer funded and constructed transportation improvements, Financial contributions to programmed WSDOT or local agency projects, and/or Dedication of property for right of way.
Refer to the Development Service guidance document Traffic Mitigation Payments on the Development Services website for more information and examples to help determine or calculate pro rata share financial contributions by developers.

1130.10(2) Selecting the Type of Agreement Form Agreement Forms There are both standard and nonstandard agreements. WSDOT has developed standard form agreements for commonly encountered developer agreement needs. A good practice is to use a standard form agreement. These save WSDOT and the Developer time since they do not require HQ or Assistant Attorney General (AAG) review. Do not alter a standard form, or it will need to be reviewed by the AAG. Select an agreement form that best fits with the type and form of mitigation. Determine if one of the standard form agreements below will suffice and use if possible. If not, prepare a nonstandard agreement. Developer Agreement - Construction by Developer at Developer Expense (Form 224-054)
•
•
This is a two-party agreement between the developer and WSDOT. The developer constructs the improvement on WSDOT right of way.
Developer / Local Agency Agreement – Construction by Developer at Developer Expense (Form 224-063)
•
•
Like the above, but as a three-party agreement which involves the developer, the local agency and WSDOT. Use this agreement if part of the improvement to be constructed is located on local agency right-of-way in addition to state-owned right of way.
Local Agency Participating Agreement - Developer Mitigation (Form 224-015)
•
•
•
•
This agreement is a two-party contract between the Local agency and WSDOT. The Agency has collected developer mitigation payments pursuant to RCW 82.02.020 that have an expiration date of five (5) years from date of collection. The Agency desires to transmit these funds to WSDOT for use in constructing the above referenced project. WSDOT has programmed and budgeted the subject project.
Developer Agreement - Construction by State at Developer Expense (Form 224-064)
•
•
•
This is a two-party agreement between the developer and WSDOT. WSDOT agrees to build the project for the developer as a separate project. The project will have to go through the normal ad and award process. This type of agreement is required by FHWA if the improvements are constructed on the Interstate system and may impact the mainline traffic. An example would be a developer-funded signal installation on an off-ramp where it is likely the construction will impact the mainline traffic.

Local Agency Participating Agreement Work by WSDOT — Actual Cost (Form 224-065)
•
•
•
This is a two-party agreement between the local agency and WSDOT. WSDOT is planning the construction or improvement of a section of the state route and the Local Agency has requested that WSDOT perform certain work for the Local Agency. It is deemed to be in the public’s best interest for WSDOT to include the requested Work in WSDOT’s construction contract for the state route improvement. The Local Agency is obligated for the cost of the work.
Developer Mitigation Agreement: Collection of Pro Rata Share for Contribution Toward a WSDOT Project.
•
•
•
This would be a non-standard agreement that establishes a contract between WSDOT and the developer whereby the developer can contribute toward a programmed WSDOT project to mitigate impacts to the state highway system. It can be modified to include a third-party when the WSDOT has a joint project with a city or county. Refer to the guidance document Traffic Mitigation Payments on the Development Services Website for more information about how to develop pro rata share developer contributions.

1130.10(3) Time to Process an Agreement The agreement process requires a technical review and concurrence or approval of all plans within WSDOT right of way that become part of the agreement, and possibly review by WSDOT HQ and the Attorney General’s Office (AGO). The length of time it takes to execute an agreement varies greatly and depends upon:
•
•
•
Complexity of the project. Number of revisions required for the plans and specifications. Quality and quantity of plans submitted by the developer.
The overall time to complete this process is primarily based on the quality and quantity of plans submitted by the developer. The closer the plans are to WSDOT standards, the more efficiently the review will proceed. Each region should develop guidance for communicating expectations for review and approval timeframes.
1130.10(4) Assembling Agreement Components A typical Developer Agreement includes a set of engineering plans and specifications prepared by the developer. These include preliminary plans for approval, construction plans, reports, and other documents. Agreements include these items as exhibits. These exhibits are reviewed and approved before the agreement is signed. These include but are not limited to:
•
•
•
Preliminary docuents, including a Plan for Approval and the Summary of Design. Construction plns, materials certifications, specifications. Hydraulics reports.

An Intersectin Control Evaluation (ICE) may be required for new or modified intersections (refer to Chapter 1300.) Other dcuments as determined by region.
Plans Review Process Once mitigation has been determined, the development services staff will contact the developer/consultant to request submittal of required plans and specifications for WSDOT review and concurrence or approval. DS Staff determine which support offices are appropriate and route the plans to them for review and approval. The Development Services lead acts as the project engineer in the review and approval of development plans by coordinating, screening and consolidating, and resolving the review comments. When the initial reviews are complete, the Development Services lead compiles comments and returns the plans to the developer and/or consultant for revisions. When all of the review comments have been addressed and plan revisions made, the Development Services lead will obtain the necessary electronic approvals/signatures for the plans. The following sections provide details supporting preparation of:
•
•
Plans for approval, the summary of design, and construction plans, documents, and responsibilities. Descriptions and Links to additional resources and forms.
1130.10(5) Preliminary Design Documents The main preliminary documents used in the beginning of the mitigation agreement process are the Plan for Approval and the Summary of Design. These become exhibits attached to the agreement. This section provides instruction for the Summary of Design (SOD) and Plans for Approval (PFA), the two most common documents used. The SOD and the PFA should be developed concurrently. The SOD is required to be submitted by the developer prior to or with the PFA. WSDOT will support and collaborate in the development of the Plan for Approval and Summary of Design. Criteria in the WSDOT Design Manual apply to design of mitigation projects on WSDOT highways and rights of way.
Summary of Design (SOD) The SOD was developed specifically for use on non-WSDOT projects on the state transportation system. Use the SOD to record decisions about development-based transportation improvements. Provide the information needed to complete the SOD, including the proposed multimodal project elements, community engagement, and design tradeoffs. Provide enough detail on the SOD that a Plan for Approval can proceed. WSDOT and the Developer use the SOD to record decisions about development-based transportation improvements. The “Project Information” section expects consideration of all modes and documenting tradeoffs determined in the design process.
•
•
The SOD prompts for multimodal considerations; how all travel modes have been addressed in the mitigation. It also provides for documenting the design elements of the project.
Note: in some cases, the Basis of Design (BOD) may be required, but the general expectation is the SOD should suffice for most projects. Consult Section 300.04(3) Local Agency and Development Services Approvals for further guidance.

Summary of Design Resources
•
•
Download the SOD (Form 224-045), or BOD if required and provide it to the local agency / developer. Refer to Chapter 300 and the SOD/BOD for Approval requirements.
Plan for Approval (PFA) The developer/consultant prepares the PFA. Note: These are commonly called Channelization Plans, but for consistency with this Design Manual, the term Plan for Approval is used. The PFA is the basis for all the construction drawings and essentially defines the scope of the project. Review the plan for approval and support the developer in revisions needed. Review and ensure developer and local agency project plans meet WSDOT policies and procedures. WSDOT Design Controls. Design controls are specific factors that directly influence the selection of most design elements and their dimensions. Consult Chapter 1103 for the five WSDOT design controls. Checklists and Examples: Provide your Region’s checklist to help the developer prepare the PFA prior to region review. Provide example PFAs as needed. Basic content usually includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Roadway channelization and intersection configuration. Linear design elements and dimensions such as lane and shoulder widths, taper lengths, sidewalks, bicycle facilities, shared-use paths/trails, transit stops or pullouts, and other elements. Intersection design elements and dimensions such as corner radii, marked crosswalks, crossing protection islands, bike boxes, leading pedestrian intervals, protected intersection features, mixing zones, protected left turn signals, lighting, etc. Midblock and trail crossing locations and dimensions with included features such as Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons, Rectangular Rapid Flashing beacons, raised crossings, etc. Ramp junction crossing locations and dimensions with included features such as Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons, Rectangular Rapid Flashing beacons, advance signage, raised crossings, etc. The entire mitigation project limits or portion thereof on the state system All existing access connections, both public and private, on both sides of the state highway Property use each proposed new or combined access connection serves. Design data pertinent to the improvements being proposed. Plots from turn movement simulation software to verify that the turn movements for the design vehicle(s) do not have conflicts. Refer to Chapter 1103 for Design Controls policy, including selecting the intersection design vehicle.
Consult your region PFA checklist for full details. Note: Any channelization outside of the state highway right-of-way will require confirmation that the design meets the local agency’s design standards. WSDOT Review times: WSDOT’s initial review of the PFA for approval/or concurrence will generally take about three weeks before comments are returned. Subsequent reviews of this plan will require up to two additional weeks each time the plan is resubmitted. Approval: WSDOT approves or concurs the PFA by electronic signature and provides a copy to the developer. Refer to Chapter 300 for approvals. The following sections provide details along with references to other WSDOT Manuals and resources needed.

Other Preliminary Documents Other design requirements may be triggered by the proposal, such as an approved Intersection Control Evaluation, Access Revision Report, or Design Analysis, to list a few. Consult Chapter 300 for the list of many documents and approval authorities which may be needed, particularly for intersections or for proposed freeway access revisions.
1130.10(6) Construction Plans, Specifications, and Reports Upon approval of the PFA and SOD, the developer/consultant prepares construction plans, specifications and other documents and submits them to WSDOT for review. Upon approval, these are made attachments to the agreement. The construction plans for a developer agreement are similar to those that are required for a WSDOT state contract for highway improvements. As such, the same design criteria and materials certifications apply. Use judgment in matching the level of plan complexity and review to the level of detail warranted by a developer project to ensure compliance with WSDOT standards and specifications without placing an undue burden on developers. The plans and reports in Exhibit 1130-4 are a brief listing that may be required for a developer project. This is not all inclusive. Consult region subject matter experts, region requirements, practices, and checklists. Engage region experts in plans review, construction and materials requirements, utilities, and hydraulics. The goal is to support the developer in the assemblage of the construction plans, specifications and reports required. Monitor progress and quality of developer work, give constructive feedback to developers throughout the process. Exhibit 1130-4 Common Plans and Reports

Right of Way In most cases, the required mitigation such as widening for turn lanes or shoulder improvements, installation of pedestrian protection islands, striping of bike lanes and installing bike boxes, can be accommodated within existing right of way. However, if insufficient right-of-way exists, the developer must donate the necessary land (that they own rights to) to WSDOT. The right of way must provide a wide enough corridor to include drainage facilities (such as back of the ditch), all signal and illumination facilities, utilities under franchise, and any other feature that requires access for highway maintenance. WSDOT will not exercise eminent domain authority (condemn property) to obtain right of way for a private development. WSDOT can request right of way be conveyed from a developer to mitigate developer traffic impacts to state highway based upon engineering plans, rather than approved right of way plans. The needed right of way must have a nexus to the direct impacts and be proportional to these impacts. Review additional information on Right of Way donations in Chapter 47.14 RCW and in Chapter 468-100 WAC.
Traffic Control Coordinate traffic control plans and strategies with the developer. Refer to Design Manual Chapter 1010 and links provided therein. Coordinate with Region Traffic office to handle all traffic related issues. Traffic Analysis including analysis of both existing and potential pedestrian and bicyclist movements, Channelization plans, electrical design, traffic control and signing, both public and private, are the major responsibilities of this group.
Utilities Utility Plan and Responsibilities The Utility Plan details all the existing utilities and the proposed utility relocations within the project limits. It is the Developer’s responsibility to ensure the Utility Plan and relocation strategies comply with WSDOT’s Utilities Manual and the Utilities Accommodation Policy. The Utility Plan and proposed utility relocations must be approved by the Region Utility Engineer prior to execution of the Developer Agreement. Utility plan must include, but is not limited to, the following: 1. Highway alignment and right-of-way limits. 2. Proposed roadway configuration, as shown on the channelization plan, including final location of all driveways and intersecting roads, illumination, guardrail and drainage. 3. Locations of all existing utility facilities and appurtenances, such as lines, poles, cabinets, vaults, valves, and hydrants.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1130
Development Services
Utility Locates and Service Connections Permanent utility service connections will require a utility service agreement. A service agreement is between the Developer and the utility company. WSDOT is not responsible for obtaining this agreement. Utility service connections and any associated facilities that require water, electric power, telephone service, such as signal and illumination systems, will be the Developer’s responsibility to coordinate. The Developer establishes the new service account in his/her name, with WSDOT listed as the permanent owner, and pays the initial service connection costs and fees. After final inspection, acceptance by WSDOT, and upon project completion, the account can be transferred to either WSDOT or the appropriate city or town. The Developer will be responsible for the cost and transferring of any accounts to WSDOT and/or to the applicable city or town.
Hydraulics and Stormwater Requirements Region Development Services staff will coordinate WSDOT’s review and concurrence of requirements. Enlist support from region subject matter experts for assistance in assessing drainage and water quality compliance issues. Following are some common requirements and resource manuals. The Highway Runoff Manual states that WSDOT must provide for the passage of existing off-site flows through its right of way to maintain natural drainage paths. Private developer projects that discharge to a WSDOT right of way or storm sewer system must comply with the provisions of the Highway Runoff Manual (HRM), Ecology stormwater management manuals, or an Ecology-approved local equivalent manual. The developer must also demonstrate that WSDOT conveyance systems have adequate capacity to convey the developer’s flows in accordance with Hydraulics Manual conveyance design standards. Developer / consultant designing stormwater facilities within the WSDOT ROW shall prepare hydraulic reports in compliance with the policy outlined in the Hydraulics Manual. A hydraulic report with supporting calculations, plans and details showing proposed improvements is needed anytime storm water runoff enters state right of way from a development site, or modifications are proposed for existing facilities’ out falling to state facilities.
HRM Certification Training Requirements Designing BMPs within WSDOT right of way requires a Highway Runoff Manual certification regardless of which manual is used for the design. Visit the WSDOT Hydraulics webpage for additional information, Hydraulics & hydrology | WSDOT (wa.gov) and the WSDOT Hydraulics training webpage on available HRM classes to obtain a certification: Hydraulics & hydrology training | WSDOT (wa.gov). The Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Manual (TESCM) is intended for use during the design, permitting, and construction phases of transportation construction projects. It covers:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Applying for, transferring, and terminating Permit coverage Temporary erosion and sediment control (TESC) plan design and implementation TESC best management practice (BMP) application and installation Spill prevention, control, and countermeasure (SPCC) plans Discharge sampling, site inspections and reporting Site management and documentation Compliance related issues
A utility permit for stormwater discharge (Form 224-693) is utilized to regulate constructed facilities that discharge stormwater onto state right of way and into a highway drainage system. For more information on requirements and permits for discharging to the WSDOT ROW and/or building on the WSDOT ROW, consult the Utilities Manual. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-25
Chapter 1130
Development Services
Documentation will be reviewed for compliance with state and local requirements and more specifically checked to ensure storm water has been properly treated and detained, meeting WSDOT’s NPDES permit requirements, existing drainage systems are capable of handling the flows and no downstream impacts before issuing a permit. For Stormwater Permits, consult regional utility office for structures within WSDOT Right of Way.
1130.10(7) Establish Developer’s Financial Guarantee WSDOT requires either a surety bond, assignment of escrow account, savings account/certificate of deposit or letter of credit from the developer to ensure timely and proper construction of the project according to the Developer Agreement. WSDOT does not require this of governmental agencies or of tribes. The developer (usually his/her consultant) provides an itemized estimate of construction costs. Review the estimate to ensure that it represents typical costs for similar types of work. Base the amount of the surety bond on this cost estimate, including all utility work and may also include a surcharge to cover cost overruns. Bonding for local agency projects is at the discretion of the Department and in most cases will not be required. Bonding is usually secured through a standard WSDOT bond form (discussed below), which names the developer and the surety company. Attach the bond certificate to the form. The developer may choose to provide an “assignment of escrow account” or “assignment of savings account/certificate of deposit” in lieu of the bonding. On a case-by-case basis, WSDOT will accept a letter of credit. Download the above WSDOT standard forms here: Main page: https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/forms/pdfForms.html Direct links:
•
•
Individual Bond for Agreement (Form 224-049) Assignment of Savings Account/Certificate of Deposit (Form 224-004) internal website only.
At the discretion of regional development services staff, the bond may be required prior to the execution of the Developer Agreement or, at the latest, at the time of the pre-construction meeting. In any case, no work should be allowed on WSDOT right-of-way until the bond is secured by developer. Release the surety bond, escrow account, or savings account/certificate of deposit after final WSDOT inspection and approval of the construction. In some cases, a release of funds may be only after a specified period to ensure performance of the improvement. Make sure that the original bond, escrow account, savings account/certificate of deposit clearly states the time of release, such as 30 days after final acceptance, 12 months after final acceptance, etc. Collection of the bond, or a portion thereof, may be pursued if the work is not completed to the WSDOT’s satisfaction. WSDOT must give 30 thirty days written notice prior to any action to collect on the bond. The notice must include a detailed list of the incomplete items or outstanding payments, and the name and phone number of the appropriate WSDOT contact.
1130.10(8) Assembly, Execution, Routing and Archiving of Developer Agreements Assembly and execution When the engineering/construction plans and specifications are reviewed and approved, add them to the Agreement form along with a right of way plan and any other required exhibits, completing the agreement package.

The developer must first sign the completed Developer Agreement. If required, the developer obtains the appropriate local agency signature. The developer or local agency must return the signed agreement to the Development Services office for WSDOT region signature and final execution. Signature authority for Developer Agreements varies among the different regions.
Routing and closure Consult the Agreements Manual Chapter 3 for instruction on closing and archiving agreements (Consultants: Please contact your WSDOT Project Manager for access to the Agreements Manual).
1130.11 Using Interlocal Agreements WSDOT, counties and cities have successfully used Interlocal Agreements to provide an equitable and predictable Development Services process. Developers in high growth counties and cities may generate multiple projects a year, affecting state highways. In these situations, there is a definite long-term benefit to having an Interlocal Agreement in place. An Interlocal Agreement is highly encouraged and provides WSDOT with a basis for recovery of impact fees from the developer. It also provides a timely and predictable means of determining whether a developer project will cause significant adverse impacts to the state highway system and provides a streamlined mechanism by which mitigation measures are calculated and required as a condition of plan approval, if necessary, for all parties involved.
•
•
•
•
WSDOT benefits by being able to leverage limited funds and advance needed improvements to state highways significantly impacted by new development. Local government benefits by having needed transportation improvements constructed. Taxpayers benefit by not subsidizing the mitigation of transportation impacts caused by new development. Developers benefit by knowing up-front what type of mitigation will be required and what it will cost. Each developer will be treated equitably and the requirement for traffic analysis for smaller developments is eliminated.
1130.11(1) Interlocal Agreement Basic Elements Development Services Staff and local agencies negotiate the terms of each Interlocal Agreement. These agreements may contain elements that are unique to the local jurisdiction. However, every Interlocal Agreement contains the following framework.
Notification The local agency will notify WSDOT of all development proposals that are subject to review.
Thresholds WSDOT and the local agency will agree upon the level of impact, which will trigger WSDOT review of a development proposal. This threshold is normally based on the number of added trips, LOS, safety performance and crash history of the impacted state highway. It could consider multimodal needs assessment of the local transportation system and the impacted highway. Having frontage on a state highway also will trigger WSDOT’s review of a development plan.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-27
Chapter 1130
Development Services
Review Time The local agency will allow WSDOT an agreed upon minimum review period once a developer plan is received. Regional Development Services staff has the responsibility to thoroughly review the proposal, which may include consultation with staff such as multimodal traffic and environmental expertise. The Interlocal Agreement specifies the amount of time that the local agency and/or SEPA will allow for WSDOT review. Typically, this ranges from 14 to 21 days for SEPA DNS projects and 21 to 30 days for projects requiring an EIS.
1130.11(2) Local Jurisdiction Mitigation Commitment Provide in the Interlocal Agreement that the local jurisdiction agrees to collect traffic mitigation payments and/or impose certain channelization improvements and/or require right of way dedication conveyance on behalf of WSDOT, which is vital for WSDOT operations and finances. An Interlocal Agreement establishes city or county and WSDOT procedures for development plan review and determination of transportation impacts. It clarifies when traffic analyses are required and helps to define mitigation measures. The agreement also provides a reasonable timeline for review of development plans. Interlocal Agreements also provide the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
A list of WSDOT improvement projects for the next ten years, subject to amendment updates. Mitigation charges based on ADT or Peak-Hour Trip for developer traffic; i.e., Traffic Mitigation Payment, channelization revision, signalization, right of way dedication/conveyance, etc. A procedure for requiring traffic studies, including a checklist for those studies. How intersection LOS requirements will be met and addresses intersections with safety performance needs identified by WSDOT. A procedure for transfer of mitigation payments from local agency to WSDOT. A procedure for dedication/conveyance of right of way to WSDOT and/or provides for establishment of setbacks for future highway projects. A method for allowing credits against traffic mitigation payments for developer construction work, and/or right-of-way dedications/conveyances that benefit the highway or future highway construction projects. Reference to appeal process for developers who dispute WSDOT requirements. Unilateral termination of the agreement by WSDOT or Local Agency.
Application Interlocal Agreements can be set up to apply to: (1) all developments having frontage on, or requiring direct access onto a state highway AND/OR (2) all developments, which will be subject to SEPA review. Single family residences, duplexes, short plats and certain small commercial developments are excluded, consistent with SEPA regulations unless they are located adjacent to a state highway.
1130.11(3) Other Cost Sharing Mechanisms TBD and LID Policy In some instances, developers have agreed to participate in cost sharing as part of a Transportation Benefit District (TBD) or Local Improvement District (LID). If these contributions are wholly or partially used to mitigate developer impacts to the state highway, WSDOT will not seek further mitigation. Local Transportation Act (RCW 39.92) WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-28
Chapter 1130
Development Services
This statutory provision authorizes local governments to develop and adopt programs for the purpose of jointly funding, from public and private sources, transportation improvements necessitated in whole or in part by economic development and growth within their respective jurisdictions. This supplemental authority allows local governments to enact, if certain procedures are followed, ordinances that will set forth the procedures for calculating, assessing and spending transportation impact fees. This procedure can be used only if monies or improvements have not been collected through SEPA and/or RCW 82.02. For more information refer to RCW 39.92.
1130.12 Using Developer Permits The following are some of the permits administered by Development Services, Maintenance, or other Region entity. Note: Cities and towns issue access connection permits within their incorporated boundaries on managed access highways. Use permit forms, as well as permit applications, and provisions here: https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/forms/pdfForms.html
Access Connection Permit A WSDOT Access Connection Permit is used to grant the right to access a Managed Access State Highway, located outside of the boundaries of incorporated cities and towns, from the abutting property and, in some cases, authorize the temporary right to enter upon the right of way for the purposes of constructing the approach. Refer to Section 1130.06(2) and Chapter 540.
General permits General permits are another form of agreement for documenting terms for allowing work to be done on state right of way. This form can serve multiple uses, as identified on the form itself. Use Form 224-698 (Permit) and Form 224-698 (Provisions.)
Subterranean Monitoring Permits Use Form 224-036 to permit wells on WSDOT right of way. Show all developer wells on the alignment / ROW plan, including well ID number and coordinates. Provisions are included on the form. There are mandatory reporting requirements for well installation and decommissioning imposed by the Department of Ecology. Consult Chapter 610 and the Geotechnical Design Manual for more information.
Transit Stop Permits WSDOT may issue a Transit Stop Permit, for an agency requested facility on a state highway or Interstate under the jurisdiction of WSDOT and/or FHWA, provided the facility meets WSDOT and/or FHWA requirements. Review the requirements on the form. FHWA approval is required on all facilities located within Interstate rightof-way. WSDOT does not issue permits within incorporated cities or towns on managed access highways. Based upon the facility’s proposed location, the transit agency may apply for Transit Stop Permit to the appropriate WSDOT Region Office. The Region Development Services Office may forward the request to another regional office for processing of the permit. WSDOT Region will:
•
•
Verify WSDOT’s ownership and that the property is not currently under lease, franchise, permit, and other encumbrance that would prohibit the use of the identified property for the proposed use. Verify the property is not presently, nor in the foreseeable future, needed for highway purposes.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-29
Chapter 1130
•
Development Services
Coordinate a review of any application on Interstate property with the HQ Access and Hearings Manager.
Use Form 510-006 (permit) and Form 510-017 (application). Note these are not for use on Managed Access Highways within an incorporated City or Town. The forms include conditions and specify the need for certain plans and provisions. Issue Transit Stop Permits using the guidance of Design Manual Chapter 1730 and the Traffic Manual. This could include denial of permit for safety reasons, like sight distance. Enter the permit information into the Roadway Access Permit Management System (RAMPS) database.
Roadside Vegetation Permit Roadside Vegetation Permits are another form of agreement for documenting terms for allowing vegetation establishment and on-going vegetation maintenance by others on state right of way. Like developer agreements, Roadside Vegetation Permits use a boilerplate form with accompanying special provisions and are usually supplemented by planting and or vegetation plans. The plan development and review process are the same as for developer agreements, but greatly simplified. Consult with your Region’s Real Estate Office to ensure a lease is not required in lieu of a Roadside Vegetation Permit due to Leasehold Excise Tax and/or 18th Amendment requirements. Use Form 220-018 and Form 220-019 for the Roadside Vegetation Permit and its application.
Timber Mitigation – Removal Permits WSDOT may issue permits to residents of this state to remove specified quantities of standing or downed trees and shrubs, rock, sand, gravel, or soils that have no market value in place and that WSDOT desires to be removed from state-owned lands that are under WSDOT jurisdiction. An applicant for a permit must certify that the materials so removed are to be used by the applicant. General – RCW 47.12.140 authorizes WSDOT to issue a permit for the removal of timber having no market value in place and that the WSDOT desires to have removed. A permit to remove timber should only be issued when the total merchantable timber volume is no more than 5,000 board feet or one truck load of logs. Permits should not be issued for the removal of timber from properties located off operating right of way (removal of timber off operating right of way will require an approved Forest Practice Application). For more information refer to the WSDOT Right of Way Manual Section 11-6. Use forms 224-082 or 224-083 depending on circumstance.
1130.13 Construction Oversight After a Developer Agreement is executed, the appropriate level of attention must be given to developer projects to ensure that they are constructed to WSDOT standards and specifications common to any work performed on state highways, and that such efforts are paid for by the developers. Inspection is either performed by WSDOT or through private services agreed upon. Consult Region subject experts and the Standard Specifications and Construction Manual.
Preconstruction Conference A well-planned preconstruction conference is an important first step to a successful construction project. This meeting is required before construction can begin. The purpose of the preconstruction conference is to
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1130-30
Chapter 1130
Development Services
introduce the developer’s contractor to the WSDOT representative and to review the details of the project. Other recommended attendees include the prime contractor, subcontractors, the consultant engineer and, if applicable, a representative from the local agency. It is especially important to review scheduling, traffic control, outstanding materials certification issues, coordination issues, and any items that are not explicitly detailed in the Developer Agreement. If the surety bond was not secured prior to execution of the Developer Agreement, it should be required no later than the preconstruction conference. Guidelines for a pre-construction conference are found in the Construction Manual.
Materials Certification All materials incorporated into WSDOT facilities must be certified according to the Standard Specifications and the special provisions of the Developer Agreement. Materials certification is obtained through developer (or contractor) submittal of Request for Approval of Materials Source (RAMS.) Testing and approval requirements are given in Chapter 9 of the Construction Manual and in the Standard Specifications. While many materials require testing at the Headquarters Materials Lab, the Qualified Products List can streamline this process. Using materials identified in WSDOT’s Qualified Products List will save the developer costs and time. See: Materials Lab - Qualified Products List (QPL) | WSDOT (wa.gov)
•
•
•
•
•
•
Acceptance of some materials by Manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance is also an acceptable practice, especially for the minor quantities associated with many developer projects. Nevertheless, all materials must be approved by WSDOT on a RAMS form (Form 350-071) and all materials must meet WSDOT specifications. It is recommended the Hot Mix Asphalt mix designs and corresponding material sources be obtained from the Qualified Products List. QPL listings eliminate the need to submit mix designs for approval along with the cost of testing and time delay. Aggregates may be approved by manufacturers’ certificate of compliance. They must be produced from a WSDOT approved source. This should be communicated, in writing, to the developer or his/her contractor early in the process. Electrical materials, including structural elements, are complex devices and may require lengthy evaluation and testing processes. The use of preapproved items (such as QPL listed items) can greatly simplify the materials approval process and potentially save a significant amount of time. For example, the use of poles that are not pre-approved requires a structural submittal package to be provided to the WSDOT Bridge & Structures Office (consult Standard Specification 9-29.6), which can take weeks to review depending on workload. For traffic signals owned, operated, and maintained by WSDOT, in accordance with RCW 47.24.020, traffic signal controllers and cabinets must be tested and configured at the WSDOT Headquarters Materials Lab and/or Regional Signal Shop (testing locations are dependent on the WSDOT region responsible for the installation location). This process typically takes 3-6 weeks.
Construction Inspection The level of field inspection required for a developer project varies with the project complexity and region policy and jurisdiction. In some regions the Development Services offices have their own inspectors. Other regions assign inspection of developer projects to a WSDOT Project Engineer. Regardless of the complexity of the

Development Services
project, the project manager must ensure that construction of all work on WSDOT facilities is adequately inspected for compliance with the Standard Specifications and special provisions. Any proposed changes in the project, after execution of the Developer Agreement, must be reviewed and concurred or approved by WSDOT. Changes may be required by WSDOT if on-site conditions do not prove to be as expected. Minor changes may be resolved in the field with adequate documentation by the WSDOT representative. For any significant design change, WSDOT must notify the developer in writing, stating the specific conditions that must be resolved before the project will be accepted. The developer must submit a written proposal, with plans and supporting documentation, showing what changes will be made to meet WSDOT’s requirements. Plan revisions and addenda will require support office review as was required for the original plan set.
Construction Documentation When WSDOT Region performs project inspection, follow procedures in the Construction Manual. Using a “Daily Diary” or the WSDOT Inspector’s Daily Report (IDR) form is recommended.
Traffic Control Management Consult Section 1-10.2 of the Standard Specifications for traffic control management and traffic control supervisor requirements.
As-Built Construction Plans Upon completion, the developer shall supply WSDOT with As-Built Construction Plans, also known as record drawings, for the work done inside WSDOT right of way. Instructions and examples for preparing and submitting As-Built Plans and Shop Drawings are provided in the Construction Manual Chapter 10.
1130.14 Final Inspection/Acceptance Upon satisfactory completion of the project, WSDOT shall write a letter of final acceptance. If the agreement is a Developer/Local Agency Agreement, then acceptance by the local agency is a prerequisite to final acceptance by WSDOT. WSDOT may hold release of the bond, escrow account, or savings account/certificate of deposit longer to ensure performance of the improvements.
1130.15 Documentation WSDOT prefers electronic signatures on documents. Guidance for digital signatures is available through your Assistant State Design Engineer or Region offices. Local agencies, tribes, and developer projects within WSDOT jurisdiction are required to follow WSDOT design documentation policy as noted in Chapter 300.

1210.02 Horizontal Alignment 1210.02(1) General Horizontal and vertical alignments (see Chapter 1220) are the primary controlling elements for highway design. It is important to coordinate these two elements with design speed, drainage, intersection design, and aesthetic principles in the early stages of design. How horizontal alignments are designed depends largely on the context and selected design controls. Lower-speed environments can be more forgiving than higher-speed environments.
1210.02(1)(a) Low-Speed Alignments Consider the following when designing low-speed horizontal alignments: a) Determine whether sufficient contextual elements exist within the roadway cross section to indicate the desired low-speed environment (street trees, lack of building setbacks, streetside amenities, etc.). b) Determine whether horizontal geometric traffic calming treatments will be needed to maintain the selected design speed (see Chapter 1103). c) Avoid placing pedestrian midblock crossings within horizontal curves.

Geometric Plan Elements
1210.02(1)(b) High-Speed Alignments Horizontal alignments designed for high speed are likely to have modal priorities for freight and passenger vehicles, and it is necessary to strive for forgiving and predictable alignments within high-speed environments. Exhibit 1220-2 through Exhibit 1210-3 show desirable and undesirable alignment examples for use with the following considerations: a) Make the highway alignment as direct as practicable and still blend with the topography while considering developed and undeveloped properties, community boundaries, and environmental concerns. b) Make highway alignment consistent by:
•
•
•
Using gentle curves at the end of long tangents. Using a transition area of moderate curvature between the large radius curves of rural areas and the small radius curves of populated areas. Making horizontal curves visible to approaching traffic.
c) Avoid minimum radii and short curves unless:
•
•
Restrictive conditions are present and alternatives are not readily or economically avoidable. On two-lane highways, minimum radii result in tangent sections long enough for needed passing.
d) Avoid any abrupt change in alignment. Design reverse curves with an intervening tangent long enough for complete superelevation transition for both curves. See Chapter 1250 for more information on superelevation transitions. e) Avoid the use of curves in the same direction connected by short tangents (broken back curves); substitute a single larger curve. f) Avoid compound curves on open highway alignment if a simple curve can be obtained. When compound curves are used, make the shorter radius at least two-thirds the longer radius. Make the total arc length of a compound curve not less than 500 feet. g) On divided multilane highways, take advantage of independent alignment to produce a flowing alignment along natural terrain. h) The desirable locations for bridges, interchanges, intersections, and temporary connections are on tangent sections in clear view of drivers. i) On two-lane two-way highways, strive for as much passing sight distance as possible (see Chapter 1260).
1210.02(2) Horizontal Curve Radii Design speed is the governing variable of horizontal curves. For guidance regarding design speed selection, see Chapter 1103, and see Chapter 1360 for ramps. Use the following factors to determine the radius for a curve:
•
•
Low to intermediate design speed environments may need to utilize horizontal curves to maintain the desired operating speed. Horizontal curvature, more than any other design element or treatment, provides the best speed management results. See Chapter 1103 for more information on speed management. Stopping sight distance where sight obstructions are on the inside of a curve. Median barriers, bridges, walls, cut slopes, wooded areas, buildings, and guardrails are examples of sight obstructions. See Chapter 1260 to check for stopping sight distance for the selected design speed.

Geometric Plan Elements
Superelevation is the rotation or banking of the roadway cross section to overcome part of the centrifugal force that acts on a vehicle traversing a curve. Design information on the relationship between design speed, radius of curve, and superelevation is in Chapter 1250. Coordinate vertical and horizontal alignment (see Chapter 1220).
Spiral curves, although no longer used on new highway construction or major realignment, still exist on Washington’s highways. Spirals were used to transition between tangents and circular curves with the horizontal curvature rate increasing from tangent to the central curve and decreasing from curve to tangent. Spirals do not pose an operational concern and may remain in place. (See A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets for information on spirals.)
1210.02(3) Horizontal Curve Length A curve is not required for small deflection angles. Exhibit 1210-1 gives the maximum allowable angle without a curve. (See Chapter 1310 for guidance on angle points or short radii curves in the vicinity of intersections at grade.) To avoid the appearance of a kink in the road, the desirable length of curve for deflection angles larger than given in Exhibit 1210-1 is at least 500 feet. Exhibit 1210-1 Maximum Angle without Curve

1210.03 Distribution Facilities 1210.03(1) General In addition to the main highway under consideration, other facilities can be used to distribute traffic to and from the highway and to provide access. Highway flexibility can be augmented by:
•
•
•
•
•
Frontage roads Collector-distributor roads On and off connections Parallel arterial routes with connections between them and the main highway Loop highways around large metropolitan areas
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1210-3
Chapter 1210
Geometric Plan Elements
A city or county may be asked to accept a proposed distribution facility as a city street or county road. Plan and design these facilities according to the applicable design values as city streets or county roads (see Chapter 1230).
1210.03(2) Frontage Roads Frontage roads constructed as part of highway development may serve to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Reestablish continuity of an existing road severed by the highway. Provide service connections to adjacent property that would otherwise be isolated as a result of construction of the highway. Control access to the highway. Maintain circulation of traffic on each side of the highway. Segregate local traffic from the higher speed through traffic and intercept driveways of residences and commercial establishments along the highway. Relieve congestion on the arterial highway during periods of high use or in emergency situations.
Frontage roads are generally not permanent state facilities. They are usually turned back to the local jurisdiction. Plan and design frontage roads as city streets or county roads (see Chapter 1230). Initiate coordination with the local agency that will be the recipient of the facility early in the planning process, and continue through design and construction. (See Chapter 530 for additional guidance on frontage roads and turnbacks.) Outer separations function as buffers between the through traffic on the highway and the local traffic on the frontage road. The width is governed by requirements for grading, signing, barriers, aesthetics, headlight glare, and ramps. Where possible, make the separation wide enough to allow for development on both sides of the frontage road. Wider separations also move the intersection with the frontage road and a crossroad farther from the intersection with the through roadway, and they can reduce the amount of limited access control rights to be acquired (see Chapter 530). Where two-way frontage roads are provided, make the outer separation wide enough to minimize the effects of approaching traffic on the right, particularly the headlight glare. (See Chapter 1600 for information on headlight glare considerations.) With one-way same-direction frontage roads, the outer separation need not be as wide as with two-way frontage roads. Wide separations lend themselves to landscape treatment and can enhance the appearance of both the highway and the adjoining property. A substantial width of outer separation is particularly advantageous at intersections with cross streets. The wider separation reduces conflicts with pedestrians and bicycles. Where ramp connections are provided between the through roadway and the frontage road, the minimum outer separation width depends on design of the ramp termini.

1210.04 Number of Lanes and Arrangement 1210.04(1) General The basic number of lanes is designated and maintained over a length of highway. The total number of lanes is the basic number of lanes plus any auxiliary lanes provided to meet:
•
•
•
Level of service (volume-capacity) Lane balance Flexibility of operation
1210.04(2) Basic Number of Lanes In certain situations, it is appropriate to keep the basic number of lanes constant over a highway route, or a significant portion thereof, regardless of changes in traffic volume. However, this can lead to unnecessary property or environmental impacts that need to be balanced throughout a design. Consider the impacts, human factors, and traffic analysis before making decisions regarding basic number of lane consistency throughout a highway route. Change the basic number of lanes for general changes in traffic volume over a substantial length of the route. The desirable location for a reduction in the basic number of lanes is on a tangent section between interchanges or intersections. However, there can be advantages in using dedicated turn lanes at intersections as a means to reduce the number of lanes. To accommodate high traffic volumes for short distances, such as between adjacent interchanges, use auxiliary lanes. When auxiliary lanes are provided on consecutive sections between interchanges, consider increasing the basic number of lanes through the entire length.
1210.04(3) Auxiliary Lanes Auxiliary lanes are added to the basic number of lanes to allow additional traffic movements on short segments. These added lanes are based primarily on volume-to-capacity relationships (see Chapter 320). For efficient operation of auxiliary lanes, see the following:

When a lane width change does not create an angle point in an adjacent lane, a 25:1 taper is sufficient.

Geometric Plan Elements
1210.05(1)(b) Reduce Number of Lanes To reduce the number of lanes, provide a transition with the following guidelines:
•
•
•
•
Locate transitions where decision sight distance exists, desirably on a tangent section and on the approach side of any crest vertical curve, except the end of climbing lanes, which are transitioned in accordance with Chapter 1270. Supplement the transition with traffic control devices. Reduce the number of lanes by dropping only one at a time from the right side in the direction of travel. See the MUTCD when dropping more than one lane in a single direction. Use the following formula to determine the minimum length of the lane transition for speeds 45 mph or more: 𝐿 = 𝑉𝑇 Where: L = Length of transition (ft) V = Design speed (mph) T = Tangential offset width (ft)
•
Use the following formula to determine the minimum length of the lane transition for speeds less than 45 mph: 𝐿 = (𝑇𝑉^2)/60 Where: L
= Length of transition (ft)
V
= Design speed (mph)
T
= Tangential offset width (ft)
1210.05(1)(c) Increase Number of Lanes To increase the number of lanes, a tangential rate of change in the range of 1:4 to 1:15 is sufficient. Aesthetics are the main consideration.
1210.05(1)(d) Turning Roadway For turning roadway widening width transitions, see Chapter 1240.
1210.05(2) Median Width Transitions Whenever two abutting sections have different median widths, use long, smooth transitions (L = VT or flatter). When horizontal curves are present, this can be accomplished by providing the transition throughout the length of the curve. For transitions on tangent sections, the transitions may be applied symmetrically about the centerline or on only one side of the median based on whether or not the abutting existing section is programmed for the wider median in the future. For aesthetics, make the transition length as long as feasible.

1220.01 General Vertical alignment (roadway profile) consists of a series of gradients connected by vertical curves. It is mainly controlled by the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Topography Class of highway Horizontal alignment Safety Sight distance Construction costs Drainage Adjacent land use Vehicular characteristics Aesthetics

1220.02 Vertical Alignment 1220.02(1) Design Principles The following are general principles for developing vertical alignment (also see Exhibit 1220-4 through Exhibit 1220-7):
•
•
•
•
Use a smooth grade line with gradual changes, consistent with the context identification and character of terrain. Avoid numerous breaks and short grades. Avoid “roller coaster” or “hidden dip” profiles by use of gradual grades made possible by heavier cuts and fills or by introducing some horizontal curvature in conjunction with the vertical curvature. Avoid grades that affect truck speeds and, therefore, traffic operations. Avoid broken back grade lines with short tangents between two vertical curves.

Geometric Profile Elements
Use long vertical curves to flatten grades near the top of long, steep grades. Where at-grade intersections occur on roadways with moderate to steep grades, it is desirable to flatten or reduce the grade through the intersection. Establish the subgrade at least 1 foot above the high water table (real or potential), or as recommended by the Region Materials Engineer. Consider the low side of superelevated roadways. When a vertical curve takes place partly or wholly in a horizontal curve, coordinate the two as discussed in Section 1220.03.
1220.02(2) Minimum Length of Vertical Curves (Section rewritten ) The minimum length of a vertical curve is controlled by design speed, stopping sight distance, and the change in grade.
1220.02(2)(a) New Construction Projects For new construction (building a street where one does not currently exist), the minimum length of the vertical curve must meet stopping sight distance (see Chapter 1260) or have a length at least three times the design speed, whichever is greater. For aesthetics, the desirable length of a vertical curve is two to three times the length needed for stopping sight distance.
1220.02(2)(b) Reconstruction Projects On reconstruction projects, a zero-length vertical curve may be used as follows:
•
•
Intermediate and Low Speeds: Algebraic difference of 1.0% or less High Speeds: Algebraic Difference of 0.5% or less
Zero-length vertical curves are meant for spot locations to accommodate small profile changes that match into existing profiles. For example, modifying the existing profile for an overlay or adjusting the profile to accommodate a fish passage structure. Do not use a series of zero-length vertical curves as a replacement for a properly designed vertical curve. The minimum length of crest vertical curves shall be the same as new construction. The minimum length of sag vertical curves is determined using Exhibit 1220-1. There are two minimum lengths listed in Exhibit 1220-1: minimum and desired minimum. Try to meet the desired minimum as it provides more sight distance for nighttime driving. If you are unable to meet the desired minimums and must drop to the minimum, document your decision in the Design Documentation Package. A spreadsheet is available on the Design Support website to calculate the minimum and desired minimum shown in Exhibit 1220-1.

* The calculated value of L cannot be less than what is required for comfort. Use the formula for comfort shown above. In this case, the comfort equation may be used within pedestrian crossings or intersections because sight distance is not restricted by the sag vertical curve. ** The comfort equation cannot be applied when the curve is within an intersection or a pedestrian crossing. In these situations, the minimum sag vertical curve must meet stopping sight distance. *** All values for SSD used in this table must be adjusted for grade per Section 1260.03(2).
1220.02(3) Maximum Grades Analyze grades for their effect on traffic operation because they may result in undesirable truck speeds. Maximum grades are controlled by terrain type and design speed (see Exhibit 1220-4 and Section 1360.03(3) for ramp grades).
1220.02(4) Minimum Grades Minimum grades are used to meet drainage requirements. Avoid selecting a “roller coaster” or “hidden dip” profile merely to accommodate drainage. Minimum ditch gradients of 0.3% on paved materials and 0.5% on earth can be obtained independently of roadway grade. Medians, long sag vertical curves, and relatively flat terrain are examples of areas where independent ditch design may be justified. A closed drainage system may be needed as part of an independent ditch design.
1220.02(5) Length of Grade The desirable maximum length of grade is the maximum length on an upgrade at which a loaded truck will operate without a 10 mph reduction. Exhibit 1220-2 gives the desirable maximum length for a given percent of grade. When grades longer than the desirable maximum are unavoidable, consider an auxiliary climbing lane (see Chapter 1270). For grades that are not at a constant percent, use the average. When long, steep downgrades are unavoidable, consider an emergency escape ramp, and for grades longer than indicated, consider an auxiliary climbing lane (see Chapter 1270).

Geometric Profile Elements
Exhibit 1220-2 Grade Length
For grades longer than indicated, consider an auxiliary climbing lane (see Chapter 1270).
1220.02(6) Grade and Speed Considerations Grades can affect the operating performance of the vehicles negotiating them. The bicycle, transit, and freight modes are most affected by grades, while passenger cars can readily negotiate grades as steep as 5% without appreciable loss of operating speed. Steep downgrades can also impact operating speeds, particularly for heavy trucks, which display up to a 5% increase in speed on downgrades. Consider the selected performance for a location and corridor before making a determination on grade selection, to avoid unnecessary cuts or fills required for a vertical alignment. Exhibit 1220-3 provides the maximum grades based on the context, terrain classification, and targeted speed.

1220.02(7) Alignment on Structures Where practicable, avoid high skew, vertical curvature, horizontal curvature, and superelevation on structures, but do not sacrifice safe roadway alignment to achieve this.
1220.03 Coordination of Vertical and Horizontal Alignments Do not design horizontal and vertical alignments independently. Coordinate them to obtain uniform speed, pleasing appearance, and efficient traffic operation. Coordination can be achieved by plotting the location of the horizontal curves on the working profile to help visualize the highway in three dimensions. Perspective plots will also give a view of the proposed alignment. Exhibit 1220-4 and Exhibit 1220-5 show sketches of desirable and undesirable coordination of horizontal and vertical alignment. Guides for the coordination of the vertical and horizontal alignment are as follows:
•
•
Balance curvature and grades. Using steep grades to achieve long tangents and flat curves or excessive curvature to achieve flat grades are both poor designs. Vertical curvature superimposed on horizontal curvature generally results in a more pleasing facility. Successive changes in profile not in combination with horizontal curvature may result in a series of dips not visible to the driver.

Geometric Profile Elements
Do not begin or end a horizontal curve at or near the top of a crest vertical curve. A driver may not recognize the beginning or ending of the horizontal curve, especially at night. An alignment where the horizontal curve leads the vertical curve and is longer than the vertical curve in both directions is desirable. To maintain drainage, design vertical and horizontal curves so that the flat profile of a vertical curve is not located near the flat cross slope of the superelevation transition. Do not introduce a sharp horizontal curve at or near the low point of a pronounced sag vertical curve. The road ahead is foreshortened and any horizontal curve that is not flat assumes an undesirably distorted appearance. Further, vehicular speeds, particularly of trucks, often are high at the bottom of grades and erratic operation may result, especially at night. On two-lane roads, the need for passing sections (at frequent intervals and for an appreciable percentage of the length of the roadway) often supersedes the general desirability for the combination of horizontal and vertical alignment. Work toward long tangent sections to secure sufficient passing sight distance. On divided highways, consider variation in the width of medians and the use of independent alignments to derive the design and operational advantages of one-way roadways. Make the horizontal curvature and profile as flat as practicable at intersections where sight distance along both roads is important and vehicles may have to slow or stop. In residential areas, design the alignment to minimize nuisance factors to the neighborhood. Generally, a depressed facility makes a highway less visible and less noisy to adjacent residents. Minor horizontal adjustments can sometimes be made to increase the buffer zone between the highway and clusters of homes. Design the alignment to enhance attractive scenic views of the natural and constructed environment, such as rivers, rock formations, parks, and outstanding buildings.
When superelevation transitions fall within the limits of a vertical curve, plot profiles of the edges of pavement and check for smooth transitions.
1220.04 Airport Clearance Contact the airport authorities early for proposed highway construction or alteration in the vicinity of a public or military airport, so that advance planning and design work can proceed within the required Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations (see the Environmental Manual).
1220.05 Railroad Crossings When a highway crosses a railroad at grade, design the highway grade to prevent low-hung vehicles from damaging the rails or getting hung up on the tracks. Exhibit 1220-8 gives guidance on designing highway grades at railroad crossings. For more information on railroad-highway crossings, see Chapter 1350.
1220.06 Procedures When the project modifies the vertical alignment, develop vertical alignment plans for inclusion in the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) to a scale suitable for showing vertical alignment for all proposed roadways, including ground line, grades, vertical curves, and superelevation. (See the Plans Preparation Manual for guidance.) When justifying any modification to the vertical alignment, include the reasons for the change, alternatives addressed (if any) and why the selected alternative was chosen.

Short Tangent on a Crest Between Two Horizontal Curves
This combination is deficient for several reasons:
•
•
•
The curve reversal is on a crest, making the second curve less visible. The tangent is too short for the superelevation transition. The flat area of the superelevation transition will be near the flat grade in the crest.

When choosing any geometric cross section dimension, including lane or shoulder width, read the guidance that is specific to the facility type. Also, read the general guidance related to common elements such as lanes, shoulders, side slopes, etc. See Chapter 1106 for the general dimensioning guidance. This chapter also contains guidance related to jurisdiction.
1230.01 General The geometric cross section is composed of multiple lateral design elements such as lanes, shoulders, medians, bike facilities, and sidewalks. The designer’s task is to select, size, and document these elements appropriately. There is flexibility in the selection of design element dimensioning. All WSDOT routes, regardless of context, are referred to in the Design Manual as “highways.” Under this definition, freeways are a subset of highways while Interstate freeways are one specific type of freeway. Refer to the Design Manual Glossary of Terms for many of the terms used in this chapter. See Chapter 300 for design documentation requirements.
1230.02 Guidance for Specific Facility Types Guidance regarding geometric cross sections is located in various Design Manual chapters. The chapter depends on the facility type. Examples of specific facility types include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Highways (general) Freeways Ramps Auxiliary lanes Collector-Distributor lanes Service lanes Frontage roads HOV facilities

Examples include special use lanes, bridges, transit facilities, bus pull outs, median U-turns and crossovers, enforcement areas, truck weighing facilities, pedestrian bridges and tunnels, sidewalks & bicycle facilities
Notes: General guidance for curb design is in Chapter 1239. Guidance for curb is also found for numerous types of facilities (Chapter 1310 and others.)

1230.04 Jurisdiction for Design and Maintenance On all state highways in locations outside of cities or towns and within limited access design areas, geometric design is to be consistent with this Design Manual. On state highways within an incorporated city or town, develop design features in cooperation with the local agency. For NHS routes, use the Design Manual. For non-NHS routes, the Local Agency Guidelines may be used for dimensioning design elements Cross-sectional design within incorporated cities or towns can get complicated due to the joint-jurisdictional authority. WSDOT typically has jurisdiction between the backs of curbs, and cities typically have jurisdiction outside the backs of curbs (see Exhibit 1230-2). When no curb is present, the city or town holds responsibility for the roadside outside the paved shoulder. Despite the jurisdictional differences, it is extremely important to cooperatively determine a cross-sectional design. Refer to Chapter 301 for additional information on jurisdictional maintenance responsibilities and considerations for maintenance agreements.

1231.01 General Geometric cross sections for state highways are governed by the need to balance performance metrics, the context, and selected design controls. The objective is to optimize the use of available public space while avoiding an unreasonable investment in right of way acquisition. The term “highways” refers to all WSDOT roadways, including freeways; however, note that freeways have their own geometric cross section guidance. This chapter is not intended for freeway design. See Chapter 1232 for freeways.
1231.02 Design Up Unless otherwise specified, use the “design up” method described in Chapter 1106 to choose a design element width when a range of widths is given in this chapter.
1231.03 Common Elements The geometric cross sections shown in this chapter have many elements that are also common to facilities addressed in other chapters. The following chapters contain guidance related to these common geometric cross section elements:

1231.04 Cross Section Elements 1231.04(1) Vehicle Lanes There are many types of lanes that may exist in a cross section, and each has its own purpose and sizing needs. General-purpose traffic lanes need to accommodate a variety of vehicle types including buses, freight vehicles, personal automotive vehicles, and bicycles. The target speed, modal priority, balance of performance needs, and transportation context are all considerations when determining size, type, and number of lanes. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Notes: [1] The width shown is exclusive of the gutter if the gutter is a color that contrasts with the roadway. [2] See Chapter 1430 for part time shoulders and Chapter 1440 for metered shoulders. Established or common practices can be useful in determining and documenting lane width selection where a range of width values is provided. A brief list of these practices and some of their benefits is provided in Exhibit 1231-1. Engage subject matter experts in traffic operations, multimodal planning, and maintenance to establish and document the mode, function, performance, and tradeoffs involved (see DM Chapter 1106) prior to making the decision. Lane Width Considerations Roadways on curves, see Chapter 1240 Turning Roadway Widths Narrower lanes may be used as part of a speed reduction strategy
General
Two-lane, two-way rural highways: 12 ft lanes provide clearance between large vehicles traveling in opposing directions. Especially beneficial when high volumes or high truck percentages expected. On multilane facilities with width constraints, utilizing narrower inside lanes may permit wider outside lanes for bicycles, freight, and transit. Reduced lane widths allow more lanes to be provided in areas with constraints and allow shorter pedestrian crossing times because of reduced crossing distances. 12 ft lanes provide increased benefit on high speed, free-flowing principle arterials.
Intermediate to High Speed
12 ft lanes provide increased benefit where there are higher truck volumes, especially for intermediate and high-speed facilities. Safety and mobility performance difference between 11 ft and 12 ft lanes can be negligible. Work with Region Traffic Office to evaluate performance differences for the subject roadway 11 ft lanes are common on urban arterials
Low Speed
Lane widths of 10 ft may be appropriate in constrained areas with low truck and bus volume In pedestrian oriented sections, 10 ft lanes can be beneficial in minimizing crossing distance

Chapter 1231
Geometric Cross Section – Highways
1231.04(1)(b) Turn Lanes Dedicated turn lanes are separated from the through lanes and provide storage for turning vehicles waiting for a signal or gap in opposing traffic. There are a number of different types of turn lanes which are discussed in detail in Chapter 1310. Turn lanes are useful when addressing the mobility and accessibility performance of motorized and bicycle modes. Traffic analysis determines the type, storage length, and number of turn lanes that are needed to achieve the balance of multimodal performance needs. Turn lanes present potential conflicts, particularly with bicyclists and pedestrians. See Chapter 1510 and Chapter 1520 for additional discussion on ways to mitigate for these conflicts.
1231.04(1)(c) Transit-Only Lanes Transit-only lanes are ideal for improving transit mobility performance and segregating heavily used or complex intermodal connections. There are many different ways to configure these within a geometric cross section. Some configurations are limited due to passenger loading needs for both the transit vehicle type and the stop locations. Develop widths for transit-only lanes with the partnering transit agency. See Chapter 1730 for additional information on Transit Facility considerations.
1231.04(1)(d) Auxiliary lanes Auxiliary lanes enhance mobility performance for motor vehicles. See Chapter 1270 for design guidance and a detailed discussion on the types of auxiliary lanes.
1231.04(1)(e) Managed and Shared Lanes There are many different types of managed and shared lanes. Some examples include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
High occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes (see Chapter 1410) Express toll lanes (ETL) (discuss with Tolling Division and see Chapter 1410) Part-time shoulder Metered shoulder Bicycle shared lane (see Chapter 1520) Business access and transit (BAT) lane (see Chapter 1410, Arterial Street HOV)
1231.05 Bicycle and Pedestrian Elements Bicycle and pedestrian elements include sidewalks, buffers, bicycle lanes and shared-use-paths. Note that shoulders designed to accommodate bicycles or pedestrians are not considered bicycle lanes. See Chapter 1510 and Chapter 1520 for information on the design of pedestrian and bicycle facilities.
1231.06 Designing Cross Sections (Section Rewritten 2023) Select a cross section configuration that is based on the design elements and dimensions included in the project’s preferred alternative (Chapter 1104, Chapter 1105, Chapter 1106), and the applicable design controls (Chapter 1103), and in the case of Complete Streets, including the required level of traffic stress (see Chapter 1510 and Chapter 1520). Where a range of values is provided for a cross section element, either in the examples below or in the applicable chapter in this manual, use the “mode, function, performance” approach to select and document the appropriate dimensions (see Chapter 1106).

1231.07 Cross Section Examples The cross-section examples in this section are organized by modal priority based on the following primary modes:
Motor Vehicles, including freight
Bicycles
Pedestrians
Transit
The cross-section examples shown in Exhibit 1231-2 through Exhibit 1231-7 depict various combinations of elements that may be included in a cross section. The examples are intended to stimulate designer creativity and awareness of modal accommodations and are not intended to be standard cross sections to be reproduced for a given modal priority. It is expected that innovative project alternatives will result in diverse configurations that best balance baseline and contextual needs (see Chapter 1101). The intention in providing these examples is to depict combinations of elements that may be included in a cross section depending on modal priority and Level of Traffic Stress needs. These examples are not standards, but instead are intended to be a starting point in the design process, demonstrating noteworthy practices in how to accommodate a given modal priority. Note that the dimensions shown in the examples represent design policy (except where noted as optional), and decisions to depart from the value or range shown for a particular element (based on the function described for it) requires a Design Analysis (see Section 300.03(2)(a). Refer to the specific chapters referenced in the examples for more information about the configuration of individual elements, combinations of elements, and their required dimensions (or range of dimensions). Maintaining the continuity of a roadway is an important consideration, particularly for limited access and other high-speed highways. However, it is also appropriate to change continuity as context changes in order to influence driver behavior. When designing intentional changes to the continuity of the roadway cross section, consider what is needed to enable the transition. High-speed to low-speed changes will need to transition the cross section over a distance utilizing a speed transition segment (see Chapter 1103).
1231.07(1) Auto-and Freight Oriented Cross Sections Exhibit 1231-3 shows examples of motorized vehicle-oriented designs. Motorized vehicles come in a variety of types which are operated on many vehicle lanes and parking areas. The performance needs of freight and other automotive vehicle types are often similar. However, certain truck vehicle types may require additional turning roadway width for off-tracking (see Chapter 1240), or at other locations a truck climbing lane may be needed to facilitate mobility performance (see Chapter 1270). Generally, lane width within suburban and urban contexts is less critical for mobility and safety performance than in rural and high-speed contexts. Within urban areas, placement of and sizing for loading areas within the parking areas can depend on the freight vehicle type.

1231.07(2) Cross Sections Featuring Bicycle Facilities Exhibit 1231-3 Example A features bicycle facilities at an intermediate-speed location. Bike lane location within the cross section depends largely on how cyclists will interact with the land use and potential modal conflicts. Locating directional bike lanes on the outside of the motor vehicle lanes can improve accessibility for bicyclists. If cyclist mobility performance is a primary concern or intermodal conflicts (such as transit stop locations) are present, locating a two-way bike facility on one side of the roadway may be more appropriate. Whether or not a bike lane buffer is needed depends mostly on the target speed and average daily traffic (ADT) of the facility; the intent of bike buffers or other protected bike facilities is to address safety performance for cyclists. Buffers and other means of modal segregation also benefit motor vehicle drivers and bicyclists by delineating allocated spaces. Both roadway bike lane configurations and bike facility selection are discussed in more detail in Chapter 1520.

1231.07(3) Cross Sections Featuring Pedestrian Facilities Exhibit 1231-5 shows cross-section examples featuring pedestrian facilities. The pedestrian mode is a vital transportation mode since, for most people, nearly every trip at least begins and ends by walking or rolling. Roadway facilities prioritized for pedestrians emphasize streetside elements. See Chapter 1238 for guidance regarding streetside elements. The objective is to achieve the Pedestrian Circulation Path (PCP) necessary to support mobility, socioeconomic, and accessibility needs and provide access to intermodal connections. The configuration and dimension of streetside elements varies significantly depending on the performance needs being addressed. See Chapter 1510 for additional pedestrian design requirements and considerations.

1231.07(4) Cross Sections Featuring Transit Facilities Exhibit 1231-6 provides examples of different potential configurations oriented for the transit mode. Work with the transit provider to determine their ability to operate within a given cross-sectional arrangement. In general, transit configurations can be positioned toward the side or center of a roadway. Both side and center configurations can be implemented with medians or outer separations to improve safety performance for intermodal connections, or mobility performance for the transit service. Exhibit 1231-6 Example A shows a central configuration for transit service that provides a separated bus-only lane. Other transit vehicle types may require different widths and may also require other median cross section configurations for passenger loading. Exhibit 1231-6 Example B shows a side configuration where transit vehicles occupy the outside lane. This example can also be configured as business access and transit [BAT] lanes. Note the importance of streetside elements to assist with intermodal connections. Exhibit 1231-6 Example C is an example of a type of special use lane for high-speed routes that are routinely congested. In this example, the shoulder allows the restricted use for buses.

1231.07(5) Example Cross-Sections – Complete Streets Complete street configurations attempt to balance the performance needs of all users, regardless of age, ability, or mode. The general intent is to provide context-appropriate designs that enable safe access for all design users. It is always important to consider modal connectivity and conflicts that may occur with complete street configurations, particularly at intersections and/or transit stop locations. There are different potential configurations for complete streets, such as:
•
•
•
A rural two-lane highway with an adjacent shared-use path. An urban highway or street with vehicle lanes, bike lanes, bus lanes, and sidewalks. An urban highway that undergoes a “road diet” (see Section 1231.08) including installation of additional pedestrian crossings.
The low-speed examples in Exhibit 1231-7 illustrate roadway cross sections that:
•
•
•
•
Separate access lanes from through traffic lanes using curbed islands. Reduce conflicts between pedestrian, bike, transit, and auto modes by separating them. Provide transit stops integrated with raised islands. May result in improved operations for all modes.

1231.08 Roadway Cross Section Reallocation Roadway cross section reallocation (also known as road diets or road buffets) change the channelization and roadway features of an existing roadway to improve multimodal performance. At intersections and access points, a reallocation can improve sight distances, may improve access management along the road, and in some cases may also improve mobility performance for motorists. A common example is converting four-lane undivided highways to three lanes with the center lane for left turning movements and the remaining outside space repurposed for bicyclists or other functions. The center lane can consist of a two-way left-turn lane (TWLTL) or can be dedicated for directional left turns either by paint or other median treatments. The choice of how to configure the center lane depends largely on balancing the resulting safety and accessibility performance of different modes and land uses. (See Chapter 540 for additional restrictions on the use of TWLTLs)
Typical Road Diet Basic Design from FHWA Road Diet Informational Guide
Refer to “Guidebook for Roadway Cross Section Reallocation” (NCHRP 1036) for more information about developing reallocation alternatives, analyzing tradeoffs, and identifying a preferred alternative. The Region Traffic Engineer must approve reallocation applications on state highways. Retrofit options refer to the application of lower-cost treatments that utilize paint and other delineation devices rather than hardscape features. See Chapter 1238 for more information on retrofit options such as relocating the curb, parklets and plazas.

If your roadway fits the definition of a freeway, use the guidance in this chapter for geometric cross-section elements. If your roadway is not a freeway, see Chapter 1230.
1232.01 General Freeways are defined as divided highways with a minimum of two lanes in each direction for the exclusive use of vehicular traffic and with full control of access. Interstate is one type of freeway. Freeways are high-speed facilities that prioritize through travel for vehicles, freight and transit. Lanes must be wide enough for all vehicles that use them. Shoulders provide very important functions for freeways. Freeways can be thought of as a unique context. This is reflected by the fact that design controls (Chapter 1103) are fairly consistent for all freeways:
•
•
•
Modal priority: motor vehicles Access control: full control Design speed: high
Freeways do not present the challenges of accommodating the competing needs of other modes such as pedestrians. Also, adjacent land use is generally not an issue due to freeways being limited access facilities. For these reasons, choosing cross-sectional element dimensions for freeways does not have as many complexities as for some other roadway types. Note that there are locations where bicyclists are allowed use of the freeway shoulder. The geometric cross-section for interstate freeways is shown in Exhibit 1232-1. The geometric cross-section for non-interstate freeways is shown in Exhibit 1232-2. Refer to the Design Manual Glossary for terms used in this chapter. Refer to Chapter 300 for design documentation requirements.
1232.02 Lane Width For freeways, travel-through mobility and safety for motor vehicles are prioritized performance areas. Lanes must be wide enough for all vehicles that use them to travel safely at high speeds. When a range is given for lane width, use the mode/function/performance approach described in Chapter 1106 and “design up” to choose a width within the range. See Chapter 1231 for considerations for choosing a lane width.
1232.03 Shoulder Width The prioritization of travel-through mobility and safety for motor vehicles results in placing a high priority on providing some important shoulder functions (see Chapter 1239) for freeways:
•
•
Stopping out of traffic Emergency services & incidence response

Chapter 1232
•
Geometric Cross Section – Freeways
Maintenance operations
The high-speed nature of freeways reinforces the importance of providing these functions. For instance, the high speed differential between a stopped vehicle and adjacent traffic leads to a greater need to get stopped traffic out of the travelled way. Also, the limited access nature of freeways generally means that there are fewer access points to provide potential refuge. When a range is given for shoulder width, use the mode/function/performance approach described in Chapter 1106 and “design up” to choose a width within the range. See Chapter 1239 for additional considerations for choosing a shoulder width.

Use of the shoulder on a freeway for part-time shoulder or as an HOV lane requires a Design Analysis. [1] 4 ft minimum on facilities up to 4 lanes, and 10 ft minimum on 6-lane facilities. In mountainous terrain, inside shoulder may be reduced to 4 ft on facilities up to 6 lanes. [2] In mountainous terrain, outside shoulders may be reduced to 8 ft on facilities up to 6 lanes.

1232.05 Design Flexibility There are always locations that warrant special consideration. Existing freeways may have constraints (right-ofway or environmental considerations, for example) that make the cost of widening outweigh the benefits. The optimum solution may include widths different than those shown. If this is the case for your project, and you choose widths different than shown in the Design Manual, formulate alternative solutions that consider the tradeoffs associated with various lane and shoulder widths and document the decision in a Design Analysis. Where appropriate, include documentation of your consultation with the project advisory team (see Chapter 1100) in the Design Analysis. When compiling the Design Analysis, consider recent design resources that explore options, performance, functions, and mitigation associated with various lane and shoulder dimensions. One source is FHWA HOP-16060 “Use of Narrow Lanes and Narrow Shoulders on Freeways.” Another source is NCHRP 15-47, “Developing an Improved Highway Geometric Design Process”.

Exhibit 1238-1 Zones within the Streetside
1238.01 General The geometric cross section of a roadway is composed of different elements. The cross sections shown in Chapter 1231 include parking and various zones within the streetside (see Exhibit 1238-1). This chapter provides information on parking and streetside elements. The need to provide a particular element is dependent on the context and modal needs for a given section of roadway.
1238.02 Parking On-street parking is typically provided in urban and rural town center areas, but is not necessarily required. Onstreet parking can help visually narrow the street in places to assist in conveying the surrounding context for the segment. Refer to municipal codes regarding parking requirements, and coordinate with the municipality involved. Also, if on-street parking will be either delineated or metered, the ADA has requirements on the number and configuration of parking stalls for people with disabilities. Consult with a regional ADA subject matter expert. On-street parking can be either parallel or angled. However, angled parking on any state route requires approval from the State Traffic Engineer. Submit a request for angled parking approval through the region Traffic Office. Include an engineering study documenting that the parking will not unduly reduce safety and that the roadway is of sufficient width that parking will not interfere with the normal movement of traffic. Provide for vehicle overhang within the furnishing zone for all angled parking locations. Consider back-in angled parking if bike lanes are present to improve conflict management through increased visibility. When designing parking locations for freight loading areas, it is important to consider both the delivery vehicle size and how the vehicle loading/unloading is done. Consult with business owners and freight carriers to locate and configure the freight loading areas. Width considerations: Cross sections in the Design Manual generally show a range for parallel parking of 7 to 9 feet. AASHTO defines a passenger car width as 7 feet. Additional width can allow a buffer for car doors opening, a buffer for bike riders, or a stall that can accommodate delivery trucks. Work with stakeholders to determine the appropriate width to provide within the site-specific constraints.
1238.03 Streetside The area behind the curb is referred to as the “streetside” and is described in terms of “zones.” Information about each zone is provided below. Note, local agency partners may have policy containing additional streetside zones to consider.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1238-1
Chapter 1238
Geometric Cross Section – Streetside and Parking
WSDOT uses the following terminology to describe the zones found within the streetside:
•
•
•
Frontage Zone Pedestrian Zone Furnishing Zone
Exhibit 1238-1 Zones within the Streetside
The streetside is the interface between pedestrians and land use. A robust streetside can serve as both a pedestrian thoroughfare and a destination, which is desirable in many urban core and main street contexts to help promote economic vitality. The streetside can also reinforce the target speed. The pedestrian zone will always be present in streetside design, but other zones are optional and dependent on the modal and contextual needs and desired balance of performance needs within the available right of way. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires specific design element dimensions for streetside elements, depending on the configuration. In general, the pedestrian zone and frontage zone will always be part of the pedestrian circulation path (PCP). The furnishing zone may or may not be part of the PCP, depending on how it is designed. See Chapter 1510 for detailed accessibility criteria and design guidance for pedestrian facilities.
1238.03(1) Frontage Zone The frontage zone serves the retail functions, and is the portion of the sidewalk that provides the connection to the building. The frontage zone includes the building, the façade, and the space immediately adjacent to the building. The primary purpose is access to retail space without interfering with the required pedestrian access route (PAR) within the pedestrian zone. The frontage zone may also provide space for sidewalk cafes, temporary retail product displays, advertisements, and/or outdoor seating for customers. If there is no retail or residential access need adjacent to the streetside, a frontage zone may not be necessary. Width considerations: Cross sections in Design Manual generally show a range for the frontage zone width of 2 to 12 feet.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1238-2
Chapter 1238
Geometric Cross Section – Streetside and Parking
Narrow, 2-ft frontage zones provide for a clear area where protruding objects from the building can be located without compromising the pedestrian access route. Two feet also provides an offset from the building and minimal space for entering/exiting the building. Wider frontage zones, such as 12-ft can provide width for a variety of possible elements, such as sidewalk café dining with tables and chairs along the building. If a frontage zone is to be provided, work with stakeholders to determine the appropriate width to provide within the site-specific constraints.
1238.03(2) Pedestrian Zone The pedestrian zone is the space available to accommodate pedestrian travel that will:
•
•
•
•
Create interconnectivity between different land uses Provide for the transfer between modes Separate pedestrians from vehicular traffic Support walking as a transportation mode
The pedestrian zone is located within the Pedestrian Circulation Path and includes the Pedestrian Access Route (PAR) needed to meet ADA accessibility criteria (see Chapter 1510). The pedestrian zone may be considerably wider than the PAR. A generous pedestrian zone width promotes the mobility and accessibility typically anticipated within some urban and suburban contexts. Consider wider pedestrian zones when the following are present:
•
•
•
•
Transit facilities and passenger shelters Access routes to businesses School walking routes Other high pedestrian activity generators
Width considerations: The minimum pedestrian zone width of 5 feet corresponds to WSDOT’s minimum sidewalk width (see Chapter 1510). Other considerations when choosing a pedestrian zone width include:
•
•
•
•
•
In many downtown environments, the focus is on multimodal transportation and, in particular, pedestrian accessibility and use. Wider streetside zones promote a greater sense of safety, and can provide a comfortable and inviting area that can attract pedestrians. In urban/downtown environments where store fronts/businesses are located, a larger width is recommended. Consider providing wider sidewalks to increase pedestrian comfort levels and to promote walking. In places with higher pedestrian volumes, a 10 foot width allows for pedestrians walking side-by-side or in groups to pass others comfortably without changing directions or walking speed. A 10 foot width provides sufficient width for a wheelchair user to turn around and to pass another wheelchair user (5 foot width is typically adequate to perform these maneuvers). The minimum sidewalk width of 5 feet is appropriate in low pedestrian volume areas, such as where there are few stores abutting the street or in residential neighborhoods.
Work with stakeholders to determine the appropriate width to provide within site-specific constraints.

Chapter 1238
Geometric Cross Section – Streetside and Parking
1238.03(3) Furnishing Zone The furnishing zone is the key buffer component between the active pedestrian walking area (pedestrian zone) and the roadway. The furnishing zone provides area for multiple functions. The furnishing zone is not located within the Pedestrian Access Route (PAR). However, a PAR connection is required to many features that may be found in this zone (such as street furniture, parking meters, transit shelters, and transit boarding areas.) The Furnishing zone:
•
•
•
•
Promotes environmental and aesthetic features that improve people’s experience Contains street trees, street furniture, benches, planter boxes, and artwork Provides for the travel of the various modes through modal segregation or clearance to obstructions Discourages crossings at less desirable locations along the facility with use of buffers.
Traffic signs and signal cabinets; utility poles; fire hydrants; parking meters; transit boarding, queuing, and shelters; and bike racks are also generally found within the furnishing zone. Involve the local agency, regional Landscape Architect, and safety professionals to determine optimal vegetation types. Other width accommodations for on-street parking may be needed for vehicle overhang or entering/exiting movements when parking is present. Coordinate with region Program Management to understand potential funding limitations for furnishing zone features described within this section. Partnerships or grants may be necessary to complete all desired features within the furnishing zone. Width considerations: A width of 2 feet provides the minimum width to accommodate utilities and street furniture. Greater widths accommodate a larger variety of possible features within the furnishing zone. Other considerations when choosing a furnishing zone width include:
•
•
•
•
An 8-foot width or greater generally provides sufficient space to accommodate a bus transit stop (loading/unloading) and a transit shelter (see Chapter 1730 and work with the transit provider to determine needed space.) In commercial areas, a minimum furnishing zone width of 4 feet is recommended. In areas where snow accumulation can occur, the furnishing zone can provide snow storage space that does not decrease the width of the pedestrian zone. When higher vehicle speeds are present, providing a larger width to act as a buffer between vehicles and pedestrians is desirable.
If a furnishing zone is to be provided, work with stakeholders to determine the appropriate width to provide in order to accommodate the expected features within the site-specific constraints.
1238.04 Retrofit Options Retrofit options refer to the application of lower-cost treatments that utilize paint and other delineation devices rather than hardscape features. Retrofit applications are particularly useful when:
•
•
•
Construction will occur in phases over a timeline greater than one year between phases where overlapping areas of work occur, or when elements or features are funded by a partnering agency. Implementing speed management treatments (see Chapter 1103) that, after evaluating their effectiveness, may need to be reconfigured. Funding is unable to adequately accomplish the identified scope of work.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1238-4
Chapter 1238
Geometric Cross Section – Streetside and Parking
Applied retrofit options may require additional maintenance over long-duration applications. Coordination with maintenance jurisdictions as described in Chapter 301 is critical to evaluating the potential maintenance outcomes for retrofit options being considered. The retrofit options discussed within the following subsections are more likely to be applied in urban context settings. Note that cities over 25,000 population will have the responsibility of maintaining any retrofit delineation, and it will be critical to ensure they have the resources to maintain striped retrofit features. The following subsections describe several common applications of retrofit options.
1238.04(1) Relocate Curbs Changes to the geometric cross section may involve relocating the existing curb. While installing a new curb may be preferred, there are a number of additional considerations (like stormwater conveyance) that make relocating curb lines cost-prohibitive. However, there are multiple retrofit solutions that can provide effective accommodation including, but not limited to:
•
•
•
Striping combined with MUTCD-approved channelization devices. Curb extensions offset from the original curb. Depending on the use of the new curbed section, retrofit designs may include slotted grates tying the existing curb and new curb together while maintaining the original stormwater conveyance system. Colorized pavement to delineate a change of use.
Use retrofit features as a low-cost solution to create wider sidewalk areas, curb extensions, bicycle parking areas, parklet areas, and/or green street low-impact development solutions.
Note that retrofits like this must comply with the accessibility criteria for pedestrian facilities in Chapter 1510.

1238.04(2) Parklets and Plazas Parklets and plazas reuse existing right of way in urban and rural town centers, providing public space to support the economic vitality and social livability performance of a particular context. As geometric cross sections are reconfigured, spaces may become available at intersections or for repurposing a parking area into either plazas or parklets. The primary intent of presenting these treatments is for low-speed roadways or main streets with volumes at or below 20,000 ADT. However, there are many potential constraints external to the engineering design that may need resolution before application. Consult with Real Estate Services to discuss the specific property management-related concerns and any potential lease and/or economic payment considerations proportionally appropriate for utilization of the highway space in this manner, as further detailed in RCW 47.24.020(15).
A parklet specifically uses the area usually used for parking to create a space for pedestrians. A common application provides seating accommodations to support local restaurants and shops. Parklet designs will vary depending on local jurisdiction regulations, but they typically include railing and/or planter boxes to provide a separation of uses between people and traffic.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1238
Geometric Cross Section – Streetside and Parking
Parklet design should not cover catch basins or other features that may require frequent maintenance. Parklets interact with motorized vehicle traffic best when placed on tangent alignments. Plazas can reuse right of way to define a relatively large common public space. Plazas are typically associated with a central gathering location for special events, and will likely have limited application on Washington state highways.

1239.02 Shoulders Shoulders are typically used on high, or intermediate speed limited and non-limited access facilities, some rural contexts, as well as intermediate-speed locations that do not have streetsides (curb-sections) (see Chapter 1238). Intermediate-speed locations in suburban and urban contexts that utilize streetsides do not need to include a shoulder unless determined to be necessary by shoulder function, (where intended for bicyclists for example) or safety performance analysis, hydraulic analysis or engineering judgment. Shoulders provide space to escape potential collisions or reduce their severity. They also provide a sense of openness, contributing to driver ease at higher speeds. Shoulders also convey drainage away from the traveled way as determined by hydraulic analysis.

[3] Intermediate-speed and low-speed locations in urban and suburban contexts utilizing streetsides do not need to include a shoulder unless necessary for safety performance, hydraulic performance or engineering judgment. See Exhibit 1231-5, Exhibit 1231-6 (A & B), Exhibit 1231-7 (B & C), and Section 1239.02.
1239.02(1)(a) Shoulder Width Considerations Exhibit 1239-2 lists considerations for choosing an appropriate shoulder width from the range given. The considerations listed help one to understand the modal needs and function associated with different shoulder widths. Contact the Area Maintenance Superintendent to determine/verify the shoulder width appropriate for maintenance operations. In some cases, a continuous width is not necessary; instead, the focus is placing the shoulder width near assets with high-frequency maintenance needs. Compare the added cost of the wider shoulders to the added benefits to maintenance operations as well as other benefits that may be derived (see Chapter 301). The usable shoulder is the width necessary to provide the desired function (see Exhibit 1239-2). Usable shoulder width is less than the constructed shoulder width when vertical features (such as traffic barrier or walls) are at the edge of the shoulder. This is because roadway users tend to shy away from the vertical feature. For widening for traffic barrier, see Chapter 1600. For requirements for lateral clearance to barrier or curb, see Section 1239.06. When walls are placed adjacent to shoulders, see Chapter 730 and Chapter 740 for barrier guidance. Shoulder widths greater than 10 feet may encourage use as a travel lane. Therefore, use shoulders wider than 10 feet only to meet one of the listed functions (see Exhibit 1239-2).

(See the Standard Plans for additional details and dimensions.) [6] Consider using the same application of slope rounding on all ramps and crossroads, as well as the main roadway. Use end rounding on the crossroad just beyond the ramp terminals and at a similar location where only a grade separation is involved. [7] When widening beyond the edge of usable shoulder for curb or barrier, additional widening for slope rounding may be omitted. [8] For widening guidelines for guardrail and concrete barrier, see Chapter 1610 and Exhibit 1610-10. [9] Permanent precast unanchored barrier shown above. See Exhibit 1610-3 for other barrier deflection distances. [10]There is no minimum width between pavement and break point for side slopes 4H:1V or flatter and 1 foot minimum width between pavement and break point for side slopes steeper than 4H:1V. General: On divided multilane highways, see Exhibit 1239-15 through Exhibit 1239-17 for additional details for median shoulders.
1239.03 Fill Sections, Cut Sections, and Ditch Sections The design for side slopes can affect shoulder design, clear zone requirements, and whether or not traffic barrier is warranted. There are three basic roadway sections for side slopes. Fill sections – Roadway sections where the height of the roadway is higher than the existing natural ground. Ditch sections - Roadway sections where the height of the roadway is higher than the existing natural ground but not as high as the needed roadside ditch so that after the needed ditch is installed there is a foreslope into the ditch and a back slope out of the ditch up to where it catches the natural ground. Cut sections - Roadway sections where the height of the roadway is lower than the existing ground. This typically produces a foreslope into the ditch and a back slope out of the ditch up to where it catches the natural ground. When designing side slopes, attempt to fit the slope selected for any fill section, ditch section, or cut section into the existing terrain to give a smooth transitional blend from the construction to the existing landscape when practicable. Flatter slopes are desirable, especially with higher posted speeds and when the associated cost does not significantly exceed other design options. Fill side slopes not steeper than 4H:1V, with smooth transitions where the slope changes, will provide a reasonable opportunity to recover control of an errant vehicle. Fill side slopes designed to 4H:1V or flatter are preferred. Provide widening and slope rounding outside the usable shoulder when the foreslope is steeper than 4H:1V (see Exhibit 1239-3). Do not disturb existing stable cut slopes just to meet the 4H:1V foreslope preference.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1239-6
Chapter 1239
Geometric Cross Section – Shoulders, Side Slopes, Cross Sections, and Medians
Fill-slopes that are steeper than 4H:1V but not steeper than 3H:1V are considered traversable but not recoverable. When providing a slope that meets these characteristics, placement of a clear area extending from the toe of the slope to the outside edge of the design clear zone is needed for an errant vehicle runout and stop (see Chapter 1600 for design clear zone guidance). Consult with Region Maintenance to determine if mowing is contemplated. When providing fill-slopes steeper than 3H:1V, it is a best practice to document the reason for the decision in the design documentation package. When mowing is contemplated, provide slopes not steeper than 3H:1V. Where unusual geological features or soil conditions exist, treatment of the slopes depends upon results of a review of the location by the Region Materials Engineer. See Section 1600.03(1) for when to use traffic barrier to mitigate a side slope. Unmitigated critical slopes will require a Design Analysis. The steepest slope allowed is determined by the Region Materials Engineer based on soil conditions. If more material is needed to build the roadway, consider obtaining it by flattening cut slopes uniformly on one or both sides of the highway. Consult the Region Materials Engineer to determine what percentage of the excavated material will likely be suitable for fill material. Where considering wasting excess material on an existing fill side slope, consult the Region Materials Engineer to verify that the subgrade will support the additional material. Provide for drainage from the roadway surface and drainage in ditches (see Chapter 800). For drainage ditches, see Section 1239.03(1). At locations where vegetated filter areas or detention facilities will be established to improve highway runoff water quality, provide appropriate slope, space, and soil conditions for that purpose. (See the Highway Runoff Manual for design criteria and additional guidance.) It is desirable to plant and establish low-growing vegetation on non-paved roadsides. This type of treatment relies on the placement of a lift of compost or topsoil over base course material in the roadway cross section. Consult with the area Maintenance Superintendent and the region or HQ Landscape Architect to determine the appropriate configuration of the roadway cross section and soil and plant specifications. This kind of treatment would not be done where barrier is installed along the roadway as the lift of compost or topsoil is not a suitable barrier foundation. Flatten freeway section median cross-over foreslopes to 10H:1V (See Section 1370.03). Flatten crossroad and road approach foreslopes not steeper than 6H:1V on other highways. Grade crossroad and road approach foreslopes flatter than 6H:1V where feasible. Provide smooth transitions between the main line foreslopes and the crossroad or road approach foreslopes. Move the crossroad or road approach drainage as far away from the main line as feasible. This can locate the pipe outside the Design Clear Zone and reduce the length of pipe. Provide slope treatment as shown in the Standard Plans (Slope treatment) at the top of roadway cut slopes except for cuts in solid rock. Unless Class B slope treatment is called for, Class A slope treatment is used. Call for Class B slope treatment where space is limited, such as where right of way is restricted.
1239.03(1) Drainage Ditches Exhibit 1239-5 shows the preferred trapezoidal ditch section and the alternative V bottom ditch section. The trapezoidal ditch design is preferred as V bottom ditches tend to silt up faster than flat bottom trapezoidal ditches and Trapezoidal ditches convey more drainage than V ditches. On the other hand, Trapezoidal ditches can be more difficult to construct than V bottom ditches. The trapezoidal ditch is preferred, but a ‘V’ bottom ditch can be used where constraints, such as limited right of way or sensitive areas, preclude a trapezoidal ditch. Consult with the Region Hydraulic Engineer to determine if the chosen design meets the needed hydraulic performance. Consult with the Region Materials Engineer about the chosen ditch foreslope and backslope.

When topographic restrictions exist, consider an enclosed drainage system with appropriate inlets and outlets. Maintenance operations are also facilitated by adequate width between the toe of the slope and an adjacent drainage ditch. Where this type of facility is anticipated, provide sufficient right of way for access to the facility and place the drainage ditch as close to the right of way line as feasible.

Foreslopes 4H:1V or flatter are desirable. See Exhibit 1239-4 for requirements for slopes steeper than 4H:1V Foreslopes and backslopes 3H:1V or flatter support mowing operations. Do not design foreslopes and/or backslopes steeper than 2H:1V without Region Materials Engineer and Region Hydraulics Engineer concurrence. See Exhibit 1600-6 for foreslopes steeper than 3H:1V. See Hydraulics Manual, Section 4-3 and Figure 4-7 for ditch depth detail.
1239.03(2) Bridge End Slopes Bridge end slopes are determined by several factors, including context, fill height, depth of cut, soil stability, and horizontal and vertical alignment. Coordinate bridge end slope treatment with the HQ Bridge and Structures Office (see Chapter 720). Whenever possible, design to avoid creating environments that might be desirable to the homeless, both for their safety and the safety of maintenance staff. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

1239.04 Roadway Sections in Rock Cuts There are two basic design treatments applicable to rock excavation. Typical sections for rock cuts, illustrated in Exhibit 1239-8 and Exhibit 1239-9, are guides for the design and construction of roadways through rock cuts. Design A applies to most rock cuts. Design B is a talus slope treatment. Changes in slope or fallout area are recommended when justified. Base the selection of the appropriate sections on an engineering study and the recommendations of the region Materials Engineer and region Landscape Architect. Obtain concurrence from the Headquarters Geotechnical Office.
1239.04(1) Design A This design is shown in cases to aid the Geotech Designer in selecting an appropriate section for the site conditions in regard to the backslope, probable rockfall, hardness of rock, and so on. The following guidelines apply to the various cases shown in Exhibit 1239-8:
•
•
•
Case 1 is used where the anticipated quantity of rockfall is small, adequate fallout width can be provided, and the rock slope is ½H:1V or steeper. Controlled blasting is recommended in conjunction with Stage 1 construction. Case 2 is used when a “rocks in the road” problem exists or is anticipated. Consider it on flat slopes where rocks are apt to roll rather than fall. Cases 3, 4, and 5 represent the full implementation of all protection and safety measures applicable to rock control. Use these when extreme rockfall conditions exist. o Case 3 – Protection and safety measures applicable to rock control using guardrail. o Case 4 – Protection and safety measures applicable to rock control using concrete barrier with no rock protection fence. o Case 5 – Protection and safety measures applicable to rock control using concrete barrier and rock protection fence.
The use of Cases 2, 4, or 5 (concrete barrier) is based on the designer’s analysis of the particular site. Considerations include maintenance; size and amount of rockfall; probable velocities; availability of materials; ditch capacity; adjacent traffic volumes; distance from traveled lane; and impact severity. Incorporate removable sections in the barrier at approximately 200-foot intervals. Provide appropriate terminal treatment (see Section 1610.06(3)). Occasionally, the existing ground above the top of the cut is on a slope approximating the design cut slope. The height (H) is to include the existing slope or that portion that can logically be considered part of the cut. Select cut slopes for a project that provide stability for the existing material. Benches may be used to increase slope stability; however, the use of benches may alter the design given in Exhibit 1239-8. The necessity for benches, as well as their width and vertical spacing, is established after an evaluation of slope stability. Make benches at least 20 feet wide. Provide access for maintenance equipment to the lowest bench and to the higher benches if feasible. Greater traffic benefits in the form of added safety, increased horizontal sight distance on curves, and other desirable attributes may be realized from widening a cut rather than benching.

[3] Consult with the Region Materials Engineer to make this slope as steep as the material will allow. General: Treat cut heights less than 20 feet as a normal roadway unless otherwise determined by the Region Materials Engineer.

1239.04(2) Design B A talus slope treatment is shown in Exhibit 1239-9. The rock protection fence is placed at any one of the three positions shown, but not in more than one position at a particular location. Consult with the RME for the placement of the rock protection fence in talus slope areas.
•
•
•
•
Fence position a is used when the cliff generates boulders less than 0.25 yd3 in size and the length of the slope is greater than 350 feet. Fence position b is the preferred location for most applications. Fence position c is used when the cliff generates boulders greater than 0.25 yd3 in size regardless of the length of the slope. On short slopes, this may require placing the fence less than 100 feet from the base of the cliff. Use of gabions may be considered instead of the rock protection shown in fence position a. Because gabion treatment is considered similar to a wall, provide appropriate face and end protection (see Chapter 730 and Chapter 1610).
Use of the alternate shoulder barrier is based on the designer’s analysis of the particular site. Considerations similar to those given for Design A alternatives apply. Evaluate the need for rock protection treatments other than those described above for cut slopes that have relatively uniform spalling surfaces (consult with the RME).

•
•
Ordinarily, place fence within a zone of 100 feet to 200 feet maximum from base of cliff, measured along the slope. Rock protection fence may be used in conjunction with the Shoulder Barrier Alternate when site conditions dictate.
1239.04(3) Stepped Slopes Stepped slopes are a construction method intended to promote early establishment of vegetative cover on the slopes. They consist of a series of small horizontal steps or terraces on the face of the cut slope. Soil conditions dictate the feasibility and necessity of stepped slopes. They are to be considered on the recommendation of the RME (see Chapter 610). Consult the region landscape personnel for appropriate design and vegetative materials to be used. Use Exhibit 1239-10 for stepped slope design. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

1239.05 Curbs Vertical curbs with a face slope of 1H:3V or steeper that are more than 4 inches tall are not considered mountable, while vertical curbs that are 4 inches tall or shorter are considered mountable. Curbs with a sloping face (flatter than 1H:3V) that are as tall as 6 inches are mountable but using curbs 4 inches or less is recommended in order to reduce vehicle underside damage if driven over. 1239.05(1) Non-Mountable Vertical Curb Uses a) Use vertical curbs with a height of 6 inches: To delineate the traveled way with respect to other features in the roadway cross-section such as medians, sidewalks, landscaped areas, etc. To delineate separations between walkways and pedestrian refuges. To provide vertical grade separation between raised islands and the roadway surface. For expediting transfer times for transit partners on low-speed roadways in urban and suburban contexts (curb height may exceed 6 inches if needed by transit provider). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1239
Geometric Cross Section – Shoulders, Side Slopes, Cross Sections, and Medians
b) Consider vertical curbs with a height of 6 inches: To indicate to drivers where midblock left turns are not allowed. To delineate divisional and channelizing islands. To provide a hardscape boundary for raised landscaped islands. To convey stormwater. 1239.05(2) Mountable Curb Uses a) Provide mountable curbs where a curb is needed but vertical curb is not suitable for specific design user(s). b) Use mountable curbs in roundabouts. See Chapter 1320 and Standard Plan F-10.18-01. 1239.05(3) Curb Use Based on Speed Avoid using curbs if the same objective can be attained with pavement markings. Where the highway speed is 40 mph or faster, 4-inch-high mountable curbs may be used to control drainage or for access control and 6-inchhigh mountable curbs may be considered where streetside zones are provided or where traffic movements are to be restricted. Locate mountable curb no closer to the traveled way than the outer edge of the shoulder (4’ minimum). With justification, mountable curb may be placed at the edge of traveled way for access management in urban areas. With justification, vertical curb can be used on a 40 mph or faster highway if the vertical clearance is 4 or more feet wide. All curb types are appropriate for low-speed facilities. See Exhibit 1239-11 for lateral clearance to curb for low speed and ramps. With all curb types, provide sloping end treatments where the curb is introduced and terminated. Adding curb reduces lane and/or shoulder width and may require additional documentation. 1239.05(4) Curb Used for Drainage Where curbing is provided to direct drainage, provide a design that collects the surface water at the curb and drains it without ponding in the traveled way or flowing across the roadway. In some areas, curb may be needed to control runoff water until ground cover is attained to control erosion. Document the plan to remove the curb when the ground cover becomes adequate. A best practice is to arrange for curb removal with region maintenance staff as part of the future maintenance plans (see Maintenance Owner’s Manual guidance in Chapter 301). When curb is used in conjunction with guardrail, see Chapter 1610 for guidance. For existing curb, particularly on facilities with a speed of 40 mph and faster, evaluate the continued need for the curb. Remove curbing that is no longer needed. 1239.05(5) Curb Use Considerations Curbs can provide physical guidance to drivers, but curbs are not intended to redirect errant vehicles. When an overlay will reduce the height of a curb, evaluate grinding (or replacing the curb) to maintain curb height if needed for pavement or drainage performance. (See Section 1250.02(2) for shoulder cross slope considerations.) To maintain or restore curb height, consider lowering the existing pavement level and improving cross slope by grinding before an asphalt overlay or as determined by the pavement design. The cross slope of the shoulder may be steepened to maximize curb height and minimize other related impacts. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Curbs can hamper snow-removal operations. In areas of heavy snowfall, ask the Area Maintenance Superintendent to review and concur with the use of curbing. For curbs at traffic islands, see Chapter 1310. For curbs at roundabouts, see Chapter 1320 and Standard Plan F10.18-01.
1239.06 Lateral Clearance to Curb and Barrier Lateral clearance to curb or barrier is the perpendicular distance from edge of traveled way to the face of a curb or a traffic barrier (guardrail, concrete barrier, etc.). Lateral clearance includes the shoulder width. The minimum lateral clearance to the face of a curb or barrier is shown in Exhibit 1239-11. See also Chapter 1310 for intersections including clearance to curb at traffic islands. Exhibit 1239-11 Minimum Lateral Clearance to Barrier and Curb [6] Posted Speed

[6] See Exhibit 1430-2 for part-time shoulders and Exhibit 1440-2 for metered shoulders.
1239.07 Chain-Up and/or Chain-Off Areas Provide chain-up areas in order to allow chains to be put on vehicles out of the through lanes at locations where traffic enters chain enforcement areas. Provide chain-off areas to remove chains out of the through lanes for traffic leaving chain enforcement areas. Chain-up or chain-off areas are widened shoulders designed as shown in Exhibit 1239-12. Locate chain-up and chain-off areas where the grade is 6% or less and desirably on a tangent section. Consider illumination for chain-up and chain-off areas on multilane highways. When deciding whether or not to install illumination, consider traffic volumes during the hours of darkness and the availability of power. See Section 1040.02(7). The wide shoulders at chain-up and chain-off areas may encourage parking. When parking is undesirable, consider parking restrictions.

1239.08 Medians and Outer Separations Medians are either restrictive or nonrestrictive. Restrictive medians physically limit motor vehicle encroachment, using raised curb, median barrier, fixed delineators, vegetative strips, or vegetative depressions. Nonrestrictive medians limit motor vehicle encroachment legally, and use pavement markings to define locations where turns are permissible. The main functions of an outer separation are to separate the main roadway from a frontage road or service lane, or to provide modal segregation. Consider medians or outer separations to optimize the desired performance objective, such as safety, throughput operations, pedestrian mobility needs, etc. Provide a median or outer separation to:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Separate traffic lanes such as ETL, HOV lanes, bike lanes, etc. Separate divided highways with differing alignments. Separate opposing traffic to reduce the risk of head-on collisions. Manage speed. Provide a refuge area for emergency parking. Allow for future widening of a planned phase. Separate collector-distributor lanes, frontage roads, weigh sites, or rest areas. Accommodate drainage facilities. Accommodate bridge piers at undercrossings. Provide vehicle storage space for crossing and left-turn movements at intersections. Accommodate headlight glare screens, including planted or natural foliage. Provide recovery areas for errant or disabled vehicles. Provide a pedestrian refuge area at crossing locations. Provide storage space for snow and water away from traffic lanes. Separate modes for increased safety, comfort, and ease of operations. Control access. Provide enforcement areas.
The width of a median is measured from edge of traveled way to edge of traveled way and includes shoulders. Median widths can vary greatly based on the functional use of the median, the functional use of the shoulders, target speed, and context. Guidance for median and shoulder widths depending on their function and context is given in:
•

1239.08(1) Median Design: High and Intermediate Speed Exhibit 1239-13 lists width considerations for median functions common on high and intermediate speed facilities. When the horizontal and vertical alignments of the two roadways of a divided highway are independent of one another, determine median side slopes in conformance with Section 1239.03 and Chapter 1600 and Chapter 1610. Independent horizontal and vertical alignment, rather than parallel alignment, can allow for reduced grading or cut sections.

Geometric Cross Section – Shoulders, Side Slopes, Cross Sections, and Medians
Considerable latitude in grading treatment is intended on wide, variable-width medians, provided the minimum performance needs are met or exceeded. Unnecessary clearing, grubbing, and grading are undesirable within wide medians. Use selective thinning and limited reshaping of the natural ground when feasible. For median clear zone criteria see Chapter 1600, and for slopes between the face of traffic barriers and the traveled way see Chapter 1610. In areas where land is expensive, make an economic comparison of wide medians to narrow medians with barrier. Consider right of way, construction, maintenance, and safety performance. The widths of medians need not be uniform. Make the transition between median widths as long as practical. (See Chapter 1210 for minimum taper lengths.) When using concrete barriers in depressed medians or on the insides of curves, provide for surface drainage on both sides of the barrier or provide MASH compliant scupper barrier. At locations where the median will be used to allow vehicles to make a U-turn, provide the widths in Exhibit 1310-30. (For information on U-turns, see Section 1310.02(19)) Document the selected design vehicle and provide alternate route information for vehicles not serviced by the U-turn. Where feasible, widen medians at intersections on rural divided multilane highways. Provide sufficient width to store vehicles crossing the expressway or entering the expressway with a left turn. When the median is to be landscaped, or where fixed objects are to be placed in the median, see Chapter 1600 for traffic barrier and clear zone guidance. When the median will transition for use as a left-turn lane, see Chapter 1310 for left-turn lane design considerations.

1240.01 General The roadway on a curve may need to be widened to make the operating conditions comparable to those on tangents. There are two main reasons to do this. One is the off-tracking of vehicles such as trucks and buses. The other is the increased difficulty drivers have in keeping their vehicles in the center of the lane. Apply turning roadway widths only when there is a need to optimize the operational or safety performance of a particular segment of roadway with larger volumes of trucks or when trucks are the identified modal priority. The application of turning roadway width is not applicable on managed access low-speed roadways or managed access intermediate-speed highways in suburban or urban contexts. For additional information, see the following: Chapter 1230 Cross section design element widths Chapter 1250 Superelevation Chapter 1360 Lane and shoulder widths for ramps
1240.02 Turning Roadway Widths 1240.02(1) Two-Lane Two-Way Roadways Exhibit 1240-1 shows the traveled way width (W) for two-lane two-way roadways. For values of radius (R) between those given, interpolate W and round up to the next foot. Minimum traveled way width (W), based on the delta angle of the curve (shown in Exhibit 1240-2), may be used. Document the reasons for using the minimum width. Round W to the nearest foot. Widths given in Exhibit 1240-1 and Exhibit 1240-2 are for facilities with 12-foot lanes. When 11-foot lanes are selected, width (W) may be reduced by 2 feet.
1240.02(2) Two-Lane One-Way Roadways Exhibit 1240-3 shows the traveled way width (W) for two-lane one-way turning roadways, including two-lane ramps and four-lane highways. For values of radius (R) between those given, interpolate W and round up to the next foot. Treat each direction of travel on four-lane facilities as a one-way roadway. Minimum traveled way width (W), based on the delta angle of the curve (shown in Exhibit 1240-4), may be used. Document the reasons for using the minimum width. Round W to the nearest foot. Widths given in Exhibit 1240-3 and Exhibit 1240-4 are for facilities with 12-foot lanes. When 11-foot lanes are selected, width (W) may be reduced by 2 feet.

Chapter 1240
Turning Roadways
To keep widths to a minimum, the traveled way widths for Exhibit 1240-3 and Exhibit 1240-4 were calculated using the WB-40 design vehicle. When volumes are high for trucks larger than the WB-40 and other traffic, consider using the widths from Exhibit 1240-1 and Exhibit 1240-2.
1240.02(3) One-Lane Roadways Exhibit 1240-5 shows the traveled way width (W) for one-lane turning roadways. For values of R between those given, interpolate W and round up to the next foot. Exhibit 1240-5 applies to one-lane ramps only when the largest vehicles present demonstrate a safety or operational need based on frequency of use and shoulder pavement depths, and when turn simulation software shows that the total roadway width cannot accommodate the turning movement within the structural pavement section. Minimum width (W), based on the delta angle of the curve for one-lane roadways, may be used. Exhibit 1240-6 gives W using the radius to the outer edge of the traveled way. Exhibit 1240-7 gives W using the radius on the inner edge of the traveled way. Document the reasons for using the minimum width. Round W to the nearest foot. Build shoulder pavements at full depth for one-lane roadways. To keep widths to a minimum, traveled way widths were calculated using the WB-40 design vehicle, which may force larger vehicles to encroach on the shoulders. This also helps to maintain the integrity of the roadway structure during partial roadway closures.
1240.02(4) Other Roadways For roadways where the traveled way is more than two lanes in any direction:
•
•
For each lane in addition to two, additional width in excess of the selected lane width dimension (see Chapter 1230 and Chapter 1106) is not needed. For three-lane ramps with HOV lanes, see Chapter 1410.
1240.02(5) Total Roadway Width Shoulder widths for the highway or ramp are added to the traveled way width to determine the total roadway width. Small amounts of widening add to the cost with little added benefit. When the traveled way width for turning roadways results in widening less than 0.5 foot per lane, or a total widening of less than 2 feet on existing roadways that are to remain in place, it may be disregarded. When widening the traveled way:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Widening may be constructed on the inside of the traveled way or divided equally between the inside and outside. Do not construct widening only on the outside of a curve. Place final marked lane lines, and any longitudinal joints, at equal spacing between the edges of the widened traveled way. Provide widening throughout the curve length. For widening on the inside, make transitions on a tangent where possible. For widening on the outside, develop the widening by extending the tangent. This avoids the appearance of a reverse curve that a taper would create. For widening of 6 feet or less, use a 1:25 taper. For widths greater than 6 feet, use a 1:15 taper.

1250.01 General Use this chapter to design roadway cross slopes and superelevation. Cross slopes function to drain water away from the roadway and 2% is a commonly used slope rate. To maintain the design speed, highway and ramp curves are usually superelevated to overcome part of the centrifugal force that acts on a vehicle.
1250.02 Roadway Cross Slope 1250.02(1) Lanes The cross slope on tangents and curves is a main element in roadway design. The cross slope or crown on tangent sections and large radius curves is complicated by the following two contradicting controls:
•
•
Reasonably steep cross slopes aid in water runoff and minimize ponding as a result of pavement imperfections and unequal settlement. Steeper cross slopes are noticeable in steering, increase the tendency for vehicles to drift to the low side of the roadway, and increase the susceptibility of vehicles to slide to the side on icy or wet pavements.
A 2% cross slope is normally used for tangents and large-radius curves on high and intermediate pavement types, although cross slopes may vary from the target 2%. The algebraic difference in cross slopes is an operational factor that can affect vehicles making a lane change across a grade-break during a passing maneuver on a two-lane two-way roadway. Its influence increases when increased traffic volumes decrease the number and size of available passing opportunities. On ramps with metering, consider how cross slopes can impact driver comfort within the queue. Additionally, larger cross slopes may present concerns about maintaining vehicle lateral position within the queue lane, depending on weather and resulting pavement conditions. A somewhat steeper cross slope may be needed to facilitate recommended drainage design, even though this might be less desirable from an operational point of view. In such areas, consider not exceeding design cross slopes of 2.5% with an algebraic difference of 5%. For a two-lane two-way roadway, provide an algebraic difference to meet the appropriate conditions stated above except when drainage design recommends otherwise.

Chapter 1250
Cross Slope and Superelevation
1250.02(2) Shoulders Shoulder cross slopes are normally the same as the cross slopes for adjacent lanes. With justification, shoulder slopes may be increased to 6%. On the high side of a roadway with a plane section, such as a turning roadway in superelevation, the shoulder may slope in the opposite direction from the adjacent lane. The maximum difference in slopes between the lane and the shoulder is 8%. Locations where it may be desirable to have a shoulder slope different than the adjacent lane are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Where curbing is used. Where shoulder surface is bituminous, gravel, or crushed rock. Where overlays are planned and it is desirable to maintain the grade at the edge of the shoulder. On divided highways with depressed medians where it is desirable to drain the runoff into the median. On the high side of the superelevation on curves where it is desirable to drain stormwater or meltwater away from the roadway. At intersections where pedestrian signal accommodations are provided within the shoulder
Where extruded curb is used, see the Standard Plans for placement (see Chapter 1239 for information on curbs). Widening is also normally provided where traffic barrier is installed (see Chapter 1610 and the Standard Plans). On ramps with metering, where the shoulder is or could be utilized for queuing, consider how the shoulder cross slope can impact driver comfort within the queue. Additionally, larger shoulder cross slopes may present concerns of maintaining vehicle lateral position within the queue lane, depending on weather and resulting pavement conditions. The remainder of this chapter provides information to design superelevation.
1250.03 Superelevation Rate Selection The maximum superelevation rate allowed is 10%. Depending on design speed, construct large-radius curves with a normal crown section. The minimum radii for normal crown sections are shown in Exhibit 1250-1. Superelevate curves with smaller radii as follows:
•
•
•
•
Exhibit 1250-4 (emax=10%) is desirable for all open highways, ramps, and long-term detours, especially when associated with a main line detour. Exhibit 1250-5 (emax =8%) may be used for freeways in urban design areas and areas where the emax =6% rate is allowed but emax =8% is preferred. Exhibit 1250-6 (emax =6%) may be used—with justification—for non-freeway highways in urban design areas, in mountainous areas, and for short-term detours, which are generally implemented and removed in one construction season. Exhibit 1250-7 may be used on low-speed streets in urban areas where speed is relatively low and variable or at intersections.
When selecting superelevation for a curve, consider the existing curves on the corridor. To maintain route continuity and driver expectance on open highways, select the chart (see Exhibit 1250-4, Exhibit 1250-5, or Exhibit 1250-6) that best matches the superelevation on the existing curves. In locations that experience regular accumulations of snow and ice, limit superelevation from the selected chart to 6% or less. In these areas, provide justification for superelevation rates greater than 6%. Vehicles moving at slow speeds or stopped on curves with supers greater than 6% tend to slide inward on the radius (downslope). Round the selected superelevation rate to the nearest full percent.

Address superelevation when the existing radius is less than the minimum radius calculated using the equation or when the maximum speed determined by a ball banking analysis is less than the design speed. When modifying the superelevation of an existing curve, provide superelevation as given in Section 1250.02.

1250.05 Turning Movements at Intersections Curves associated with the turning movements at intersections are superelevated using Exhibit 1250-7. Use superelevation rates as high as practicable, consistent with curve length and climatic conditions. Exhibit 1250-7 shows the minimum radius for a selected superelevation and given design speed for intersections and low-speed curves. When using high superelevation rates on short curves, provide smooth transitions with merging ramps or roadways.
1250.06 Runoff for Highway Curves Provide transitions for all superelevated highway curves as specified in Exhibit 1250-8 through Exhibit 1250-12. Which transition to use depends on the location of the pivot point, the direction of the curve, and the roadway cross slope. The length of the runoff is based on a maximum allowable difference between the grade at the pivot point and the grade at the outer edge of traveled way for one 12-foot lane. Pay close attention to the profile of the edge of traveled way created by the superelevation runoff; do not let it appear distorted. The combination of superelevation transition and grade may result in a hump and/or dip in the profile of the edge of traveled way. When this happens, the transition may be lengthened to eliminate the hump and/or dip. If the hump and/or dip cannot be eliminated this way, pay special attention to drainage in the low areas to prevent ponding. Locate the pivot point at the centerline of the roadway to help minimize humps and dips at the edge of the traveled lane and reduce the superelevation runoff length. When reverse curves are necessary, provide sufficient tangent length for complete superelevation runoff for both curves—that is, from full superelevation of the first curve, to level to full superelevation of the second curve. If tangent length is longer than this, but not sufficient to provide full super transitions—that is, from full superelevation of the first curve, to normal crown to full superelevation of the second curve—increase the superelevation runoff lengths until they abut.

Cross Slope and Superelevation
This provides one continuous transition, without a normal crown section, similar to Designs C2 and D2 in Exhibit 1250-10 and Exhibit 1250-11, except that full super will be attained rather than the normal pavement slope as shown. Superelevation runoff on structures is permissible but not desirable. Whenever practicable, strive for full super or normal crown slopes on structures.
1250.07 Runoff for Ramp Curves Superelevation runoff for ramps use the same maximum relative slopes as the specific design speeds used for highway curves. Multilane ramps have a width similar to the width for highway lanes; therefore, Exhibit 1250-8 through Exhibit 1250-12 are used to determine the superelevation runoff for ramps. Superelevation transition lengths (LT) for single-lane ramps are given in Exhibit 1250-13 and Exhibit 1250-14. Additional runoff length for turning roadway widening is not required.

1260.01 General Sight distance allows the driver to assess developing situations and take actions appropriate for the conditions. Sight distance relies on drivers being aware of and paying attention to their surroundings and driving appropriately for conditions presented. For the purposes of design, sight distance is considered in terms of stopping sight distance, passing sight distance, and decision sight distance. For additional information, see the following: Chapter 1250 Sight distance at railroad crossings Chapter 1310 Sight distance at intersections at grade Chapter 1320 Sight distance at roundabouts Chapter 1340 Sight distance at driveways Chapter 1515 Sight distance for shared-use paths

1260.03 Stopping Sight Distance (Eye height – 3.5 ft, Object height – 2.0 ft) 1260.03(1) Design Criteria Stopping sight distance is provided when the sight distance available to a driver equals or exceeds the stopping distance for a passenger car traveling at the design speed. Stopping distance for design is very conservatively calculated, with lower deceleration and slower perception reaction time than normally expected from the driver. Provide design stopping sight distance at all points on all highways and on all intersecting roadways, unless a design analysis is deemed appropriate.

Chapter 1260
Sight Distance
1260.03(1)(a) Stopping Sight Distance Stopping sight distance is the sum of two distances: the distance traveled during perception and reaction time and the distance to stop the vehicle. The perception and reaction distance used in design is the distance traveled in 2.5 seconds at the design speed.
The design stopping sight distance is calculated using the design speed and a constant deceleration rate of 11.2 feet/second2. For stopping sight distances on grades less than 3%, see Exhibit 1260-1; for grades 3% or greater, see Exhibit 1260-2.

1260.03(2) Effects of Grade The grade of the highway has an effect on the stopping sight distance. The stopping distance is increased on downgrades and decreased on upgrades. Exhibit 1260-2 gives the stopping sight distances for grades of 3% and steeper. When evaluating sight distance with a changing grade, use the grade for which the longest sight distance is needed.

1260.03(4) Sag Vertical Curves When evaluating an existing roadway, refer to Section 1260.03(7). Sight distance is not restricted by sag vertical curves during the hours of daylight. Therefore, headlight sight distance is used for the sight distance design criteria at sag vertical curves. In some cases, a lesser length may be allowed. For guidance, see Chapter 1220. Refer to Exhibit 1260-6 or the equations in Exhibit 1260-7 to find the minimum length for a sag vertical curve to provide the headlight stopping sight distance when given the algebraic difference in grades. The value for S is shown as the distance between the vehicle and the point where a 1-degree angle upward of the headlight beam intersects with the roadway. The sight distance greater than the length of curve equation is not used in Exhibit 1260-6. When the sight distance is greater than the length of curve and the length of curve is critical, the S>L equation given in Exhibit 1260-7 shall be used to find the minimum length of curve.

1260.03(5) Horizontal Curves When evaluating an existing roadway, see Section 1260.03(7). Use Exhibit 1260-8 or the equation in Exhibit 1260-9 to check stopping sight distance where sightline obstructions are on the inside of a curve. A stopping sight distance sightline obstruction is any roadside object within the horizontal sightline offset (M) distance (such as median barrier, guardrail, bridges, walls, cut slopes, buildings or wooded areas), 2.0 feet or greater above the roadway surface at the centerline of the lane on the inside of the curve (h0). Exhibit 1260-8 and the equation in Exhibit 1260-9 are for use when the length of curve is greater than the sight distance and the sight restriction is more than half the sight distance from the end of the curve. Where the length of curve is less than the stopping sight distance or the sight restriction is near either end of the curve, the desired sight distance may be available with a lesser M distance. When this occurs, the sight distance can be checked graphically.

There is no identified collision trend. The existing vertical and horizontal alignment is retained. The existing roadway pavement is not reconstructed. The roadway will not be widened, except for minor shoulder widening requiring no work past the bottom of the ditch. The sightline obstruction is existing. Roadside improvements to sight distance are within existing right of way.

1260.04 Passing Sight Distance (Eye height – 3.5 ft, Object height – 3.5 ft) 1260.04(1) Design Criteria Minimum passing sight distance is the distance (on a two-lane highway) used for a driver to execute a normal passing maneuver based on design conditions and design speed. The potential for passing maneuver conflicts is ultimately determined by the judgments of the driver and the conditions present at the time of the maneuver. Exhibit 1260-12 gives the passing sight distances for various design speeds. Exhibit 1260-11 Passing Sight Distance Design Speed (mph) 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80

Sight Distance
On two-lane two-way highways, provide passing opportunities to meet traffic volume demands. This can be accomplished with roadway sections that provide passing sight distance or by adding passing lanes at locations that would provide the greatest benefit to passing (see Chapter 1270). In the design stage, passing sight distance can be provided by adjusting the alignment either vertically or horizontally to increase passing opportunities. These considerations also apply to multilane highways where staged construction includes a two-lane two-way operation as an initial stage. Whether auxiliary lanes are provided, however, depends on the time lag proposed between the initial stage and the final stage of construction.
1260.04(2) Passing Sight Distance Vertical Curves Exhibit 1260-14 gives the length of crest vertical curve used to provide passing sight distance for two lane highways. The distance from Exhibit 1260-12 and the equations in Exhibit 1260-13 may also be used to determine the minimum length of vertical curve to meet the passing sight distance criteria. Sag vertical curves are not a restriction to passing sight distance. Exhibit 1260-12 Passing Sight Distance: Crest Vertical Curve Calculations

1260.04(3) Passing Sight Distance Horizontal Curves Passing sight distance can be restricted on the inside of a horizontal curve by sightline obstructions that are 3.5 feet or more above the roadway surface. Use the distance from Exhibit 1260-12 and the equation in Exhibit 1260-9 to determine whether the object is close enough to the roadway to be a restriction to passing sight distance. The equation assumes that the curve length is greater than the sight distance. Where the curve length is less than the sight distance, the desired sight distance may be available with a lesser sightline offset (M) distance.
1260.05 Decision Sight Distance (Eye height – 3.5 ft, Object height – 2.0 ft) Decision sight distance values are greater than stopping sight distance values because they give the driver an additional margin for error and afford sufficient length to maneuver at the same or reduced speed rather than to just stop.

Consider decision sight distances (see Exhibit 1260-14) at locations where there is high likelihood for driver error in information reception, decision making, or control actions. If site characteristics and budget allow, locate these highway features where decision sight distance can be provided. If this is not practicable, use suitable traffic control devices and positive guidance to give advanced warning of the conditions.

1270.01 General Auxiliary lanes are used to comply with capacity demand; maintain lane balance; accommodate speed change, weaving, and maneuvering for entering and exiting traffic; and encourage carpools, vanpools, and the use of transit. For signing and delineation of auxiliary lanes, see the Standard Plans, the Traffic Manual, and the MUTCD. Contact the region Traffic Engineer for guidance. Although slow-moving vehicle turnouts and shoulder driving for slow vehicles are not auxiliary lanes, they are covered in this chapter because they perform a similar function. For additional information, see the following: Chapter 1103 Design controls, including speed Chapter 1230 Geometric cross section components Chapter 1310 Turn lanes Chapter 1310 Speed change lanes at intersections Chapter 1360 Collector-distributor roads Chapter 1360 Weaving lanes Chapter 1410 High-occupancy vehicle lanes
1270.02 Climbing Lanes 1270.02(1) General Climbing lanes (see Exhibit 1270-1) are normally associated with truck traffic, but they may also be considered in recreational or other areas that are subject to slow-moving traffic. Climbing lanes are designed independently for each direction of travel.
1270.02(2) Climbing Lane Warrants Generally, climbing lanes are provided when two warrants—speed reduction and level of service—are met. Either warrant may be waived if, for example, slow-moving traffic is causing an identified collision trend or congestion that could be corrected by the addition of a climbing lane. However, under most conditions, climbing lanes are built when both warrants are met.

Auxiliary Lanes
1270.02(2)(a) Warrant No. 1: Speed Reduction Exhibit 1270-2 shows how the percent and length of grade affect vehicle speeds. The data is based on a typical commercial truck. The maximum entrance speed, shown in the graphs, is 60 mph. This is the maximum value regardless of the posted speed of the highway. When the posted speed is above 60 mph, use 60 mph in place of the posted speed. Examine the profile at least ¼ mile preceding the grade to obtain a reasonable approach speed. If a vertical curve makes up part of the length of grade, approximate the equivalent uniform grade length. Whenever the gradient causes a 10 mph speed reduction below the posted speed limit for a typical truck for either two-lane or multilane highways, the speed reduction warrant is met (see Exhibit 1270-3).
1270.02(2)(b) Warrant No. 2: Level of Service The level of service warrant for two-lane highways is met when the upgrade traffic volume exceeds 200 vehicles per hour and the upgrade truck volume exceeds 20 vehicles per hour. On multilane highways, a climbing lane is warranted when a capacity analysis shows the need for more lanes on an upgrade than on a downgrade carrying the same traffic volume. Exhibit 1270-1 Climbing Lane Example
1270.02(3) Climbing Lane Design When a climbing lane is justified, design it in accordance with Exhibit 1270-4. Provide signing and delineation to identify the presence of the auxiliary lane. Begin climbing lanes at the point where the speed reduction warrant is met and end them where the warrant ends for multilane highways and 300 feet beyond for two-lane highways. Consider extending the auxiliary lane over the crest to improve vehicle acceleration and sight distance. Design climbing lane width equal to that of the adjoining through lane and at the same cross slope as the adjoining lanes. Whenever possible, maintain a shoulder width equal to the adjacent roadway segments (preserve shoulder width continuity). On two-way two-lane highways, the shoulder may be reduced to 4 feet. If the shoulder width is reduced to 4 feet document the reasoning for the decision in the design parameter sheets. If the shoulder width is reduced to less than 4 feet, a design analysis is required.

Exhibit 1270-3 Speed Reduction Warrant Example
Given: A two-lane highway meeting the level of service warrant, with the above profile, and a 60 mph posted speed. Determine: Is the climbing lane warranted? If so, what is its length? Solution: 1. Follow the 4% grade deceleration curve from a speed of 60 mph to a speed of 50 mph at 1,200 ft. The speed reduction warrant is met and a climbing lane is needed. 2. Continue on the 4% grade deceleration curve to 4,000 ft. Note that the speed at the end of the 4% grade is 35 mph. 3. Follow the 1% grade acceleration curve from a speed of 35 mph for 1,000 ft. Note that the speed at the end of the 1% grade is 41 mph. 4. Follow the -2% grade acceleration curve from a speed of 41 mph to a speed of 50 mph, ending the speed reduction warrant. Note that the distance is 700 ft. 5. The total auxiliary lane length is (4,000-1,200)+1,000+700+300=4,800 feet. 300 ft is added to the speed reduction warrant for a two-lane highway (see Section 1270.02(3) and Exhibit 1270-4).

1270.03 Passing Lanes 1270.03(1) Passing Lane Benefits A passing lane (see Exhibit 1270-5) is an auxiliary lane provided in one or both directions of travel on a two-lane highway to improve passing opportunities. They may be intermittent or continuous passing lanes in level or rolling terrain and short four-lane sections. The objectives of passing lanes are to:
•
•
•
Improve overall traffic operations on two-lane highways by breaking up traffic platoons and reducing delays caused by inadequate passing opportunities over substantial lengths of highway. Increase average travel speed within the passing lane itself; the speed benefits of passing lanes continue downstream of the lane. Passing lanes typically reduce the percent time spent following within the passing lane itself. These “percent time spent following” benefits can continue for some distance downstream of the passing lane. Improve safety by providing assured passing opportunities without the need for the passing driver to use the opposing traffic lane. Safety evaluations have shown that passing lanes and short four-lane sections reduce collision rates and severity.
1270.03(2) Passing Lane Length Design passing lanes long enough to provide a reduction in traffic platooning. To maximize the traffic operational efficiency of a passing lane in level or rolling terrain, its length can vary from 0.5 mile to 2.0 miles depending on the directional flow rate, as shown in Exhibit 1270-6. Passing lanes longer than 2 miles can cause the driver to lose the sense that the highway is a two-lane facility. However, these lengths may vary for other reasons such as addressing safety-related issues. Passing lanes longer than 2.0 miles or shorter than 0.5 miles in length may be used depending on the identified need or other operational considerations within the design. Lengths shown do not include passing lane tapers at the beginning or end of the passing lane. Exhibit 1270-5 Passing Lane Example

1270.03(3) Passing Lane Location A number of factors are considered when selecting an appropriate location for a passing lane, including the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Locate passing lanes where decision sight distance (see Chapter 1260) at the lane decrease tapers can be provided. Provide stopping sight distance continuously along the roadway Avoid locating passing lanes near high-volume intersections, existing structures, railroad crossings, areas of dense development, and two-way left-turn lanes. Locate passing lanes where they appear logical to the driver. When designing the addition of passing lanes, make sure existing curves at the desired location have adequate superelevation to provide speeds suitable for passing. For information on superelevation, see Chapter 1250. Avoid other physical constraints, such as bridges and culverts, if they restrict the provision of a continuous shoulder. Consider the number, type, and location of intersections and road approaches. Consider grades when choosing the side on which to install the passing lane. Uphill grades are preferred but not mandatory. Preference for passing is normally given to the traffic departing a developed area such as a small town.
1270.03(3)(a) Traffic Operational Considerations When passing lanes are provided at an isolated location, their typical objective is to reduce delays at a specific bottleneck; for example, climbing lanes (see Section 1270.02). The location of the passing lane is dictated by the needs of the specific traffic operational problem encountered. When passing lanes are provided to improve traffic operations over a length of road, there is flexibility in the choice of passing lane locations to maximize their operational effectiveness and minimize construction costs. If delay problems on an upgrade are severe, the upgrade will usually be the preferred location for a passing lane. Passing lanes at upgrades begin before speeds are reduced to unacceptable levels and, where possible, continue over the crest of the grade so that slower vehicles can regain some speed before merging.

Chapter 1270
Auxiliary Lanes
1270.03(3)(b) Construction Cost Considerations The cost of constructing a passing lane can vary substantially, depending on terrain, highway structures, shoulders, and adjacent development. Thus, the choice of a suitable location for a passing lane may be critical to its cost-effectiveness. Generally, passing lanes in level and rolling terrain can be placed where they are least expensive to construct, avoiding locations with high cuts and fills and existing structures that would be expensive to widen.
1270.03(3)(c) Intersection-Related Considerations Consider a corridor evaluation of potential passing lane locations for each direction, avoiding placement of passing lanes near intersections. Avoid or minimize turning movements on a road section where passing is encouraged. Low-volume intersections and driveways are allowed within passing lanes, but not within the taper transition areas. Where the presence of higher-volume intersections and driveways cannot be avoided, consider including provisions for turning vehicles, such as left-turn lanes. Provide right- and left-turn lanes in passing lane sections where they would be provided on a conventional twolane highway. Left turns within the first 1,000 feet of a passing lane are undesirable. Strategies to address the turning movement could include left-turn lanes, right-in/right-out access, beginning the passing lane after the entrance, and so on.
1270.03(4) Passing Lane Design Where a passing lane is planned, evaluate several possible configurations (see Section 1270.03(4)(a)) that are consistent with the corridor and fit within the constraints of the specific location. The recommended minimum transition distance between passing lanes in opposing directions is 500 feet for “tail-to-tail” and 1,500 feet for “head-to-head” (see Exhibit 1270-8). Some separation between lanes in opposite directions of travel is desirable; however, passing lanes can operate effectively with no separation. In either situation, address pavement markings and centerline rumble strips as appropriate. It is desirable to channelize the beginning of a passing lane to move traffic to the right lane in order to promote prompt usage of the right lane by platoon leaders and maximize passing lane efficiency. Widening symmetrically to maintain the roadway crown at the centerline is preferred, including in continuous passing lane configurations. However, the roadway crown may be placed in other locations as deemed appropriate. Considerations for crown locations might include: costs, constructability, right of way, environmentally sensitive roadsides, or other factors.

1270.03(4)(a) Alternative Configurations Where a passing lane will be provided, evaluate the configurations shown in Exhibit 1270-7. In the exhibit, general passing lane configurations and their typical applications are described in the following: a. Isolated Passing Lane – Exhibit 1270-7 (a) o Two-lane highway with passing lane provided at a spot location to dissipate queues. o For isolated grades, consider climbing lanes (see Section 1270.02). b. Intermittent Passing Lanes, Separated – Exhibit 1270-7 (b) o Often pairs are used at regular intervals along a two-lane highway. o Frequency of passing lanes depends on desired level of service. o The spacing between passing lanes and between pairs may be adjusted to fit the conditions along the route (see Section 1270.03(3)). c. Continuous Passing Lanes – Exhibit 1270-7 (c) o Use only when constraints do not allow for the use of other configurations. The use of this configuration requires concurrence from the region Traffic Engineer. (See Exhibit 1270-8 for additional information regarding buffer areas.) o Appropriate for two-lane roadways carrying relatively high traffic volumes where nearly continuous passing lanes are needed to achieve the desired level of service. o Particularly appropriate over an extended section of roadway where a wide pavement is already available. o May be used as an interim stage for an ultimate four-lane highway. o Short Four-Lane Section – Exhibit 1270-7 (d) o Sufficient length for adjoining passing lanes is not available. o Particularly appropriate where the ultimate design for the highway is four lanes. d. Intermittent Three-Lane Passing Lanes – Exhibit 1270-7 (e) o Does not require the slow vehicle to change lanes to allow passing. o Requires the widening to transition from one side of the existing roadway to the other. o Eliminates the head-to-head tapers.
1270.03(4)(b) Geometric Aspects Carefully design transitions between passing lanes in opposing directions. Intersections, bridges, other structures, two-way left-turn lanes, painted medians, or similar elements can be used to provide a buffer area between opposing passing lanes. The length of the buffer area between adjoining passing lanes depends on the configuration (see Exhibit 1270-8). Exhibit 1270-7 illustrates five passing lane design configurations. Part (c) illustrates a continuous three-lane section with alternating passing lanes. Consider a four-lane cross section when volume demand exceeds the capacity of a continuous three-lane roadway. Exhibit 1270-9 illustrates taper rates, cross slopes, and section lengths for three and four-lane passing sections. Where practicable provide shoulder width in a passing lane section equal to the shoulder width on the adjacent segments of a two-lane highway. However, the shoulder may be reduced to 4 feet. If the shoulder width is reduced to 4 feet, document the reason for the decision on the design parameter sheets. If the shoulder width is reduced to less than 4 feet, a design analysis is required. See Chapter 1600 for shoulder rumble strip criteria and considerations.

Auxiliary Lanes
Where practicable, design the passing lane width the same as the lane width on the adjacent segments of the two-lane highway. Provide a 25:1 or flatter taper rate to increase the width for a passing lane. When all traffic is directed to the right lane at the beginning of the passing lane, provide a taper rate of the posted speed:1. Provide a posted speed:1 taper rate for the merging taper at the end of a passing lane. (Refer to the Lane Transitions section in Chapter 1210 for additional information on taper rates.) Consider a wide shoulder at the lane drop taper to provide a recovery area for drivers who encounter a merging conflict. Provide signing and delineation to identify the presence of an auxiliary passing lane. Refer to the Standard Plans, the Traffic Manual, and the MUTCD for passing lane signing and marking guidance.

1270.04 Slow-Moving Vehicle Turnouts 1270.04(1) General RCW 46.61.427 states: On a two-lane highway where passing is unsafe … a slow-moving vehicle, behind which five or more vehicles are formed in a line, shall turn off the roadway wherever sufficient area for a safe turn-out exists, in order to permit the vehicles following to proceed… A slow-moving vehicle turnout is not an auxiliary lane. Its purpose is to provide sufficient room for a slowmoving vehicle to pull out of through traffic and stop if necessary, allow vehicles to pass, and then return to the through lane. Generally, a slow-moving vehicle turnout is provided on existing roadways where passing opportunities are limited, where slow-moving vehicles such as trucks and recreational vehicles are predominant, and where the cost to provide a full auxiliary lane would be prohibitive.
1270.04(2) Design Base the design of a slow-moving vehicle turnout primarily on sound engineering judgment. Designs may vary from one location to another. Provide a length between 100 and 1,320 feet, excluding tapers. Select a width adequate for the vehicle type expected to use the turn-out, between 8 to 12 feet in width. Surface the turnouts with a stable, unyielding material (such as BST or HMA) with adequate structural strength to support the heavier traffic. To improve the ability of a vehicle to safely reenter through traffic, locate slow-moving vehicle turnouts where adequate sight distance is available. The minimum design range for slow-vehicle turnouts may be where at least design stopping sight distance is available. See Chapter 1260. Sign slow-moving vehicle turnouts to identify their presence. For guidance, see the Standard Plans, the Traffic Manual, and the MUTCD.
1270.05 Shoulder Driving for Slow Vehicles 1270.05(1) General Use of a shoulder driving section is an alternative means to meet the performance objectives provided by climbing or passing lanes. Review the following when considering a shoulder driving section:
•
•
•
•
•
Horizontal and vertical alignment Character of traffic Presence of bicycles Road approaches and intersections Clear zone (see Chapter 1600)
1270.05(2) Design When designing a shoulder for shoulder driving, locate where full design stopping sight distance (speed/path/direction decision sight distance is desirable) and a minimum length of 600 feet are available. Where practicable, avoid sharp horizontal curves. When barriers or other roadside objects are present, the minimum width is 12 feet.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1270-14
Chapter 1270
Auxiliary Lanes
The shoulder width depends on the vehicles that will be using the shoulder. Where trucks will be the primary vehicle using the shoulder, use a 12-foot width; when passenger cars are the primary vehicle, a 10-foot width may be used. Shoulder driving and bicycles are not compatible. When the route has been identified as a local, state, or regional significant bike route, shoulder driving for slow vehicles is undesirable. Reconstruct the shoulders to provide adequate structural strength for the anticipated traffic. Select locations where the side slope meets the criteria of Chapter 1239. When providing a transition at the end of a shoulder driving section, use a 50:1 taper. Signing for shoulder driving is required (see the Standard Plans, the Traffic Manual, and the MUTCD). Install guideposts when shoulder driving is to be permitted at night.
1270.06 Emergency Escape Ramps 1270.06(1) General Consider an emergency escape ramp (see Exhibit 1270-10) whenever a long, steep downgrade is encountered. In this situation, the possibility exists of a truck losing its brakes and going out of control at a high speed. Consult local maintenance personnel and check crash data to determine whether or not an escape ramp is justified. Exhibit 1270-10 Emergency Escape Ramp Example

1270.06(2) Design 1270.06(2)(a) Types Escape ramps include the following types:
•
•
•
•
Gravity escape ramps are ascending grade ramps paralleling the traveled way. They are commonly built on old roadways. Their long length and steep grade can present the driver with control problems, not only in stopping, but with rollback after stopping. Gravity escape ramps are the least desirable design. Sand pile escape ramps are piles of loose, dry sand dumped at the ramp site, usually not more than 400 feet in length. The deceleration is usually high and the sand can be affected by weather conditions; therefore, they are less desirable than arrester beds. However, where space is limited, they may be suitable. Arrester beds are parallel ramps filled with smooth, free-draining gravel. They stop the out-of-control vehicle by increasing the rolling resistance and are the most desirable design. Arrester beds are commonly built on an upgrade to add the benefit of gravity to the rolling resistance. However, successful arrester beds have been built on a level or descending grade. The Dragnet Vehicle Arresting Barrier consists of chain link or fiber net that is attached to energyabsorbing units. (See Chapter 1610 for additional information.)
1270.06(2)(b) Locations The location of an escape ramp depends on terrain, length of grade, sight distance, and roadway geometrics. Desirable locations include before a critical curve, near the bottom of a grade, or before a stop. It is desirable that the ramp leave the roadway on a tangent at least 3 miles from the beginning of the downgrade.
1270.06(2)(c) Lengths The length of an escape ramp depends on speed, grade, and type of design used. The minimum length is 200 feet. Calculate the stopping length using the equation in Exhibit 1270-11. Exhibit 1270-11 Emergency Escape Ramp Length
𝐿=
𝑉2 0.3(𝑅 ± 𝐺)
Where: L = Stopping distance (ft) V = Entering speed (mph) R = Rolling resistance (see Exhibit 1270-12) G = Grade of the escape ramp (%) Speeds of out-of-control trucks rarely exceed 90 mph; therefore, the desirable entering speed is 90 mph. Other entry speeds may be used when justification and the method used to determine the speed are documented.

1270.06(2)(d) Widths The width of each escape ramp depends on the needs of the individual situation. It is desirable for the ramp to be wide enough to accommodate more than one vehicle. The desirable width of an escape ramp to accommodate two out-of-control vehicles is 40 feet and the minimum width is 26 feet. The following items are additional considerations in the design of emergency escape ramps:
•
•
•
•
•
•
If possible, at or near the summit, provide a pull-off brake check area. Also, include in this area informative signing about the upcoming escape ramp. Free-draining, smooth, non-crushed gravel is desirable for an arrester bed. To assist in smooth deceleration of the vehicle, taper the depth of the bed from 3 inches at the entry to a full depth of 18 to 30 inches in not less than 100 feet. Mark and sign in advance of the ramp. Discourage normal traffic from using or parking in the ramp. Sign escape ramps in accordance with the guidance contained in the MUTCD for runaway truck ramps. Provide drainage adequate to prevent the bed from freezing or compacting. Consider including an impact attenuator at the end of the ramp if space is limited. A surfaced service road adjacent to the arrester bed is needed for wreckers and maintenance vehicles to remove vehicles and make repairs to the arrester bed. Anchors are desirable at 300-foot intervals to secure the wrecker when removing vehicles from the bed.
Typical examples of arrester beds are shown in Exhibit 1270-10 and Exhibit 1270-13. Include justification, all calculations, and any other design considerations in the emergency escape ramp documentation.

1300.01 General It is WSDOT practice to analyze potential intersection solutions at all intersection improvement locations in accordance with E 1090 – Moving Washington Forward: Practical Solutions. The objective is to provide the optimum solution within available resources, with an emphasis on low-cost investments. The analysis can be done for individual intersections, or on a corridor or network basis. This chapter provides guidance on preliminary intersection analysis and selection of control type. Intersection design is completed using Chapter 1310 for the geometrics of intersections, Chapter 1320 for roundabouts, and Chapter 1330 for traffic signals. Use the aforementioned chapters in conjunction with Chapter 1106, Chapter 1230 series, Chapter 1730, Chapter 1510, and Chapter 1520 to assist with dimensioning design elements. Consider design users and the balance between modes, safety and mobility performance considerations, context-sensitive/sustainable design, and economics when selecting and evaluating alternatives to meet the needs of the project. Identification of intersection projects can come from a variety of programs and sources, including those funded by local agencies and developers. The intent of this chapter is that the procedures apply to all types of intersection modifications on the state highway system. Potential safety project locations are identified through the safety priority programming process. Other programs may identify intersection needs through the priority programming process, but the influence of the type of intersection control with respect to specific performance category needs may not be fully understood until contributing factors analysis is completed (see Chapter 1101). Complete an Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE), formerly known as Intersection Control Analysis (ICA), as early as practicable, taking into account the level of community engagement that may need to occur prior to approval. The ICE (see Section 1300.05 for procedures) should be considered a working document that is initiated no later than the scoping phase so that the scope and schedule are compatible with the chosen intersection type. Scale the ICE according to the size and complexity of the project; for example, evaluation of adding a turn lane to an existing intersection control may take less effort than evaluating new intersection control. Consult the region or HQ Traffic offices for assistance with the level of effort required. It is WSDOT policy to focus on lower cost solutions with the intent to optimize return on investment. Only when all at-grade intersection alternatives are ruled out, including turn restrictions and complete intersection removal, should other more-costly measures be considered, such as grade-separation. Ramp terminal intersections are subject to the analysis requirements of this chapter. See Chapter 1360 and Chapter 550 for additional information.

1300.02 Intersection Control Objectives Intersections are an important part of highway design. Intersection control choice requires consideration of all potential users of the facility, including drivers of motorcycles, passenger cars, heavy vehicles of different classifications, public transit, and bicyclists and pedestrians. Design users have varying skills and abilities. Younger and older drivers in particular are subject to a variety of behavioral or human factors that can influence elements of their driving ability. See NCHRP Report 600 – Human Factors Guidelines for Road Systems: Second Edition for additional information (www.trb.org/Main/Blurbs/167909.aspx). Bicyclists, from recreational to commuters, also have a variety of skill sets that can influence the effectiveness of bike facilities and intersection operational design (see Chapter 1520 for additional information). Meeting the needs of one user group can directly influence the service that other groups experience. The selection process evaluates these competing needs and results in an optimal balance of tradeoffs for all design users, recognizing the context and priorities of the location. The intent of an ICE is not to design an intersection, but to evaluate the compatibility of different intersection control types with respect to context, modal priority, intersection design vehicle, and the identified balance of performance needs. Four basic intersection design consideration categories are shown in Exhibit 1300-1 and can affect the intersection control types depending on the situation. The objectives of the ICE are to:
• Provide a consistent framework to determine the most compatible intersection control type for the location, context, economics, and balance of performance needs.
• Evaluate the operational and safety performance for various appropriate and feasible intersection control types under consideration.
• Evaluate the modal performance considerations between different intersection control types with respect to the identified modal priority and intersection design vehicle (see Chapter 1103). Identify the potential modal treatments that augment the control types.
• Consider the intersection operations and the relationship with adjacent intersections and other access points.
• Evaluate the intersection control types for potential sustainability, community value, and expected maintenance and operation needs.
• Include roundabouts in all intersection control evaluations due to their safety, operational, and sustainability benefits.
• Consider emerging alternative intersection designs such as displaced left-turn (DLT) and restricted crossing u-turn intersections (RCUT) where appropriate.
• Select the intersection control type for the project based on overall need and context. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Intersection Control Type
1300.03 Common Types of Intersection Control Generally, intersection control evaluations consider multiple intersection control types when intersections are assessed. The following is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of intersection control types but does serve as an initial guide. Depending on the context at a certain location, an entirely different or unique solution may be reached. Intersection control decisions including individual movements are often documented in Intersection Control Evaluations. However, not all changes to intersections require an Intersection Control Evaluations, in those instances please note the documentation requirements in this section.
1300.03(1) Uncontrolled Intersections Uncontrolled movements are those that do not have signing, and the normal right of way rule (RCW 46.61.180) applies. This intersection type is typically found on local roads and streets where the volumes of the intersecting roadways are low, speeds are low, and there is little to no crash history. Uncontrolled movements can sometimes be found in existing intersections such as right turns onto adjoining roads or highways. In those rare cases, document the use of uncontrolled movements for state routes at new or changed intersections projects in urban areas or where pedestrians or bicycles are expected.

Chapter 1300
Intersection Control Type
1300.03(2) Yield Control Intersections with yield control assign right of way without requiring a stop. Vehicles controlled by a YIELD sign need to slow down to a speed that is reasonable for the existing conditions and can stop when necessary to avoid interfering with conflicts that have the right of way. All approaches to roundabouts are yield controlled. Sometimes channelized movements at intersections and interchanges are as well. Except at roundabouts, document use of yield control at intersections for state routes at new or changed intersections projects within urban areas or where pedestrians and bicycles are expected.

Chapter 1300
Intersection Control Type
1300.03(3) Two-Way Stop Control Intersections with two-way stop control are a common, lower cost control, which require the traffic on the minor roadway to stop and yield to mainline traffic before entering the major roadway. Along certain corridors, especially where u-turn opportunities exist, consider limiting access at two-way stops to “right-in, right-out only.”
1300.03(4) All-Way Stop Control For an all-way stop intersection, motor vehicle traffic approaching it from all directions is required to stop before proceeding through the intersection. An all-way stop may have multiple approaches and typically marked with a supplemental signing stating the number of approaches. All-way stop control is most effective at the intersection of low-speed, 2-lane roadways not exceeding 1,400 vehicles during the peak hour. All-way stop control are not used for projects on multilane state highways at new or updated intersection projects with more than one thru lane in a direction. Guidance for consideration of all-way stop control is provided in the MUTCD.

Intersection Control Type
1300.03(5) Roundabouts Roundabouts are often circular (or near-circular) at-grade intersections, where traffic on the approaches yield to traffic within the circulating roadway. Roundabouts are an effective intersection type that may offer the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Reduced fatal and injury crashes compared with other at-grade intersection types. Fewer conflict points. Lower potential for wrong-way driving. Reduced traffic delays. Traffic-calming and lower speeds. More capacity than a two-way or multi-way stop. Quickly serves pedestrians needing to cross the intersection and shortens crossing distance for pedestrians by allowing for crossing in stages using splitter islands as pedestrian refuges. Reduced vehicular approach speeds that result in reduced crash and severity potential to pedestrians. Ability to serve high turning volumes with minimal number of approach lanes. Improved operations where space for queuing is limited. Improved capacity at ramp terminals intersections with high left-turn volumes without affecting the structure. Facilitation of u-turn movements and can be appropriate when combined with access management along a corridor. Aesthetic treatments and gateways to communities. Flexibility to fit funding and a variety of site constraints. Roundabouts are scalable and site-specific solutions. See Chapter 1320 for more information on roundabout types and design.

Intersection Control Type
1300.03(6) Traffic Control Signals Signalized intersections may offer the following benefits:
•
•
•
Increased capacity of the intersection compared to stop-controlled intersections. Allow for improved progression within a coordinated system along a corridor or a grid. Can be used to interrupt heavy traffic at intervals to permit other traffic, vehicular or pedestrian, to complete their movement or enter the intersection. Can be preempted to provide priority service to railroad, emergency responders, transit and approaches where advance queue loops are used. Reduced at-angle vehicle crashes compared to stop-controlled intersections.
•
•
However, signalized intersections have drawbacks. They:
•
•
•
•
Require continual maintenance and engineering for optimal operations. Cannot adequately balance large traffic flows with pedestrian demands. Can be susceptible to power outages and detection failures. Increase rear-end crashes.
Indiscriminate use of traffic signals can adversely affect the safety performance and operational efficiency of vehicle, bicycle, and pedestrian traffic. Therefore, and as required by the MUTCD, a traffic signal should be considered for installation only after if it is determined to meet specific “warrants” and an engineering study shows that the installation would improve safety and/or operations. Satisfying a signal warrant does not mandate the installation of a traffic signal nor by itself meet the requirements of Section 1300.05; but failing to satisfy at least one warrant shall remove the signal from consideration. Not all crashes are correctable with the installation of a traffic signal. Traffic signals may decrease the potential for crashes of one type and increase the potential for another type. For instance, at-angle crashes are less frequent with signals because the traffic movements are controlled, but rear-end crashes are more frequent with signals because of stopping and starting of vehicles. At-angle crashes are usually more severe than rear-end crashes; however, the severity of these rear-end crashes tend to be higher at operating speeds above 40 mph. This requires careful consideration of the location characteristics, traffic flow, and crash history. State statutes (RCW 46.61.085) require WSDOT approval for the design and location of all conventional traffic signals and for some types of beacons located on city streets forming parts of state highways. The Traffic Signal Permit (DOT Form 242-014 EF) is the formal record of the department’s approval of the installation and type of signal. For traffic signal permit guidance, see Chapter 1330.
1300.03(7) Alternative Intersections Alternative intersections work mainly by rerouting U and left turns, and/or separating movements. Alternative intersections may have different terminology in different areas, but the most common types include:

Intersection Control Type
As alternative intersections may be relatively new to Washington State and its users, more education and community engagement will be necessary to help ensure project success. However, extensive experience shows that many of these intersection types can provide better operational and safety performance, often at much less cost than traditional strategies. Three types of alternative intersections are highlighted in the subsections below: median u-turn, restricted crossing u-turn, and displaced left-turn intersections. For more information about these and other intersection design solutions, see the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Alternative Intersection Design web page.
1300.03(7)(a) Median U-Turn The Median UTurn (MUT) intersection treatment relocates left turn movements downstream from the intersection resulting in lower delays, higher throughput, and reduction in the number and severity of crashes. Left-turning drivers proceed straight through the at-grade intersection, and then execute a u-turn at some distance downstream at a new or existing median opening. The main intersection is typically signalized and can be highly efficient needing only two signal phases. By removing the left turns at the main intersection, the MUT design results in a significant reduction in rear-end, angle, and sideswipe crashes; while reducing the number of conflict points from 32 to 16 when compared to a conventional signalized intersection. The MUT can also have advantages for pedestrians with fewer conflict points and a lower delay. However, the intersection design may reduce bicyclist mobility as they are expected to use the pedestrian crossings in order to perform left turns at the intersection. The MUT intersection design is more likely to be suitable for consideration in situations where:
•
•
•
•
The intersection is over capacity. There are heavy through volumes and low to moderate left turn volumes. The intersection is within a higher-speed, multilane, median-divided corridor. There are safety concerns at an existing signalized intersection or corridor.
Refer to FHWA’s Median U-Turn Intersection Informational Guide for geometric design considerations and recommendations. (See Chapter 1310 for geometrics when designing the u-turn movement for the MUT intersection.)

Exhibit 1300-2 Median U-Turn Intersection Example
MUT Intersection from FHWA’s Median U-Turn Intersection Informational Guide
1300.03(7)(b) Restricted Crossing U-Turn Intersection Restricted Crossing U-Turn (RCUT) intersections, also known as superstreets or J-turns, have similarities with the MUT in that the minor road left-turning movements are redirected (see Exhibit 1300-2). RCUTs, however, also redirect minor road through movements as shown in Exhibit 1300-3. This intersection type results in lower delays, improved progression, and a potential reduction in the total number of crashes and fatal and injury crashes. Drivers on the minor road approaches must turn right onto the major road and then perform a u-turn maneuver at a median opening downstream. However, the major road left turn movements may still be allowed at the main intersection. RCUT intersections may or may not warrant signalization due to traffic volumes, and those with signalization require fewer signal phases and shorter cycle lengths than a traditional signalized intersection. The RCUT intersection is more likely suitable for consideration in situations where:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The intersection is over capacity. There is a need to improve travel time and progression for the major road. There are crashes at the intersection related to turning movements that can be reduced by a RCUT. The intersection is within a higher-speed, multilane corridor. There are low through and left turn volumes on the minor road. Pedestrian volumes are low. The major roadway contains sufficient median width, or total right of way width, to support the u-turn movements.

Example of RCUT Intersection with stop-control from FHWA’s Restricted Crossing U-Turn Intersection Informational Guide The RCUT intersection may be a potential alternative compared to a grade-separated interchange, at locations meeting grade-separated considerations identified in Section 530.04(3). Refer to FHWA’s Restricted Crossing UTurn Intersection Informational Guide for geometric design considerations and recommendations. (See Chapter 1310 for geometrics when designing the u-turn movement for the RCUT.)
1300.03(7)(c) Displaced Left-Turn Intersection The Displaced Left-Turn (DLT) intersection, also known as a continuous flow intersection, works mainly by relocating one or more left turn movements to the other side of the opposing traffic via an interconnected signalized crossover. This essentially causes the traffic signal system to be more efficient by eliminating the left turn phase at the main intersection allowing for more green time to be allocated to other movements. The DLT can reduce delays by up to 40%, but often can be delivered for just slightly more cost than a typical signalized intersection. Compared with a conventional intersection, the DLT can be more challenging for pedestrians due to longer crossing distances and counter-intuitive left turn vehicular movements. However, the DLT typically has shorter cycle lengths and potentially shorter delays. The DLT intersection design is best applied in situations where:
•
•
•
•
•
•
There are high left-turn and through volumes. Intersection is over capacity. There are excessive delays and queuing, especially when left turn queues extend past the available storage bays. Pedestrian volumes are low. Sufficient right-of-way exists on the leg(s) that need to be widened to accommodate the new lanes. Context is urban/suburban.

1300.04 Modal Considerations When designing a multimodal intersection, consideration needs to be given to all design users at the intersection, the intersection design vehicle and selected modal priority (see Chapter 1103). It is not appropriate to design for specific modal treatments on the outset of evaluating intersection control types; however, modally oriented intersection treatments may be necessary to enhance specific modal baseline or contextual performance needs (see Chapter 1101), and may influence the control type selection. Include a discussion of the potential modally oriented treatments relevant to the control types being analyzed and modal performance needs. Evaluate the potential effect of modal specific treatments on all design users relevant for the control types evaluated in the ICE.
1300.04(1) Pedestrian Considerations Consider the intersection type and how it accommodates pedestrians. With each intersection type, there may be specific elements and/or treatments applicable for pedestrians (see, for example Chapter 1231 and Chapter 1510) to meet modal performance needs identified (see Chapter 1101). For example, a signalized intersection with a long cycle length, high vehicle speeds, or frequent permitted turning movements is generally not appropriate for areas with moderate to high pedestrian demand. However, a roundabout or responsive signal in an urban downtown core with low speeds is typically well respected with high compliance and short delays.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1300-12
Chapter 1300
Intersection Control Type
Roundabouts often accommodate pedestrian crossings because of high motorist compliance rates, short delays, and minimal disruption to vehicular traffic flow due to short crossing distances, reduced vehicular speeds, and two-stage crossings. Additional strategies may be utilized at multi-lane roundabouts if the pedestrian network and context supports enhanced pedestrian crossings. Additional information on emerging practices to address pedestrian performance needs for different intersection control types can be found at the Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center (www.pedbikeinfo.org/). For signalized intersections, sidewalk and ramp designs have additional requirements to accommodate the pedestrian features of the traffic signal system (see Chapter 1330).
1300.04(2) Bicycle Considerations For consideration of bicycle needs at intersections and treatments that may have an operational effect on other design users, see Chapter 1515 and Chapter 1520. Additional emerging practice information to address bicycle performance needs for different intersection control types can be found at the Pedestrian and Bicycle Information Center (www.pedbikeinfo.org/) and the NACTO Urban Bikeway Design Guide (nacto.org/publication/urban-bikeway-design-guide/).
1300.04(3) Transit Considerations When transit vehicles are identified as a modal priority, consider treatments to meet the performance needs of the specific transit vehicle types and their effect on the performance of other design users (see Chapter 1103). Transit oriented treatments can vary significantly depending on the proximity of stop locations with respect to the intersection location and origin of the transit movement (see Chapter 1730 for bus stop placement guidelines), and the type of transit vehicle (such as a fixed guideway vehicle). Discuss treatment options and any operating restrictions the transit provider may have regarding different intersection control types.
1300.04(4) Operational Considerations Traditional delay analysis focuses on determining the peak-hour letter-graded Level of Service (LOS) of an individual intersection. However, as this approach often does not account for multimodal users and as roughly 80% of the daily traffic volumes occur outside of the peak hours, a more encompassing review of the intersection is needed to provide sufficient multimodal capacity and safety performance at all hours of the day. Intersection control can have an influence on road user behavior and modal operations, not just at the intersection itself, but also along the corridor or surrounding network, even when the intersection has an acceptable LOS. Delay affects route and mode choice and sometimes whether a user will decide to complete the trip. A user’s willingness to accept delay depends on many factors including the user’s knowledge of the transportation network, anticipated traffic conditions, and alternative options. The increasing presence of invehicle guidance systems and real-time traffic apps further aids the user in selecting the route with shortest travel times. Also, some alternatives that may improve mobility for one mode, such as the addition of turn lanes, may result in a performance degradation or even discourage trips for pedestrians or other modes. Thus, it is important to consider the effects of intersection control on the surrounding network and for all potential users. The following are some factors when selecting and evaluating alternatives:
•
•
Access management strategies can be effective in promoting efficient travel patterns and rerouting traffic to other existing intersections. Check with the WSDOT region Planning Office for future land use plans or comprehensive plans to provide for future growth accommodation. Consider the volume to capacity (V/C) ratio, the delay, and the queue length of each approach. Some scenarios may require additional sensitivity analysis to determine the impacts of small changes in volumes.

Chapter 1300
•
•
Intersection Control Type
Examine the effects of existing conditions. Consider progression through nearby intersections (corridor and network analysis) and known risky or illegal driving maneuvers. Consider the possibility that traffic from other intersections with lower LOS will divert to the new/revised intersection.
1300.05 Procedures 1300.05(1) For new intersections Determine and document intersection control according to the applicable procedures in this chapter.
1300.05(2) For existing intersections An Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) is required for intersection improvement projects involving pavement construction and/or reconstruction, or preservation projects such as signal replacement/rehabilitation. Evaluate intersection control in accordance with this chapter unless there is documentation that this analysis has already been completed and is referenced in the Project Summary. An ICE is not required, but should be considered, for existing intersections that are unaffected by the project (per the contributing factors analysis) or are receiving minor revisions such as signal timing changes or rechannelization of existing pavement. Intersection rechannelization within existing pavement can result in operational and safety performance changes that should be evaluated within the existing project framework. Consideration should be given to mainline traffic volume, entering volume, and availability of mainline gaps for additions of left- or right-turn storage within existing intersection width.
1300.05(3) Intersection Control Evaluation The Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE), formerly known as the Intersection Control Analysis, is a 5-step process meant to screen and evaluate alternatives to determine the best possible intersection type and design. Scale the ICE according to the size and complexity of the project. Due to the safety and operational performance record, a roundabout is required to be evaluated in Step 1. For each alternative, provide a brief description of the assumed layout. Include the number of lanes on major and minor approaches and any measures necessary to accommodate multi-modal users. For a roundabout, document the assumed inscribed circle diameter. For a signal, document the assumed cycle length and phasing strategy used for the analysis. Step 1: Background and Project Needs – Describe the existing conditions. Include physical characteristics of the site, posted speed, AADT, turning movement volumes, channelization and control features, multimodal facilities, context, and modal priority. Document the project’s baseline and contextual needs and performance metrics and targets that will be affected by the intersection. These needs, metrics, and targets will be used for alternative comparison in Step 3. Identify all project alternatives under consideration. For each alternative, determine if it is expected to meet the basic needs of the project. Remove alternatives that do not pass the initial screening and document their removal. All remaining alternatives are to proceed to Step 2. Step 2: Feasibility – Develop the alternatives at a sketch level to determine the footprint required to achieve performance measures. Consider right-of-way, environmental, cost, context-sensitive/sustainable design, and geometrics/physical constraints for each remaining alternative.

Determine the right of way requirements and feasibility. Discuss the right of way requirements and the feasibility of acquiring that right of way in the analysis. Include sketches or plan sheets with sufficient detail to identify topography, existing utilities, environmental constraints, drainage, buildings, and other fixed objects. An economic evaluation will be useful if additional right of way is needed. Include the right of way costs in the alternatives evaluation (Step 4). Identify known environmental concerns that could influence control type selection. At this stage, are there any red flags or obvious concerns between potential control types? Are there any known environmental risks that may substantially increase the cost of the project or available information that could help in alternatives comparison? Consult with region Environmental staff for support. Consider Context Sensitive/Sustainable Design. Context sensitive design is a model for transportation project development. A proposed transportation project is to be planned not only for its physical aspects as a facility serving specific transportation objectives for pertinent modes, but also for its effects on the aesthetic, social, economic, and environmental values, needs, constraints, and opportunities in a larger community setting. Projects designed using this model: Optimize safety of the facility for both the user modes and the community. Promote multimodal solutions. Are in harmony with the community, and preserve the environmental, scenic, aesthetic, historic, and natural resource values of the area. Are designed and built with minimal disruption to the community. Involve efficient and effective use of the resources (time, budget, community) of all involved parties. Minimize maintenance and maximize useful lifetime of the design. See additional guidance in Chapter 301.
Step 3: Operational and Safety Performance Analysis – Perform and report the results of applicable analyses for all remaining alternatives and the no-build condition for performance metrics and targets identified in Step 1. The analysis is scalable, but typically should include the metrics below. The level of effort should be based on project complexity, cost of proposed alternatives, context, and impact to the network and other modes. Contact the region Traffic Office early in the process to determine the network area of influence and scope of analysis. Include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
Traffic Analysis – Use the opening year and selected design year for analysis (see Chapter 1103). In some cases, it may also be appropriate to analyze the horizon year as well. Identify and justify any growth rates used and provide turning movements for all scenarios. There are several deterministic and microsimulation tools for analyzing delay and intersection performance. Traffic volumes and the proximity to other access points will dictate the modeling effort required. Contact the region Traffic Office to determine the appropriate approved tool(s). For more information and guidance on traffic analysis, refer to Chapter 320 and the Traffic Analysis webpage (https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineeringstandards/design-topics/traffic-analysis). Peak hour(s) – Report the delay for each alternative. Off-Peak – Report the delay for an additional time period representative of off-peak travel. Depending on location, up to 80% of total delay can occur in off-peak hours. If a traffic signal is under consideration, perform and report the findings of the signal warrant analysis. Safety Performance Analysis – See the Safety Analysis Guide for ICE safety analysis procedures.

Intersection Control Type
Multimodal safety and operations – Briefly discuss how the design for each alternative is expected to affect applicable multimodal users. Potential items to consider include pedestrian delay, number of lanes to cross, protected vs permitted turning movements, motorist approach speed, speed differential of users, etc. When applicable, evaluate multimodal treatments that may be necessary for each alternative to meet the performance needs of each user type.
If a roundabout is determined to be the preferred alternative based on analysis conducted in Steps 1 through 3, contact the Region Traffic Engineer to determine if further alternative evaluation is required. Step 4: Alternatives Evaluation – Compare the alternatives based on their ability to address the baseline and contextual needs using the established performance metrics and targets. When applicable, report the Benefit/Cost (B/C) for mobility (due to change in travel time or delay) and/or the B/C for safety (due to change in crash frequency/severity). The B/C analysis may include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Estimated project costs. May use project costs from similar locations of the alternative as cost justification. A qualitative discussion of life cycle cost using the following considerations: Annual maintenance and operations cost. For signals, this should include the cost of signal engineers and technicians to review and implement signal timings and respond to malfunctions and emerging issues. This value can be obtained from the region Traffic Office. Travel time savings in all hours of the day. Societal cost savings (considered as the Benefit in the analysis) of reduced crash frequency and/or severity using a predictive method as described in Chapter 321 and the Safety Analysis Guide. See the Safety Analysis Guide for WSDOT Societal Costs for crash severities. Salvage value of right of way, grading and drainage, and structures.
Step 5: Selection – Based on performance tradeoffs and documented project needs, select the recommended alternative.
1300.05(3)(a) Additional Information Discuss the following in the ICE as needed to further support the selection (is it an item that will have a significant effect on the decision?):
•
•
•
•
•
•
Review the corridor sketch plans and database with the regional planning office. Information from a corridor or planning study. Current and future land use and whether or not the intersection control will reasonably accommodate future land use traffic changes. Community engagement and local agency coordination and comments. Effect on future local agency projects. Other elements considered in the selection of the intersection control.
1300.05(4) Community Engagement Community engagement is a necessary element of project development. Technical, public, and political aspects must be considered. It is critical that community engagement efforts occur with preparation and well-organized content regarding the known performance data associated with different control types to inform communities of the distinct differences between control types with respect to the existing and future contexts and modes.

Intersection Control Type
Use the baseline and contextual needs (see Chapter 1101) identified by the team and informed by the community to help support the options being considered to change operational and safety performance at a given location.
There is often concern from communities regarding control types that may be under consideration, especially the types of intersections that may seem unfamiliar or that break from the traditional approach. Education and outreach efforts, if necessary, are collaborative and are most useful during the analysis and early scoping stages. Follow the guidelines of WSDOT’s Community Engagement Plan (www.wsdot.wa.gov/planning/), and document the effort as indicated in Chapter 1100.
1300.05(5) Approval The ICE shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed Professional Engineer. Approval of the ICE (see Chapter 300 for more information) requires the following:
•
•
Region Traffic Engineer Approval HQ Traffic Approval
1300.05(6) Local Agency or Developer-Initiated Intersections Chapter 320 provides guidance for preparation of a Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA). Early in the design process, local agencies and developers should coordinate with the region office to identify specific intersections for further analysis. The project initiator provides an Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) for approaches and intersections with state routes per Section 1300.05, or references this information in the TIA. The project initiator documents the design considerations and submits the ICE and all documentation to the region for approval (per Section 1300.05). After the ICE is approved, finalize the intersection design and obtain approval per Chapter 300 (for documentation), Chapter 1310 (for intersections), Chapter 1320 (for roundabouts), and Chapter 1330 (for traffic signals).

1310.01 General Intersections are a critical part of Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) highway design because of increased conflict potential. Design intersections for the needs of motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians based on the examples provided in this chapter and incorporating the specific design elements as described for each where appropriate. Traffic and driver characteristics, bicycle and pedestrian needs, physical features, and economics are considered during the scoping and design stages to develop channelization and traffic control to provide multimodal traffic flow through intersections. Channelization, which is the separation or regulation of traffic movements into delineated paths of travel, can facilitate the orderly movement of pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles. Channelization includes left-turn lanes, right-turn lanes, speed change lanes (both acceleration and deceleration lanes), and islands. If pedestrian facilities are present, the design objective becomes one of reducing the potential for vehicle/pedestrian conflicts. This is done by minimizing pedestrian crossing distances and controlling the speeds of turning vehicles. Pedestrian refuge islands can be beneficial. See chapters in the 1100 series for instruction on multimodal practical design, including identifying project needs, context, design controls, modal performance, alternatives analysis, and design element dimensioning. This chapter provides guidance for designing intersections, including ramp terminals. Refer to the following for additional information: Chapter 1103 Design controls

1310.02 Designing for Motor Vehicles Consider all potential users of the facility in the design of an intersection. This involves addressing the needs of a diverse mix of user groups, including passenger cars, heavy vehicles of varying classifications, bicycles, and pedestrians. Often, meeting the needs of one user group results in a compromise in service to others. Intersection design balances these competing needs, resulting in appropriate levels of operation for all users. In addition to reducing the number of conflicts, minimize the conflict area as much as possible while still providing for the design vehicle (see Chapter 1103). This is done to control the speed of turning vehicles and reduce the area of exposure for vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. For additional information on pedestrian needs, see Chapter 1510. For intersections with shared-use paths, see Chapter 1515. For bicycle considerations at intersections, see Chapter 1520.
1310.02(1) Non-Geometric Considerations Geometric design considerations, such as sight distance and intersection angle, are important. Equally important are perception, contrast, and a driver’s age. Perception is a factor in the majority of crashes. Regardless of the type of intersection, the function depends on the driver’s ability to perceive what is happening with respect to the surroundings and other vehicles. When choosing an acceptable gap, the driver first identifies the approaching vehicle and then determines its speed. The driver uses visual clues provided by the immediate surroundings in making these decisions. Thus, given equal sight distance, it may be easier for the driver to judge a vehicle’s oncoming speed when there are more objects to pass by in the driver’s line of sight. Contrast allows drivers to discern one object from another.
1310.02(2) Intersection Angle and Roadway Alignment An important intersection design characteristic is the intersection angle. The desirable intersection angle is 90°, with 60° to 120° allowed. Do not put angle points on the roadway alignments within intersection areas or on the through roadway alignment within 100 feet of the edge of traveled way of a crossroad. However, angle points within the intersection are allowed at intersections with a minor through movement, such as at a ramp terminal (see Exhibit 1310-2). When feasible, locate intersections such that curves do not begin or end within the intersection area. It is desirable to locate the PC and PT 250 feet or more from the intersection so that a driver can settle into the curve before the gap in the striping for the intersection area. Do not locate short curves where both the PC and PT are within the intersection area.
1310.02(3) Lane Alignment It is desirable that entering through traffic is aligned with the exit lanes. However, the entering and exit lanes may be offset up to 6 feet when the following conditions are met:
•
•
•
•
Illumination is provided. The intersection is not within a horizontal curve, nor is it within a crest vertical curve. The taper rates provided in Exhibit 1310-1 are used. There is a posted speed of 55 mph or less.
Consider dotted extension lines that continue through the intersection.

1310.02(4) Intersection Spacing Provide intersection spacing for efficient operation of the highway. The minimum design intersection spacing for highways with limited access control is covered in Chapter 530. For other highways, the minimum design intersection spacing is dependent on the managed access highway class. (See Chapter 540 for minimum intersection spacing on managed access highways.) As a minimum, provide enough space between intersections for left-turn lanes and storage length. Space signalized intersections and intersections expected to be signalized to maintain efficient signal operation. Space intersections so that queues will not block an adjacent intersection. Evaluate existing intersections that are spaced less than shown in Chapter 530 and Chapter 540. Also, evaluate closing or restricting movements at intersections with operational issues. Document the spacing of existing intersections that will remain in place and the effects of the spacing on operation, capacity, and circulation.

1310.02(5) Accommodating vs. Designing for Vehicles Accommodating for a vehicle allows encroachment of other lanes, shoulders, or other elements to complete the required maneuver. Designing for a vehicle does not require encroachment on those elements. There are competing design objectives when considering the crossing needs of pedestrians and the turning needs of larger vehicles. To design for large design vehicles, larger turn radii are used. This results in increased pavement areas, longer pedestrian crossing distances, and longer traffic signal arms. (See Chapter 1103 for design vehicle selection criteria.) When appropriate, to reduce the intersection area, consider accommodating for large vehicles instead of designing for them. This reduces the potential for vehicle/pedestrian conflicts, decreases pedestrian crossing distance, and controls the speeds of turning vehicles. Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify the design.
1310.02(6) Sight Distance For stopping and decision sight distance criteria, see Chapter 1260. Intersection sight distance criteria are discussed in Section 1310.02(10).
1310.02(7) Crossroads When the crossroad is a city street or county road, design the crossroad beyond the intersection area in cooperation with the local agency. When the crossroad is a state facility, design the crossroad according to the Design Manual. Continue the cross slope of the through roadway shoulder as the grade for the crossroad. Use a vertical curve that is at least 60 feet long to connect to the grade of the crossroad. Evaluate the profile of the crossroad in the intersection area. The crown slope of the main line might need to be adjusted in the intersection area to improve the profile for the cross traffic. Design the grade at the crosswalk to meet the requirements for accessibility. (See Chapter 1510 for additional crosswalk information.) In areas that experience accumulations of snow and ice for all legs that require traffic to stop, design a maximum grade of ±4% for a length equal to the anticipated queue length for stopped vehicles.
1310.02(8) Rural Expressway At-Grade Intersections Evaluate grade separations at all intersections on rural expressways. Design high-speed at-grade intersections on rural expressways as indirect left turns, split intersections, or roundabouts. The State Traffic Engineer’s approval is required for any new intersection or signal on a rural expressway.
1310.02(9) Interchange Ramp Terminals When stop control or traffic signal control is selected, the design to be used or modified is shown in Exhibit 1310-2. Higher-volume intersections with multiple ramp lanes are designed individually. Provide ramp terminal designs consistent with the speed of the crossroad.

Chapter 1310
Intersections
Where stop control or signal control is implemented, the intersection configuration criteria for ramp terminals are normally the same as for other intersections. One exception is that an angle point is allowed between an offramp and an on-ramp. This is because the through movement of traffic getting off the freeway, going through the intersection, and getting back on the freeway is minor. Another exception is at ramp terminals where the through movement is eliminated (for example, at a singlepoint interchange). For ramp terminals that have two wye connections, one for right turns and the other for left turns, and no through movement, the intersection angle has little meaning and does not need to be considered. Due to the probable development of large traffic generators adjacent to an interchange, width for a median on the local road is desirable whenever such development is expected. This allows for future left-turn channelization. Use median channelization when justified by capacity determination and analysis or by the need to provide a smooth traffic flow. Adjust the alignment of the intersection legs to fit the traffic movements and to discourage wrong-way movements. Use the allowed intersecting angles of 60° to 120° in designing the best alignment for efficiency and intersection operations. Exhibit 1310-2 Ramp Terminal Intersection Details
Notes: [1] For right-turn corner design, see Exhibit 1310-8. [2] Use turn simulation software to verify that the design vehicle can make the turn. [3] For taper rates, see Exhibit 1310-15, Table 1.
1310.02(10) Intersection Sight Distance (Eye Height – 3.5 ft, Object Height – 2.0 ft) Providing drivers the ability to see stop signs, traffic signals, and oncoming traffic in time to react accordingly will reduce the probability of conflicts occurring at an intersection. Avoiding conflicts is dependent on the judgment, abilities, and actions of all drivers using the intersection. The driver of a vehicle that is stopped and waiting to cross or enter a through roadway needs obstruction-free sight triangles in order to see enough of the through roadway to complete all legal maneuvers before an approaching vehicle on the through roadway can reach the intersection. Use Exhibit 1310-3 to determine minimum intersection sight distance along the through roadway.
WSDOT Design Manua M 22-01.22 
Page 1310-5
Chapter 1310
Intersections
The sight triangle is determined as shown in Exhibit 1310-4. Within the sight triangle, lay back the cut slopes and remove, lower, or move hedges, trees, signs, utility poles, signal poles, and anything else large enough to be a sight obstruction. Eliminate parking to remove vehicles that would be obstructions to sight distance. In order to maintain the sight distance, the sight triangle must be within the right of way or a state maintenance easement (see Section 510.03(2)(a)).
1310.02(10)(a) New or Existing Highways New intersections or existing highways require a setback distance of 18 feet from the edge of traveled way for the sight triangle. This represents the position of the driver’s eye when the vehicle is stopped 10 feet from the edge of traveled way. The driver is typically 8 feet or less from the front of the vehicle; therefore, 8 feet are added to the 10 foot setback. When the stop bar is placed more than 10 feet from the edge of traveled way, provide the sight triangle to a point 8 feet back of the stop bar. Provide a clear sight triangle for the SU-30 vehicle. If there is significant combination truck traffic, use the common WB vehicle rather than the SU-30. In areas where SU-30 or WB vehicles are minimal and right of way restrictions limit sight triangle clearing, only the P vehicle sight distance needs to be provided.
1310.02(10)(b) Existing Intersections At existing intersections, where sight obstructions within the sight triangle cannot be removed due to limited right of way, the setback distance may be reduced. Drivers who do not have the desired sight distance creep out until the sight distance is available; therefore, the setback may be reduced to 10 feet. Document the intersection location, available sight distance, and right of way width; and provide a brief analysis of the intersection sight distance clarifying the reasons for reduction. Verify and document that there is no identified crash trend at the intersection.
1310.02(10)(c) All Intersections (Section Rewritten 2023) For all intersections, if the intersection sight distance cannot be provided, use the stopping sight distance of the vehicles travelling on the major roadway and document with a Design Analysis. (See Chapter 1260 for required stopping sight distance.) This will require a Deign Analysis with a brief analysis of the intersection sight distance clarifying the reasons for having to rely on mainline vehicle stopping sight distance. Verify and record that there is no identified crash trend involving intersection sight distance.
1310.02(10)(d) Other Sight Distance Situations At intersections controlled by traffic signals, provide sight distance for right-turning vehicles. For intersections controlled by the geometry of roundabouts, see Chapter 1320. Designs for movements that cross divided highways are influenced by median widths. If the median is wide enough to store the design vehicle, with a 3-foot clearance at both ends of the vehicle, sight distances are determined in two steps. The first step is for crossing from a stopped position to the median storage. The second step is for the movement, either across or left into the through roadway. Design sight distance for ramp terminals as at-grade intersections with only left- and right-turning movements. An added element at ramp terminals is the grade separation structure. Exhibit 1310-4 gives the sight distance guidance in the vicinity of a structure. In addition, when the crossroad is an undercrossing, check the sight distance under the structure graphically using a truck eye height of 6 feet and an object height of 1.5 feet. Document a brief description of the intersection area, sight distance restrictions, and traffic characteristics to support the design vehicle and sight distances chosen.

1310.02(11) Wrong-Way Movement Countermeasures Wrong-way crashes, though infrequent, have the potential to be more serious than other types of crashes, especially on high-speed facilities. Crash data show that impaired and older drivers are overrepresented and that a high percentage of these crashes occur at night. Washington State data show approximately equal numbers of crashes on the Interstate and multilane urban principal arterial highways. Discourage wrong-way maneuvers at all stages of design.
1310.02(11)(a) Wrong-Way Driving Countermeasure Categories There are three categories of countermeasures used to discourage wrong-way driving:
•
•
•
Signing and delineation Intelligent transportation systems Geometric design
i Signing and Delineation Signing and delineation countermeasures include:
•
•
•
•
•
DO NOT ENTER and WRONG WAY signs. ONE WAY signs. Turn restriction signs. Guideposts with red delineation. Red-backed raised pavement markers (RPMs).
•
•
•
Directional pavement arrows. Yellow edge line on left and white edge line on right side of exit ramps. Pavement marking extension lines to direct drivers to the correct ramp.
DO NOT ENTER and WRONG WAY signs may be more effective when they are lowered to 4 feet above the edge of traveled way as they are better illuminated by low-beam headlights. Do not lower these signs when the height obscures intersection sight distance, interferes with pedestrian or bicyclists’ movements, or where snow or vegetation will block viewing of the sign.
ii Intelligent Transportation Systems Wrong-way ITS countermeasures are wrong-way detection and warning systems. Contact the region Traffic Office for assistance when considering an ITS wrong-way warning system.
iii Geometric Design Geometric countermeasures include separating wrong-way movements from other movements, discouraging wrong-way movements, encouraging right-way movements, and improving the visibility of the right-way movement. a. Separate On- and Off-Ramp Terminals Consider the separation of on- and off-ramp terminals, particularly at interchanges where the ramp terminals are closely spaced (for example, partial cloverleaf ramps combined with other ramps). Wider medians between off- and on-ramp terminals provide room for signing and allow the median end to be shaped to help direct vehicles onto the correct roadway. The minimum width of the raised median is 7 feet, face of curb to face of curb, to accommodate a 36-inch sign. Extend the raised median on a two-way ramp from the ramp terminal intersection to the split of the onand off-ramps. The median outside of the intersection area may be reduced to the width of a dual-faced mountable curb. (See Exhibit 1310-5 for an example of the minimum median at the terminal of a two-way ramp.)

Intersections
Exhibit 1310-5 Median at Two-Way Ramp Terminal
b. Reduced Off-Ramp Terminal Throat Width Reducing the width of the off-ramp throat has been a successful method of discouraging wrong-way movements. A smaller opening makes the wrong-way entry less inviting, particularly for closely spaced ramps. When off-ramp terminals have right-turn lanes, a raised island will reduce the potential for a wrong-way movement. c. Increased On-Ramp Terminal Throat Width Increasing the width of the on-ramp throat can encourage right-way movements. A larger opening for the on-ramp makes it easier to turn into. To increase the throat width of on-ramps, use flat radii for left- and right-turning traffic and remove islands.
WSDOT Design Manua M 22-01.22 
Page 1310-10
Chapter 1310
Intersections
d. Intersection Balance When drivers make a left turn, they are required to leave the intersection in the extreme left-hand lane lawfully available. As a result, left-turning drivers tend to head for a point between 50% and 60% of the way through the intersection. At a two-way ramp terminal, the desirable throat width for the on-ramp roadway is not less than the offramp roadway width to accommodate this behavior (see Exhibit 1310-6). Much of this can be achieved by adjusting the stop bar position on the interchange cross street. Exhibit 1310-6 Intersection Balance Example
e. Visibility When drivers can see and recognize the roadway they want to turn onto, they are less likely to make a mistake and turn onto the wrong roadway. For two-way ramps and divided multilane roadways with barrier in the median, end the barrier far enough from the intersection that a left-turning driver can see and recognize the roadway going the correct direction. Drivers need to see the delineation pavement markings, curbs, or other elements to locate the correct roadway. f. Angular Corners on the Left of Off-Ramp Terminals Angular corners on the left side of off-ramp terminals will discourage wrong-way right turns. Provide a corner design as angular as feasible that will provide for the left turn from the off-ramp. Circular curves can look inviting for a wrong-way right turn onto the off-ramp (see Exhibit 1310-2).

1310.02(11)(b) Countermeasure Applications Following are applications of wrong-way countermeasures for some common locations. For assistance with signing and delineation, contact the region Traffic Office.
i All Ramps Countermeasures that can be used on almost any ramp or intersection with potential wrong-way concerns include:
•
•
•
•
•
Enlarged warning signs. Directional pavement arrows at ramp terminals. Redundant signing and pavement arrows. Roundabout ramp terminal intersections, where room is available. Red-backed RPMs.
ii One-Way Diamond Off-Ramp Diamond interchanges are common, and although drivers are familiar with them, they can still get confused and go the wrong way. In addition to signing and pavement markings for these interchanges, provide:
•
Angular corners to discourage wrong-way right turns.
iii Diamond Interchange with Advance Storage Diamond interchanges with advance storage have left-turn storage lanes that extend from the on-ramp past the off-ramp (see Exhibit 1310-7). This allows for a potential early left turn onto the off-ramp. Following are additional countermeasures for interchanges with advanced left-turn storage:
•
•
Provide a raised median to discourage the wrong-way left turn. Provide signing and directional arrows to direct traffic to the correct left-turn point.

Intersections
Exhibit 1310-7 Diamond Interchange with Advance Storage
iv Two-Way Ramps Two-way ramps have the on- and off-ramp adjacent to each other. They are used at partial cloverleaf, trumpet, and button hook interchanges. Because the on and off roadways are close to each other, they are more vulnerable to wrong-way driving. Also, when the separation between on and off traffic is striping only, the ramps are susceptible to drivers entering the correct roadway and inadvertently crossing to the wrong ramp. In addition to signing and delineation, the following are countermeasures for two-way ramps:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Separate the on- and off-ramp terminals. Reduce off-ramp terminal throat width. Increase on-ramp terminal throat width. Maintain intersection balance. Improve on-ramp visibility. Provide a raised median or dual-faced curb from the ramp terminal intersection to the gore nose.

Chapter 1310
Intersections
v HOV Direct Access Ramps HOV direct access ramps are two-way ramps in the median; therefore, the ability to provide separation between the on and off traffic is limited by the width of the median. An additional concern is that HOV direct access ramps are left-side ramps. Drivers normally enter the freeway using a right-side ramp and they may mistakenly travel the wrong way on a left-side ramp. Review existing and proposed signing for inadvertent misdirection. (See Chapter 1420 for HOV direct access and countermeasures for wrong-way driving at HOV direct access ramps.)
vi Multilane Divided Roadways Wrong-way driving can also occur on multilane divided nonfreeway facilities. Wrong-way drivers may enter multilane divided facilities at driveways and at-grade intersections. Countermeasures for wrong-way driving on nonfreeway multilane divided highways include:
•
•
Wrong-way signing and delineation at the intersections. Right-in/right-out road approaches.
1310.02(12) Right-Turn Corners Exhibit 1310-8 shows initial ranges for right-turn corner designs using a simple curve with a taper. These are considered approximate pavement areas to ensure the design vehicles do not encroach into the adjacent lane at either leg of the curve. Other design considerations may include a combination of simple or compound curves, tapers at the beginning or end of the turn, and so on. Verify the design vehicle can make the turn using turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®). Depending on the context of the roadway and right-turn corner (which vehicles will be designed for, and which vehicles will be accommodated), there may be several design considerations. Consider vehicle-pedestrian conflicts; vehicle encroachment on the shoulder or adjacent same-direction lane at the exit leg; capacity restrictions for right-turning vehicles or other degradation of intersection operations; and the effects on other traffic movements.

1310.02(13) Left-Turn Lanes and Turn Radii Left-turn lanes provide storage, separate from the through lanes, for left-turning vehicles waiting for a signal to change or for a gap in opposing traffic. (See Section 1310.02(16) for a discussion on speed change lanes.) Design left-turn channelization to provide sufficient operational flexibility to function under peak loads and adverse conditions.
1310.02(13)(a) One-Way Left-Turn Lanes One-way left-turn lanes are separate storage lanes for vehicles turning left from one roadway onto another. One-way left-turn lanes may be an economical way to lessen delays and crash potential involving left-turning vehicles.

In addition, they can allow deceleration clear of the through traffic lanes. Provide a minimum storage length of 100 feet for one-way left-turn lanes. When evaluating left-turn lanes, include impacts to all intersection movements and users. At signalized intersections, use a traffic signal analysis to determine whether a left-turn lane is needed and the storage length. If the length determined is less than the 100-foot minimum, make it 100 feet (see Chapter 1330). At unsignalized intersections, use the following as a guide to determine whether or not to provide one-way leftturn lanes:
•
•
•
•
A traffic analysis indicates congestion reduction with a left-turn lane. On two-lane highways, use Exhibit 1310-9, based on total traffic volume (DHV) for both directions and percent left- turn traffic, to determine whether further investigation is needed. On four-lane highways, use Exhibit 1310-10 to determine whether a left-turn lane is recommended. A study indicates crash reduction with a left-turn lane. Restrictive geometrics require left-turning vehicles to slow greatly below the speed of the through traffic. There is less than decision sight distance for traffic approaching a vehicle stopped at the intersection to make a left turn.
A traffic analysis based on the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) may also be used to determine whether leftturn lanes are needed to maintain the desired level of service.

Design opposing left-turn design vehicle paths with a minimum 4-foot (12-foot desirable) clearance between opposing turning paths. Where one-way left-turn channelization with curbing is to be provided, evaluate surface water runoff and design additional drainage facilities if needed to control the runoff.

*Length from Exhibit 1310-10 and Exhibit 1310-11, Exhibit 1310-12, or Exhibit 1310-13. At signalized intersections with high left-turn volumes, double (or triple) left-turn lanes may be needed to maintain the desired level of service. For a double left-turn, a throat width of 30 to 36 feet is desirable on the exit leg of the turn to offset vehicle offtracking and the difficulty of two vehicles turning abreast. Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify that the design vehicle can complete the turn. Where the design vehicle is a WB 40 or larger, it is desirable to provide for the design vehicle in the outside lane and an SU30 vehicle turning abreast rather than two design vehicles turning abreast. Exhibit 1310-15 through Exhibit 1310-20 show left-turn lane geometrics, which are described as follows:
i Modifications to Left-Turn Designs The left-turn lane designs discussed above and given in Exhibit 1310-15 through Exhibit 1310-19 may be modified when determined by design element dimensioning (see Chapter 1106.) Document the benefits and impacts of the modified design, including changes to vehicle-pedestrian conflicts; vehicle encroachment; deceleration length; capacity restrictions for turning vehicles or other degradation of intersection operations; and the effects on other traffic movements. Provide a modified design that supports the design vehicle, and provide for the striping (see the Standard Plans and the MUTCD). Verify the design vehicle can make the turn using turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®); include a plot of the design and verification.

ii Widening It is desirable that offsets and pavement widening (see Exhibit 1310-15) be symmetrical about the centerline or baseline. Where right of way or topographic restrictions, crossroad alignments, or other circumstances preclude symmetrical widening, pavement widening may be on one side only.
iii Divided Highways Widening is not needed for left-turn lane channelization where medians are 11 feet wide or wider (see Exhibit 1310-16 through Exhibit 1310-18). For medians between 13 feet and 23 feet or where the acceleration lane is not provided, it is desirable to design the left-turn lane adjacent to the opposing lane (see Exhibit 1310-16) to improve sight distance and increase opposing left-turn clearances.

Chapter 1310
Intersections
A median acceleration lane (see Exhibit 1310-17 and Exhibit 1310-18) may be provided where the median is 23 feet or wider. The median acceleration lane might not be needed at a signalized intersection. When a median acceleration lane is to be used, design it in accordance with Section 1310.02(16), Speed Change Lanes. Where medians have sufficient width, provide a 2-foot shoulder adjacent to a left-turn lane.
iv Minimum Protected Left Turn with a Median At intersections on divided highways where channelized left-turn lanes are not provided, provide the minimum protected storage area (see Exhibit 1310-19).
1310.02(13)(b) Two-Way Left-Turn Lanes Two-way left-turn lanes (TWLTLs) are located between opposing lanes of traffic. They are used by vehicles making left turns from either direction, from or onto the roadway. Use TWLTLs only on managed access highways where there are no more than two through lanes in each direction. Evaluate installation of TWLTLs where:
•
•
•
A crash study indicates reduced crashes with a TWLTL. There are existing closely spaced access points or minor street intersections. There are unacceptable through traffic delays or capacity reductions because of left-turning vehicles.
TWLTLs can reduce delays to through traffic, reduce rear-end crashes, and provide separation between opposing lanes of traffic. However, they do not provide refuge for pedestrians and can encourage strip development with additional closely spaced access points. Evaluate other alternatives (such as prohibiting midblock left turns and providing for U-turns) before using a TWLTL. (See Chapter 540 for additional restrictions on the use of TWLTLs, and Chapter 1230 for discussion of road diets, which commonly employ a center turn lane.) The basic design for a TWLTL is illustrated in Exhibit 1310-20. Additional criteria are as follows:
•
•
•
•
The desirable length of a TWLTL is not less than 250 feet. Provide illumination in accordance with the guidelines in Chapter 1040. Pavement markings, signs, and other traffic control devices must be in accordance with the MUTCD and the Standard Plans. Provide clear channelization when changing from TWLTLs to one-way left-turn lanes at an intersection.

1310.02(14) Islands An island is a defined area within an intersection between traffic lanes for the separation of vehicle movements or for pedestrian refuge. Pedestrian refuge islands can be beneficial because they minimize the pedestrian crossing distance, reduce the conflict area, and minimize the impacts on vehicular traffic. Within an intersection, a median is considered an island. Design islands to clearly delineate the traffic channels to drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists. When designing islands, speeds can be reduced by designing the turning roadway with a taper or large radius curve at the beginning of the turn and a small radius curve at the end. This allows larger islands while forcing the turning traffic to slow down. Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify the design. Traffic islands perform the following functions:
•
•
•
•
•
Channelization islands control and direct traffic movements. Divisional islands separate traffic movements. Refuge islands provide refuge for pedestrians and bicyclists crossing the roadway. Islands can provide for the placement of traffic control devices and luminaires. Islands can provide areas within the roadway for landscaping.
WSDOT Design Manua M 22-01.22 
Page 1310-29
Chapter 1310
Intersections
Traffic islands can create a right turn slip lane where traffic control can differ from the traffic control used for other vehicular movements through the intersection. Slip lanes introduce an additional area where pedestrians and bicyclists are exposed to motor vehicle traffic. Designing intersections without traffic islands, removing existing slip lanes, or enhancing the design of slip lanes can provide benefits for pedestrians and bicyclists. Where traffic islands and associated slip lanes are deemed necessary, active transportation design elements may be available to manage speed (see Section 1510.10), reduce exposure, and increase the conspicuity of vulnerable users crossing these features. Consult with HQ Active Transportation Division for design recommendations when evaluating traffic islands and slip lanes.
1310.02(14)(a) Size and Shape Divisional islands are normally elongated and at least 4 feet wide and 20 feet long. Channelization islands are normally triangular. In rural areas, 75 ft2 is the minimum island area and 100 ft2 is desirable. In urban areas where posted speeds are 25 mph or slower, smaller islands are acceptable. Use islands with at least 200 ft2 if pedestrians will be crossing or traffic control devices or luminaires will be installed. Design triangular-shaped islands as shown in Exhibit 1310-21 through Exhibit 1310-23. The shoulder and offset widths illustrated are for islands with vertical curbs 6 inches or higher. Where painted islands are used, such as in rural areas, these widths are desirable but may be omitted. (See Chapter 1240 for desirable turning roadway widths.) Island markings may be supplemented with reflective raised pavement markers. Provide barrier-free access at crosswalk locations where raised islands are used. For pedestrian refuge islands and barrier-free access requirements, see Chapter 1510.
1310.02(14)(b) Location Design the approach ends of islands so they are visible to motorists. Position the island so that a smooth transition in vehicle speed and direction is attained. Begin transverse lane shifts far enough in advance of the intersection to allow gradual transitions. Avoid introducing islands on a horizontal or vertical curve. If the use of an island on a curve cannot be avoided, provide sight distance, illumination, or extension of the island.

1310.02(14)(c) Compound Right-Turn Lane To design large islands, the common method is to use a large-radius curve for the turning traffic. While this does provide a larger island, it also encourages higher turning speeds. Where pedestrians are a concern, higher turning speeds are undesirable. An alternative is a compound curve with a large radius followed by a small radius (see Exhibit 1310-22). This design forces the turning traffic to slow down.

In general, except to meet one of the uses listed above, it is desirable not to use curbs on facilities with a posted speed of 45 mph or above. Avoid using curbs if the same objective can be attained with pavement markings. Refer to Chapter 1230 for additional information and design criteria on the use of curbs. Exhibit 1310-23 Traffic Island Designs
Notes: [1] For shoulder width at curbs, see Chapter 1230. For additional information on shoulders at turn lanes, see Section 1310.02(18). [2] Small traffic islands have an area of 100 ft2 or less; large traffic islands have an area greater than 100 ft2. General: Provide an accessible route for pedestrians (see Chapter 1510).
1310.02(15) Right-Turn Lanes Right-turn movements influence intersection capacity even though there is no conflict between right-turning vehicles and opposing traffic. Right-turn lanes might be needed to maintain efficient intersection operation. Use the following to determine when to consider right-turn lanes at unsignalized intersections:
•
•
•
•
•
•
For two-lane roadways and for multilane roadways with a posted speed of 45 mph or above, when recommended by Exhibit 1310-24. A crash study indicates an overall crash reduction with a right-turn lane. The presence of pedestrians requires right-turning vehicles to stop. Restrictive geometrics require right-turning vehicles to slow greatly below the speed of the through traffic. There is less than decision sight distance for traffic approaching the intersection. For unsignalized intersections, see Section 1310.02(16) for guidance on right-turn lane lengths. For signalized intersections, use a traffic signal analysis to determine whether a right-turn lane is needed and what the length is (see Chapter 1310).

A capacity analysis may be used to determine whether right-turn lanes are needed to maintain the desired level of service. Where adequate right of way exists, providing right-turn lanes is relatively inexpensive and can provide increased operational efficiency. The right-turn pocket or the right-turn taper (see Exhibit 1310-25) may be used at any minor intersection where a right-turn lane is not provided. These designs reduce interference and delay to the through movement by offering an earlier exit to right-turning vehicles. If the right-turn pocket is used, Exhibit 1310-25 shows taper lengths for various posted speeds.
Exhibit 1310-24 Right-Turn Lane Guidelines
Notes: [1] For two-lane highways, use the peak hour DDHV (through + right-turn). For multilane, highways (posted speed 45 mph or above), use the right-lane peak hour approach volume (through + right-turn). [2] When all three of the following conditions are met, reduce the right-turn DDHV by 20: o The posted speed is 45 mph or below o The right-turn volume is greater than 40 VPH o The peak hour approach volume (DDHV) is less than 300 VPH [3] For right-turn corner design, see Exhibit 1310-8.

1310.02(16) Speed Change Lanes A speed change lane is an auxiliary lane primarily for the acceleration or deceleration of vehicles entering or leaving the through traveled way. Speed change lanes are normally provided for at-grade intersections on multilane divided highways with access control. Where roadside conditions and right of way allow, speed change lanes may be provided on other through roadways. Justification for a speed change lane depends on many factors, including speed; traffic volumes; capacity; type of highway; design and frequency of intersections and crash history. When either deceleration or acceleration lanes are to be used, design them in accordance with Exhibit 1310-26 and Exhibit 1310-27. When the design speed of the turning traffic is greater than 20 mph, design the speed change lane as a ramp in accordance with Chapter 1360. When a deceleration lane is used with a left-turn lane, add the deceleration length to the storage length. A dedicated deceleration lane (see Exhibit 1310-26) is advantageous because it removes slowing vehicles from the through lane. An acceleration lane (see Exhibit 1310-27) is not as advantageous because entering drivers can wait for an opportunity to merge without disrupting through traffic. However, acceleration lanes for left-turning vehicles provide a benefit by allowing the turn to be made in two movements. WSDOT Design Manua M 22-01.22

1310.02(17) Drop Lanes A lane may be dropped at an intersection with a turn-only lane or beyond the intersection. Do not allow a lanereduction taper to cross an intersection or end less than 100 feet before an intersection. (See Chapter 1210 for lane reduction pavement transitions.) When a lane is dropped beyond signalized intersections, provide a lane of sufficient length to allow smooth merging. For facilities with a posted speed of 45 mph or higher, use a minimum length of 1,500 feet. For facilities with a posted speed lower than 45 mph, provide a lane of sufficient length that the advanced lane reduction warning sign can be placed not less than 100 feet beyond the intersection area. When a lane is dropped beyond unsignalized intersections, provide a lane beyond the intersection not less than the acceleration lane length from Exhibit 1310-27.
1310.02(18) Shoulders Shoulder width is controlled by its intended functional use and its contribution to achieving the desired safety performance when balanced with other design elements. See Exhibit 1239-2 for functional uses and recommended shoulder widths. Reducing the shoulder width at intersections facilitates the installation of turn lanes without unduly affecting the overall width of the roadway. A narrower roadway also reduces pedestrian exposure in crosswalks and discourages motorists from using the shoulder to bypass other turning traffic.
1310.02(19) U-Turns For divided multilane highways without full access control that have access points where the median prevents left turns, evaluate the demand for locations that allow U turns. Normally, U turn opportunities are provided at intersections. However, where intersections are spaced far apart, U-turn median openings may be provided between intersections to accommodate U-turns. Use the desirable U-turn spacing (see Exhibit 1310-28) as a guide to determine when to provide U-turn median openings between intersections. Where the U-turning volumes are low, longer spacing may be used. Locate U-turn median openings where intersection sight distance can be provided. Exhibit 1310-28 U-Turn Spacing Urban/Rural

U-turns at signal-controlled intersections do not need the acceleration lanes shown in Exhibit 1310-30. For new U-turn locations at signal-controlled intersections, evaluate conflicts between right-turning vehicles from side streets and U-turning vehicles. Warning signs on the cross street might be appropriate.

1310.03 Designing for Active Transportation (New Section 2023) Design intersections to provide accommodation for pedestrian and bicycle movement at and through intersections on facilities where they are legally allowed. This includes new or reconstructed intersections at locations where completes streets does not apply. Accommodation of pedestrian and bicycle movements at intersections is achieved through incorporation of various design strategies that benefit one or more of the six functional characteristics that affect active transportation user’s comfort and safety. These functional characteristics include exposure, speed, delay, conspicuity, predictability, separation in space, and separation in time. Improve the safety and comfort of active transportation users by:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Decreasing pedestrian/bicyclist exposure to points of conflict with motor vehicle traffic; Decreasing motor vehicle operating speed; Increasing pedestrian/bicyclist user conspicuity; Increasing the predictability of movements of different user groups through the intersection; Increasing separation in space between motorists and pedestrians/bicyclists; and/or Increasing separation in time between motorists and pedestrians/bicyclists.
Intersection designs may not be able to incorporate design strategies that benefit all functional characteristics. Review the project for possible improvements to individual functional characteristics and apply engineering judgement as to which bullets are appropriate and to what extent they will be addressed (see Section 1310.03(1)). For more complex or innovative intersection layouts such as Diverging Diamond Interchanges, Displaced Left Turns, Single Point Urban Interchanges, etc., contact the HQ Transportation Operations Office for support. For additional information for roundabouts see Section 1320.05 and 1320.06.
1310.03(1) Design Process (New Section 2023) The identification of appropriate bicycle and pedestrian design features for all intersections along a corridor or at an individual intersection is informed by the corridor’s existing or planned bicycle and pedestrian facilities and other design elements (e.g., parking). The appropriateness of various design feature may be limited by geometric constraints (e.g., sufficient width). Moreover, the effectiveness of specific design features may be diminished if they are not supported by complementary corridor infrastructure and/or violate driver expectancy. Some features may not be conducive to a given corridor, while others may not be conducive to an individual intersection application. When designing for pedestrian and bicycle movements under a complete streets (CS) project, although a minimum Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) value of 2 or better is the standard for bicyclists and pedestrians, interpretation of that standard at intersections is still in development. In the interim, the CS requirements for intersections will be met if you follow the design table and implement appropriate strategies as outlined below. Design decisions made relative to the corridor will be reflected in the intersection and will therefore meet CS requirements. The approach to determining the appropriate intersection treatments for bicycle and pedestrian facilities focuses on matching selected intersection treatments to the corridor’s linear bike/pedestrian facilities and providing treatments that support local agency plans and WSDOT project goals.

Intersections
When used in conjunction with the table in Exhibit 1310-31, intersection treatments selected under this approach will support the LTS goals of the corridor. The table is designed to result in lower-stress intersection treatments that match lower-stress corridor facility types. The approach follows a five-step process: Step 1: Gather and review all pertinent active transportation goals and plans from local agency active transportation plans and/or comprehensive plans, the WSDOT Active Transportation Plan, and the project summary. Additional information may be provided in the Basis of Design and any design recommendations from the Region Complete Streets Team, where applicable. Step 2: Determine whether the project will include bicycle and pedestrian facility improvements. Most projects will include some form of bicycle and pedestrian facility improvements. A small selection of preservation projects in which complete streets does not apply might not include any bicycle or pedestrian facility improvements. If your project does not include any bicycle or pedestrian improvements, Step 2 is the last step in the process. For all other projects proceed to Step 3. Step 3: Determine the linear bicycle and pedestrian facility types that will be applied along your project corridor between intersections. For some projects the linear bicycle and pedestrian facilities will match existing facilities, and for others the project may propose new facility types to replace existing facilities (or to establish new facilities where none exist today). For intersection projects determine the linear bicycle and pedestrian facility types that exist leading up to the intersection. For all complete streets projects, the linear bicycle and pedestrian facility types will meet LTS 2. Step 4: Consult the table in Exhibit 1310-31. Find the columns under “Corridor Linear Bike/Ped Facility Types” that match the bicycle and pedestrian facilities determined in Step 3. Note that you will be tracking columns for both the bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Review and select any treatments from the “Intersection Treatments Applied at All Intersections Throughout Corridor” (orange group) that will support the corridor bicycle and pedestrian treatments determined in Step 3, local agency plans, and WSDOT project goals. Note that multiple treatments might be selected from this group in order to achieve a project’s goals. For corridor projects, the treatments selected from the orange group should be applied to all intersections in the corridor. Step 5: Next, review and select any treatments from the “Intersection Treatments Applied at Individual Intersections” (blue group) that will likewise support the corridor bicycle and pedestrian treatments determined in Step 3, local agency plans, and WSDOT project goals. As with the orange group, multiple treatments from the blue group might be selected in order to achieve a project’s goals. Repeat Step 5 for each individual intersection in the project. When reviewing potential treatments in the table, the cells marked “Yes” indicate that the treatment in the row is an appropriate treatment for the facility type in the column and should be considered for inclusion in the project. For the cells marked “No”, that treatment type should not be combined with the facility type in that column and therefore should not be used in the project.

Intersections
For the cells marked “N/A”, the treatment type in that row does not have any relationship with the facility type in the column and is therefore not applicable to the decision about whether to use that treatment. Note that other facility types that might apply to your project could still indicate use of that treatment. An example of this is the “Bikecross Markings” treatment. For that treatment, the pedestrian facility type has no bearing on the decision about whether to use bikecross markings, since these markings are not connected to the pedestrian facilities and do not serve any function for pedestrians. Therefore, the cells under the pedestrian facility types are all marked “N/A” for this treatment; however, the bicycle facility type does drive the decision about whether or not to use bikecross markings, and for certain bicycle facility types bikecross markings cannot be used, so some bicycle facility types are marked “Yes” for this treatment and some are marked “No”. For the cells marked “Not Typical”, the treatment in the row is not usually used in conjunction with the facility type in the column; however, under certain limited circumstances there may be a reason to consider the treatment. These combinations are normally not used unless there is a specific contextual reason to do so. After completing all five steps, document your determinations and results in the DDP.

KEY: "Yes" = treatment is appropriate for this facility type; "No" = treatment is not appropriate for this facility type; "N/A" = treatment is not applicable in the evaluation for this facility type—use other determinants for evaluation of potential use of treatment; "Not Typical" = not a typical treatment for this facility type, but can be considered if circumstances warrant use. Notes: [1] If a treatment is selected for use from this group, apply at all intersections; however, individual intersections within a project may not require certain treatments. [2] Treatments in this group are evaluated on an intersection-by-intersection basis; can be used at any or all intersections in a project. [3] To evaluate appropriate intersection treatments, typically select one column from the bicycle facility type group and one column from the pedestrian facility type group, and review potential treatments with consideration for both. [4] "None" means there are no facilities dedicated to bicycle use in the right of way (i.e., no bike lanes, no Neighborhood Greenway, no shared use path). This type includes locations with only sharrows in traffic lanes, as sharrows do not establish dedicated space for cyclists. [5] Green colored pavement markings can be applied as a conspicuity enhancement to bike lanes, bikecross markings, two-stage turn boxes, and leading bike boxes. [6] The use of median diverters is evaluated at the corridor-wide network level, but applied at individual intersections. [7] Marked crosswalks and pedestrian signal features are primarily intended for pedestrian use; however, at some high-conflict intersections bicyclists may be directed to use pedestrian crossing facilities. [8] "Ohio DOT Guide" is the 2022 Ohio DOT Multimodal Design Guide. Discuss this treatment with your ASDE when considering this guidance.

1310.03(2) Protected Intersection (New Section 2023) A protected intersection is a comprehensive design approach that incorporates a suite of design features to address all of the functional characteristics listed in Section 1310.03. This suite of design features can be applied to one or more corners of an intersection. A protected intersection is a geometric treatment that keeps bicyclists physically separated from drivers up to the intersection, including the corners. As such, they are typically implemented as a continuation of a separated bike lane facility, including two-way separated bike lanes. Protected intersections also provide benefits for pedestrians. The term protected in this context refers to the separation provided between vehicle lanes and pedestrians and bicyclists. Protected intersections include the following standard set of treatment countermeasures:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Corner island Bike queue area Bikeway setback and driver yield zone Pedestrian refuge island Pedestrian crossing of the bike lane Pedestrian curb ramp Bicyclist crossing of travel lanes Pedestrian crossing of travel lanes
Protected intersection features are applied at signalized and unsignalized intersections. When used at a signalized location, they sometimes include specialized signal phasing. Protected intersection features can be applied to one or more intersection legs. In a protected intersection, the separated nature of roadway bike lane and a pedestrian walkway at the intersection is created or preserved. In addition, a standard set of treatments is provided that are intended to improve the crossing for pedestrians and bicyclists. The design seeks to minimize shared space between bicyclists and vehicles, ideally to a single point where the motor vehicle turns across the bike lane and pedestrian crossing. The speed of each mode at this conflict point is controlled using geometric design techniques. Crossings are also offset from the physical corner to improve sight distance and decision time. Where feasible, transition the bike lane buffer to a minimum of 6 feet wide as it approaches and departs the intersection. This allows space for a motorist to stop for bicyclists and pedestrians without blocking traffic, improves a motorist’s view of approaching bicyclists by creating a crossing that is more perpendicular, and can potentially provide more time for all users to identify the point of conflict and react as needed (Exhibit 1310-32, #9). Use corner islands to influence the speed of right-turning motor vehicles and reduce crossing distances for bicyclists and pedestrians, minimizing exposure to turning traffic (Exhibit 1310-32, #1). (See Section 1510.09(5)(a)) Corner islands also provide positive separation between motor vehicles and bicycles up to the point of crossing. Restricting right turn on red can also reduce inadvertent encounters between travel modes. At locations where a small radius corner is desirable to control speeds of passenger vehicle traffic, but provisions must be made for occasional use by larger vehicles, truck aprons may be used in conjunction with corner islands (Exhibit 1310-32, #3; see also Exhibit 1510-16).

Intersections
At locations where there are sufficient buffer widths, such as streets with parking lanes, provide advance bicycle queuing areas (Exhibit 1310-32, #2) to improve visibility of cyclists and allow them to enter the intersection before turning motorists. These queue areas should be at least 6 feet long to fit a typical bicycle. At locations where advance queuing areas cannot be provided the bike lane stop bar should be placed ahead of the crosswalk on the approach. Use delineator islands to separate bicycle and pedestrian crossings and help guide pedestrians to the crosswalk and curb ramps. Design elements include: Exhibit 1310-32 Protected Intersection Design Elements (from the AASHTO Bike Guide 2021 Draft) (New Exhibit 2023)
1. Corner island and minimize radius - to define a path that encourages a low vehicle turning speed (see Section 1510.09(5)(a)) 2. Forward bicycle queuing area – to improve visibility and exclusive area for waiting to reduce conflict 3. Corner island truck apron – to accommodate a vehicle larger than the design vehicle 4. Pedestrian refuge median – to improve gap acceptance and comfort for pedestrians 5. Pedestrian crossing of the separated bike lane – to improve conspicuity and comfort for pedestrians 6. Pedestrian curb ramp – to meet ADA standards (see Chapter 1510) 7. Bicycle crossing of travel lanes – to indicate joint usage with motor vehicles and priority for bicycles 8. Pedestrian crossing of travel lanes - to indicate joint usage with motor vehicles and priority for bicycles 9. Car in motorist yield zone – to provide a space for waiting to reduce conflicts * Consider mountable truck apron (see Chapter 1510) based on an analysis of occurrence.

1310.04 Signing and Delineation Use the MUTCD and the Standard Plans for signing and delineation criteria. Provide a route confirmation sign on all state routes shortly after major intersections. (See Chapter 1020 for additional information on signing.) Painted or plastic pavement markings are normally used to delineate travel paths. For pavement marking details, see the MUTCD, Chapter 1030, and the Standard Plans. Contact the region or HQ Traffic Office for additional information when designing signing and pavement markings.
1310.05 Procedures Document design decisions and conclusions in accordance with Chapter 300. For highways with limited access control, see Chapter 530.
1310.05(1) Approval An intersection is approved in accordance with Chapter 300. Complete the following items, as needed, before intersection approval:
•
•
•
Intersection Control Type Approval (see Chapter 1300) Design Analyses approved in accordance with Chapter 300 Approved Traffic Signal Permit (DOT Form 242-014 EF) (see Chapter 1330)
1310.05(2) Intersection Plans Provide intersection plans for any increases in capacity (turn lanes) at an intersection, modification of channelization, or change of intersection geometrics. Support the need for intersection or channelization modifications with history; school bus and mail route studies; hazardous materials route studies; pedestrian use; public meeting comments; etc. For information to be included on the intersection plan for approval, see the Intersection/ Channelization Plan for Approval Checklist on the following website: Design - Support | WSDOT (wa.gov)
1310.05(3) Local Agency or Developer-Initiated Intersections Intersections in local agency and developer projects on state routes must receive the applicable approvals in Section 1310.05(1) as part of the intersection design process. The project initiator submits an intersection plan and the documentation of design decisions that led to the plan to the region for approval. For those plans requiring a Design Analysis, the Design Analysis must be approved in accordance with Chapter 300 prior to approval of the plan. After the plan approval, the region prepares a construction agreement with the project initiator (see the Utilities Manual).
1310.06 Documentation Refer to Chapter 300 for design documentation requirements.

1320.01 General Modern roundabouts are near-circular intersections at grade. They are an effective intersection type with fewer conflict points and lower speeds, and they provide for easier decision making than other intersection types. They also require less maintenance than traffic signals. Well-designed roundabouts have been found to reduce crashes (especially fatal and severe injury collisions), traffic delays, fuel consumption, and air pollution. They also have a traffic-calming effect by reducing vehicle speeds using geometric design rather than relying solely on traffic control devices.
Roundabout
Roundabout design is an iterative process. A well-designed roundabout achieves a balance of safety and efficiency. Good design is a process of creating the smooth curvature, channelization, and deflection required to achieve consistent speeds, well-marked lane paths, and appropriate sight distance. The decision to install a roundabout is the result of an Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) (see Chapter 1300) approved by the region Traffic Engineer or other designated authority. New roundabouts and changes to existing roundabouts that either add or reduce capacity, or change the geometric configuration require a Peer Review (see Section 1320.12)

Chapter 1320
Roundabouts
1320.02 Roundabout Types There are five basic roundabout types: mini, compact, single-lane, multilane, and teardrop described in the following sections.
1320.02(1) Mini-Roundabouts Mini-roundabouts are small single-lane roundabouts generally used in 25 mph or less urban/suburban environments. Because of this, mini-roundabouts are typically not suitable for use on higher-volume (greater than 6,000 AADT) state routes. In retrofit applications, mini-roundabouts are relatively inexpensive because they normally require minimal additional pavement at the intersecting roads. A 2-inch mountable curb for the splitter islands and the central island is desirable because larger vehicles might be required to cross over it. A common application is to replace a stop-controlled or uncontrolled intersection with a mini-roundabout to reduce delay and increase capacity. With mini roundabouts, the existing curb and sidewalk at the intersection can sometimes be left in place.
1320.02(2) Compact Roundabouts Compact roundabouts are a hybrid of attributes found in mini- and single-lane roundabouts. Similar to a miniroundabout, a compact roundabout may require minimal additional pavement, has a completely mountable center island, and in many cases existing curb or sidewalk can be left in place. As a result, compact roundabouts rarely require the purchase of right of way. Compact roundabouts are similar to single-lane roundabouts regarding design vehicle assumptions, ability to process traffic volumes, and signing.

1320.02(3) Single-Lane Roundabouts Single-lane roundabouts have single-lane entries at all legs and one circulating lane. They typically have mountable raised splitter islands, a mountable truck apron, and a landscaped central island.
Single-lane roundabout
1320.02(4) Multilane Roundabouts Multilane roundabouts have at least one entry or exit with two or more lanes and more than one circulating lane. The operational practice for trucks negotiating roundabouts is to straddle adjacent lanes.

Roundabouts
1320.02(5) Teardrop Roundabout Teardrops are usually associated with ramp terminals at interchanges: typically, at diamond interchanges. Teardrop roundabouts allow the “wide node, narrow link” concept. Unlike circular roundabouts, teardrops do not allow for continuous 360° travel resulting in less vehicle conflicts as traffic traveling on the crossroad (link) between ramp terminal intersections (nodes) does not encounter a yield as it enters the teardrop intersections. At higher ADT locations this lack of conflicting vehicles can result in a higher throughput but can also result in limited gaps for the off-ramp approach. Consult HQ or region Transportation Operations Office for guidance.
Teardrop roundabouts
1320.03 Capacity Analysis Use the capacity analysis completed as part of the Intersection Control Evaluation (see Chapter 1300) to verify the number of lanes required for every individual movement in the design year.
1320.04 Geometric Design 1320.04(1) Selecting Shape and Placement Roundabout shape is an important decision, because the shape can affect design elements that affect safety performance and operation of the roundabout.
1320.04(1)(a) Circular The circular shape is the most desirable roundabout shape when constraints allow. If a circular shape is not feasible, contact the region Transportation Operations Office to investigate other shapes described below. Sometimes a circular shape can be used by slightly offsetting the placement of the roundabout.

Roundabouts
1320.04(1)(b) Non-Circular A non-circular roundabout is a good choice when constraints such as right of way, existing roadway alignments, buildings, and/or environmentally sensitive areas influence the shape. Experiment with different roundabout sizes and radii and use design vehicle turning software (such as AutoTURN®) to refine the shape to find the best operation while retaining desired speeds.

1320.04(2)(a) Curbing All curbing within a roundabout should be drivable. The type of curbing appropriate for a roundabout is shown in the Standard Plan Roundabout Cement Concrete Curbs: F-10.18. Exception: existing curb untouched as part of a mini or compact roundabout installation may remain.
1320.04(2)(b) Truck Apron A truck apron is the mountable portion of a central island which helps minimize the overall footprint of the roundabout by allowing the turning path of commercial vehicles to traverse the truck apron. Generally, the truck tractor can traverse the roundabout in the circulating lane while the trailer is allowed to off track onto the apron. The apron is slightly raised vertically above the circulating travel path with a different pattern or color to provide lane guidance to drivers in the circulating lane. A truck apron’s width is based on the needs of the design vehicle. If a bus uses the intersection for any movement routinely, the designer should try to minimize apron use of the bus, however this is not a requirement. Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to fine tune the width of apron needed, so as not to design too large of an apron width that won’t be used. There are rare circumstances where a combination of frequent low clearance trucks such as lowboys, roadway grades or other roadway features may lead to consideration of a truck apron height of less than 3 inches. Contact with HQ Transportation Office for guidance. Changing the apron height from 3” requires a Design Analysis. The apron color should be distinguishable in contrast with the adjacent circulating roadway and pedestrian facilities. WSDOT practice generally includes encouraging the use of a red color with brick texturing. The use of grey or darker colors alone does not provide adequate contrast. However, designs using a mixture of color, textures, and geometric shapes such as incorporation of central island landscaping, or chevron patterns can provide desirable contrast to the adjacent circulating roadway. Work with the region Landscape Architect (HQ Roadside and Site Development Section for regions without a Landscape Architect) and HQ Transportation Operations Office for color, texture, and design options.

This example includes a rock blanket on the splitter islands, sidewalk buffer, and a wave pattern on the central island. Contrasting the rock blanket in the central island is tan concrete with brick texturing. Further contrast is provided by the red brushed concrete apron and a small circular landscaped area in the central island. The truck apron is red brushed concrete. The rock blanket could be placed in pervious concrete if needed for stormwater management purposes. Location is Handford Armona Rd at Exit 84 on State Route 198 in Handford, CA.

Roundabouts
1320.04(2)(c) Central Island The central island is the portion of the roundabout that is inside of the circulating roadway and typically includes an inside truck apron and a landscaped area (except for mini-roundabouts and compact roundabouts, which have no landscaped area and are entirely mountable). Central island shape is a function of the site-specific needs of a roundabout intersection. It doesn’t have to be an identical shape of the inscribed circle diameter (ICD) dimensions but should support the design principles of deflection and low speeds, and the accommodation of the design vehicle. Roundabouts present opportunities to create community focal points, landscaping, and other gateway features within an intersection. The central island may include enhancements (such as landscaping, sculptures, or fountains), which serve both an aesthetic purpose and provide visual indication of the intersection for approaching motorists (this is particularly important for high-speed approaches). Ideal central island treatments fit the context and result in minimal consequence to any vehicle that may encroach on the non-mountable portion of the central island. These treatments should not attract pedestrians to the central island, as pedestrians should never cross the circulating roadway. Work with the region Landscape Architect (HQ Roadside and Site Development Section for regions without a Landscape Architect) for central island features. See Chapter 950 for policy and guidance.
1320.04(2)(d) Splitter Island A splitter island is the raised island at each two-way leg between entering and exiting vehicles, designed primarily to control the entry and exit speeds by providing deflection. They also discourage wrong-way movements, and provide pedestrian refuge. Splitter islands can have different shapes based on entry angle requirements and exit design speeds. Raised channelization, or the appearance of raised curbing, is important, as research shows that drivers will slow down when they perceive that the driving width is narrowing.
Splitter Island
The length of the splitter island will vary (typical lengths: 30 ft. to 350 ft.) based on the terrain, access considerations, site-specific mainline and crossroad operational speeds and the stepdown speeds to the final desired entry speed, which is usually 15–25 mph. (See 1320.04(3)(a) for using chicanes on higher-speed roadways.) WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1320
Roundabouts
Try to maximize the splitter island width adjacent to the circulating roadway. The larger achieved width, the better a driver approaching the roundabout can perceive whether a driver in the circulating lane will exit or continue inside the roundabout. This results in better gap acceptance. This may also support a better pedestrian refuge design. The splitter island should be distinguishable in contrast with the adjacent roadway and pedestrian facilities. See discussion and guidance for truck aprons in Section 1320.04(2)(b).
1320.04(2)(e) Inscribed Circle Diameter The Inscribed Circle Diameter (ICD), that is, the overall outside diameter of a roundabout, is determined by the variables design vehicle, design speed, and the number of circulatory lanes. The ranges of ICD in Exhibit 1320-1 are only suggestions to start a roundabout design. The ICD for noncircular shapes should be defined with dimensions along the X and Y axis.

1320.04(2)(f) Entry 1. Deflection Ideal alignment offers an entry design that provides deflection, speed control, and reasonable view angles to drivers while balancing property impacts and costs. While most intersections are at 90º angles and most through movements are straight, deflection contributes to the safety performance of a roundabout. Deflection is primarily achieved with the central island and supporting it with splitter islands on all entries to the roundabout. 2. Alignment Offset There are three alignment choices for attaching entry legs to the circulatory roadway:
•
•
•
The offset left alignment is preferred. It constrains the entry, slowing a vehicle’s approach speed, and opens up the exit for efficient egress. The symmetrical alignment (if needed) is acceptable for lower speed contexts such as 30 mph. The offset right alignment tends to allow faster entry speeds and constrains the exit; it is undesirable.

Offset left alignment (preferred)
3. Entry Angle To achieve the proper amount of deflection for each approach to a roundabout, there is a range of angle values that are desirable. This range is usually between 20 and 40 degrees. The purpose of entry angle is so vehicles don’t hit broadside. 4. Entry Width Entry width is determined by the turning template of the design vehicle turning through the entry curve at the desired entry speed. The ranges of entry widths in Exhibit 1320-1 are only suggestions to start a roundabout design.
Entry angle and width
5. Path Overlap In a multilane roundabout, if the vehicles in the entry are aligned toward the central island or the truck apron, the vehicle on the right is pointed toward the inside lane and tends to go in that direction, while the vehicle on the left tends to be squeezed to the right toward the vehicle on the right. Avoid path overlap. Avoid a design that aligns an entering vehicle at the incorrect lane in the circulatory roadway. As a vehicle enters the circulating roadway it should be headed directly toward its respective lane within the circulating roadway. For multilane roundabouts, if inside lane is pointing at truck apron this is also considered to be path overlap. If right entry lane is pointing to left circulatory lane, then there is path overlap.

1320.04(2)(g) Right-Turn Slip Lanes Right-turn slip lanes are a proven way to increase the “life” of an intersection by removing traffic that would otherwise enter the roundabout and reduce the available capacity to other movements. If a right-turn movement has 250 vehicles/hour or more, or if over 40% of the total approach volume is taking right turns, a slip lane should be considered. The conflicting volume of vehicles on the merge will influence the length of merge lane prior to termination. Speeds can be very low and vehicles can take turns at these low speeds. Multimodal considerations will influence the length based on crosswalk location and bicycle use.

Roundabouts
1320.04(3) Speed Control Roundabout operation performance is dependent on low, consistent vehicle speeds. Low and consistent operating speeds facilitate appropriate gap acceptance by an entering driver. Design for travel path operating speeds between 15 mph and 25 mph (see Section 1320.04(3)(b)). Design to have low-speed differentials (12 mph or under) between entering and circulating traffic. Multilane roundabouts might have higher speeds along their respective travel paths, but generally 30 mph or less. The ideal design speed mechanism has the entry and circulating speeds being similar. This varies due to size, shape and context of the roundabout. The vehicle then moves into and through the circulation lane, being controlled all along by the design speed of the circulating lane. The circulating design speed controls the exit speed; therefore, the exit design speed, as calculated in the Travel Path section below, is not as critical. Designing geometric entry speed control encourages lower speeds and lower speed differentials at conflict points, which reduces the potential for collisions.
1320.04(3)(a) Chicanes Chicanes are a type of horizontal deflection used in traffic calming to reduce the speed of vehicles. Research has shown that chicanes have value in slowing down higher approach speeds.
Chicane
Consider chicanes where posted speeds near the roundabout are 45 mph or higher. Design chicane curves with successively smaller radii in order to successively reduce vehicle speeds approaching the roundabout entry. Use Exhibit 1320-2 to determine the radii-speed relationship (the radii are measured using the offsets recommended in the Travel Paths section). The normal cross slope (superelevation in Exhibit 1320-2) is 2% however, site conditions may require more based on how you tilt the plane of the roundabout for site specific conditions. A minus (-) 2% drains toward the central island. Also, consider the grade of the roadways that enter the roundabout, because a vehicle can more easily slow down on an upgrade than on a downgrade. Adjust the length of the deceleration based on the “Adjustment Factors for Grades Greater Than 3%” in Design Manual Exhibit 1360-11.

1320.04(3)(b) Travel Paths Travel path calculations can be used on all roundabout designs to get an understanding of speeds for different paths throughout the roundabout. A travel path is the shortest path through the roundabout, no closer than 5 feet from any curb face or lane line as shown. Use Exhibit 1320-2 and R1 through R5 to determine Travel Path speeds.

1320.04(5) Circulatory Roadway Profile and Cross Slope The preferred profile grades of the circulatory roadway of a roundabout are ±4% or flatter radially around the circulatory lane(s). Profile grades steeper than ±4% require justification. It is preferred to bench the roundabout if practicable to reduce profile grade.
Preferred grades and cross slopes
The preferred circulatory roadway cross slope may range from 1.5% to 4.0% (2.0% preferred), away from the central island to promote lower circulating speeds, improve central island visibility, minimize breaks in cross slope of entry and exit lanes, and facilitate drainage of water to the outside of the roundabout.
Drawing shows preferred cross slopes. Site conditions and drainage may require slopes outside these ranges.
1320.04(6) Design Tools During the scoping or preliminary geometric design process, do not to use truck turning paths alone as a constraint to eliminate a roundabout at an intersection. There are several design tools available to aid in the design of a roundabout. It is important to understand how the software works, its default settings, and its application to the design process.
1320.04(6)(a) Vehicle Swept Path Flexibility Managing vehicle speeds is a goal in roundabout design. Therefore, selection of a design vehicle that fits the transportation and land use context while balancing vehicle speed and accommodation is a key first step. Section 1103.03(4), states, “WSDOT policy provides flexibility when choosing the intersection design vehicle. The purpose for this policy is to balance user needs and avoid the unnecessary expense of oversizing intersections.” Once vehicle(s) have been selected for both design and accommodation, there are certain assumptions that must be made with software programs that replicate vehicle swept paths. Determine which defaults are to be

Roundabouts
used or modified so that different movements can be modeled. Every effort should be made to minimize swept paths using modeling software. Swept paths of infrequent vehicles also have the added benefit of drivable curbing that adds flexibility and redundancy to designs. See Section 1103.03(4) and 1310.02(5) for guidance on determining modal priority and design vehicles.
1320.04(6)(b) Truck Swept Path In some cases, roundabouts of the perfect circular variety with symmetrical roadway attachments require less specific knowledge of truck-turning software and its applications. However, when looking at a non-circular shaped roundabout where the combination of the truck’s speed, its turning angle settings, its rear axle locations, and its alignment are the critical design elements to address, a mastery of the software is required. Designers that are unfamiliar with how to apply the software inputs accurately to model a truck’s swept path need to contact HQ Transportation Operations Office for guidance. Poor alignment of a truck swept path can result in unnecessarily large roundabout footprints, higher than desired Travel Path speeds, or uncomfortable driving maneuvers by the freight community. Assume that a truck will travel much slower through a roundabout than the Travel Path speed calculated for passenger vehicles (see Section 1320.04(3)(b)). Adjust the software input to allow a slower truck speed in order to make a good engineering judgment about how fast a truck may use a roundabout (for example, for AutoTURN® use 5 mph). Design tool default settings don’t necessarily allow the maximization of the tool and can prohibit the designer from getting a good, balanced design between passenger car speeds and truck accommodation.
Single lane roundabout - Truck using the truck apron
When using a truck-turning software tool like AutoTURN® on multilane roundabouts, assume a truck’s travel path will occupy (straddle) parts of two adjacent lanes.

1320.04(7) Sight Distance Sight distance is an important design consideration at roundabouts. Restricting sight distance across the central island with strategic landscaping may enhance the intersection by making the intersection a focal point and encouraging lower speeds. Work with the region Traffic Engineer and Landscape Architect (HQ if there is no region contact) to determine this balance. Provide sight triangle plan sheets for consideration of landscape design.
1320.04(7)(a) Stopping Use the design stopping sight distance in Chapter 1260. Anticipated speeds throughout the roundabout can be calculated using Exhibit 1320-2, based on the Travel Path radius and direction of the particular curve. The design stopping sight distance is measured along the vehicle’s path as it follows the curvature of the roadway; it is not measured as a straight line.
Sight distance – Approach and Exit
1320.04(7)(b) Intersection Provide minimum intersection sight distance. Longer sight distances can lead to higher vehicle speeds that reduce gap opportunities for entering vehicles. For intersection sight distance at roundabouts, provide entering vehicles a clear view of traffic on the circulating roadway and on the immediate upstream approach in order to aid in judging an acceptable gap. The intersection sight distance at roundabouts is given in Exhibit 1320-3. The S1 intersection sight distance is based on the average of the entering and circulating speeds, and the S2 intersection sight distance is based on the left-turning speed. The sight distance may also be calculated using the intersection sight distance equation given in Chapter 1310 using a time gap (tg) of 4.5 seconds.

1320.04(8) Railroad Crossings Although it is undesirable to locate any intersection near an at-grade railroad crossing, this situation exists at many locations on the highway system. Experience shows that a roundabout placed near a crossing has some operational advantages. If there is a railroad crossing near the roundabout contact HQ Transportation Operations Office for further guidance.
1320.05 Pedestrians As part of the approved ICE it has already been determined whether pedestrians will use the roundabout and, if so, which legs (see Chapter 1300). With the knowledge of where pedestrian facilities are needed, design the roundabout while keeping in mind the ADA requirements for crosswalks, sidewalks, paths, and other pedestrian facilities.

Chapter 1320
Roundabouts
1320.05(1) Crossing Location The pedestrian crossing located on the entry side of a roundabout leg should be about 20 feet from the yield line so that a pedestrian can walk behind a vehicle that is waiting at the yield line. The crossing located in the exit side of the roundabout leg can be closer to the roundabout, because as the vehicles leave the roundabout, they accelerate and make it harder to find a break in traffic. As speed increases, drivers are less likely and less able to stop. Verify that stopping sight distance is provided throughout the roundabout, based on operating speed.
1320.05(2) Splitter Island Pass Through Design the splitter island pass through a minimum of 5 feet wide, or the width of the sidewalk, whichever is greater. The length of the pass through (measured back of curb to back of curb of the splitter island) is to be a minimum of 6 feet long measured along the shortest section of the pedestrian path. Consider a “V” shape pass through as shown.
Splitter island pass through
1320.05(3) Buffers Wherever feasible, separate sidewalks from the curb with a buffer. Landscaping or colored concrete are acceptable for the buffer. See WSDOT Standard Plan F10-18 for dimension details. Do not compromise required vehicle sight triangle needs. The buffer discourages pedestrians from crossing to the central island or cutting across the circulatory roadway of the roundabout. It also helps guide pedestrians with vision impairments to the designated crosswalks and can be used by the occasional inexperienced truck driver who encroaches up onto a curb while traversing through the roundabout.
1320.05(4) Curb Ramps Roundabouts with buffers typically have combination-type curb ramps; otherwise, parallel curb ramps are normally used. (See Chapter 1510 and the Standard Plans for curb ramp information.) WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

1320.05(5) Sight Triangles A vehicle sight triangle specific to pedestrians (see Section 1320.04(7)) must include the whole curb ramp, including the landing, where pedestrians are likely to wait to cross. It is also important that pedestrians are also able to see approaching vehicles.
1320.05(6) Pedestrian Beacons On multilane roundabouts, consider installing pedestrian beacons to warn drivers when a pedestrian wants to cross the roadway. Work with the region Traffic Engineer on types and locations of pedestrian beacons.

1320.06 Bicycles Provide bicyclists with similar options to negotiate roundabouts as they have at other intersections. Consider how they navigate either as motor vehicles or pedestrians depending on the size of the intersection, traffic volumes, their experience level, and other factors. Bicyclists are often comfortable riding through single-lane roundabouts in low-volume environments in the travel lane with motor vehicles, as speeds are comparable and potential conflicts are low. At larger or busier roundabouts, cyclists may be more comfortable using ramps connecting to a sidewalk around the perimeter of the roundabout as a pedestrian. Where bicycle lanes or shoulders are used on approach roadways, they should end before the geometry changes the approach to the roundabout. Contact the HQ Design Office for bicycle ramp design options.

1320.07 Signing The graphic shown is an example of potential signing for a single-lane roundabout. For additional information, refer to the MUTCD, Plan Sheet Library, and the Standard Plans for details on signing. A preliminary sign plan is developed to identify existing and proposed signing on state highways. Sign plans on state routes are to be reviewed and approved by the region Traffic Engineer and then furnished to the HQ Transportation Operations Office for review. The plan provides an easily understood graphic representation of the signing, and it provides statewide uniformity and consistency for regulatory, warning, and guide signs at roundabouts on the state highway system. For roundabouts located near a port, industrial area, or route that experiences oversize loads, consider using perforated square steel posts.

1320.08 Drainage Features (New Section 2023) The type, frequency, and placement of drainage features in a roundabout can influence operational performance and cause the drainage features to be damaged by vehicles. For example, vehicles in a multi-lane roundabout may shy away from drain inlets placed in the traveled way thus compromising the roundabout’s optimal performance of channelizing vehicles and speed control. Consult with the Region Hydraulics Engineer early in the project development process to identify the best design characteristics that both facilitates drainage features and optimizes roundabout performance.

1320.09 Pavement Marking See Standard Plan M-12.10 for roundabout pavement marking details. Consult region Traffic on traffic pavement markings and materials.
1320.10 Illumination Provide illumination for each of the conflict points between circulating and entering traffic in the roundabout and at the beginning of the raised splitter islands. Illuminate raised channelization or curbing. Position the luminaires on the upstream side of each crosswalk to improve the visibility of pedestrians. Light the roundabout from the outside in toward the center. This improves the visibility of the central island and circulating vehicles to motorists approaching the roundabout. Ground-level lighting within the central island that shines upward toward objects in the central island can also improve their visibility. Consult with the region Transportation Operations Office for illumination design. (See Chapter 1040 for additional information on illumination.) On higher-speed approaches, consider internally illuminated bollards (IIB) in lieu of other illumination.
1320.11 Road Approach, Parking, and Transit Facilities Road approach (road or driveway) connections to the circulating roadway are not allowed at roundabouts unless they are designed as a leg to the roundabout. It is desirable that road approaches are not located on the approach or departure legs within the length of the splitter island. The minimum distance from the circulating roadway to a road approach is controlled by corner clearance using the outside edge of the circulating roadway as the crossroad. When minimum corner clearance cannot be met, document the decision in accordance with Chapter 530 and Chapter 540. If a parcel adjoins two legs of the roundabout, it is acceptable to provide a right-in/right-out driveway within the length of the splitter islands on both legs. Roadways between roundabouts may have restrictive medians with left-turn access provided with U-turns at the roundabouts. Parking is not allowed in the circulating roadway or on the entry or exit roadway within the length of the splitter island. Transit stops are not allowed in the circulating roadway, in the approach lanes, or in the exit lanes prior to the crosswalk. Locate transit stops on the roadway before or after the roundabout, in a pullout, or where the pavement is wide enough that a stopped bus does not block the through movement of traffic or impede sight distance.

1330.01 General Traffic control signals are automated traffic control devices that warn or direct motorists to take a specific action. Traffic control signals are used to control the assignment of right of way at locations where conflicts with motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians exist or where passive devices such as signs and markings do not provide the necessary flexibility of control to move motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians in an efficient manner. The decision to install a traffic signal is the result of an Intersection Control Evaluation (ICE) (see Chapter 1300) that is approved by the region Traffic Engineer or other designated authority.
1330.02 Procedures 1330.02(1) Traffic Signal Permit State statutes (RCWs) require WSDOT approval for the design and location of all conventional traffic signals and some types of beacons located on city streets forming parts of state highways. Approval by WSDOT for the design, location, installation, and operation of all other traffic control signals installed on state highways is required by department policy. The Traffic Signal Permit (DOT Form 242-014 EF) is the formal record of the signal warrant analysis required by the MUTCD and the department’s approval of the installation and type of signal. Permits are required for the following types of signal installations:
•

Traffic Control Signals
The Permit and its supporting data must be included in the Design Documentation Package (DDP.) The permit is completed by the requesting agency and submitted, complete with supporting data, through the region Traffic Office to the approving authority for approval. See Section 1330.02(1)(a) for Signal Warrant information required as part of the supporting documentation. The approving authority is the Regional Administrator or authorized delegate. The approving authority approves or denies the application and sends it back to the region Traffic Office. The region Traffic Office retains a record of the approved permit and supporting data and forwards a copy of the Permit and the supporting data to the State Traffic Engineer at WSDOT Headquarters (HQ). Preserve the approved permit as required by Section 1330.07 Documentation. Emergency vehicle signals require annual permit renewal. The region Traffic Office reviews the installation for compliance with requirements. If satisfactory, the permit is renewed by the Regional Administrator with a letter to the operating agency. A copy of this letter is also sent to the State Traffic Engineer. Permits are not required for portable traffic signals, speed limit sign beacons, stop sign beacons, or lane assignment signals at toll facilities. A new permit application is required when the level of control is increased, such as changing from an intersection control beacon to a conventional traffic signal or adding an approach to an existing signal system. For a reduction in the level of control, such as converting a conventional signal to a flashing intersection beacon or removal of the signal, submit the “Report of Change” portion of the traffic signal permit, complete with supporting data, to the approving authority, with a copy to the region Traffic Office and State Traffic Engineer. If experimental systems are proposed, region Traffic Engineer review and approval is required. The region Traffic Office will send the approved proposal to the State Traffic Engineer for review and approval. The State Traffic Engineer will forward the approved proposal to FHWA for their approval. A copy of the approval from FHWA will be returned and must be preserved as required by 1330.07 Documentation. Any signal system requiring a permit, with the exception of Ramp Meter signals, also requires Preliminary Signal Plan approval from the WSDOT HQ Traffic Office (see Section 1330.05).
1330.02(1)(a) Signal Warrants A signal warrant is a minimum condition that is to be met before a signal may be considered for installation. Satisfying a warrant does not mandate the installation of a traffic signal. The warranting condition(s) supports the inclusion of a traffic signal for consideration as part of the ICE performed during the scoping of the project (see Chapter 1300). For a list of the traffic signal warrants and information on how to use them, see the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). Contact the region Traffic Engineer for region specific practices. Address all warrants listed in the currently adopted MUTCD as part of the Signal Warrant Analysis. Mark warrants which do not apply as “Not Applicable” and include a basic supporting statement or similar justification. Include the Signal Warrant Analysis in the Signal Permit supporting data. For Warrant 7, the three year period must be used for all traffic signals installed on state highways as described in FHWA Interim Approval IA-19 (https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interim_approval/ia19/index.htm).

Responsibilities vary depending on location, jurisdiction, and whether or not limited access control has been established. Limited access as used in this chapter refers to full, partial, or modified limited access control that has been established as identified in the Access Control Tracking System. The following is a summary of the typical areas of responsibility: a) Inside the corporate limits of cities with a population of 30,000 or greater where there is no established limited access control: The city is responsible for the funding, construction, maintenance, and operation of traffic signals. Population figures can be found at: www.ofm.wa.gov/pop/ b) Inside the corporate limits of cities with a population of less than 30,000: WSDOT is responsible for funding, construction, maintenance, and operation of traffic signals. Population figures can be found at: www.ofm.wa.gov/pop/ c) Inside the corporate limits of cities with a population of 30,000 or greater where there is established limited access control: WSDOT is responsible for funding, construction, maintenance, and operation of traffic signals. Population figures can be found at: www.ofm.wa.gov/pop/ d) Outside the corporate limits of cities and outside established limited access control areas: WSDOT is responsible for funding, construction, maintenance, and operation of a traffic signal when a new state highway crosses an existing county road. When a new county road intersects an existing state highway, WSDOT is responsible for only the maintenance and operation of a traffic signal. The county is responsible for the construction costs of the traffic signal and associated illumination. When it is necessary to construct a traffic signal at an existing county road and state highway intersection, the construction cost distribution is based on the volume of traffic entering the intersection from each jurisdiction’s roadway. The county’s share of the cost, however, is limited to a maximum of 50%. The state is responsible for maintenance and operation (WAC 468-18-040). e) Outside the corporate limits of cities and inside established limited access control areas: WSDOT is responsible for funding, construction, maintenance, and operation of traffic signals. f) Emergency vehicle signals: The emergency service agency is responsible for all costs associated with emergency vehicle signals. g) Third party agreement signals: At those locations where WSDOT is responsible for traffic signals and third-party activity justifies the installation of a traffic signal, as determined by an ICE, the following rules apply: o The third party is responsible for funding the design and construction of the traffic signal system, unless another arrangement is agreed upon with WSDOT. o The third party obtains a traffic signal permit. o The third party agrees to design and construct the traffic signal in conformance with WSDOT’s guidelines and requirements. o The third party agrees to submit the design and construction documents to WSDOT for review and approval by the region Traffic Engineer. o Preserve all third party provided documents and any third-party agreement(s) as required by Section 1330.07 Documentation.

1330.03 Intersection Design Considerations Signalized intersections require different design considerations than non-signalized intersections. These elements should be considered as early as the ICE process (see Chapter 1300 and Chapter 1310 for further guidance.) This Section discusses basic intersections with relatively simple geometry. For more complex or innovative intersection layouts such as Diverging Diamond Interchanges, Displaced Left Turns, or Single Point Urban Interchanges, contact the WSDOT HQ Traffic Office for support. Consider providing an unrestricted through lane on the major street of a T intersection (sometimes referred to as a Continuous Green “T” (CGT) intersection). This design allows for one traffic movement to flow without restriction. When this is used on through roadways with a posted speed of 45 MPH or greater, the through lane must be separated by a physical barrier or the through movement must also be signalized. If there is a crosswalk across the through lane, the through lane must be signalized. Exhibit 1320-2 shows an example of a CGT intersection.

Exhibit 1330-2 Example Continuous Green “T” Intersection Layout
1330.03(1) Left Turns It is recommended that a left turn storage lane be provided for all main line roadways where left turns are allowed. This helps to avoid having stopped traffic in a through lane with a green through signal display. This also helps to support potential future changes in left turn operations. See Section 1330.06(1) for additional discussion. Left-turning traffic can operate more efficiently when the opposing left-turn lanes are directly opposite each other. When a left-turn lane is offset into the path of an opposing through lane, the left-turning driver may assume the opposing vehicles are also in a left-turn lane and fail to yield. To prevent this occurrence, less efficient split phasing may be necessary. (See Chapter 1310 for guidance on lane offsets and opposing left-turn clearance.) Where there are opposing through lanes but no opposing left turn lane, install a striped or raised median area opposite the left turn lane if possible. Place stop lines so that they are out of the path of conflicting left turns. Check the geometric layout by using turning templates or a computerized vehicle turning path program (such as AutoTURN®) to determine whether the proposed layout and phasing is sufficient for the design vehicles. Also, check the turning paths of opposing left-turn movements. In many cases, the phase analysis might recommend allowing opposing left turns to run concurrently, but the intersection geometrics are such that this operation cannot occur. The intersection should be large enough to provide opposing left turning vehicle paths with a 4-foot minimum (12-foot desirable) separation between them. Where this separation cannot be achieved, less efficient signal phasing may be required to provide adequate space for opposing left turns. Some intersections may have multi-lane left turns. At locations with closely spaced intersections, a multi-lane left-turn storage area might be the only solution to reduce the potential for the left-turn volume to back up into an adjacent intersection. As with single left turn lanes, the intersection should be large enough to provide opposing left turning vehicle paths with a 4-foot minimum (12-foot desirable) separation between them. Where this separation cannot be achieved, less efficient signal phasing may be required to provide adequate space opposing left turns. At smaller intersections, the opposing single-lane left-turn movement might not be able to turn during the twolane left-turn phase and it might be necessary to reposition this lane. If the opposing left turns cannot time together, the reduction in delay from the two-lane left-turn phase is likely to be nullified by the requirement for a separate opposing left-turn phase. Exhibit 1330-3 shows two examples of two-lane left turns with opposing single-left arrangements.

Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
Two receiving lanes are required for two-lane left-turn movements. In addition, these receiving lanes are to extend well beyond the intersection before reducing to one lane. A lane reduction immediately beyond the intersection can cause delays and backups into the intersection because the left-turning vehicles usually move in dense platoons, which may make merging and lane changes difficult. (See Chapter 1310 for guidance on lane reductions on intersection exits.) Exhibit 1330-3 Left-Turn Lane Configuration Examples

1330.03(2) Right Turns Large right-turn curb radii at intersections sometimes have impacts on traffic signal operation. Larger radii allow faster turning speeds and might move the pedestrian entrance point farther away from the intersection area. Pedestrian crossing times are increased because of the longer crossing, thereby reducing the amount of time available for vehicular traffic. (See Chapter 1310 for guidance on determining these radii.) At intersections with large right-turn radii, consider installing raised traffic islands. These islands are primarily designed as pedestrian refuge areas. (See Chapter 1510 for pedestrian refuge islands and traffic island designs.) Traffic islands may decrease the required pedestrian clearance intervals; however, large radii and raised traffic islands may make it difficult for pedestrians to navigate the intersection. Where pedestrians are expected to cross a right turn lane to a traffic island, it is recommended to use a compound right turn-lane design as shown in Chapter 1310.
1330.03(3) Pedestrian Features See Chapter 1510.
1330.03(4) Road Approaches and Driveways If roadway approaches and driveways are located too close to an intersection, the traffic from these facilities can affect signal operations. Consider eliminating the accesses or restricting them to “right in/right out”. If a driveway or road approach is directly opposite a leg of the intersection, that approach may be signalized. If the approach is signalized, it must be signalized as if it were a standard intersection leg, and the pedestrian crossing across the approach must also be signalized as if it were a standard crosswalk. Management of driveways and road approaches should be determined early (preferably no later than scoping) so that they can be considered and addressed in the design. (See Chapter 530 and Chapter 540 for further guidance.) Consider shifting the location of advance detection upstream to clear an access point so that vehicles entering from the access point will not affect detection and operation of the signal.
1330.03(5) Skewed Intersections Skewed intersections, because of their geometry, are challenging to signalize and delineate. Where feasible, modify the skew angle to provide more normal approaches and exits. In many cases, the large, paved areas for curb return radii at skewed intersections can be reduced when the skew angle is reduced. (See Chapter 1310 for requirements and design options.) Visibility of pedestrians is of particular concern and must also be taken into consideration.
1330.03(6) Transit Stops Transit stops and pullout locations should be located on the far side of the intersection to minimize their impacts on signal operation. (See Chapter 1730 for transit stop and pullout designs.)
1330.03(7) Railroad Crossings Where railroad preemption is used at a signalized intersection, install left and right turn lanes for the movements leading to the leg of the intersection with the railroad crossing if possible. This greatly improves the efficiency of the signal during railroad preemption when turns are restricted. Also consider providing a left-turn lane for the minor leg opposing the railroad crossing. This will allow for more effective signal operations during long periods of railroad preemption. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Where there is less than 40 feet between the nearest rail and the normal location of the stop line, do not install a stop line between the tracks and the intersection. Use the same stop line for the traffic signal and the rail crossing instead. Exhibit 1330-4 shows recommended intersection features for intersections near rail crossings. Contact the WSDOT HQ Traffic Office for assistance with standalone queue-cutter signals. Exhibit 1330-4 Recommended Features for Intersections near Rail Crossings
1330.04 Conventional Traffic Signal Design 1330.04(1) General The goal of any traffic signal design is to assign right of way in the most efficient manner possible and still be consistent with traffic volumes, intersection geometrics, and safety. An advanced signalized intersection warning sign may be required when the sight distance to the signal is not met. A beacon assembly with the sign to warn motorists of a signalized intersection shall be included when directed by Region Traffic Engineer if either of the two following conditions exists: a) The visibility requirements in the MUTCD are not achievable. b) The posted speed is 55 mph or higher and the previous signalized intersection is more than 2 miles away; this does not apply to freeway off-ramps. This warning sign and beacon assembly consists of a W3-3 sign with Type IV reflective sheeting and one or two continuously flashing beacons. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-8
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
Where two beacons are used, the beacons should flash alternately instead of simultaneously. Locate the sign in advance of the intersection in accordance with Table 2C-4 (Condition A) of the MUTCD. The warning sign and beacon assembly may be omitted with approval from the region Traffic Engineer.
1330.04(2) Signal Phasing With some exceptions, the fewer the traffic signal phases, the more efficient the operation of the traffic signal. The number of phases required for efficient operation is related to intersection geometrics, traffic volumes, composition of traffic flow, turning movement demands, and desired level of driver comfort. The traffic movements at an intersection have been standardized to provide consistency in both traffic signal design and driver expectations. (See Exhibit 1330-5 for standard intersection movements, signal head (display) numbering, and standard phase operation.)

Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
For WSDOT operated signals, the region Signal Operations Engineer will develop the signal phasing plan or review proposed phasing for systems designed by others. For signals operated by other jurisdictions, the operating jurisdiction should be involved in signal phasing development. Phasing development is addressed in Section 1330.06 Operational Considerations for Design. Phasing development should begin as soon as the decision is made to install a traffic signal and may begin as early as the intersection control evaluation. Provide the proposed channelization plans and traffic count data to the region Signal Operations Engineer or phasing designer as early as possible, as phasing information is required to complete the signal system design. For WSDOT owned and operated signals, vehicle and pedestrian movement phase numbering is standardized to provide uniformity in signal phase numbering, signal display numbering, preemption channel identification, detection numbering, and circuit identification. For signals owned and operated by other jurisdictions, refer to that jurisdiction’s guidelines for phase and equipment numbering. The following are general guidelines for the WSDOT numbering system: 1. Phases 2 and 6 are normally assigned to the major street through movements, with phase 2 assigned to the northbound or eastbound direction of the major street. This results in phase 2 being aligned with the direction of increasing mileposts. 2. Phases 1 and 5 are normally assigned to the major street protected left-turn movements. 3. Phases 4 and 8 are normally assigned to the minor street through movements, with phase 4 normally assigned to the approach to the left of the phase 2 approach (as viewed from the phase 2 stop line). 4. Phases 3 and 7 are normally assigned to the minor street protected left-turn movements. 5. Phasing on new signals installed within an already signalized corridor should be assigned to match the existing corridor phasing – even if it doesn’t follow the standard phasing conventions listed above. 6. At T intersections, the movement on the stem of the T is normally assigned to either phase 4 or phase 8. Which phase is used will normally depend on the major street phase assignments. 7. At intersections where split phasing is used (opposing directions time separately) assign phases normally but show the split phase phasing diagram, unless otherwise directed by maintenance and operations staff. 8. Signal displays are numbered as follows: a. The first number indicates the signal phase, and the second number is the number of the signal head, counting from centerline (or left edge line) to the right edge line of the approach. For example, signal displays for phase 2 are numbered, as viewed from left to right, 21, 22, 23, and so on. If the display is an overlap, the designation is the letter assigned to that overlap. For example, signal displays for overlap A are number A1, A2, A3, and so on. b. If the display is protected/permissive, the display is numbered with the phase number of the through display followed by the phase number of the left-turn phase. For example, a protected/permissive signal display for phase 1 (the left-turn movement) and phase 6 (the compatible through movement) is numbered 61/11. For overlap right turns, the protected portion may either be an overlap phase, or it may be the same phase as the complementing left turn phase. 9. With a conventional protected/permissive left-turn display, the circular red, yellow, and green displays are connected to the through phase (phase 6, in this example) controller output and the steady yellow and green arrow displays are connected to the left turn phase (phase 1, in this example) controller output.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-10
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
10. When a flashing yellow arrow display is used, coordinate with the Signal Operations Engineer and signal maintenance group to determine appropriate wiring. For new cabinets, always specify an auxiliary output rack when protected/permissive phasing will be used. 11. Pedestrian displays and detectors are numbered with the first number indicating the signal phase and the second number as either an 8 or 9. For example, pedestrian displays and detectors 28 and 29 are assigned to phase 2. If there are more than two displays or detectors for a single pedestrian phase, use letter suffixes for additional displays and detectors (28A / 29A, 28B / 29B, etc.). 12. Vehicle detector numbering depends on the type of detection: a. Induction loop detectors use three-digit numbers for designation. The first number represents the phase. The second number represents the lane number, starting from the left lane and moving towards the right edge line. The third number represents the loop number counting from the stop line back. For example, detection loops for phase 2 detectors are numbered 211, 212, 213 for lane 1; 221, 222, 223 for lane 2; and so on. For loops tied together in series for a single detection channel, such as a three-loop series stop line detector, the individual loops in the series use a letter suffix. For a stop line detector in lane 1 for phase 2, using three loops in series, the loops would be designated 211A, 211B, and 211C. b. b. Video detectors are designated V#, where “#” is the through phase number for that approach, even if it will cover additional phases (such as left turn or overlap) for that approach. If the video detector is for advance detection, the suffix “A” is added. For example, the advance video detector for phase 6 would be V6A. Video detection zones may be drawn on the contract plans if desired, but these will normally be field established and adjusted and may not end up as shown in the plans. If used, video detection zones are labeled the same as loop detectors, but with a “V” suffix. For example, the stop line video detection zone for phase 5 would be 511V. c. Radar detectors are designated similar to video detectors but use an “R” prefix in place of the “V”. For example, the advance radar detector for phase 4 would be R4A. d. Wireless in pavement sensors use the same numbering scheme as induction loops but add a “W” suffix. For example, the phase 7 stop line sensor would be 711W. e. Exhibit 1360-6 shows examples of standard detector numbering. 13. Emergency vehicle detectors use letter designations: Channel A detectors cover phase 2 and phase 5; Channel B detectors cover phase 4 and phase 7; Channel C detectors cover phase 1 and phase 6; and Channel D detectors cover phase 3 and phase 8. When there are multiple detectors for the same channel, the first detector uses the letter, and all other detectors use a number suffix (C, C1, C2, etc.).

1330.04(3) Vehicle Signal Displays Signal displays are the devices used to convey right of way assignments and warnings from the signal controller to the motorists and pedestrians. When selecting display configurations and locations, the most important objective is the need to present these assignments and warnings to the motorists and pedestrians in a clear, concise, and uniform manner. The use of ball, steady arrow, or flashing yellow arrow displays is dependent upon the signal phasing. Use the approved signal phasing diagram to determine which display types can be used for which movements. Typical vehicle signal displays are shown in Exhibit 1330-7 through Exhibit 1330-14. In addition to the display requirements contained in the MUTCD, the following also apply: 1. A minimum of two indications for the through movement, if one exists at an intersection, must be provided - even if it is not the primary (predominant) movement. Provide a minimum of two indications for the major signalized turn movement of an intersection if no through movement exists, such as on the stem of a T intersection. These signal faces are to be spaced a minimum of 8 feet apart. At a T intersection, select the higher-volume movement as the primary movement and provide displays accordingly. A green left-turn arrow on a primary display and a green ball on the other primary display do not comply with this rule. At an intersection where left turns are prohibited, the leftmost through display may use a green up arrow in place of the green ball display. At an intersection where right turns are prohibited, the rightmost through display may use a green up arrow in place of the green ball display. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-12
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
2. All displays for an approach, regardless of phase served, are to be a minimum of 8 feet apart. 3. Locate displays directly overhead and centered over the associated lane of the applicable vehicular traffic as it moves through the intersection. (See Exhibit 1330-7 through Exhibit 1330-14 for signal head locations.) For intersections with a skew for through traffic, locate signal displays for through traffic in one of the following ways: a. Over the center of the outbound (far side) lane b. Over a line drawn between the center of the approaching lane and the center of the associated outbound lane, ending at the stop lines Left turn displays may either be located relative to the through displays or in line with approaching traffic, dependent on ability to mount the display(s). (See Exhibit 1330-15 for skew placement examples.) 4. Locate displays a minimum of 50 feet and a maximum of 180 feet from the stop line. The preferred location of the signal heads is between 60 and 120 feet from the stop line. When the nearest signal face is located between 150 and 180 feet beyond the stop line, engineering judgment of conditions, including worst-case visibility conditions, is to be used to determine whether the provision of a supplemental or nearside signal face would be beneficial. When it is not physically possible to locate displays at least 50 feet from the stop line, the distance to the displays may be reduced as follows: a. 3-section vertical and 5-section cluster (doghouse) displays may be located between 40 and 50 feet from the stop line. b. 4-section vertical displays may be located between 41 and 50 feet from the stop line. c. 5-section vertical displays may be located between 45 and 50 feet from the stop line. The distances listed above are the minimums required to maintain 16.5 feet of clearance over the roadway with a backplate installed. Overhead displays should always be located on the far side of the crossing roadway for the best visibility. Locating overhead displays on the near side of the roadway results in issues with visibility and driver compliance with stop lines. When an overhead display is located on the near side of the crossing roadway, the stop line typically has to be pushed back so that the minimum visibility distance is met. However, this also pushes the stop line back too far for drivers to see cross traffic, resulting in drivers creeping past the stop line towards the intersection – especially for turning traffic. This results in both the driver being stopped past the stop line and being unable to see the signal displays. For ramp meter signals, place Type RM signal standards and displays at the stop line. 5. Use vertical vehicle-signal display configurations. Horizontal displays are not allowed unless clearance requirements cannot be achieved with vertical displays or unless they are being installed at an intersection to match other displays in the intersection. Approval by the State Traffic Engineer is required for the installation of horizontal displays. 6. Use 12-inch signal sections for all vehicle displays except the lower display for a post mounted ramp meter signal.

Traffic Control Signals
7. Provide displays for turning movements with dedicated lanes as follows: a. For protected movements, use all arrow displays. b. For protected / permissive movements, use four section arrow displays. Alternatively, a shared five section cluster (doghouse) display may be used for both the turn lane and the adjacent through lane. Note: A three section arrow display, with bi-modal flashing yellow arrow / steady green arrow may be used in cases where windload or vertical roadway clearance will not allow for the use of a four-section display. If vertical clearance can be provided through adjustments to the signal display mount, such as mounting the Type M mount between different display sections, a four-section arrow display should be used. c. For permissive right turns, a three-section arrow display with flashing yellow arrow (Exhibit 1330-13) is optional. This display is highly recommended where there are concerns regarding permissive right turns and the conflicting pedestrian crossing movement, such as known incidents or high volumes of both pedestrian crossings and right turn movements. 8. Use steady green arrow indications only when the associated movement is completely protected from conflict with other vehicular and pedestrian movements. This includes conflict with a permissive left-turn movement. At T intersections, steady green arrow displays may not be used for a movement that has a conflicting pedestrian movement. 9. Use either Type M or Type N mountings for vehicle display mountings on mast arms, as directed by the region maintenance staff or owning agency. Provide only one type of mounting for each signal system. Mixing mounting types at an intersection is not acceptable except for supplemental displays mounted on the signal standard shaft. 10. Use backplates for all overhead-mounted displays for new, updated, or rebuilt signal faces. Add backplates to all existing signal displays that do not already have them. 11. Use Type E mountings for pedestrian displays mounted on signal standard shafts unless otherwise approved by region maintenance staff or the owning agency. 12. Include supplemental signal displays when the approach is in a horizontal or vertical curve and the intersection visibility requirements of this section and the MUTCD cannot be met, unless approved otherwise by the region Traffic Engineer. Supplemental far side displays are recommended at intersections with higher truck volumes, as the trucks will frequently block visibility of overhead displays for following drivers. Supplemental far side protected left turn displays are recommended for long left turns.

At signalized intersections with railroad preemption, install blankout signs for turning movements that do not have a dedicated signal display (3-section arrow display). Blankout signs are 36” x 36” and will display either a No Right Turn symbol (R3-1) or No Left Turn symbol (R3-2) when activated, as appropriate. Blankout signs should be placed the same as equivalent static signs.
1330.04(4) Pedestrian Equipment Pedestrian equipment consists of pedestrian signal displays and pedestrian detectors (pushbuttons). New signal systems are required to use countdown displays and Accessible Pedestrian Signal (APS) pushbuttons. See Section 1330.04(4)(a) for pedestrian display and detection requirements for existing signal systems. No intersection may have a mix of APS and non-APS pushbuttons, nor may any intersection have a mix of countdown and non-countdown pedestrian displays. Pedestrian displays are required to be installed with the bottom of the display housing no less than 7 feet or more than 10 feet above the sidewalk surface. Pedestrian displays are required to be installed to provide maximum visibility at the beginning of the controlled crosswalks. To accomplish this, pedestrian displays should be located no more than 5 feet from the outside edge of the crosswalk, as measured on a line perpendicular to the crosswalk centerline (See Exhibit 1330-17). This distance may be increased up to a maximum of 10 feet from the outside edge of the crosswalk if physical constraints prevent the display from being placed no more than 5 feet from the outside edge of the crosswalk.

Exhibit 1330-17 Pedestrian Display Placement Requirements
Pedestrian pushbuttons (PPBs) are required to be located within a certain distance of the crosswalk being served and oriented such that the sign on the pushbutton is parallel to the crosswalk served. Pedestrian pushbutton location requirements are as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
The PPB setback distance is measured from one of the following: o The face of curb, where sidewalk or curb is present. o The edge line of the roadway, where there is no sidewalk or curb present. o Or the edge of pavement, where there is no edge line, sidewalk, or curb present. The preferred PPB setback distance is 6 feet but may be increased up to a maximum 10 feet. Contact the HQ Traffic Office if the PPB setback distance cannot be kept to 10 feet or less. The minimum PPB setback distance is 4 feet. If a planter strip or similar buffer strip is present, with justification, the minimum PPB setback may be reduced to 1.5 feet from the curb face or edge line. The PPB setback distance shall not be less than 1.5 feet. The PPB should be located as close to the outside edge of the crosswalk line as possible, so that for APS PPBs, the button and sign face towards the core of the intersection, rather than back down the adjacent approaching roadway. The PPB may be located no more than 5 feet outside either edge of the crosswalk line. If possible, PPBs should be located on separate poles and be separated by a minimum of 10 feet. See Exhibit 1330-18 for recommended and allowed PPB placement locations.

Exhibit 1330-18 PPB Placement Requirements
PPBs are required to be located so that the actual button, not just the assembly, is within 9 inches horizontally of a level all-weather surface (generally sidewalk or paved road shoulder) as described in Chapter 1510. To accomplish this, certain criteria must be met depending on the type of pole upon which the pushbutton is installed: a. For vertical shaft poles (Type PPB, PS, I, FB, or RM), the center of the pole shall be no more than 9 inches from the edge of the level clear space. The pushbutton shall not be oriented more than 90 degrees from facing the level clear space. (See Exhibit 1330-19.) b. For larger signal standards (Type II, III, IV, IV, or SD), the button must face the level clear space, with the edge of the pole baseplate no more than 6 inches from the edge of the level clear space. It is recommended that the pole either be in the sidewalk, or the edge of the pole base plate be installed as close to the back of sidewalk as possible. (See Exhibit 1330-20.) Some minor rotation of the button on the pole is possible, but even smaller angles may quickly exceed the allowed reach limit – particularly on larger poles. 60-inch by 36-inch clear space shown in Exhibit 1330-19 and Exhibit 1330-20 for reference only – see Section 1510.12(1)(b) for clear space requirements.

60-inch by 36-inch clear space shown in Exhibit 1330-19 and Exhibit 1330-20 for reference only – see Section 1510.12(1)(b) for clear space requirements. In all cases, it is recommended that the pole be installed in the sidewalk for maximum accessibility. However, the pole and the pushbutton itself are obstructions and must not encroach upon the required minimum pedestrian access route widths (see Chapter 1510). PPBs are required to be installed at 42 inches above the level clear space, as measured to the center of the actual button. Existing pushbuttons do not require a height adjustment if the center of the actual button is within a range of 36 to 48 inches above the level clear space. Where there is a median or center island with a pedestrian refuge, consult with signal operations to determine if a pushbutton should be installed in the pedestrian refuge area. This may be justified for locations with particularly long crossings or slower moving pedestrians. For WSDOT owned systems, pedestrian signal equipment may not be installed on light standards. Do not install pedestrian signal equipment on light standards for systems owned by other jurisdictions unless directed to do so by that jurisdiction.
1330.04(4)(a) Accessible Pedestrian Signals and Countdown Pedestrian Displays Accessible Pedestrian Signals consist of a pedestrian pushbutton with integrated vibro-tactile and audible versions of the visual indications presented by pedestrian signal displays. APS are required at any location with a pedestrian display – even if there was no pedestrian detection previously.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-27
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
This is due to the requirement to provide non-visual indication of the pedestrian phase. All new construction traffic signals are required to include APS. Countdown pedestrian displays are displays which use a combination of an overlapping person (walk) and hand (don’t walk) indication and an adjacent two-digit countdown timer display. The timer counts down the seconds remaining in the pedestrian clearance phase (flashing don’t walk). For WSDOT owned traffic signals, all new construction traffic signals are required to include countdown pedestrian displays. For new construction traffic signals owned by other jurisdictions, countdown pedestrian displays are required unless directed otherwise by the owning jurisdiction. For existing signalized intersections where pedestrian equipment was not previously installed, the installation of APS and countdown pedestrian displays is required for the entire intersection. This may require new or relocated poles, as well as additional ramp and sidewalk work beyond that necessary for basic sidewalk and ramp ADA compliance. At signalized intersections with existing pedestrian equipment, the following criteria determine when APS pushbuttons and countdown pedestrian displays shall be installed: 1. The following are considered minor signal upgrades, and do not require the installation of APS pushbuttons or countdown pedestrian displays at that intersection: a. Where pushbuttons are only being adjusted in height or orientation. b. Where pushbuttons are being relocated on a single corner, including to a new pole, and no other work (including sidewalk or ramp work) is taking place at any other corner, pushbuttons may be relocated or replaced with the same type of pushbutton as currently exists at that intersection. Countdown pedestrian displays are not required to be installed at that intersection. New pole location(s) must meet accessibility requirements for pedestrian pushbuttons (see Section 1510.11). Accessibility for any affected poles must be evaluated for both existing pushbuttons and future APS pushbuttons. 2. The following types of work shall include the installation of APS pushbuttons and countdown pedestrian displays as described below: a. At any signalized intersection included in a project that is designated as an alteration project, as defined in Section 1510.03(2): i. For WSDOT owned traffic signal systems, install APS pushbuttons and countdown displays. For any project which has completed its scoping phase before August 1, 2018, consult with your ASDE to determine if APS pushbuttons and countdown pedestrian displays can be added to the project – documentation is not required if the project cannot support the expanded scope of work. ii. For traffic signal systems owned by other agencies, install APS pushbuttons and countdown displays if funded by the owning agency. b. At any signalized intersection where APS pushbuttons are being installed in response to a public request, replace all pushbuttons and pedestrian displays with APS pushbuttons and countdown pedestrian displays at that intersection. Additional poles may be required, and ramp and sidewalk work may be necessary to support access to new APS locations / orientations.

Traffic Control Signals
c. For any other project, not previously described, which requires traffic signal system work affecting pedestrian pushbuttons, replace all pushbuttons and pedestrian displays with APS pushbuttons and countdown pedestrian displays. This may require additional ramp and sidewalk work to provide required accessibility to and for APS locations / orientations beyond that already required for other ADA compliance efforts. APS pushbuttons are required to include the following features: 1. Audible and vibrotactile indications of the WALK interval. 2. A locator tone which operates only during the DON’T WALK and flashing DON’T WALK intervals. 3. A tactile arrow on the pushbutton (control surface) indicating the crossing direction served. This arrow must be high contrast with the rest of the button – either light on dark or dark on light. 4. An integral 9” x 15” R10-3e sign. 5. If additional crossing time will be provided as part of an extended press feature, a supplemental R10-32P sign is required to be installed adjacent to or integral with the APS PPB.
1330.04(5) Signal Standards (Supports) Signal standards consist of five main types of supports: Vertical Steel Shaft, Cantilevered Steel Mast Arm, Steel Strain Pole, Wood Strain Pole, and Signal Bridge. The type of support selected will depend on required placement of vehicle signal displays and the ability of the support to reach that location. The MUTCD states that the preferred location for signal displays is overhead on the far side of the intersection. Signal displays may also be mounted to bridges where clearance will not allow an alternate signal standard type. Installation on bridges requires approval of both the region Traffic Engineer and the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. Signal Standards shall be considered in the following order of preference: 1. Cantilevered Steel Mast Arm. These are the standard support type for permanent systems and should be used whenever possible. Mast arm installations are preferred because they generally provide better placement of the signal displays, greater stability for signal displays in high-wind areas, and reduced maintenance costs. Mast arm lengths are limited to 65 feet from center of pole to farthest display mount – if additional length is needed, an alternate support type must be used. 2. Span Wire System (Steel or Wood Strain Poles). These systems may be used when displays are needed at a greater distance than a mast arm system can support, or if a system is expected to be in place for less than 5 years. Steel poles are required to be used for permanent signal systems. Temporary signal systems (systems to be removed under the same contract as installation) may use wood poles. The use of wood poles beyond the end of a contract or for longer than 5 years requires the approval of the region Traffic Engineer. Individual spans have a limit of 150 feet – longer spans require design by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. 3. Signal Bridge. Signal bridges shall only be used when no other alternative can physically be installed, and support displays in the required locations. Diagonal signal bridges may not be used for WSDOT signal systems – only signal bridges across a single approach may be used. Diagonal signal bridges are extremely difficult to maintain and result in displays being too close to at least one of the two cross streets, resulting in poor display visibility, and any structural failure will result in the loss of the entire signal system, rather than just one or two directions. Single Point Urban Interchanges (SPUIs) where a signal bridge is required across the center of the intersection are not considered a diagonal span and may be used.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-29
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
4. Vertical Steel Shaft. Vertical steel shaft supports should only be used for supplemental vehicle displays or pedestrian equipment. In special cases (such as in a small historic town), vertical steel shaft supports may be used without overhead signal displays if approved by the region Traffic Engineer, as allowed by the MUTCD. Justification shall be provided for the use of vertical steel shaft signals without any overhead signal displays, as displays are too easily obstructed from view. When placing signal standards, the primary consideration is the visibility of signal faces. Place the signal supports as far as feasible from the edge of the traveled way without adversely affecting signal visibility. (The MUTCD provides additional guidance on locating signal supports.) Initially, lay out the location for supports for vehicle display systems, pedestrian detection systems, and pedestrian display systems independently to determine the optimal location for each type of support. Consider the need for future right-turn lanes or intersection widening when choosing the final location of the signal standards. Poles should also be located outside of sight triangles for turning traffic. See Section 1600.03(2)(e) for more information and documentation requirements. If conditions allow and optimal locations are not compromised, pedestrian displays and pedestrian detectors can be installed on the vehicular display supports. However, pole placement cannot encroach on pedestrian access route or maneuvering space requirements. Pole mounted appurtenances, such as pushbuttons, terminal cabinets, and displays, need to be taken into consideration regarding their encroachment into accessible spaces. Another important consideration that can influence the position of signal standards is the presence of overhead and underground utilities. Verify the location of these lines during the preliminary design stage to avoid costly changes during construction: a. Underground Utilities: Underground utilities must be located, marked, and surveyed. If any underground utility is within 10 feet of any foundation, consider potholing for the utility to find its actual location. Field locates are rarely precise and must be verified if a potential conflict exists. b. Overhead Utilities: Signal standards may be located within close proximity to overhead communications lines (phone, cable, fiber-optic), but the lines should not touch the any part of the signal system and should not pass in front of any displays. Overhead power lines require a minimum 10-foot circumferential clearance for lines rated at 50kV (50,000 V) or below, including the neutral. For lines rated over 50kV, the minimum clearance is 10 feet plus 0.4 inches for each kV over 50kV. Overhead utilities may have to be relocated if a suitable location for signal equipment cannot be found. Once pole locations have been selected, a soils investigation is required to determine the lateral bearing pressure, the friction angle of the soil, and whether groundwater may be encountered. Standard foundations may be used if the soil lateral bearing pressure is at least 1,000 psf, the friction angle is at least 17°, and the ground slope is 2H:1V or flatter. Standard foundation information is found in the Standard Plans, and depends on the type of support system being used. Special foundation designs are required if the soil lateral bearing pressure is less than 1,000 psf, the friction angle is less than 17°, or the ground slope is steeper than 2H:1V. The region materials group works with the HQ Materials Laboratory to determine the bearing pressure and friction angle of the soil at the proposed foundation locations. If soils do not meet these minimum values for lateral bearing pressure and friction angle, the signal standard charts and soil conditions report (summary of geotechnical conditions for foundations) must be forwarded to the HQ Bridge and Structures Office with a request for special foundation design. The HQ Bridge and Structures Office designs foundations for the regions and reviews designs submitted by others.

Traffic Control Signals
Where poles are installed on structures, the anchorage must be designed by the Bridge designer. Coordinate with the Bridge designer for placement and design of pole anchorages on structures. Do not place any signal standard in a median area. The sole exception is a Type PS or Type PPB signal standard as required for median refuge areas for pedestrians. Coordinate with all stakeholders (Maintenance, Signal Operations, Civil Design Engineer, Drainage Engineer, and so on) in the placement of signal equipment to avoid any possible conflicts. Arrange field reviews with the appropriate stakeholders as necessary.
1330.04(5)(a) Mast Arm Signal Standards and Foundation Design Mast arm signal standards are designated by the following types:
•
•
•
Type II: Single mast arm with no luminaire mount. Type III: Single mast arm with luminaire mount. Type SD: Double mast arm, with or without luminaire mount.
Mast arm signal standards are normally located on the far-right corner of the intersection from approaching traffic. A typical mast arm signal standard only has one mast arm, however two may be used. If the angle between the two arms is not exactly 90 degrees, the design must be sent to the bridge and structures office. In most cases, two arms at 90 degrees can support the necessary display positioning. Additionally, signal standards on mast arms may be rotated up to 30 degrees from center. Do not allow a mast arm for one direction to cross in front of the mast arm for a different direction if possible, as it results in a visual obstruction of the signal displays. Where two double arm signal standards are installed on opposite corners, the preferred location for the two poles are the far-right corners of the mainline roadway. This way, the mast arms for the mainline traffic will not cross in front of each other. Mast arm signal standards have a typical arm attachment point of 18 to 20 feet in height. This height range needs to be taken into consideration when placing signal displays in order to ensure that the display height requirements shown in Section 1330.04(3) are met. The attachment point height may be adjusted throughout this range as necessary but increments of 0.5 feet are recommended for ease of fabrication. Connection points outside of this range are a special design and require design support from the Bridge and Structures Office. Mast arm signal standards are designed based on the total wind load moment on the mast arm. The moment is a function of the surface area of each appurtenance (signal display or sign), X * Y, and the distance between the vertical centerline of each appurtenance and the vertical centerline of the signal pole Z. This determines the total wind load moment, referred to as an XYZ value and measured in cubic feet, which is used to select the appropriate mast arm fabrication plan and foundation design. Preapproved mast arm fabrication plans are available at https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/all-manuals-and-standards/plan-sheetlibrary/illumination-signals-and-its, and will be listed in the Contract Provisions. To determine the XYZ value for a signal standard, the XYZ value of each appurtenance must be calculated. These values are then totaled to determine the overall XYZ value for the signal standard. For signal standards with two mast arms at 90 degrees apart, the larger of the two XYZ values calculated for each mast arm is used for the overall pole XYZ value. When determining the XYZ values, use the worst-case scenarios for signal display and sign placements. All signal displays and mast arm-mounted signs, including street name signs, must be included in this calculation. Emergency preemption detectors, preemption indicator lights, cameras, and radar detectors are negligible and are not included in determining the XYZ values. For mast arm-mounted signs, use the actual sign area (in square feet) to determine the XYZ value.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-31
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
For poles with luminaire supports, the luminaire and arm are also included in the total XYZ calculation. Surface areas for vehicle displays are shown in Exhibit 1330-21. Signs are limited in size as follows:
•
•
•
Street name signs may be a maximum of 36 inches in height and 36 square feet in total area. Design the mast arm to support the widest sign that will fit within these limits (up to 144 inches wide), regardless of the actual sign size needed. This allows for future changes to the street name sign. Street name signs are mounted such that the edge of the pole is no less than 1 foot but no more than 2.5 feet from the vertical pole centerline, as shown in the Standard Plans. Use the offset necessary for the largest possible sign in the signal standard chart for the XYZ value, but refer to the Standard Plans for actual sign installation requirements using construction notes in the Contract Plans. Other mast arm mounted signs may not exceed 36 inches in height and 7.5 square feet in area. Signs mounted on the vertical pole may not exceed 36 inches in width and 15 square feet in area. These signs are not included in the XYZ calculation.
After calculating the total XYZ value, adjust the total XYZ value as follows: If the total XYZ value is less than or equal to 2850 ft3, round the XYZ value up to the next standard foundation XYZ value or 2850 ft3, whichever is lower, to determine the design XYZ value. The design XYZ builds in some flexibility for future modifications.
•
If the total XYZ value exceeds 2850 ft3, use the calculated XYZ value. There is limited opportunity for future increased wind load when the XYZ value exceeds 2850 ft3.

After the total XYZ value is determined, if a standard foundation may be used, select the correct foundation depths for the XYZ values from the table in the Standard Plans, using the next higher total XYZ value. For WSDOT systems, only the 700, 1350, 1900, 2600, and 3000 columns may be used. All five foundation options should be provided unless there is a known constraint preventing the use of one of the options, such as insufficient space for 4 ft diameter foundation or expected loose soil requiring the use of the Alternate 2 foundation construction.
1330.04(5)(b) Span Wire Signal Standards and Foundation Design Span Wire Systems use poles and aerial wires to support signal displays, signs, and emergency preemption equipment. Cameras, radar detectors, and street name signs are installed on the vertical strain poles. When laying out span wires, the preferred layout is similar to mast arm supports. Displays for an approach should be installed on a span on the far side of the intersection, with poles on the two far corners. Do not use diagonal spans unless absolutely necessary, as they are extremely difficult to maintain and if the wire is broken, the entire signal system is lost and blocks the entire intersection, rather than the equipment for only one approach. Span wire signal standards include both steel and timber strain poles. Steel and timber strain poles are designated by pole class, which is based on the horizontal tension load the pole will support. The loads and resultant forces imposed on strain poles are calculated and a pole class greater than that load is specified. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-32
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
Steel Pole Classes and their allowed tension loads are listed in the Standard Plans. Exhibit 1330-22 lists the pole classes and tension loading available for timber strain poles. Headquarters Traffic and Headquarters Bridge and Structures office support is required for determining span tension load and pole classes. Provide the pole and span layout, the locations and sizes of all signal displays and span wire mounted signs, and the soils report. Span wire mounted signs are limited to a maximum of 36 inches in height and 7.5 square feet in area. Emergency preemption equipment locations do not need to be submitted, as they are not included in load calculations. Spans should not exceed 150 feet, if possible, in order to reduce the complexity of the design. After the pole classes are provided by the Headquarters Bridge and Structures office, select the appropriate foundation information from the Standard Plans using the pole classes and soil conditions. If a standard foundation cannot be used, a foundation design will be provided along with the pole class information. Exhibit 1330-22 Timber Strain Pole Classes Pole Class

1330.04(5)(c) Special Case Signal Supports Special case signal supports include signal bridges and structure (typically bridge) mounts. These should only be selected if absolutely necessary, as they are difficult to design, construct, and maintain, and they frequently result in signal display locations that are difficult for drivers to see. Use of these types of supports requires approval from the Headquarters Traffic Office. Signal bridges function the same as a diagonal span wire system, with the two supports on opposite corners of the intersection. Signal bridges require windload calculations similar to mast arm signal standards, so display and sign locations and offsets must be provided. Signal bridge foundations must be designed by the Headquarters Bridge and Structures office. Signal displays and other equipment may be installed on structures when there is insufficient clearance below the structure to allow for a different type of signal support. Coordinate with the Bridge designer to place mounts and determine routing paths for conduit and wiring out of the structure. Structure mounts are not desirable, as they typically cannot be modified without reconstruction of the structure itself, and any equipment embedded in the structure is inaccessible after the structure is complete. Signal displays may not be installed on sign structures such as cantilever sign structures or sign bridges. Signal displays also may not be installed on railroad cantilever structures unless the signal system and the railroad are owned by the same jurisdiction and maintained by the same staff.

Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
1330.04(5)(d) Vertical Steel Shaft Supports Vertical steel shaft supports include the following types of signal standards: a) Type PPB: Sometimes referred to as a “stub pole”, this pole is typically 5 feet tall and 3 inches in diameter. It is used strictly to support pedestrian pushbuttons. Due to the frequency of damage, regardless of location, it is recommended that breakaway bases always be used. b) Type PS, I, RM, and FB: These poles are effectively identical, with the difference being the total height to the slipfitter top. o Type PS are 8 ft tall and may only have pedestrian displays mounted on the top. o Type I are 10 ft tall and may have vehicle displays mounted on the top and pedestrian displays mounted on the side. Type RM are identical to Type I but are used for ramp meter systems only. o Type FB are 14 feet tall and may be used like Type I when additional height is needed for the vehicle display(s). Placement of vertical steel shaft supports will depend on visibility requirements for displays and accessibility requirements of pedestrian features. Generally, these supports should be located at back of sidewalk, as they are farther from traffic and more likely to be out of both the pedestrian access route and the path of any users. Fixed bases should be used when located at the back of sidewalk but slip bases may be used if circumstances recommend it. Supports located within sidewalk (includes planter strips) or in locations with only paved shoulders should always use slip bases.
1330.04(6) Vehicle Detection Systems Vehicle detection systems are necessary for the efficient operation of traffic signals. By responding to the presence of traffic, signal systems do not have to use fixed timing. This improves efficiency by removing unnecessary delay and not providing service to an approach or movement with no traffic.
1330.04(6)(a) Vehicle Detection Zone Placement The vehicle detection system at a traffic-actuated signal installation provides the control unit with information regarding the presence or movement of vehicles, including motorcycles and bicycles. Vehicle detection systems perform two basic functions: queue clearance and the termination of phases. Depending on the specific intersection characteristics, either of these functions can take priority. The merits of each function are considered, and a compromise might be necessary. There are two basic types of detection zones: stop bar and advance. Stop bar detection is a zone that extends from the stop line to a point 30 to 40 feet in advance of that location. Advance detection is a discrete zone (or zones) placed in advance of the stop line at a distance dependent on vehicle speed. Basic vehicle detection requirements depend upon the speeds of the approaching vehicles: a) When the posted speed is below 35 mph, provide stop bar detection or one advance detection zone. See Exhibit 1330-23 for advance detection zone distances. b) When the posted speed is at or above 35 MPH, provide stop bar detection and at least two advance detection zones. Multiple advance detection zones are normally required to adequately provide decision zone detection.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-34
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
c) Side street advance detection is not required for WSDOT owned signal systems but may be provided through means that do not require equipment to be installed off of WSDOT right of way. For signals owned by other jurisdictions, the use of side street advance detection is at the discretion of the owning jurisdiction. For posted speeds of 35 MPH or higher, there are two options for placing advance detectors to address the decision zone: 1. Fixed locations based on posted speed, which is generally the 85th percentile speed. Place loops according to the table in Exhibit 1330-23. 2. Calculated locations based on calculated decision zone detection design. This design increases the opportunity for a range of vehicles from the 90th percentile speed vehicle to the 10th percentile speed vehicle to either clear the intersection or decelerate to a complete stop before reaching the intersection. The method of calculating the decision zone and the required detection loops is shown in Exhibit 1330-24. Although the exhibits reference loops, advance detectors may be of any approved type. For new intersection construction where there is no existing traffic, the fixed locations based on posted (target design) speed are to be used. Fixed locations based on posted speed use the same methods as the calculated decision zone detection design but set V90 at 5 MPH above posted speed and V10 at 5 MPH below posted speed. Engineering judgment based on similar intersections (such as geometrics and traffic volumes) may justify modifying the V90 and V10 speeds used in the calculation, with concurrence from the region Signal Operations Engineer. Both methods require a study of the approach speeds at the intersection. For intersection approaches, conduct the speed study as follows:
•
•
•
•
Collect data at the approximate location or just upstream of the decision zone; Collect data during off-peak hours in free-flow and favorable weather conditions; Collect data during regular commuting hours in a high-volume signalized corridor during favorable weather conditions Only document the speed of the lead vehicle in each platoon.
It is important that the person conducting the speed study remain inconspicuous, so they do not influence drivers to slow down. Normal driving patterns are needed for proper speed studies. Prior speed-study information obtained at this location may be used if it is less than 18 months old and driving conditions have not changed significantly in the area. Preserve detection zone placements and any supporting calculations as required by Section 1330.07 Documentation.

Traffic Control Signals
1330.04(6)(b) Vehicle Detector Types There are two basic categories of vehicle detectors:
•
•
Non-Invasive: These are detectors installed outside of the roadway, typically overhead in a strategic location. These include camera (optical and infra-red) and radar systems. In-Pavement: These are detectors which are installed in the road itself. These include induction loops and wireless in-pavement sensors.
Non-invasive detection is generally recommended over in-pavement detection, due to the ability to revise noninvasive detection at any time and the ease of installation, repair, and replacement – particularly when supporting traffic control and impacts are taken into account. Additionally, pavement damage due to regular wear or construction activities will disable in-pavement detection, whereas non-invasive detectors will continue to function, and can even be adjusted to support revised lane configurations. Stop line detection should use non-invasive systems for detection. Although induction loop detectors are typically the most reliable for detecting cars and trucks, they do not consistently detect bicycles and motorcycles. RCW 47.36.025 specifically requires that vehicle-activated traffic control signals be capable of detecting motorcycles and bicycles. Advanced detection may be either non-invasive or in-pavement, as these improve efficiency of the signal systems but are not as critical as stop line detection. Non-invasive detection is recommended for posted speeds of 45 MPH or lower, as they are currently only effective for up to about 600 feet from the location of the detector. The advantage is that advance detection can be installed at the intersection, rather than trenching long distances to place advanced detectors in pavement. For speeds over 45 MPH, non-invasive detection systems may be considered, but in-pavement systems will probably be more effective. Advance detection does not need to detect bicycles. Selection of detector types will depend on a variety of environmental factors and locations available for placement. 1. Radar Detectors Radar detectors are located on either the signal mast arms or the signal vertical strain poles, depending on lane configuration, detector type, and location availability. Radar detectors are not affected by weather and are typically minimally affected by mast arm motion in high wind. Consult the detector manufacturer’s installation guidance for placement details. One detector can normally cover all lanes of an approach for that type of detection (stop line or advance). 2. Video Detectors Placement of video detectors depends on the function of the detector. Both infra-red and optical cameras are available, but WSDOT systems may not use optical cameras due to the adverse effects of rain, snow, fog, sun glare, and sharp shadows on their effectiveness. Infra-red cameras may still be affected by heavy fog or other major thermal events, but it is more of a rare occurrence than with optical cameras. All video detection may be affected by mast arm motion due to high winds. 3. Exhibit 1330-25 provides placement examples. Stop line detectors should be installed on the same mast arm as the vehicle displays for that approach. The detector should be placed on an extension of the wide line between the left turn and through lanes, if present; if there is no wide line, the detector should be centered on the through lanes. One detector can cover all lanes of an approach for that type of detection (stop line or advance). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-38
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
Advance detectors should be installed on a luminaire arm, preferably on the adjacent corner to the approaching lanes, as the effectiveness of the advance detection depends on height. Consider requiring a luminaire arm even if no luminaire is needed, in order to provide an optimal installation site for the detector. Advance detectors may be installed on a mast arm but will typically have less effective range. Both infra-red and optical cameras are available, but WSDOT systems may not use optical cameras due to the adverse effects of rain, snow, fog, sun glare, and sharp shadows on their effectiveness. Infra-red cameras may still be affected by heavy fog or other major thermal events, but it is more of a rare occurrence than with optical cameras. All video detection may be affected by mast arm motion due to high winds.

3. Induction Loops Induction Loops are coils of wire in the roadway that use the magnetic properties of vehicles to detect them. Induction loops can last a very long time when undisturbed. However, induction loops require bicycles to be in a very specific location in order to be detected and may not detect carbon fiber bicycles. Induction loops must be installed with one per lane per detection zone – stop line WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-40
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
loops may be larger or series loops. Where induction loops are used, loops need to be numbered in order to keep track of the wiring and lanes they are detecting. See Section 1330.04(2) for detector numbering requirements. 4. Wireless In-Pavement Sensors Wireless in-pavement sensors are compact detectors installed in pavement and use either radar or magnetics to detect vehicles. They use a wireless connection to the signal cabinet. The sensors rely on a battery for operation and require replacement of the entire unit when they fail. Sensor placement is similar to induction loops – one per lane per detection zone. The magnetic versions are subject to the same difficulties with bicycles as loop detectors. All wireless sensors are also subject to various factors that affect wireless signals such as range, signal obstructions, and possible signal interference from other radios depending on the frequency used. Non-invasive detectors are preferred with concrete (Portland cement concrete pavement) roadway surfaces. Inpavement detectors installed in concrete panels typically cannot be revised or replaced until all affected concrete panels are replaced. In-pavement detectors installed in bridge decks must be installed when the bridge deck is constructed and cannot be replaced unless the bridge deck is replaced. Non-invasive detection is also useful for approaches where advance detection is desired, but the approach is outside the jurisdiction of the agency that owns the signal, or for non-standard approaches such as driveways. Temporary detection should be installed for all stop lines where existing detection will be disabled or ineffective (such as lane shifts) during construction. Temporary advance detection is recommended for 45 MPH or higher approaches where the decision zone detection will be disconnected for an extended period of time. Consult with the Signal Operations Engineer to determine if temporary advance detection should be used. Temporary advance detection zone placement should take into account any temporary speed limit revisions.
1330.04(7) Preemption Systems 1330.04(7)(a) Emergency Vehicle Preemption Emergency vehicle preemption (EVP) is required for all traffic signals unless approved otherwise by the region Traffic Engineer. WSDOT is responsible for installing EVP detection equipment at new and rebuilt signalized intersections on state highways. At existing signalized intersections that do not have EVP detection equipment, or where an emergency service agency requests additional equipment beyond the basic required equipment, the emergency service agency is responsible for all material and installation costs. The emergency service agency is responsible for preemption emitters in all cases. Optically activated EVP systems are used to ensure compatibility with all area emergency service agency emitters. Approval by the State Traffic Engineer is required for the installation of any other type of emergency vehicle preemption system. Locate optical detectors facing each approach to the intersection – only one detector per approach – with a clear view of the approaching roadway. Detectors have a cone of vision of approximately 8 degrees, and an effective range of 200 to 2500 feet. Detectors should have an unobstructed view of the approach for a minimum of 1800 feet. Primary detectors are normally installed on the same support as the vehicle displays for that approach. Place the detector between the left turn lane and through lane displays on approaches with left turn lanes, or centered on the approaching lanes where left turn lanes are absent.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-41
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
When the approach is in a horizontal or vertical curve, or there are other sight obstructions, non-standard placement of the primary detector or additional supplemental detectors may be necessary. Primary detectors may be located on other signal display supports (arms or spans) or vertical strain poles, depending on visibility requirements. Supplemental detectors may also be located on separate Type I or Type FB poles in advance of the intersection. On higher speed roadways, supplemental detectors can provide extended detection range – one mile in advance of the intersection is usually sufficient. Preserve any documentation associated with the EVP system, including system type selected and any associated agreements or approvals, as required by Section 1330.07 Documentation.
1330.04(7)(b) Railroad Preemption Railroad preemption is used when a railroad is in close proximity to a signalized intersection. If railroad tracks are within 1/4 mile of a signalized intersection, then a Railroad Crossing Evaluation Team is formed to determine the need (if any) for railroad preemption, interconnection, simultaneous preemption, advanced preemption, and so on. The Railroad Crossing Evaluation Team should consist of region and HQ Signal Design Engineers, region and HQ Signal Operations Engineers, HQ Railroad Liaison, HQ Rail Office representative, region Utilities Engineer, region Traffic Design Engineer, region Maintenance Superintendent, and the affected railroad representative. Where the signal is owned, operated, or maintained by a local agency, a local agency representative should also be included. The Railroad Crossing Evaluation Team will determine what design considerations are needed at all signalized intersections near railroad crossings. For locations where the railroad tracks are located greater than 500 feet from the signalized intersection, and it can be demonstrated that the 95% maximum queue length(s) will not extend to within 200 feet of the tracks, railroad preemption may be omitted with the approval of the Railroad Crossing Evaluation Team. Include the demonstration and approval in the documentation required by Section 1330.07 Documentation. Railroad preemption and interconnection are recommended when any of the following conditions occurs:
•
•
•
•
The distance from the stop bar to the nearest rail is less than or equal to 200 feet. There is no dedicated left turn lane and the distance from the stop bar to the nearest rail is less than or equal to 500 feet. The 95% maximum queue lengths from the intersection stop bar are projected to cross the tracks. (Use a queue arrival/departure study or a traffic analysis “micro-simulation model” to determine 95% maximum queue lengths.) The 95% maximum queue lengths from the railroad are projected to affect an upstream traffic signal. (Use a queue arrival/departure study or a traffic analysis “micro-simulation model” to determine 95% maximum queue lengths.)
If it is determined that advanced preemption is needed, the HQ and region Signal Operations Engineers will calculate the amount of railroad preemption time required using the WSDOT Railroad-Traffic Signal Preemption Timing Worksheet.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-42
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
The addition of a pre-signal is recommended when any of the following conditions occurs:
•
•
•
The distance from the stop bar to the nearest rail is less than 88 feet but is at least 40 feet. (For reference, the 88 feet is derived from: the longest design vehicle permitted by statute (75 feet) + front overhang (3 feet) + rear overhang (4 feet) + downstream clear storage (6 feet)). The distance from the stop bar to the nearest rail is > 88 feet and < 120 feet and there are no gates for the railroad crossing. The sight distance triangle in Chapter 1350, Exhibit 1350-1 (Sight Distance at Railroad Crossing), cannot be met, and the railroad crossing does not have active control (lights or gates).
When pre-signals are used, two stop lines are used: one for the rail crossing, and one for the intersection. The pre-signal displays stop traffic at the rail crossing stop line, and the second set of signal displays stop traffic at the intersection. Use louvers on the intersection displays so that they are not visible from the stop line for the rail crossing. Optically programmed displays may be used in place of louvers, but are not recommended due to the limited benefits, complexity of installation and maintenance, and high cost. Where the distance between the normal location for the stop bar and the approach is less than 40 feet, the same stop bar should be used for both the traffic signal and the rail crossing. Install vehicle displays on the near side of the intersection, but on the far side of the tracks from the stop line, to improve visibility and discourage drivers from stopping between the tracks and the intersection. Do not install vehicle displays on the far side of the intersection. Exhibit 1330-26 shows examples of the distances and typical system layouts referenced above. The Railroad Crossing Evaluation Team has final review and approval authority for all PS&E documents for signal design and operation at all signalized intersections near railroad crossings. All documentation associated with railroad preemption and a memo with each team member’s concurrence with the PS&E documents must be preserved as required by Section 1330.07 Documentation.

1330.04(7)(c) Transit Priority Preemption Transit Priority Preemption allows for transit operations to influence signal timing, similar to emergency vehicle preemption. This can be included in mobility projects, but the transit agency assumes all costs for providing, installing, and maintaining this preemption equipment. WSDOT’s role is limited to approving preemption operational strategies (phasing, timing, software, and so on) and verifying the compatibility of the transit agency’s equipment with the traffic signal control equipment. Preserve all transit priority preemption decisions and agreements as required by Section 1330.07 Documentation.
1330.04(8) Control Equipment The standard WSDOT Signal Controller type for traffic signals is the Type 2070 Controller. Some agencies use National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) controllers (Type TS1 or TS2). Although not normally used for new construction, WSDOT Ramp Meters and some older systems still use Type 170 Controllers. All traffic signal controllers have the following basic functions:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Dual ring phase operation Eight vehicle phases Four pedestrian phases Four overlap phases Four emergency vehicle preemption channels Railroad preemption Start and end daylight savings time dates Transit preemption (some older controllers may not support this)
Type 2070 controllers and newer NEMA controllers are functionally equivalent for basic signal operations. However, Type 2070 controllers and NEMA controllers use different operating software and communications protocols, and therefore cannot be interconnected together. The type of controller should be specified as follows: 1. For WSDOT traffic signals, specify Type 2070 controllers, unless: a. The signal is interconnected with other signals. If the other controllers in the interconnected system are not being replaced, specify a controller (2070, NEMA, or other) that matches the rest of the interconnected system. b. The signal is operated by another agency. In this case, work with WSDOT and the other agency’s maintenance staff to determine the appropriate controller type. 2. For traffic signals owned by other agencies, specify the controller type used by that agency. The region or operating agency will determine the controller brand and operating software, which are included in the cabinet specifications. Each region or operating agency will provide specifications for their cabinets and the equipment contained therein. For 2070 controllers, double-width cabinets (two racks) should be specified if physically possible to allow for future communications and ITS equipment. It is often beneficial for one of the agencies to assume responsibility for the operation of the traffic signals. This is accomplished by negotiating an agreement with the other agency. The designer needs to check region policy and make sure someone initiates the process for setting up an operational agreement with the other agency or modifying an existing agreement when applicable. See the Agreements Manual for more information on signal systems and maintenance agreements (Consultants: Please contact your WSDOT Project Manager for access to the Agreements Manual). At a new intersection, where the state owns the signal, but WSDOT has agreed to let
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-45
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
another agency operate the signal, the controller should be compatible with that agency’s system. When installing a new controller in an existing interconnected corridor, the controller should be capable of operating with the existing controllers in the corridor. In situations where it is necessary to coordinate the traffic movements with another agency, it is important that the agencies work together. Intersections within ½ mile of each other on state highways should be interconnected. Perform an operational analysis to determine need for interconnection where intersections are within 1 mile of each other on state highways with a posted speed of 45 MPH or higher. The preferred method for interconnection is fiber optic cable, but other methods such as IP over copper or wireless interconnect may be considered after discussion with maintenance staff and approval by the region Traffic Engineer. Where fiber optic cable is used, it must be routed through pull boxes and cable vaults – bending fiber optic cable through standard junction boxes typically results in the cable being broken. Consider using a separate pull box or vault for coiling the fiber optic interconnect cable to allow for the large-bend radii. Add a construction note in the plans stating to coil additional cable in the adjacent pull box or vault, not the controller cabinet. This will save on space in the controller cabinet and provides additional cable in case an errant vehicle hits the cabinet. Coordinate with the operations and maintenance staff to determine the optimum controller cabinet location and the cabinet door orientation. The controller cabinet is positioned to provide the best maintenance access and clearest view of the intersection possible. Preferred visibility allows for as many signal displays and roadway approaches visible as possible from a single location. Cabinets should not be placed where they might block the view of turning traffic (intersection sight triangle). If possible, position the controller where it will not be affected by future highway construction. Cabinets require a minimum of 36 inches of level space in front of each door, including the concrete pad. Do not place cabinets where flooding might occur or where the cabinet might be hit by errant vehicles. If there is a steep down slope or drop off near the cabinet, personnel fall protection (such as fencing) is required in accordance with standards established by the Department of Labor and Industries. Fall protection may not encroach on the required clear space for the cabinet. The location must also have adequate room for a maintenance vehicle to park near the cabinet. Sufficient space for a bucket truck to park is preferable. If a telephone line (voice or DSL), fiber optic, wireless, or other connection is desired for remote access to the equipment in the cabinet, provide the appropriate equipment in the controller cabinet and/or nearby junction box or cable vault with separate conduits and junction boxes for the remote communications equipment. Communications connections to outside utilities require their own separate conduit and box/vault system. Consult with maintenance and operations staff to determine if a backup power source, such as an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) or backup generator, is needed for the signal cabinet. Install the backup power supply on the same concrete pad as the signal cabinet. Service and other cabinets may also be installed on the same concrete pad as the signal cabinet (see the Standard Plans for concrete cabinet pad layouts). Refer to Chapter 1040 for electrical service types, overcurrent protection, and descriptions and requirements for other components.
1330.04(9) Wiring, Conduit, and Junction Boxes Consider cost, flexibility, construction requirements, and ease of maintenance when laying out the electrical circuits for the traffic signal system. Consolidate roadway crossings (signal, illumination, ITS conduits, and so on) whenever possible to minimize the number of crossings and take advantage of single crossing construction (joint trenches or consolidated directional boring). Include all electrical design calculations in the Project File.

Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
1330.04(9)(a) System Wiring Traffic signal systems use multi-conductor cables to connect most of the equipment. Single conductor cable is limited to cabinet power and street lighting circuits. The following describes typical WSDOT wire type selection:
•
•
•
•
•
•
5c cables for signal displays. One 5c per signal phase may connect the signal cabinet to the terminal cabinet on the pole. Separate 5c cables should connect each signal display to the terminal cabinet. Protected / permissive displays may either use one 7c cable or two 5c cables (one for each phase on the shared display). 5c cables for pedestrian displays. Consult with region maintenance to determine if the same 5c cable is used for associated pedestrian detection. 3cs cables for emergency preemption detectors. 2c cables for induction loop detectors. Shielded cable is not required for modern loop detector cards. Older systems may still need shielded cable (2cs), but it is recommended to replace the loop detector cards instead. Manufacturer specified cables for video and radar detectors. Video detectors typically use a combined RG9/5c (#18) cable. Radar detectors typically use proprietary 6c and 8c cables. These cables are roughly the size of 7c cables (for calculating conduit fill). Use 2c cables for isolated pedestrian detectors (separate pole from associated pedestrian display). For connecting 4-wire APS units, a 7c cable may be used between the PPB post and the signal pole with the pedestrian display (where the APS control unit is located).
To simplify potential repairs for smaller signal standards (Type FB and smaller), consider routing signal display and detection conductors through terminal cabinets on larger signal standards (Type II and larger) before connecting to smaller signal standards. This reduces the amount of wire which may need to be replaced if a smaller signal standard is knocked down and the wiring damaged.
1330.04(9)(b) Conduit Refer to the Standard Specifications for conduit installation requirements. At existing intersections, where roadway reconstruction is not proposed, conduits are to be placed beyond the paved shoulder or behind existing sidewalks to reduce installation costs. All conduits shall be a minimum of 2 inches in size, with the following exceptions: 1. Conduits entering Type PPB signal standards shall be 1 inch. This may be increased to 1 1/4 inch when two APS PPBs are installed on the same pole. 2. Lighting conduits entering pole foundations (signal or light standards) shall be a minimum of 1 inch. See Chapter 1040 for additional requirements for light standards with slip bases. 3. Conduits entering Type PS, I, RM, and FB poles may be a minimum of 1-inch and a maximum of 2-inch. 4. The conduit for the service grounding electrode conductor may be a minimum of ½-inch. Install spare conduits at all road crossings. Spare conduits at road crossings should be a minimum of one 3-inch conduit or two 2-inch conduits. Install a minimum 2-inch (preferably 3-inch) spare conduit into the controller cabinet.

It is recommended to use full inch conduit sizes to simplify construction and reduce the different types of conduits required for the system. This helps to provide future capacity and reduce costs through bulk material purchasing. Size all conduits to provide 26% maximum conductor fill for new signal installations. A 40% fill area can be used when installing conductors in existing conduits. (See Exhibit 1330-27 for conduit and signal conductor sizes.)

Minimize roadway crossings whenever possible. Usually only three crossings are needed (one main line) for a four-leg intersection, and only two roadway crossings are needed for a T intersection. In most cases, the conduit should cross both the main line and side street from the corner where the controller is located. Directional boring should normally be used when crossing the state route (main line). Open cut trenching may only be used to install conduits under the following circumstances: 1. Existing roadways where the roadway is being resurfaced. 2. Existing roadways where substantial obstacles under the roadway will be encountered. 3. Where there is insufficient room for jacking or boring pits at the edges of the roadway. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-48
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
Open cut trenching is not permitted across limited access roadways unless the entire pavement surface is being replaced. Sign or signal bridges may not be used for roadway crossings.
1330.04(9)(c) Junction Boxes Provide junction boxes at the following locations:
•
•
•
•
•
Adjacent to the signal cabinet. A pull box or larger vault may be used in place of multiple junction boxes. Adjacent to each signal pole. One box may serve multiple poles. The distance from a pole to the first junction box should not exceed 10 feet without concurrence from maintenance staff. Pole bases may not be used as junction boxes. Adjacent to each set of detector loops. These boxes contain the detector loop splices. One box may serve multiple lanes, but the box should be no more than 50 feet from the detector loop. At the end of each road crossing. In the middle of conduit runs where the number of bends would equal or exceed 360°.
Where possible, locate junction boxes out of paved areas and adjacent to (but not in) sidewalks. New junction boxes may not to be placed in the pedestrian curb ramp or ramp landing of a sidewalk. If a new junction box must be placed within sidewalk, locate it at the edge of the sidewalk and designate it to be slip-resistant. Existing junction boxes located within new or existing sidewalk, including ramps or landings, must be revised as follows:
•
•
•
•
Existing junction boxes containing power conductors for the traffic signal (not including street lighting), or wiring for the signal displays, may remain in place, even if they will be within a sidewalk ramp or ramp landing. Existing junction boxes containing detector wiring may remain in sidewalks but must be relocated outside of sidewalk ramps and ramp landings. Designate that the relocation work, including conduit adjustments and rewiring, be completed within a single shift or provide temporary detection using another conduit path. All junction boxes which will be within sidewalk, sidewalk ramps, or ramp landings, must be slipresistant junction boxes. This includes replacing existing junction boxes with slip-resistant junction boxes. Under no circumstances may a junction box be located in a grade break for a sidewalk ramp. Either the ramp must be redesigned or additional accommodations made in construction to allow for the box to be relocated.
The fundamental principle is that if relocating a junction box requires shutting down a traffic signal system, the junction box may remain in its existing location but must be replaced with a slip-resistant junction box. See Chapter 1510 for additional ADA requirements. Do not place junction boxes within the traveled way unless absolutely necessary. Make every effort to locate new junction boxes and to relocate existing junction boxes outside the travel lane or paved shoulder. If there is no way to avoid locating the junction box in the traveled way or paved shoulder, heavy-duty junction boxes must be used. Avoid placing junction boxes in areas of poor drainage. Do not place junction boxes within 2 feet of ditch bottoms or drainage areas, or within vegetative filter strips or similar water treatment features which may be present. The maximum conduit capacities for various types of junction boxes are shown in the Standard Plans.

1330.05 Preliminary Signal Plan All traffic signal work which installs or modifies detection or display equipment, with the sole exception of projects where induction loops are being removed and replaced in the same location, requires a preliminary signal plan for the Project File. The type of preliminary signal plan depends on the type of work being performed. For a new traffic signal system or complete system replacement, a Full Preliminary Signal Plan is required. For all other work, a Basic Preliminary Signal Plan is required. Include a brief discussion of the issue that is being addressed by the project. Provide sufficient level of detail on the preliminary signal plan to describe all aspects of the signal installation, including proposed channelization modifications. The plan scale should not be smaller than “1 inch = 30 feet” (“1 inch = 20 feet” is preferable) – plans may be reduced to “1 inch = 40 feet” with prior approval. Submit a copy of the preliminary signal plan to the State Traffic Engineer for review and comment. A preliminary signal plan must be submitted to the State Traffic Engineer regardless of the originator of the design. Allow two to three weeks for review of the preliminary signal plan. After addressing all review comments, finalize the plan and preserve as required by Section 1330.07 Documentation. Prepare the contract plans in accordance with the Plans Preparation Manual. If HQ Traffic is preparing the contract Plans, Specifications, and Estimate (PS&E) package for the signal system portion of the project, submit the following items with the preliminary signal plan: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.
Contact person. Charge numbers. Critical project schedule dates. Existing and proposed utilities, both underground and overhead. Existing intersection layout, if different from the proposed intersection. (Turning movement traffic counts (peak hour for isolated intersections) and a.m., midday, and p.m. peak-hour counts if there is another intersection within 500 feet. 7. Electrical service location, source of power, and utility company connection requirements. After the PS&E package for the signal system portion of the project is prepared, the entire package is transmitted to the region for incorporation into its contract documents.
1330.05(1) Basic Preliminary Signal Plan The Basic Preliminary Signal Plan includes the following elements, at a minimum: a. b. c. d. e.

For any new approach, or any approach where the existing speed will change, the design posted speed may be provided instead. j. Utilities information, for any potential overhead or underground utility conflicts.
1330.06 Operational Considerations for Design This section describes operational guidance for traffic signals. These operational requirements will directly affect the design of the traffic signal, particularly in regard to signal display types and locations. All traffic signals should be periodically re-evaluated, to determine if timing or phasing changes would result in more efficient operation of the traffic signal, or in the case of interconnected systems, the corridor or network. Changes in traffic volumes, posted speeds, or other factors may influence turning movement phasing operations (protected, protected/permissive, or permissive), green times, yellow change intervals, and other operational parameters.
1330.06(1) Left-Turn Phasing Left-turn phasing can either be permissive, protected/permissive, or protected. It is not necessary that the leftturn mode for an approach be the same throughout the day. Varying the left-turn mode on an approach among the permissive only, protected/permissive, and protected-only left-turn modes during different periods of the day is acceptable. Examples are included in the phase diagrams shown in Exhibit 1330-28 and Exhibit 1330-29. For permissive left turns, including the permissive portion of a protected/permissive left turn, the permissive left turn phase shall not terminate separately from the conflicting phase(s) (typically, the opposing through phase). This is to prevent placing left turning traffic in a yellow trap. 1. Permissive Left-Turn Phasing Permissive left-turn phasing requires the left-turning vehicle to yield to opposing through traffic and pedestrians. Permissive left-turn phasing is used when the following are true: a. Turning volume is minor. b. Adequate gaps occur in the opposing through movement. c. Adequate sight distance beyond the intersection is provided.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-51
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
This phasing is more effective on minor streets where providing separate protected turn phasing might cause significant delays to the higher traffic volume on the main street. On single-lane approaches with a posted speed of 45 mph or above, or where sight distance approaching the intersection is limited, channelization should include a separate left-turn storage lane for the permissive movement to reduce the potential for rear-end-type collisions and delay to through movements. Unless there is a dedicated left-turn lane, do not provide a separate display for permissive left turns. When there is a dedicated left-turn lane, a three-section flashing yellow arrow display (with steady red arrow, steady yellow arrow, and flashing yellow arrow displays) should be used for the left-turn lane, as this provides a more positive indication of the permissive turning movement. 2. Protected/Permissive Left-Turn Phasing Protected/permissive left-turn phasing provides both a protected phase and a permissive phase for the same lane, using the same signal display. Where left-turn phasing will be installed and conditions do not warrant protected-only operation, consider protected/permissive left-turn phasing. Protected/permissive left-turn phasing can result in increased efficiency at some types of intersections, particularly “T” intersections, ramp terminal intersections, and intersections of a two-way street with a one-way street where there are no opposing left-turn movements. Protected/permissive left-turn phasing is NOT allowed under the following conditions: a. For new signals, on an approach where Warrant 7 is met (see Section 1330.02(1)(a)) and there are five or more left-turning collisions on that approach included in the warranting collisions. This condition requires protected left turn phasing. b. For existing signals, when documentation shows that existing protected left-turn phasing was installed due to left-turn collisions. c. When sight distance for left-turning vehicles, as outlined in AASHTO’s A Policy on the Geometric Design of Highways and City Streets, cannot be met. d. On intersection approaches where the opposing approach has three or more lanes (including right-turn lanes) and either the posted speed limit or 85th percentile speeds for the opposing approach are at or above 45 mph. e. On intersection approaches that have dual left-turn lanes, including approaches with left only and through-left lanes. Where there is a separate left-turn lane, protective/permissive displays may use either of the following display arrangements:
•
•
A dedicated four-section arrow display, with steady red arrow, steady yellow arrow, flashing yellow arrow, and steady green arrow displays (four-section FYA). A three-section display with a bi-modal flashing yellow arrow / steady green arrow may only be used if the signal support does not have sufficient capacity for a four-section signal display. A shared five-section cluster (doghouse) display, placed over the wide line between the left turn lane and the adjacent through lane. Cluster displays may not be used for WSDOT signal systems.
Where there is no separate left-turn lane, only a five-section vertical (recommended) or cluster display may be used. The five-section display is used in place of the left of the two required through displays for that approach.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-52
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
Protected/permissive displays may run as lead or lag. The display cycle will depend on the display type and whether the protected left leads or lags: o o
o o
Leading 4-section FYA: steady green arrow, steady yellow arrow, steady red arrow, flashing yellow arrow, steady yellow arrow, steady red arrow. Leading 5-section: green arrow, yellow arrow, red ball, green ball, yellow ball, red ball. Option: green ball may come up with green arrow, but the arrow and ball displays should cycle to yellow and red together (similar to lagging 5-section) Lagging 4-section FYA: flashing yellow arrow, steady green arrow, steady yellow arrow, steady red arrow Lagging 5-section: green ball, green ball with green arrow, yellow ball with yellow arrow, red.
3. Protected Left-Turn Phasing Protected left-turn phasing provides the left-turning vehicle a separate phase, and conflicting movements are required to stop. Use protected left-turn phasing under the following conditions: a. Multi-lane left turn movements, including left and through-left from the same approach. b. The left-turn is onto a roadway with a rail crossing. c. Where Warrant 7 is met and there are five or more left-turning collisions on that approach included in the warranting collisions. Protected left-turn phasing is recommended even when there are as few as three left-turning collisions on that approach. This includes left-turning collisions involving pedestrians. d. Where the peak-hour turning volume exceeds the storage capacity of the left-turn lane and one or more of the following conditions is present: i. The posted speed or the 85th percentile speed of the opposing traffic is 45 mph or higher. ii. The sight distance to oncoming traffic is less than 250 feet when the posted or 85th percentile speed is 35 mph or below, or less than 400 feet when the posted or 85th percentile speed is above 35 mph. iii. The left-turn movement crosses three or more lanes (including right-turn lanes) of opposing traffic. iv. Geometry or channelization is confusing, such as skewed intersections, offset-T intersections, or intersections which require unusual maneuvers to traverse. There are three typical operational arrangements for protected left turns: o
o
o
Leading Lefts: The left turns are served before the associated through movements. This is the most common operational arrangement. Example: Phases 1 and 5 (major street lefts) are served first, then phases 2 and 6 (major street throughs) are served. Lagging Lefts: The left turns are served after the associated through movements. Example: Phases 4 and 8 (minor street throughs) are served first, then phases 3 and 7 (minor street lefts) are served. Offset (or Lead/Lag) Lefts: One left turn is served before the associated through movements, and the opposing left turn is served after the associated through movements. Example: Phase 1 (one major left turn) is served first (phase 6 may be served at the same time), then phases 2 and 6 (major throughs) are served, and then phase 5 (opposing major left turn) is served (phase 2 may still be served with phase 5).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1330-53
Chapter 1330
Traffic Control Signals
Check that all turning movements provide turning clearance for opposing turn phases. If the opposing leftturning vehicle paths do not have 4-foot minimum—12-foot desirable—separation between them, split or offset (lead/lag) phasing will have to be used.
1330.06(2) Right-Turn Phasing Right turns typically do not operate with their own phasing unless there is a dedicated right turn lane. When there is no dedicated right turn lane, right turns are normally a permissive movement from the right most through lane, depending on pedestrian phases in use. When there is a dedicated right turn lane, right-turn phasing effectively operates the same as left-turn phasing. Dedicated right turn lanes may be operated the same as left turn lanes: permissive, protected/permissive, or protected. However, right turn phase operation needs to take into account any pedestrian crossing on the receiving side of the right turn. If there is a conflicting pedestrian phase – typically a pedestrian phase running concurrent with the through phase from which the right turn is being made – the right turn phase may only be operated as permissive. Dedicated right turn lanes operated as permissive and protected/permissive shall have their own displays, to avoid any confusion when indications are shared with the adjacent through lane, unless justification for not providing a separate display is given. Dedicated right turn lanes operated as protected must use their own display. Right turn displays are arranged and operated the same as those listed for left turns in Section 1330.06(1). As with left turns, a permissive right turn phase shall not terminate separately from the conflicting phase(s) (typically, the opposing through phase). Separate right turn phasing also needs to consider some additional operational modes and issues: 1. Right-Turn Overlapped Phasing A right turn overlap is when a protected right turn is allowed at the same time as a complementary protected left turn and is recommended when the lane and phase configuration will support this operation. When this operation is used, the left turn must be signed that U-turns are prohibited. When right turn overlaps are used, the wiring of the right turn displays will depend on the operating mode of each display section:
•
•
Permissive: Connect permissive display sections to the same terminals as the associated through phase. Protected: Protected display sections may either be: (a) Connected to the complementary left turn phase. Use this arrangement when the protected right turn will only be run concurrent with the complementary left turn phase. (b) Connected to an overlap phase. Use this arrangement when the protected right turn will be run with both the complementary left turn phase and with the through phase associated with the right turn.

Traffic Control Signals
2. Multiple-Lane Right-Turn Phasing Multiple-lane right turns may be run independent or overlapped as described above. Multiple-lane right turns can cause operational challenges when “right turn on red” is permitted at the intersection. Verify that there is adequate sight distance and adequate receiving lanes are available to minimize the possibility of collisions. In most cases, a single unrestricted “right-turn-only” lane approach with a separate receiving lane (auxiliary lane) will have a similar capacity as the two lane right-turn phasing.
1330.06(3) Typical Signal Phasing Arrangements The following diagrams show typical phasing diagrams for four-way and three-way intersections. Exhibit 1330-28 Phase Diagrams: Four-Way Intersections

1330.06(4) Phasing at Railroad Crossings Traffic signals near railroad crossings have additional special phasing arrangements. To provide for efficient signal operations during a rail crossing, ensure that there are dedicated turn lanes for movements turning onto the tracks. These turn lanes should be on their own dedicated phases, so that they may be omitted from the signal timing (held in red) during the rail crossing. This allows for as many of the other intersection movements as possible to continue to operate – a timing scheme referred to as “Limited Service Operation” (LSO). Just prior to LSO, when railroad preemption is used, the traffic signal will shift to a “Track Clearance Green” (TCG) phase. TCG shifts non-conflicting phases to green to allow vehicles to clear the railroad tracks. Examples of a TCG phase and LSO are shown in Exhibit 1330-30. Standalone queue cutter signals do not have a TCG phase – contact the HQ Traffic Office for operational guidance on standalone queue cutter signals. Exhibit 1330-30 Phasing at Railroad Crossings

1330.06(5) Accessible Pedestrian Signals Accessible Pedestrian Signals (APS) are required to be operated as follows: 1. All APS at an intersection must use either rapid tick or speech messages – mixed operations at a single intersection are not allowed. 2. Street names in speech messages shall be limited to the basic street name. Do not include cardinals (N, S, E, etc.) or street type (street, avenue, road, etc.) unless needed to avoid confusion where two streets have the same name, such as 2nd Avenue and 2nd Street or Center Drive at Center Way. 3. Walk messages shall be in the format “Walk sign is on to cross <street>”. 4. Button press messages during flashing or solid DON’T WALK phases shall be in the following formats: a. Short press: “Wait”. b. Long press: “Wait to cross <street1> at <street2>”. Street names shall use the same format described above. c. Long press with extended crossing time: “Wait to cross <street1> at <street2> with extended crossing time”. 5. Audible countdowns shall not be used. The APS shall default to the locator tone during any phase other than WALK.

1340.01 General For the purpose of this chapter, and to remain consistent with WSDOT’s Standard Plans and AASHTO terminology, the terms “access” and “approach” will be referred to as “driveway.” An access on a managed access highway is defined as an “access connection,” while an access on a limited access highway is defined as an “approach.”
Driveways are as much about access as they are about driveway design. This chapter describes the pertinent access criteria along with the design guidelines, including two design templates based on design vehicle, sidewalks, and sight distance criteria, for driveway connections on the state highway system. WSDOT controls driveways on all limited access state highways and regulates driveways on all managed access state highways outside the incorporated limits of a city or town. RCW 47.50.030 states that cities and towns, regardless of population size, are the permitting authority for managed access state highways within their respective incorporated city and town limits. The RCW also requires those cities and towns to adopt standards for access permitting on managed access state highways that meet or exceed WSDOT standards, provided those adopted standards are consistent with WSDOT standards.
1340.02 Access Control Limited access highways are roadways to which WSDOT has acquired the access rights from abutting property owners. Driveways, if they have been allowed, are documented and recorded in the deed and right-of-way limited access plan. Chapter 530 describes the three levels of limited access highways: full, partial, and modified. Any change to the number, type, and use of a limited access driveway must be approved by Headquarters through the process outlined in Chapter 530 and Chapter 550.

Chapter 1340
Driveways
A general permit is required to allow any new construction or repairs for a deeded road approach on a limited access highway. Access connection permits are not issued on limited access highways. Any state highway that is not a limited access highway is a managed access highway. Chapter 540 describes the five classes of managed access highways: Class 1 (most restrictive) to Class 5 (least restrictive). In addition to the five access control classes, there are also corner clearance criteria that must be used for access connections near intersections (see Section 540.04 and Exhibit 540-2). An access connection permit is required to allow the use, operation, and maintenance of a driveway connection on a managed access highway, outside incorporated cities, where WSDOT is the access permitting authority. Check with Development Services to ascertain where WSDOT has permitting authority (such as tribal lands or National Parks). When evaluating access connections or approaches on a project, review existing driveways for possible alterations, relocations, consolidations, or closures. The first step in that process is to determine the legality of each driveway. The region Development Services Office can provide a list of the permitted driveway connections on a managed access highway, noting that, per RCW 47.50.080, Permit removal, “Unpermitted connections to the state highway system in existence on July 1, 1990, shall not require the issuance of a permit and may continue to provide access to the state highway system, unless the permitting authority determines that such a connection does not meet minimum acceptable standards of highway safety.” As a result, driveway connections on a managed access state highway can be considered to be permitted, grandfathered, or unpermitted as described below:
•
•
•
Permitted driveways hold a valid permit and shall remain valid until modified or revoked. Grandfathered driveways that were in existence and in active use consistent with the type of connection on July 1, 1990, may continue to provide connection to the state highway system. The term “Grandfathered” driveway, or connection, is not a term defined in statute or rule. It is a commonly used term to define legal connections to managed access state highways, in place prior to July 1, 1990. They do not require the issuance of a new permit and may continue to provide access to the state highway system, unless the permitting authority determines that such a connection does not meet minimum acceptable standards of highway safety. Unpermitted driveways are not allowed. The permitting authority may initiate action to close the unpermitted driveway in compliance with the applicable chapters of 47.50 RCW and 468-51 and 468-52 WAC. These are driveways that do not have a permit and were constructed after July 1, 1990.
If a WSDOT project proposes to alter, relocate, consolidate, or close a driveway—regardless of whether the driveway is permitted, grandfathered, or unpermitted—it is required that a new access connection permit be issued for any driveways that are to remain. If a driveway is to be removed, formal notification to the property owner will be provided as specified in WAC 468-51-040. Unless determined otherwise, the affected property owners of driveways that will be altered, relocated, consolidated, or closed will not have the right of an Adjudicative Hearing. Additional information regarding this process can be obtained by contacting your region’s Development Services Office. On limited access highways, both the region Development Services and Real Estate Services offices may provide assistance to determine the legality of an existing driveway. Federal Highway Administration approval is required for driveway modifications on Interstate facilities.

Driveways
1340.03 Driveway Design The design of a driveway is based on the usage, design vehicle, and traffic volumes anticipated for the driveway. Driveways should be designed for the largest design vehicle that will regularly use the driveway so that it can stay in the lane and not intrude into other traffic. Determine the specific footprint of the driveway based on the turning path width of the design vehicle and in coordination with the access permit. For example, a residential driveway connection will typically have smaller radii and a narrower access width than a higher-volume commercial driveway; however, if the property owner regularly has larger-wheelbase vehicles using the driveway, such as a home-based work vehicle, recreational vehicle, or truck and boat trailer combination, then a larger driveway may be appropriate. Justification is required to design the driveway when the design vehicle stays within the paved surface but is allowed to intrude into other traffic lanes. See section 1310.02(5) for additional information pertaining to accommodating vs. designing for design vehicles. However, if the property owner regularly has larger-wheelbase vehicles using the driveway, such as a homebased work vehicle, recreational vehicle, or truck and boat trailer combination, then a larger driveway may be appropriate. Conversely, some driveways, such as a rural locked and gated, utility, farm, or logging access that larger vehicles sometimes use, may be better served with a smaller and narrower access. This is based on infrequent use and to prevent unauthorized use or dumping of debris on or near the driveway. Other design considerations are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Prevent stormwater from flowing onto the roadway from the driveway. Properly size culverts under the driveway to adequately accommodate the conveyance of stormwater in the roadway ditches and swales. Provide driveway sight distance. Accommodate for mailbox placement. Ensure surfacing materials and depths are appropriate. Generally, extend paving to the right of way line depending on the location/purpose of the driveway. The desirable intersection angle of the driveway is 90°, with 60° to 120° allowed. Where driveways intersect sidewalks, bike lanes, shared-use paths, or trails especially near schools, consider narrowing the driveway and/or reducing the radii to the minimum required by the design vehicle. Narrower driveway width and/or smaller driveway radii can reduce exposure and speed differentials between vehicles entering / exiting the driveway and pedestrians or bicycles.
1340.03(1) Design Templates There are two driveway design templates for use where there is no adjacent sidewalk. When a driveway connection has or will have adjacent sidewalk, see Section 1340.04. In both template designs, the sideslopes of the driveway shall not be steeper than 6H:1V. These templates may be used on both limited access and managed access state highways. If an Interstate limited access driveway is allowed, it must be gated. Use the design template dimensions that will accommodate the intended use of the driveway and will not adversely affect the operations of the traveled way of the state highway. See Chapter 530 and Chapter 550 for documentation requirements for access approaches to limited access facilities. Design driveways with as small a footprint as possible for the design vehicle specific to that driveway.

1340.03(3) Sight Distance A driver on the highway needs to see far enough ahead to understand, react, and take actions appropriate for the conditions, such as a vehicle entering or leaving the highway at a driveway. In addition, drivers entering the highway from a driveway need to see enough of the highway, left and/or right, so they can enter the highway in a reasonably safe manner. Design and locate driveways such that the sight distances, based on an eye height of 3.5 feet and an object height of 3.5 feet, meet or exceed the distances shown in Exhibit 1340-3; these distances may require an approaching vehicle to reduce speed or stop to prevent a collision. In addition, provide decision sight distance for through traffic at all utility and special-use driveways on facilities with limited access control (see Chapter 1260). The sight triangle areas created by the sight lines should be clear of sight obstructions that might block or affect a driver’s view of potentially conflicting vehicles. See Exhibit 1340-3. Use intersection sight distance (see Section 1310.02(10)) for road approaches with greater than 1,500 (estimated) average weekday vehicle trip ends (AWDVTE) both entering and exiting the development at full build out.

1340.03(4) Stormwater and Drainage Slope driveways away from the highway to prevent stormwater and other debris from flowing onto the highway traveled lanes and shoulders. Use of curbs, catch basins, or other measures may be needed to divert stormwater where it is not feasible to slope the driveway away from the highway. Locate catch basins outside of the vehical paths of the driveway.
Install beveled end culverts sized in accordance with the Hydraulics Manual if the driveway traverses an existing ditch or swale in the state highway right of way. Contact either the Region Hydraulic Engineer or the applicable Region Maintenance Office for assistance. Consider placing quarry spalls at each end of the open culvert to prevent erosion. Profile the road approach as shown in Exhibit 1340-1 or Exhibit 1340-2 while ensuring that roadway runoff is not a problem. Locate culverts as far from the traveled way as possible. In Exhibit 1340-1 and Exhibit 1340-2, roadway runoff can be a concern if the grade from the edge of shoulder to the right of way line and the slope parallel to the mainline is a flat or minus grade. If needed, a curb may be placed and if needed, a catch basin can also be placed as shown in Exhibit 1340-2. When considering a curb, see Chapter 1239 as allowable curb locations, heights, and offset distances can vary based on mainline speed. Construct road approaches and related areas such that they do not impair drainage within the right of way or alter the stability of the roadway subgrade.

1350.01 General Highway-rail grade crossings (“grade crossings”) are the intersection of two modes of transportation with very different physical and operational characteristics. Because of the inherent limitations associated with train operations, RCW 46.61.350 gives train traffic the right of way at grade crossings, thereby assigning motorists the primary responsibility to avoid collisions. There are many variables that influence a motorist’s ability to react appropriately at grade crossings, including what information is available to them as they approach the crossing and human factors such as competing decisions, distractions, and impaired driving. Primary factors in the design of grade crossings are roadway and railway geometry; available sight distance; highway and railway speeds; competing decisions or visual distractions; and the types of warning devices at the grade crossing. Another aspect of grade crossing design is coordination of highway traffic signal operations with grade crossing active warning devices (“railroad preemption”) when signalized intersections are located near grade crossings. In such instances, railroad preemption is designed to clear the tracks of any vehicles that may be stopped as a result of the highway traffic signal when a train is approaching the grade crossing. Further guidance on railroad preemption requirements is provided in Chapter 1330. Grade crossings are also unique due to their multijurisdictional nature. Highway authorities and railroad companies are each legally responsible for different elements at grade crossings. Additionally, the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) is the state regulatory agency with oversight of public grade crossings in Washington, except within the limits of first class cities in accordance with RCW 81.53.240. Establishing new crossings, altering existing crossings, or closing crossings all require WUTC approval. Therefore, highway projects that include a grade crossing will generally require close coordination with both the railroad company and the WUTC. Projects that include grade crossings will generally require execution of construction and maintenance agreements between the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and the railroad company. These agreements specify the design elements of the crossing, work that the railroad will perform on behalf of the project, payment terms, and legal provisions. It may also be necessary for WSDOT to obtain easements from the railroad company for new grade crossings on railroad property. The Headquarters (HQ) Railroad Liaison is responsible for facilitating highway project coordination with railroad companies, including developing agreements and obtaining WUTC approvals. Obtaining necessary approvals from the railroad company may take several months. Contact the HQ Railroad Liaison early in the design phase so that all necessary design and agreement coordination can be completed according to project schedules.

Railroad Grade Crossings
More information about general railroad coordination and WUTC requirements is provided in Chapter 3 of the Utilities Manual.
1350.02 Plans 1350.02(1) Proposed Improvements Include plans for proposed improvements to existing crossings and any new crossings in the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) package. In addition to basic roadway dimensions, signs, and markings, indicate the angle of crossing; number of tracks; location of signals and other railway facilities (such as electrical/communications lines and control boxes); and the limits of property ownership by the railroad company at the crossing location. For any project proposing to alter the horizontal or vertical alignment at a grade crossing, including grade separations, show the alignment and profile for both the railroad and the roadway for a minimum of 500 feet on all legs of the crossing. Show all other important features that might affect the safety, operation, and design of the crossing, such as nearby crossroads, driveways/entrances, buildings, and highway structures on the plans.
1350.02(1)(a) Sight Distance A railroad grade crossing is comparable to the intersection of two highways where a sight triangle is kept clear of obstructions (including vegetation) and may be protected by a traffic control device. When designing for these locations, provide for both corner and clearing sight distance. Corner sight distance allows a driver, traveling towards the crossing, to see an approaching train at a distance that allows the vehicle to stop in advance of the crossing. (see Exhibit 1350-1, Case A). Clearing sight distance allows a driver stopped at a crossing to see far enough down the tracks that they may decide to proceed and cross those tracks before a train, approaching at its maximum allowable speed, reaches the crossing (see Exhibit 1350-1, Case B.) For Cases A and B, the minimum distance for removing signs, brush and timber in the vicinity of the grade crossing that obstruct the view of an approaching train is 100 feet, measured along the tracks from the crossing. Among the challenges associated with providing sight distance at railroad grade crossing locations are topography, seasonal crops or other vegetation, and structures or other obstructions in properties that the sight lines cross, including the railroad. Evaluate, with HQ Railroad Liaison, and document the need to install active devices (such as signals or signals and gates) at locations where the distances in Exhibit 1350-1 cannot be provided or maintained over time. Contact the HQ Railroad Liaison to engage the subject railroad and the WUTC in the evaluation.
1350.02(1)(b) Highway Grade and Crossing Angle Construct highway grades so that low-clearance vehicles do not hang up on tracks or damage them. (See Chapter 1220 for information on vertical alignment at railroad grade crossings.) Whenever possible, design the roadway to cross grade crossings at right angles. If bicycle traffic uses the crossing (this can be assumed for most roads), provide a shoulder through the grade crossing at least as wide as the approach shoulder width. If a skew is unavoidable, wider shoulders may be needed to permit bicycles to maneuver to cross the tracks at right angles. See Chapter 1520 for information on bikeways crossing railroad tracks. Consider installation of advance warning signs indicating the presence of a skewed crossing for crossings where engineering judgment suggests a benefit. Include any engineering studies or sight distance measurements in the Design Documentation Package (DDP). WSDOT Design Manual M 22.01.22

Railroad Grade Crossings
1350.03 Traffic Control Systems 1350.03(1) Traffic Control System Elements There are two categories of railroad warning devices: “passive” and “active.” Passive devices include all signs and pavement markings. Active devices include flashing light signals, railroad warning gates, and active advance warning systems, all of which are activated by approaching trains.
1350.03(1)(a) Passive Elements The following signing elements are shown in the MUTCD, Part 8, Traffic Control for Highway-Rail Grade Crossings:
•
Highway-Rail Grade Crossing (Crossbuck) sign: Crossbuck signs identify the location of the grade crossing and convey the same meaning as a yield sign. The railroad is responsible for installation and maintenance of Crossbuck signs.
Note: Railroads are required to upgrade standard Crossbuck signs at passive grade crossings to “Crossbuck Assemblies” by December 31, 2019. Crossbuck Assemblies are Crossbuck signs mounted in conjunction with STOP or YIELD signs. Any projects that establish new passive crossings or result in reconstruction of passive crossings should include design of Crossbuck Assemblies. (See Chapter 8 of the MUTCD for additional guidance.)
•
•
•
•
Supplemental Number of Tracks (inverted “T”) sign: This sign is mounted below the Crossbuck sign to indicate the number of tracks when two or more tracks are involved. The railroad is responsible for installation and maintenance of these signs. Grade Crossing Advance Warning sign (W10 sign series): The road authority is responsible for installation and maintenance of these signs. Exempt sign: This is a supplemental sign that, when authorized by the WUTC, may be mounted below the Crossbuck sign. When this sign is approved, certain classes of vehicles, otherwise required to stop before crossing the tracks, may proceed without stopping, provided no train is approaching. The road authority is responsible for installation and maintenance of these signs. Do Not Stop on Tracks sign: This sign is used where it is determined that additional emphasis is needed to remind motorists of this legal requirement, such as where nearby roadway intersections result in queuing back across the tracks. The road authority is responsible for installation and maintenance of these signs.
Pavement markings on all paved approaches are the responsibility of the road authority and consist of RR Crossing markings in accordance with the Standard Plans, No Passing markings, and Pullout Lanes, as appropriate. Consider the installation of illumination at and adjacent to railroad crossings where an engineering study determines that better nighttime visibility of the train and the grade crossing is needed. For example, where:
•
•
•
A substantial number of railroad operations are conducted at night. Grade crossings are blocked for long periods at night by slow-speed trains. Collision history indicates that drivers experience difficulty seeing trains during hours of darkness.

Page 1350-4
Chapter 1350
Railroad Grade Crossings
1350.03(1)(b) Active Elements Railroad Flashing Light Signals and Gates: These are active devices intended to warn motorists of approaching trains and impose a stopping requirement. The railroad is responsible for installation and maintenance of these devices. Traffic Signal Interconnection (also known as “railroad preemption”): These provide linkage between the railroad signals and adjacent traffic signals to allow vehicles to clear the tracks at a traffic signal as a train approaches. They are typically funded by the road authority and require cooperation with the railroad for installation. The formation of a Railroad Crossing Evaluation Team is required to determine signal railroad preemption requirements. (See Chapter 1330 for further guidance.) Pre-Signals: These are traffic control signal faces that control roadway traffic approaching a grade crossing in conjunction with the traffic control signal faces that control traffic approaching a roadway-roadway intersection beyond the tracks. Pre-signals are typically used where the clear storage distance is insufficient to store one or more design vehicles. Active Advance Warning Systems: These are supplemental flashing yellow beacons mounted along with the grade crossing advance warning signs that are interconnected to the railroad active warning devices. Activation of the railroad active warning devices activates the beacons to provide motorists with an advance indication that a train is approaching or occupying the crossing. Active advance warning systems are typically used where roadway geometry prevents a clear view of the grade crossing ahead, or where higher highway speeds may require advance notification of an impending stopping requirement. Use a plaque stating “Train When Flashing” as part of such systems. Supplemental Safety Devices: Supplemental safety devices are typically used at locations where it is known that motorists frequently drive around gates, where deemed appropriate due to unique local conditions, or as part of railroad quiet zones where trains are not required to sound the locomotive horn. (For more information about quiet zones, see https://railroads.dot.gov/elibrary/quiet-zone-locations-city-and-state-1.) Typical supplemental safety devices include:
•
•
Four-Quadrant Gate Systems: These are additional gates placed on the opposite side of the roadway from the primary railroad warning gates that, when lowered, make it impossible for motorists to drive around the lowered gates. (See Chapter 8 of the MUTCD for additional information on four-quadrant gate systems. Median Separators: This is a system of raised delineators extending along the roadway centerline back from the tip of a lowered railroad warning gate that prevents motorists from being able to drive around the lowered gates. Make median separators at least 60 feet in length where sufficient space is available.
1350.03(1)(c) Selection of Grade Crossing Warning Devices At a minimum:
•
•
All public grade crossings are required to be equipped with Crossbuck signs, a supplemental plaque indicating the presence of multiple tracks (if applicable), and advance warning signs. Railroad pavement markings are required at all crossings where active warning devices are present or the posted legal speed limit is 40 mph or higher.
Passive warning devices notify drivers that they are approaching a grade crossing and to be on the lookout for trains. In general, consider stand-alone passive warning devices at grade crossings with low volumes and speeds on both the highway and railway, and where adequate sight distances exist. WSDOT Design Manual M 22.01.22 
Page 1350-5
Chapter 1350
Railroad Grade Crossings
Active warning devices are to be considered at all other crossings. No national or state warrants have been developed for installation of traffic control devices at grade crossings. Furthermore, due to the large number of significant variables that need to be considered, there is no single system of active traffic control devices universally applicable for grade crossings. Warning systems at grade crossings should be based on an engineering and traffic investigation, including input from the railroad and the WUTC. Primary factors to consider in selecting warning devices are train and highway volumes and speeds; highway and railway geometry; pedestrian volume; accident history; and available sight distance. Evaluate railroad signal supports and gate mechanisms as roadside features to be considered for mitigation. Use traffic barrier or impact attenuators as appropriate (see Division 16).
1350.04 Nearby Roadway Intersections Operations at roadway intersections located near grade crossings can present significant challenges for grade crossing safety. In particular, vehicle queues originating from the roadway intersection and extending back to the grade crossing must be clear of the tracks before the arrival of any trains. While RCW 46.61.570 prohibits motorists from stopping on any railroad tracks, it is not uncommon for motorists to stop on tracks when focusing on the downstream highway intersection rather than the immediate grade crossing. For signalized highway intersections where vehicle queues result from a red signal indication, clearance of vehicles from the grade crossing is accomplished through traffic signal interconnection with the railroad warning signals (“railroad preemption”). When railroad preemption is in place, an approaching train will initiate a special mode within the highway traffic signal specifically designed to clear any vehicles from the tracks prior to the arrival of the train at the grade crossing. Railroad preemption design involves a specialized analysis that considers the distance between the roadway intersection and grade crossing; queue clearance times; train speeds; the capabilities of the railroad active warning devices; and other traffic signal phases. Where the distance between the grade crossing and the roadway intersection is not sufficient to store a design vehicle, a pre-signal may be considered to prevent subsequent vehicles from entering the grade crossing limits during the track clearance phases of the downstream highway signal. Additionally, whenever a signalized roadway intersection is located 500 feet from a grade crossing, a Railroad Crossing Evaluation Team, which includes representatives from both WSDOT and the railroad company, will jointly determine the need for and design of railroad preemption systems. (See Chapter 1330 for further guidance on railroad preemption requirements.) Vehicle queues over the tracks can also result from operations at nonsignalized roadway intersections; for example, where there is a short distance between the grade crossing and a roadway intersection controlled by a STOP or YIELD sign. A “Do Not Stop on Tracks” sign should be installed at locations where the distance between the grade crossing and the roadway intersection is not sufficient to store a design vehicle or it is otherwise determined that vehicle queues originating from the roadway intersection routinely extend back to the grade crossing. To determine whether or not to consider a highway traffic signal in such instances, refer to MUTCD Traffic Signal Warrant 9.
1350.05 Pullout Lanes In accordance with RCW 46.61.350, certain vehicles are required to stop at all railroad crossings unless the grade crossing is flagged or an “Exempt” sign is posted. Evaluate the installation of “pullout” lanes when grade crossings have no active protection. Some school districts have a policy that school buses must stop at all grade crossings regardless of the type of control.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22.01.22

Consider the installation of pullout lanes at any public grade crossing used regularly by school buses or by trucks transporting flammable cargo or explosives and at which they must stop. Contact the local school district for school bus information. Contact the Truck Freight Program and Policy Manager at the WSDOT HQ Freight Systems Division about truck freight operations in the project vicinity. Design pullout lane geometrics in accordance with Exhibit 1350-2. The minimum shoulder width adjacent to the pullout lane is 3 feet. Exhibit 1350-2 Typical Pullout Lane at Railroad Crossing

1350.06 Crossing Surfaces Railroads are responsible for the maintenance of crossing surfaces up to 12 inches outside the edge of rail (WAC 480-62-225). Crossing surfaces can be constructed of a number of different materials, including asphalt, concrete, steel, timber, rubber, or plastic. The most common surface types used on state highway crossings are asphalt, precast concrete, and rubber. Timbered crossings are frequently used for low-volume roads and temporary construction crossings. The life of a crossing surface depends on the volume and weight of highway and rail traffic using it. Highway traffic not only dictates the type of crossing surface, but it also has a major influence on the life of the crossing. Rough crossing surfaces impact the motoring public far more than the railroad. Therefore, when a highway project passes through a railroad grade crossing, consider the condition of the crossing surface. While the existing condition might not warrant railroad investment in replacing it, the surface might have deteriorated sufficiently to increase vehicle operating costs and motorist inconvenience.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22.01.22 
Page 1350-7
Chapter 1350
Railroad Grade Crossings
In such cases, it may be effective to partner with the railroad to replace the crossing as part of the highway project. Such partnerships typically consist of the state reimbursing the railroad for all or a portion of the cost of the work.
1350.07 Crossing Closure The MUTCD states, “Any highway-rail grade crossing that cannot be justified should be eliminated.” Coordination with the appropriate railroad and the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission is required before any grade crossing can be closed. If a state route grade crossing appears unused, consult the HQ Railroad Liaison before taking any action. Close at-grade crossings that are replaced by grade separations.
1350.08 Traffic Control during Construction and Maintenance Provide work zone traffic control for projects at highway-rail grade crossings, which need protection from train traffic. When highway construction or maintenance activities affect a railroad crossing, the railroad company must be notified at least ten days before performing the work (WAC 480-62-305(4)). Furthermore, whenever highway construction or maintenance crews or equipment are working within 25 feet of an active rail line or grade crossing, consult the railroad to determine whether a railroad flagger is required. Current contact numbers for railroads may be obtained by contacting your region Utilities Engineer or the HQ Railroad Liaison. Railroad flaggers differ from highway flaggers in that they have information on train schedules and can generally communicate with trains by radio. When flaggers are required, the railroad generally sends the road authority a bill for the cost of providing this service. Do not allow work zone traffic to stop or queue up on a nearby rail-highway grade crossing unless railroad flaggers are present. Without proper protection, vehicles might be trapped on the tracks when a train approaches. (See the MUTCD for more detailed guidance.) For projects requiring temporary access across a set of railroad tracks, contact the HQ Railroad Liaison early in the design process since a railroad agreement or permit will likely be required.
1350.09 Railroad Grade Crossing Petitions and WUTC Orders The Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) is authorized by statute (Title 81 RCW) to have regulatory authority over railroad crossings. Establishing new crossings, closing existing crossings, or modifying existing grade crossings must be approved by the WUTC (WAC 480-62-150). WUTC authority does not apply within the limits of first class cities, in accordance with RCW 81.53.240. This is accomplished by submitting a formal petition to the WUTC for a formal order. The HQ Railroad Liaison will assist in the preparation and submittal of this petition. Include a copy of the petition and WUTC findings and order in the Design Documentation Package.
1350.10 Grade Crossing Improvement Projects The HQ Highways and Local Programs Office (H&LP) administers the federal (Section 130) Grade Crossing Safety Improvement Program. Project proposals are submitted by local agencies, railroads, and WSDOT. Contact H&LP or the HQ Railroad Liaison in the Utilities, Railroads, and Agreements Section for more information.

1350.11 Light Rail Light rail transit systems have been implemented and will continue to be developed in some urban areas of the state. For the most part, criteria for light rail transit crossings are very similar to those for freight and passenger rail with the exception of locations where light rail shares a street right of way with motor vehicles.

1360.01 General The primary purpose of an interchange is to reduce conflicts caused by vehicle crossings and minimize conflicting left-turn movements. Provide interchanges on all Interstate highways and freeways, and at other locations where traffic cannot be controlled efficiently by intersections at grade. For additional information, see the following: Chapter 520 Access control
Chapter 1240 Turning widths
Chapter 530 Limited access
Chapter 1250 Cross Slope and Superelevation

Chapter 1410 HOV lanes
Chapter 1106 Design element dimensions

1360.02 Interchange Design 1360.02(1) General The configuration of an interchange is determined using traffic analysis and inter-agency coordination following the Access Revision Report (ARR) process (if needed) as described in Chapter 550. Consult Chapter 550 for direction when constructing or modifying an interchange and to determine if an ARR is needed and the scope of the ARR. All freeway exits and entrances, except HOV direct access connections, are to connect on the right of through traffic. Deviations from this will be considered only for special conditions. HOV direct access connections may be constructed on the left of through traffic when they are designed in accordance with Chapter 1420.

Interchanges
Provide complete ramp facilities for all directions of travel wherever possible. However, give primary consideration to the basic traffic movement function that the interchange is to fulfill. Complications are rarely encountered in the design and location of rural interchanges that simply provide a means of exchanging traffic between a limited access freeway and a local crossroad. Carefully consider the economic and operational effects of locating traffic interchanges along a freeway through a community, particularly with respect to local access, to provide convenient local service without reducing the capacity of the major route(s). Where freeway-to-freeway interchanges are involved, do not provide ramps for local access unless they can be added conveniently and without detriment to efficient traffic flow or reduction of capacity, either ramp or freeway main line. When exchange of traffic between freeways is the basic function, and local access is prohibited by access control restrictions or traffic volume, separate interchanges for local service may be needed.
1360.02(2) Interchange Patterns Basic interchange patterns have been established that can be used under certain general conditions and modified or combined to apply to many more. Consider alternatives in the design of a specific facility; however, the conditions in the area and on the highway involved govern the final design of the interchange. The patterns most frequently used for interchange design are those commonly described as directional, semi directional, cloverleaf, partial cloverleaf, diamond, and single point (urban) interchange (see Exhibit 1360-1). Selection of the final design is based on a study of projected traffic volumes, site conditions, geometric controls, criteria for intersecting legs and turning roadways, driver expectancy, consistent ramp patterns, continuity, and cost.
1360.02(2)(a) Directional A directional interchange is the most effective design for connection of intersecting freeways. The directional pattern has the advantage of reduced travel distance, increased speed of operation, and higher capacity. These designs eliminate weaving and have a further advantage over cloverleaf designs in avoiding the loss of sense of direction drivers experience in traveling a loop. This type of interchange is costly to construct, commonly using a four-level structure.
1360.02(2)(b) Semi directional A semi directional interchange has ramps that loop around the intersection of the highways. This results in multiple single-level structures and more area than the directional interchange.

Chapter 1360
Interchanges
1360.02(2)(c) Cloverleaf The full cloverleaf interchange has four loop ramps for the left-turning traffic. Outer ramps provide for the right turns. A full cloverleaf is the minimum type interchange for a freeway-to-freeway interchange. Cloverleaf designs often incorporate a C-D road to minimize signing difficulties and remove weaving conflicts from the main roadway. The principal advantage of this design is the elimination of all left-turn conflicts with one single-level structure. Because all movements are merging movements, it is adaptable to any grade line arrangement. The cloverleaf has some major disadvantages. The left-turn movement has a circuitous route on the loop ramp, the speeds are low on the loop ramp, and there are weaving conflicts between the loop ramps. The cloverleaf also needs a large area. The weaving and the radius of the loop ramps are a capacity constraint on the left-turn movements.
1360.02(2)(d) Partial Cloverleaf A partial cloverleaf (PARCLO) has loop ramps in one, two, or three quadrants that are used to eliminate the major left-turn conflicts. These loops may also serve right turns for interchanges where ramp cannot be built in one or two quadrants. Outer ramps are provided for the remaining turns. Design the grades to provide sight distance between vehicles approaching these ramps.
1360.02(2)(e) Diamond A diamond interchange has four ramps that are essentially parallel to the major arterial. Each ramp provides for one right-turn and one left-turn movement. Because left turns are made at grade across conflicting traffic on the crossroad, intersection sight distance is a primary consideration. The diamond design is the most generally applicable and serviceable interchange configuration and usually has a smaller footprint than any other type. Consider this design first unless another design is clearly dictated by traffic, topography, or special conditions.
1360.02(2)(f) Single Point Urban A single point urban interchange (SPUI) is a modified diamond with all of its ramp terminals on the crossroad combined into one signalized at-grade intersection. This single intersection accommodates all interchange and through movements. A single point urban interchange can improve the traffic operation on the crossroad with less right of way than a typical diamond interchange, but a larger structure.

1360.02(3) Spacing To avoid excessive interruption of main line traffic, consider each proposed facility in conjunction with adjacent interchanges, intersections, and other points of access along the route as a whole. The minimum spacing between adjacent interchanges is 1 mile in urban areas, 3 miles on the Interstate in rural areas, and 2 miles on non-Interstate in rural areas (see Exhibit 1360-2). In urban areas, spacing less than 1 mile may be used with C-D roads or grade-separated (braided) ramps. Interchange spacing is measured along the freeway centerline between the centerlines of the crossroads. The spacing between interchanges may also be dependent on the spacing between ramp connections. The minimum spacing between the gore noses of adjacent ramps is given in Exhibit 1360-3. Exhibit 1360-2 Interchange Spacing
Notes: [1] As a minimum, provide length for weaving and signing, but not less than given in Exhibit 1360-3. [2] 3 miles on the Interstate System. Consider either frontage roads or C-D roads to facilitate the operation of near-capacity volumes between closely spaced interchanges or ramp terminals. C-D roads may be needed where cloverleaf loop ramps are involved or where a series of interchange ramps have overlapping speed change lanes. Base the distance between successive ramp terminals on capacity. Check the intervening sections by weaving analyses to determine whether capacity, sight distance, and effective signing can be provided without the use of auxiliary lanes or C-D roads. Provide justifications for existing interchanges with less-than-desirable spacing or ramp connection spacing to remain in place.
1360.02(4) Route Continuity Route continuity is providing the driver of a through route a path on which lane changes are minimized and other traffic operations occur to the right. In maintaining route continuity, interchange configuration may not favor the heavy traffic movement, but rather the through route. In this case, design the heavy traffic movements with multilane ramps, flat curves, and reasonably direct alignment.

Interchanges
1360.02(5) Drainage Avoid interchanges located in proximity to natural drainage courses. These locations often result in complex and unnecessarily costly hydraulic structures. The open areas within an interchange can be used for stormwater detention facilities.
1360.02(6) Uniformity of Exit Pattern While interchanges are of necessity custom-designed to fit specific conditions, it is desirable that the pattern of exits along a freeway have some degree of uniformity. From the standpoint of driver expectancy, it is desirable that each interchange have only one point of exit, located in advance of the crossroad.

1360.03 Ramps 1360.03(1) Ramp Design Speed The design speed for a ramp is based on the design speed for the freeway main line. It is desirable that the ramp design speed at the connection to the freeway be equal to the free-flow speed of the freeway. Meet or exceed the upper range values from Exhibit 1360-4 for the design speed at the ramp connection to the freeway. Transition the ramp design speed incrementally to provide a smooth acceleration or deceleration between the mainline and the cross street. For example, if the design speed at the cross street is 25 and the mainline design speed is 70, increase the on-ramp design speed through the curves from 25 to 50 to 60 and transition to 70; reverse the speed transition for off-ramp design. These design speed guidelines do not apply to the ramp in the area of the ramp terminal at-grade intersection. In the area of the intersection, use a design speed of 15 mph for turning traffic or 0 mph for a stop condition. Use the allowed skew at the ramp terminal at-grade intersection to minimize ramp curvature. For freeway-to-freeway ramps and C-D roads, the design speed at the connections to both freeways is the upper range values from Exhibit 1360-4; however, with justification, the midrange values from Exhibit 1360-4 may be used for the remainder of the ramp. When the design speed for the two freeways is different, use the higher design speed. Existing ramps meet design speed criteria if acceleration or deceleration criteria are met (see Exhibit 1360-10 or Exhibit 1360-11) and superelevation meets the criteria in Chapter 1250.

1360.03(4) Cross Section 1360.03(4)(a) Ramp Widths Provide the ramp widths given in Exhibit 1360-6. Ramp traveled ways may need additional width when operational needs exist. The minimum total ramp width for a single lane ramp is 20 feet. If when designing up the ramp width the total ramp width is less than 20 feet, add the difference to the right shoulder width or the left shoulder width whichever is best. The minimum total ramp width for a one-way two-lane ramp is 30 feet (the minimum Traveled way and minimum shoulder widths added together). Ramp shoulders may be used by accommodated vehicles for offtracking and by design vehicles passing stalled vehicles. Evaluate the need to pave shoulders full depth for accommodated vehicle offtracking using turn simulation software on one-way ramps. In curves, base the width of the ramp traveled way on Section 1240.02 or the turning template of the design vehicle. Exhibit 1360-6 Ramp Widths Number of Lanes

[4] The minimum two-way ramp median width (including shoulders) is given. Wider medians may be required for signs or other traffic control devices and their respective clearances. When either the on- or off-ramp is singlelane, use the one-lane column. If both directions are two lanes, use the two-lane column. [5] Use the mode/function/performance approach described in Chapter 1106 and Section 1239.02 for shoulders and Section 1239.08 for medians to choose between the range of widths given. [6] For metered shoulders, see Exhibit 1239-2 and Chapter 1440.
1360.03(4)(b) Ramp Cross Slope Cross slope and superelevation criteria for ramp traveled ways and shoulders are as given in Chapter 1250 for roadways. At ramp terminals, the intersection lane and shoulder width design guidance shown in Chapter 1310 may be used. Whenever feasible, make the ramp cross slope at the ramp beginning or ending station equal to the cross slope of the through lane pavement. Where space is limited and superelevation runoff is long, or when parallel connections are used, the superelevation transition may be ended beyond (for on-ramps) or begun in advance of (for off-ramps) the ramp beginning or ending station, provided that the algebraic difference in cross slope at the edge of the through lane and the cross slope of the ramp does not exceed 4%. In such cases, provide smooth transitions for the edge of traveled way.

Chapter 1360
Interchanges
1360.03(5) Two-Way Ramps Two-way ramps are on- and off-ramps on a single roadway. Design two-way ramps as separate one-way ramps. Provide a raised median to physically separate the on- and off- ramps. Wider medians than given in Exhibit 1360-6 may be required for signing or other traffic control devices and their clearances. (For signs, it is sign width plus 4 feet.) Where wider medians are required, provide a 2-foot clearance between the face of curb and the edge of traveled way. Where additional width is not required, the raised median width may be reduced to a double-faced mountable or extruded curb. Traffic barrier or a depressed median may be provided in place of the raised median.
1360.03(6) Ramp Lane Increases When off-ramp traffic and left-turn movement volumes at the ramp terminal at-grade intersection cause excessive queue length, it may be desirable to add lanes to the ramp to reduce the queue length caused by congestion and turning conflicts. Make provision for the addition of ramp lanes whenever ramp exit or entrance volumes are expected to result in an undesirable mobility or safety performance. (See Section 1210.05 for pavement transitions.)
1360.03(7) Ramp Meters Ramp meters are used to allow a measured or regulated amount of traffic to enter the freeway. When operating in the “measured” mode, they release traffic at a measured rate to keep downstream demand below capacity and improve system travel times. In the “regulated” mode, they break up platoons of vehicles that occur naturally or result from nearby traffic signals. Even when operating at near capacity, a freeway main line can accommodate merging vehicles one or two at a time, while groups of vehicles will cause main line flow to break down. The location of the ramp meter is a balance between the storage and acceleration criteria. Locate the ramp meter to maximize the available storage and so that the acceleration lane length, from a stop to the freeway main line design speed, is available from the stop bar to the merging point. With justification, the average main line running speed during the hours of meter operation may be used for the highway design speed to determine the minimum acceleration lane length from the ramp meter. (See Section 1360.04(4) for information on the design of on-connection acceleration lanes.) Driver compliance with the signal is required for the ramp meter to have the desired results. Consider enforcement areas with metered ramps. A metered ramp lane may have insufficient storage capacity to handle the on-ramp’s traffic volume. In these situations, a metered shoulder may be a viable option that utilizes the shoulder approaching a ramp meter as a temporary additional lane for storage and metered throughput during the ramp meter’s operational period. See Chapter 1440. Consider HOV bypass lanes with ramp meters. See Chapter 1410 for design data for ramp meter bypass lanes.
1360.04 Interchange Connections To the extent practicable, provide uniform geometric design and uniform signing for exits and entrances in the design of a continuous freeway. Do not design an exit ramp as an extension of a main line tangent at the beginning of a main line horizontal curve. Provide spacing between interchange connections as given in Exhibit 1360-3.

Chapter 1360
Interchanges
Avoid on-connections on the inside of a main line curve, particularly when the ramp approach angle is accentuated by the main line curve, the ramp approach results in a reverse curve to connect to the main line, or the elevation difference will cause the cross slope to be steep at the nose. Keep the use of mountable curb at interchange connections to a minimum. Provide justification when curb is used adjacent to traffic with a design speed of 40 mph or higher. Exhibit 1360-7 Lane Balance
*Note: Number of lanes (F) may increase by one lane, when the lane is an auxiliary lane between closely spaced entrance and exit ramps.
1360.04(1) Lane Balance Design interchanges to the following principles of lane balance:
1360.04(1)(a) Entrances At entrances, make the number of lanes beyond the merging of two traffic streams not less than the sum of all the lanes on the merging roadways less one (see Exhibit 1360-7).
1360.04(1)(b) Exits At exits, make the number of approach lanes equal the number of highway lanes beyond the exit plus the number of exit lanes less one (see Exhibit 1360-7). Exceptions to this are:
•
•
At a cloverleaf. At closely spaced interchanges with a continuous auxiliary lane between the entrance and exit.
In these cases, the auxiliary lane may be dropped at a single-lane, one-lane reduction off-connection (Exhibit 1360-22), with the number of approach lanes being equal to the sum of the highway lanes beyond the exit and the number of exit lanes. Closely spaced interchanges have a distance of less than 2,100 feet between the end of the acceleration lane and the beginning of the deceleration lane. Maintain the basic number of lanes, as described in Chapter 1210, through interchanges. When a two-lane exit or entrance is used, maintain lane balance with an auxiliary lane (see Exhibit 1360-8). The exception to this is when the basic number of lanes is changed at an interchange.

Interchanges
Exhibit 1360-8 Lane Balance
1360.04(2) Main Line Lane Reduction The reduction of a basic lane or an auxiliary lane may be made at a two-lane exit or may be made between interchanges. When a two-lane exit is used, provide a recovery area with a normal acceleration taper. When a lane is dropped between interchanges, drop it 1,500 to 3,000 feet from the end of the acceleration taper of the previous interchange. This allows for signing but will not be so far that the driver becomes accustomed to the number of lanes and will be surprised by the reduction (see Exhibit 1360-9). Reduce the traveled way width of the freeway by only one lane at a time.
1360.04(3) Sight Distance Locate off-connections and on-connections on the main line to provide decision sight distance for a speed/path/direction change as described in Chapter 1260.

1360.04(4) On-Connections On-connections are the paved areas at the end of on-ramps that connect them to the main lane of a freeway. They have two parts: an acceleration lane and a taper. The acceleration lane allows entering traffic to accelerate to the freeway speed and evaluate gaps in the freeway traffic. The taper is for the entering vehicle to maneuver into the through lane. On-connections are either tapered or parallel. The tapered on-connection provides direct entry at a flat angle, reducing the steering control needed. The parallel on-connection adds a lane adjacent to the through lane for acceleration with a taper at the end. Vehicles merge with the through traffic with a reverse curve maneuver similar to a lane change. While less steering control is needed for the taper, the parallel is narrower at the end of the ramp and has a shorter taper at the end of the acceleration lane.
1360.04(4)(a) Acceleration Lane Provide the minimum acceleration lane length, given in Exhibit 1360-10, for each ramp design speed on all onramps. When the average grade of the acceleration lane is 3% or greater, multiply the distance from the Minimum Acceleration Lane Length table by the factor from the Adjustment Factor for Grades table. The acceleration lane is measured from the last point designed at each ramp design speed (usually the PT of the last curve for each design speed) to the last point of the ramp width. Curves designed at higher design speeds may be included as part of the acceleration lane length.
1360.04(4)(b) Gap Acceptance For parallel on-connections, provide the minimum gap acceptance length (Lg) to allow entering motorists to evaluate gaps in the freeway traffic and position their vehicles to use the gap. The length is measured beginning at the point that the left edge of traveled way for the ramp intersects the right edge of traveled way of the main line to the ending of the acceleration lane (see Exhibit 1360-17 and Exhibit 1360-18). The gap acceptance length and the acceleration length overlap, with the ending point controlled by the longer of the two.

1360.04(4)(c) Single-Lane On-Connections Single-lane on-connections may be either tapered or parallel. Design single-lane tapered on-connections as shown in Exhibit 1360-16 and single-lane parallel on-connections as shown in Exhibit 1360-17.
1360.04(4)(d) Two-Lane On-Connections For two-lane on-connections, the parallel is desirable. Design two-lane parallel on-connections as shown in Exhibit 1360-18. A capacity analysis will normally be the basis for determining whether a freeway lane or an auxiliary lane is to be provided. Justify the use of a two-lane tapered on-connection. Design two-lane tapered on connections in accordance with Exhibit 1360-19.
1360.04(5) Off-Connections Off-connections are the paved areas at the beginning of an off-ramp, connecting it to a main lane of a freeway. They have two parts: a taper for maneuvering out of the through traffic and a deceleration lane to slow to the speed of the first curve on the ramp. Deceleration is not assumed to take place in the taper. Off-connections are either tapered or parallel. The tapered is desirable because it fits the normal path for most drivers. When a parallel connection is used, drivers tend to drive directly for the ramp and not use the parallel lane. However, when a ramp is on the outside of a curve, the parallel off-connection is desirable. An advantage of the parallel connection is that it is narrower at the beginning of the ramp.
1360.04(5)(a) Deceleration Lane Provide the minimum deceleration lane length given in Exhibit 1360-11 for each design speed for all off-ramps. Also, provide deceleration lane length to the end of the anticipated queue at the ramp terminal. When the average grade of the deceleration lane is 3% or greater, multiply the distance from the Minimum Deceleration Lane Length table by the factor from the Adjustment Factor for Grades table. The deceleration lane is measured from the point where the taper reaches the selected ramp lane width to the first point designed at each ramp design speed (usually the PC of the first curve for each design speed). Curves designed at higher design speeds may be included as part of the deceleration lane length.

1360.04(5)(b) Gores Gores (see Exhibit 1360-13 and Exhibit 1360-14) are decision points. Design them to be clearly seen and understood by approaching drivers. In a series of interchanges along a freeway, it is desirable that the gores be uniform in size, shape, and appearance. The paved area between the physical nose and the striped gore nose is the reserve area. It is reserved for the installation of an impact attenuator. The minimum length of the reserve area is controlled by the design speed of the main line (see Exhibit 1360-13 and Exhibit 1360-14). In addition to striping, raised pavement marker rumble strips may be placed for additional warning and delineation at gores. (See the Standard Plans for striping and rumble strip details.) Keep the unpaved area beyond the physical gore nose as free of obstructions as possible to provide a clear recovery area. Grade this unpaved area as nearly level with the roadways as possible. Avoid placing obstructions such as heavy sign supports, luminaire poles, and structure supports in the gore area. When an obstruction is placed in a gore area, provide an impact attenuator (see Chapter 1620) and barrier (see Chapter 1610). Place the beginning of the attenuator as far back in the reserve area as possible, desirably after the physical gore nose.
1360.04(5)(c) Single-Lane Off-Connections For single-lane off-connections, the tapered is desirable. Use the design shown in Exhibit 1360-20 for tapered single-lane off-connections. Justify the use of a parallel single-lane off-connection, as shown in Exhibit 1360-21.
1360.04(5)(d) Single-Lane Off-Connection with One Lane Reduction The single-lane off-connection with one lane reduction, shown in Exhibit 1360-22, is used when the conditions from lane balance for a single-lane exit, one-lane reduction, are met.
1360.04(5)(e) Tapered Two-Lane Off-Connection The tapered two-lane off-connection design, shown in Exhibit 1360-24, is desireable where the number of freeway lanes is reduced or where high-volume traffic operations will be improved by the provision of a parallel auxiliary lane and the number of freeway lanes is unchanged.

1360.04(6) Collector-Distributor Roads A Collector-Distributor (C-D) road can be within a single interchange, through two closely spaced interchanges, or continuous through several interchanges. Design C-D roads that connect three or more interchanges to be two lanes wide. Other C-D roads may be one or two lanes in width, depending on capacity. Consider intermediate connections to the main line for long C-D roads. a. Exhibit 1360-27 shows the designs for collector-distributor outer separations. Use Design A, with concrete barrier, when adjacent traffic in either roadway is expected to exceed 40 mph. Design B, with mountable curb, may be used when adjacent posted speed does not exceed 40 mph. b. The details shown in Exhibit 1360-28 apply to single-lane C-D road off-connections. Design a twolane C-D road off-connection, with the reduction of a freeway lane or an auxiliary lane, as a normal two-lane off-connection in accordance with Section 1360.04(5). c. Design C-D road on-connections in accordance with Exhibit 1360-29.
1360.04(7) Loop Ramp Connections Loop ramp connections at cloverleaf interchanges are distinguished from other ramp connections by a lowspeed ramp on-connection, followed closely by an off-connection for another low-speed ramp. The loop ramp connection design is shown in Exhibit 1360-30. The minimum distance between the ramp connections is dependent on a weaving analysis. When the connections are spaced far enough apart that weaving is not a consideration, design the on-connection in accordance with Section 1360.04(4) and the off-connection in accordance with Section 1360.04(5).
1360.04(8) Weaving Sections Weaving sections may occur within an interchange, between closely spaced interchanges, or on segments of overlapping routes. Exhibit 1360-15 gives the length of the weaving section for preliminary design. The total weaving traffic is the sum of the traffic entering from the ramp to the main line and the traffic leaving the main line to the exit ramp in equivalent passenger cars. For trucks, a passenger car equivalent of two may be estimated. Use the Highway Capacity Manual for the final design of weaving sections. Because weaving sections cause considerable turbulence, interchange designs that eliminate weaving or remove it from the main roadway are desirable. Use C-D roads for weaving between closely spaced ramps when adjacent to high-speed highways. C-D roads are not needed for weaving on low-speed roads.

1360.05 Ramp Terminal Intersections at Crossroads Design ramp terminal intersections at grade with crossroads as intersections at grade (see Chapter 1300). Whenever possible, design ramp terminals to discourage wrong-way movements. Locate ramp terminal intersections at grade with crossroads to provide signal progression if the intersection becomes signalized in the future. Provide intersection sight distance as described in Chapter 1310 or Chapter 1320.
1360.06 Interchanges on Two-Lane Highways Occasionally, the first stage of a conventional interchange will be built with only one direction of the main roadway and operated as a two-lane two-way roadway until the ultimate roadway is constructed. The design of interchanges on two-lane two-way highways may vary considerably from traditional concepts due to the following conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
The potential for cross-centerline crashes due to merge conflicts or motorist confusion. The potential for wrong-way or U-turn movements. Future construction considerations. Traffic type and volume. The proximity to multilane highway sections that might influence a driver’s impression that these roads are also multilane.
Provide the deceleration taper for all interchange exit ramps on two-lane highways. Design the entering connection with either the normal acceleration taper or a “button hook” configuration with a stop condition before entering the main line. Consider the following items:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Design the stop condition connection in accordance with a tee (T) intersection as shown in Chapter 1310. Use this type of connection when an acceleration lane is not possible. Provide decision sight distance as described in Chapter 1260. Since designs may vary from project to project, analyze each project for the most efficient signing placement, such as one-way, two-way, no passing, do not enter, directional arrows, guideposts, and traffic buttons. Prohibit passing through the interchange area on two-lane highways by means of signing, pavement marking, or a combination of both. The desirable treatment is a 4 foot median island, highlighted with raised pavement markers and diagonal stripes. When using a 4-foot median system, extend the island 500 feet beyond any merging ramp traffic acceleration taper. The width for the median can be provided by reducing each shoulder 2 feet through the interchange (see Exhibit 1360-31). Include signing and pavement markings to inform both the entering and through motorists of the twolane two-way characteristic of the main line. Use as much of the ultimate roadway as possible. Where this is not possible, leave the area for future lanes and roadway ungraded. Design and construct temporary ramps as if they were permanent unless second-stage construction is planned to rapidly follow the first stage. Design the connection to meet the needs of the traffic.

Traffic data for the proposed design; include all movements. For HOV direct access connections on the left, include the statement that the connection will be used solely by HOVs or will be closed.
Prepare a preliminary contour grading plan for each completed interchange. Show the desired contours of the completed interchange, including details of basic land formation, slopes, graded areas, or other special features. Coordinate the contour grading with the drainage design and the roadside development plan.

1370.01 General This chapter provides guidance for locating and designing median crossovers. Median crossovers are provided at locations on divided highways for crossing by maintenance, traffic service, emergency, and law enforcement vehicles. The use of all median crossovers is restricted to these users. Crossovers may be provided:
•
•
•
•
Where main line safety will not be compromised by providing a crossover. Where access through interchanges or intersections is not practical. As part of region maintenance operations. As necessary for law enforcement and emergency services functions.
For information about median openings to provide turning movements for public access to both sides of the roadway, see Chapter 1310, Intersections at Grade.
1370.02 Analysis A list of existing median crossovers is available from the Headquarters (HQ) Access and Hearings Section. The Statewide Master Plan for Median Crossovers website is: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-accessrequests-training The general categories of vehicles recognized as legitimate users of median crossovers are law enforcement, emergency services, traffic incident response, and maintenance vehicles. In urban areas with a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane adjacent to the median, crossovers may be considered for law enforcement (see Chapter 1410). In areas where there are 3 or more miles between access points, providing an unobtrusive crossover can improve emergency services or improve efficiency for traffic services and maintenance forces. Maintenance crossovers may be needed at one or both ends of an interchange for the purpose of winter maintenance operations and at other locations to facilitate maintenance operations. In general:
•
•
•
Existing crossovers may remain at their current locations. New crossovers should not be located closer than 1,500 feet to the end of a ramp taper or to any structure. This distance may be decreased to improve winter maintenance efficiency based on an operational analysis. Include an operational analysis in the Design Documentation Package (DDP). Crossovers should be located only where stopping sight distance is provided and preferably should not be located on superelevated curves.

Adequate median width at the crossover location is required to allow the design vehicle to complete a U-turn maneuver without backing. Use of the shoulder area is allowed for the execution of the U-turn maneuver. Typical design vehicles for this determination are a passenger car and a single-unit truck. When median barrier is placed in the vicinity of a median crossover, position the barrier to minimize the potential for errant vehicles to cross through the median. (See the Standard Plans for typical barrier layout.) Consider the types of vehicles using the median crossover. The minimum recommended throat width is 30 feet. Use grades and radii that are suitable for all authorized user vehicles (see Chapter 1340). In most cases, 10-foot inside paved shoulders are adequate for deceleration and acceleration lanes. Consider full 10-foot shoulders for a distance of 450 feet upstream of the crossover area to accommodate deceleration, and extend downstream of the crossover area for a distance of 600 feet to allow acceleration prior to entering the travel lane. In cases where the median width is narrower than the design vehicle turning path, widening shoulders may not provide a benefit. Document decisions to provide inside shoulders of less than 10 feet. Provide adequate stopping sight distance for vehicles approaching the crossover area. This is due to the unexpected maneuvers associated with these inside access points and the higher operating speeds commonly experienced in the inside travel lanes (see Chapter 1260). Provide adequate intersection sight distance at crossover locations where authorized user vehicles must encroach on the travel lanes (see Chapter 1310). For the crossing, use sideslopes no steeper than 10H:1V. Grade for a relatively flat and gently contoured appearance that is inconspicuous to the public. Consider impacts to existing drainage. Do not use curbs or pavement markings. Flexible guideposts may be provided for night reference, as shown in the Standard Plans. Consider the terrain and locate the crossover to minimize visibility to the public. Use vegetation to minimize the visibility of the crossover. Low vegetation with a 3-foot year-round maximum height is recommended for this purpose (see Chapter 900). In locations where vegetation cannot be used to minimize visibility by the traveling public, and there is a high incidence of unauthorized use, use appropriate signing such as “No U-Turns” to discourage unauthorized use. A stabilized all-weather surface is required. Paving of crossings is determined on a case-by-case basis.
1370.04 Plan Updates and Approvals All approved crossover locations will be designated on the Statewide Master Plan for Median Crossovers. Contact the HQ Access and Hearings Section for the following:

Plan updates and approvals involve coordination between the Assistant Regional Administrator for Operations or Project Development, the Washington State Patrol (WSP), the HQ Access and Hearings Section, the appropriate Assistant State Design Engineer (ASDE), and the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) Area Engineer (or their designees). Once locations are identified, the region will send a package to the HQ Access and Hearings Section, which should include: a strip map showing MP locations of, and spacing between, existing and/or planned crossovers and interchanges; a justification for the crossover(s); a copy of any requests for crossovers from the WSP, emergency services, or maintenance; and a red and green marked-up plan sheet showing locations. Approval will be given by the ASDE. Construction may not proceed prior to approval. After notification of approval, the HQ Right of Way Plans Section sends the region a reproducible revised right of way or limited access plan that includes the approved crossover location.

Managed Lanes Exhibit 1400-1 Managed Lane Types
1400.01 General As roadways become more congested, many factors—including increased construction costs, right-of-way constraints, environmental concerns, and societal impacts—contribute to the challenge of adding new generalpurpose lanes especially in developed urban areas. One strategy to alleviate traffic congestion and delay is to create a managed lane. A managed lane is a lane or shoulder that is utilized to improve mobility and increase transportation efficiency by controlling the use of the lane or shoulder either dynamically or statically. Use of the managed lanes is restricted by vehicle categories (e.g., bus only, passenger vehicles), vehicle occupancy, time of day, level of congestion, pricing, points of access, or a combination of these restrictions. Research and experience show that implementing a managed lane offers more opportunities to improve mobility and increase transportation efficiency than simply adding a new general-purpose lane. Because every traffic corridor has its own unique operating characteristics, the success of a managed lane project depends on the effectiveness of the operating strategy that addresses one or more of these characteristics:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Improving the capability of traffic corridors to move more people by increasing the number of people per vehicle. Increasing person throughput, particularly during peak hours. Deceasing travel time for all users. Providing travel options for the traveling public. Providing more efficient, safer (less fatal and severe injury crashes), and timely operations including maintenance, emergency services, and enforcement. Improving scheduled arrival for transit, paratransit, carpool, and/or other HOV services.
Stakeholders of a corridor work together to define roles and responsibilities of each stage of managed lane facility development including operations and maintenance of the facility. The managed lane facility type should be determined, agreed upon, and documented by the stakeholder team before the design phase, and early in the planning / scoping phases of project development. Document all decisions made before and throughout the project development process. These decisions are documented when the decisions are made and by whom they are made.

Context Considerations Can apply to a wide variety of transportation contexts and highway types. Access and egress points depend on transit service stop locations and frequency.
1400.02 Managed Lane Selection Managed lane systems provide more options for managing demand. Emerging best practices in managed lanes focus on operational flexibility such as distance-based pricing, time-of-day or occupancy-based restrictions, reversible lanes, and multiple access points. The selection of the appropriate managed lane strategy and configuration should reflect the corridors mobility needs, contextual considerations, and ability for the existing facility to accommodate the managed lane. Coordinate with Region Traffic, Region Management, and local stakeholders (e.g., local transit agency) to assess and identify the appropriate managed lane strategy that can best address the mobility needs, contextual and design considerations. This may require traffic modelling (e.g., VISSIM, DynaMeg, etc.) to fully understand operational benefits and limitations. Best practices that are helpful in understanding the context, needs, and viable alternatives include:
•
•
•
•
•
Establish the travel demand and capacity in order to determine the appropriate design options for managed lanes, Establish the anticipated peak hour vehicle and passenger demand volume for the facility for both existing conditions and design year. Determine the best-managed lane type. Determine the following operational parameters: o Operational period, o Static or dynamic control, o Any vehicular use restrictions; and, o The managed lane’s termini (i.e., location and length). Evaluate the existing cross sections (lane and shoulder widths) to identify opportunities for suitable roadway segments.
1400.03 Managed Lane Design and Operational Considerations The design of specific managed lane strategies reflect the operational parameters, existing infrastructure and design criteria associated with the selected manage lane strategy. The following sections provide information regarding major design elements and/or operational considerations for managed lanes. Additional design criteria and operational considerations for various managed lanes options are provide in various Design Manual chapters.
1400.03(1) Design Standards for NHS Routes The underlying design criteria for NHS routes is provided by AASHTO which does not include guidance associated with some manage lanes. As such, various design elements associated with the managed lane may not meet minimum AASHTO criteria and could require additional documentation and approval. Additional discussion regarding this issue as it pertains to specific manage lane options is provided in their respective Design Manual chapters. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1400-3
Chapter 1410
Managed Lanes
1400.03(2) Ingress and Egress Access considerations such as the design of specific entrance and exit points or allowing continuous access affects the operating conditions within a managed lane and affects the operating agency's ability to modify operating strategies. For example, the I-5 Express Lanes act as a pipeline with a limited number of entrance and exit points, which simplifies operation. When planning ingress and egress for a managed lane, all of the affected stakeholders should be part of the determination of the type of access and if specific entrance and exit locations provide equitable access. New or changed access points to or from a limited access facility may require additional review and approval by HQ Design and/or FHWA. See Chapter 550 Freeway Access Revision to determine if an Access Revision Report is necessary. When introducing multiple access locations and/or changing rules of access, determine the need for providing guidance to the driver, emergency services, and enforcement of the changing rules for use of the facility. Analyze the operational and safety characteristics at terminal access points, as well as where merges and weaves are introduced, in order to guide facility design, facility operations, and mitigation strategies. Additional future access arrangements beyond that provided at the facility termination points should be described in planning or scoping documents. Evaluate the benefits and tradeoffs associated with these additional access features. For example: providing direct access between a park & ride and an HOV lane may be desirable from an efficiency standpoint, but the expense may not be warranted from a benefit cost perspective or exceeds the current budget. Direct access options are discussed in Chapter 1420.
1400.03(3) Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Design Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) collect data, manage traffic, and make this information available to the public through changeable message signs, radio, and internet. ITS’s objective is to make more efficient use of our transportation network. Incorporate ITS into dynamically controlled managed lanes in order to optimize facility operation. In particular, determine how ITS will address management of incidents that may interrupt facility operation, since vehicle breakdowns and crashes typically have a significant impact on facility operations and safety. (For more information on ITS, see Chapter 1050.) Dynamic Message Signs (DMS) are a key part of ITS and are typically used to alert drivers of conditions on the roadway or inform them of anticipated travel times. A dynamically controlled managed lane design typically involves a combination of standard roadway signage and DMS as part of a communication strategy designed to inform the driver about changes in facility access rules, cost of lane, etc. For example, Standard roadway signage can describe where toll lanes start and stop and DMSs can notify drivers of the current toll rates that can change. Any communication strategy about managed lanes needs to take into account that this decision can be challenging for drivers who are unfamiliar with the corridor. A more complex operations strategy can also be employed, such as information on vehicle occupancy, access location, and/or pricing. In the case of electronic toll collection technology, it is also necessary to inform drivers that vehicles must be equipped with a transponder in order to access the facility. Managed lanes may use a combination of price, vehicle eligibility, or access location to manage demand on the facility. The goal is to use DMS (among other communication strategies) to communicate this information to drivers in a clear, concise manner, while avoiding information overload.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1400-4
Chapter 1410
Managed Lanes
For example, information that can be communicated may include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Entrance and exit locations (if specific ingress/egress points are specified) Occupancy requirements (Transit only, HOV lanes, etc.) Operating hours (HOV, part time shoulder, etc.) Toll amounts (toll facilities) Open/Closed indications (Express Lanes) Vehicle characteristics. (Transit only, Trucks prohibited, etc.)
1400.03(4) Enforcement Area Design Enforcement is necessary for the success of a managed lane. Where enforcement infrastructure is missing or inadequate, drivers can be discouraged from obeying the managed lane rules making enforcement more difficult. For example, buffer-separated and non-separated HOV lanes are easy for violators to enter and exit the HOV lane at will, which makes identifying violators difficult. On facilities that use pricing as a management tool, enforcement protects the integrity of the facility operation. Where managed lane rules can change, provide for enforcement strategies that can notify authorities and adapt to those changes. Coordinate with the Washington State Patrol (WSP) and other law enforcement agencies to establish enforcement design objectives, the need for visually verified enforcement, and other design elements that support enforcement. Design features typically associated with enforcement include, gaps in median barrier that allow law enforcement to turn around, roadway shoulders wide enough for traffic stops, and observation points. These features are also useful for emergency services, roadside assistance, and maintenance. Consider the effects of these features on the safety and visibility of the overall facility during the planning and design of enforcement infrastructure. As technology advances, it is anticipated that enforcement of managed lanes will become more consistent and accurate.
1400.03(5) Active Travel Demand Management (ATDM) Managed lanes can be designed to utilize Active Travel Demand Management (ATDM) equipment, which can inform drivers when there is a planned or unplanned change in the managed lane operating rules. For example, the part-time shoulder along northbound I-405 corridor utilizes dynamic signs to indicate when the managed lane is open based on real-time traffic conditions. Where time-of-day rules are part of a managed lanes facility design, evaluate the advantages of ATDM systems, especially with respect to compliance and operational effectiveness.
1400.03(6) Integrated Transportation Opportunities When a combination of interagency strategies are implemented together, management of the entire transportation network is typically improved. For example, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and carpool programs can be combined with managed lane facility design to better accommodate local travel demand.
1400.03(7) Technology With the development of standards for Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC), specifically related to the 5.9 GHz band, integration of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and toll collection will further support the proactive operation of managed lanes.

Managed Lanes
However, in short-term applications, current technology could limit operational characteristics. For example, with current technology the detection and enforcement of vehicle occupancy rule violations on HOV facilities remains a role for law enforcement.
1400.04 Documentation Use the Basis of Design (BOD) to document the:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Existing situation. Identified needs. Design controls. Managed lane design options analyzed. Preferred option choice. Ways the preferred managed lane option will meet the identified needs.
Documentation is done as decisions are made and by whom they are made. It is best practice that the BOD process is all but complete before it is passed on to the design phase. Refer to Chapter 300 for design documentation requirements and approving authorities.

1410.01 General High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities are a Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) strategy that includes separate HOV roadways, HOV lanes, transit lanes, HOV direct access ramps, and flyer stops. The objectives for the HOV facilities are:
•
•
•
Improve the capability of corridors to move more people by increasing the number of people per vehicle. Provide travel time savings and a more reliable trip time to HOV lane users. Provide travel options for HOVs without adversely affecting the general-purpose lanes.
Plan, design, and construct HOV facilities that provide intermodal linkages. Give consideration to future highway system capacity needs. Whenever possible, design HOV lanes so that the level of service for the general-purpose lanes is not degraded. In urban corridors that do not currently have planned or existing HOV lanes, complete an analysis of the need for HOV lanes before proceeding with any projects for additional general-purpose lanes. In corridors where both HOV and general-purpose facilities are planned, construct the HOV lane before or simultaneously with the construction of new general-purpose lanes. For additional information, see the following: Chapter 1230 Geometric cross section Chapter 1240 General-purpose turning roadway widths Chapter 1420 HOV direct access
1410.02 Preliminary Design and Planning 1410.02(1) Planning Elements for Design In order to determine the appropriate design options for an HOV facility, establish the travel demand and capacity, identify suitable corridors, evaluate the HOV facility location and length, and estimate the HOV demand. A viable HOV facility satisfies the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
It is part of an overall transportation plan. It has the support of the community and public. It responds to demonstrated congestion or near-term anticipated congestion: Level of Service E or F for at least one hour of peak period (traffic approaching a capacity of 1,700 to 2,000 vehicles per hour per lane) or average speeds less than 30 mph during peak periods over an extended distance. Except for a bypass of a local bottleneck, it is of sufficient length to provide a travel time saving of at least five minutes during the peak periods.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1410-1
Chapter 1410
•
•
High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
It has sufficient numbers of HOV users for a cost-effective facility and avoids the perception of underutilization (HOV volumes of 400 to 500 vehicles per hour on nonseparated lanes and 600 to 800 on separated facilities). It provides a safe, efficient, and enforceable operation.
A queue or bottleneck bypass can be effective without satisfying all of the above. An isolated bypass can be viable when there is localized, recurring traffic congestion, and such treatment can provide a travel time saving to a sufficient number of HOV users. The efficiency of the HOV facility can be affected by the access provisions. Direct access between park & ride/transit facilities and an HOV lane is the most desirable, but it is also an expensive alternative. Direct access options are discussed in Chapter 1420. Document the need for the HOV lane and how the proposed lane will meet those needs.
1410.02(2) HOV Facility Type Make a determination as to the type of HOV lane. The three major choices are: separated roadway, bufferseparated lane, and nonseparated HOV lane.
1410.02(2)(a) Separated Roadway The separated roadway can be either a one-way reversible or a two-way operation. The directional split in the peak periods, available space, and operating logistics are factors to be considered. A separated HOV roadway may be located in the median of the freeway, next to the freeway, or on an independent alignment. Separated HOV facilities are more effective for:
•
•
•
Large HOV volumes. Large merging and weaving volumes. Long-distance HOV travel.
Reversible separated roadways operate effectively where there are major directional splits during peak periods. Consider potential changes in this traffic pattern and design the facility to accommodate possible conversion to a two-way operation. The separated roadway is normally more efficient, provides for the higher level of safety, and is more easily enforced. However, it is generally the most expensive type of HOV facility.
1410.02(2)(b) Buffer-Separated Lane A buffer-separated HOV lane is similar to a freeway nonseparated HOV lane on the left, but with a buffer between the HOV lane and the general-purpose lanes. The addition of a buffer provides better delineation between the lanes and controls access between the HOV lane and general-purpose lanes to improve operations.
1410.02(2)(c) Nonseparated Lane Nonseparated HOV lanes operate in the same direction and immediately adjacent to the general-purpose lanes. They are located either to the left (desirable) or to the right of the general-purpose lanes. Nonseparated HOV lanes are normally less expensive and easier to implement, and they provide more opportunity for frequent access. However, the ease of access can create more problems for enforcement and a greater potential for conflicts.

High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
1410.02(3) Freeway Operational Alternatives For an HOV lane on a limited access facility, consider the following operational alternatives:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Inside (desirable) or outside HOV lane Lane conversion Using existing shoulder— permanent operations requires a design analysis HOV direct access ramps Queue bypasses Flyer stops Hours of operation
When evaluating alternatives, consider a combination of alternatives to provide the optimum solution for the corridor. Also, incorporate flexibility into the design in order not to preclude potential changes in operation, such as changing an outside lane to an inside lane or a reversible facility to two-way operations. Access, freeway-to-freeway connections, and enforcement will have to be accommodated for such changes. Document the operational alternatives.
1410.02(3)(a) Inside vs. Outside HOV Lane System continuity and consistency of HOV lane placement along a corridor are important, and they influence facility development decisions. Other issues include land use, trip patterns, transit vehicle service, HOV volume, ramp volume, congestion levels, enforcement, and direct access to facilities. The inside (left) HOV lane is most appropriate for a corridor with long-distance trip patterns, such as a freeway providing mobility to and from a large activity center. These trips are characterized by long-distance commuters and express transit service. Maximum capacity for an effective inside HOV lane is approximately 1,500 vehicles per hour. When HOVs weaving across the general-purpose lanes cause severe congestion, consider providing HOV direct access ramps, separated HOV roadways, or a higher-occupancy designation. Inside lanes are preferred for HOV lanes on freeways. The outside (right) HOV lane is most appropriate for a corridor with shorter, more widely dispersed trip patterns. These trip patterns are characterized by transit vehicle routes that exit and enter at nearly every interchange. The maximum capacity for an effective outside HOV lane is reduced and potential conflicts are increased by heavy main line congestion and large entering and exiting general-purpose volumes.
1410.02(3)(b) Conversion of a General-Purpose Lane The use of an existing general-purpose lane for an HOV lane is an undesirable option; however, conversion of a lane to an HOV lane might be justified when the conversion provides greater people-moving capability on the roadway. Use of an existing freeway lane as an HOV lane will be considered only with a Design Analysis. Given sufficient existing capacity, converting a general-purpose lane to an HOV lane can provide for greater people moving capability in the future without significantly affecting the existing roadway operations. The fastest and least expensive method for providing an HOV lane is through conversion of a general-purpose lane. Restriping and signing are sometimes all that is needed. Converting a general-purpose lane to HOV use will likely have environmental benefits. This method, however, is controversial from a public acceptance standpoint. Public support might be gained through an effective Community Engagement program (see Chapter 210).

Public acceptance of the lane conversion. Current and long-term traffic impacts on the adjacent general-purpose lanes and the HOV lane. Impacts to the neighboring streets and arterials. Legal, environmental, and safety impacts.
1410.02(3)(c) Use of Existing Shoulder When considering the alternatives in order to provide additional width for an HOV lane, the use of the existing shoulder is an undesirable option. Use of the shoulder on a freeway or freeway ramp as an HOV lane requires a Design Analysis. Another alternative is to use the shoulder as a part time shoulder. This managed lane strategy allows vehicles to utilize the roadway’s inside or outside shoulder as a travel lane during specified periods and then revert back to a shoulder. See Chapter 1730. The use of the shoulder creates special signing, operational, and enforcement issues. An agreement may be required with the transit agency to limit transit vehicle use of the shoulder to peak hours or to help ensure drivers adhere to conditions associated with use of the part time shoulder. Such conditions may include the maximum speed and/or speed differential between buses and adjacent traffic lanes. Provide signing that clearly defines the use of the shoulder. Institute special operations to clear the shoulder for the designated hours. The existing shoulder pavement is often not designed to carry heavy volumes of vehicles, especially transit vehicles. As a result, repaving and reconstruction of the shoulder might be required.
1410.02(3)(d) HOV Direct Access Ramps To improve the efficiency of an HOV system, exclusive HOV access connections for an inside HOV lane may be considered. (See Chapter 1420 for information on HOV direct access connections.) Direct access reduces the need for HOVs to cross the general-purpose lanes from right-side ramps. Transit vehicles will be able to use the HOV lane and provide service to park & ride lots, flyer stops, or other transit stops by the HOV direct access ramps.
1410.02(3)(e) Queue Bypass Lanes A queue bypass lane allows HOVs to save time by avoiding congestion at an isolated bottleneck. Consider a queue bypass if the time savings for bypassing HOVs is one minute or more. Typical locations for queue bypasses are at ramp meters, signalized intersections, toll plazas or ferry approaches, and locations with isolated main line congestion. Queue bypass lanes can be built along with a corridor HOV facility or independently. In most cases, they are relatively low cost and easily implemented. Where an HOV bypass is being considered at a ramp metering site, consult the Region Traffic Engineer prior to implementation. When an HOV bypass is constructed at a ramp metering site, the ramp meter system should be designed to allow for metering the HOV bypass lane as well. At a minimum, an overhead signal support (Type II) with a tenon position for a signal display for the HOV bypass lane, and sufficient space in the conduit system for additional wiring, should be provided.
1410.02(3)(f) Flyer Stops Flyer stops reduce the time required for express transit vehicles to serve intermediate destinations. However, passengers must travel greater distances to reach the loading platform. (See Chapter 1420 for information on flyer stops.) WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

1410.02(3)(g) Hours of Operation An HOV designation on freeway HOV lanes 24 hours a day provides benefits to users during off-peak periods, minimizes potential confusion, makes enforcement easier, and simplifies signing and striping. However, 24-hour operation also might result in a lane not used during off-peak periods, negative public opinion, and the need for full-time enforcement.
1410.02(4) Arterial Street Operational Alternatives Arterial street HOV lanes also have a variety of HOV alternatives to be considered. Some of these alternatives are site-specific or have limited applications. Arterial HOV lanes differ from freeway HOV lanes in slower speeds, little access control (turning traffic can result in right-angle conflicts), and traffic signals. Arterial HOV lanes are occasionally designated for transit vehicles only, especially in cities with a large concentration of transit vehicles. When evaluating alternatives, consider traffic signal queues and managed access highway class. The alternatives include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
Type of lane Left-side or right-side HOV lane Hours of operation Spot treatments Bus stops
When evaluating alternatives, consider a combination of alternatives to provide the optimum solution for the corridor. Also, incorporate flexibility into the design in order not to preclude potential changes in operation. Document the operational alternatives.
1410.02(4)(a) Type of Lane Lanes can be transit-only or include all HOVs. Transit-only lanes are desirable where bus volumes are high with a high level of congestion. They increase the speed of transit vehicles through congested areas and improve the reliability of the transit service. Lanes that allow use by all HOVs are appropriate on corridors with high volumes of carpools and vanpools. They can collect carpools and vanpools in business and industrial areas and connect them to the freeway system.
1410.02(4)(b) Left-Side or Right-Side HOV Lane Continuity of HOV lane location along a corridor is an important consideration when making the decision whether to locate an arterial street HOV lane on the left or right side of the street. Other issues include land use, trip patterns, transit vehicle service, safety, enforcement, and presence of parking. The right side is desirable for arterial street HOV lanes on transit routes with frequent stops. It is the most convenient for passenger boarding at transit stops. It is also the most common location for HOV lanes on arterial streets. General-purpose traffic must cross the HOV lane to make a right turn at intersections and to access driveways. These turns across the HOV lane can create conflicts. Minimizing access points that create these conflict locations is recommended. Other issues to consider are on-street parking, stopping areas for delivery vehicles, and enforcement areas. Left-side arterial street HOV lanes are less common than right-side lanes. HOV lanes on the left eliminate the potential conflicts with driveway access, on-street parking, and stopping areas for delivery vehicles. The result is fewer delays and higher speeds, making left-side arterial street HOV lanes appropriate for longer-distance trips. The disadvantages include the difficulty providing transit stops and the need to provide for left-turning generalpurpose traffic. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1410
High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
1410.02(4)(c) Hours of Operation An arterial street HOV lane can either operate as an HOV lane 24 hours a day or during peak hours only. Factors to consider in determining which to use include type of HOV lane, level of congestion, continuity, and enforcement. HOV lanes operating 24 hours a day are desirable when congestion and HOV demand exists for extended periods throughout the day. The 24-hour operation provides benefits to users during off-peak periods, minimizes potential confusion, makes enforcement easier, and simplifies signing and striping. The disadvantages include negative public opinion if the lane is not used during off-peak periods, the need for full-time enforcement, and the loss of on-street parking. Peak period HOV lanes are appropriate for arterial streets with HOV demand or congestion existing mainly during the peak period. Peak period HOV lanes provide HOV priority at the critical times of the day, lessen negative public perception of the HOV lane, and allow on-street parking or other shoulder uses at other times. The disadvantages include possible confusion to drivers, more difficult enforcement, increased signing, and the need to institute special operations to clear the shoulder or lane for the designated period.
1410.02(4)(d) Spot Treatments An HOV spot treatment is used to give HOVs priority around a bottleneck. It can provide time savings, travel time reliability, and improved access to other facilities. Examples include a short HOV lane to provide access to a freeway on-ramp, one lane of a dual turn lane, a priority lane at ferry terminals, and priority at traffic signals. Signal priority treatments that alter the sequence or duration of a traffic signal are techniques for providing preferential treatment for transit vehicles. The priority treatments can range from timing and phasing adjustments to signal preemption. Consider the overall impact on traffic. Preemption would normally not be an appropriate treatment where traffic signal timing and coordination are being utilized or where there are high traffic volumes on the cross streets.
1410.02(4)(e) Bus Stops Normally, with arterial HOV lanes, there is not a shoulder suitable for a bus to use while stopped to load and unload passengers without blocking the lane. Therefore, bus stops are either in-lane or in a pullout. In-lane bus stops are the simplest type of bus stop. However, stopped buses will block the HOV lane; therefore, in-lane bus stops are only allowed in transit lanes. Bus pullouts provide an area for buses to stop without blocking the HOV lane. Disadvantages include higher cost, reduced width for the sidewalk or other roadside area, and possible difficulty reentering the HOV lane. (See Chapter 1730 for additional information on bus stop location and design.)

High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
1410.03 Operations 1410.03(1) Vehicle Occupancy Designation Select the vehicle occupancy designation to provide the maximum movement of people in a corridor, provide free-flow HOV operations, reduce the empty lane perception, provide for the ability to accommodate future HOV growth within a corridor, and be consistent with the regional transportation plan and the policies adopted by the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO). Establish an initial occupancy designation. It is WSDOT policy to use the 2+ designation as the initial occupancy designation. Consider a 3+ occupancy designation if it is anticipated during initial operation that the volumes will be 1,500 vehicles per hour for a left-side HOV lane, or 1,200 vehicles per hour for a right-side HOV lane, or that a 45 mph operating speed cannot be maintained for more than 90% of the peak hour.
1410.03(2) Enforcement Enforcement is necessary for the success of an HOV facility. Coordination with the Washington State Patrol (WSP) is critical when the operational characteristics and design alternatives are being established. This involvement ensures the project is enforceable and will receive their support. Provide both enforcement areas and observation points for high-speed HOV lanes and ramp facilities. Barrier-separated facilities, because of the limited access, are the easiest facilities to enforce. Shoulders provided to accommodate breakdowns may also be used for enforcement. Reversible facilities have ramps for the reverse direction that may be used for enforcement. Gaps in the barrier may be needed so emergency vehicles can access barrier-separated HOV lanes. Buffer-separated and nonseparated HOV lanes allow violators to easily enter and exit the HOV lane. Provide strategically located enforcement areas and observation points. Consider the impact on safety and visibility for the overall facility during the planning and design of enforcement areas and observation points. Where HOV facilities do not have enforcement areas, or where officers perceive that the enforcement areas are inadequate, enforcement on the facility will be difficult and less effective.
1410.03(3) Intelligent Transportation Systems The objective of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) ), which is a subcategory of Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) strategy, is to make more efficient use of our transportation network. This is done by collecting data, managing traffic, and relaying information to the motoring public. It is important that an ITS system be incorporated into the HOV project and that the HOV facility fully utilize the ITS features available. This includes providing a strategy of incident management since vehicle breakdowns and crashes have a significant impact on the efficient operation of the HOV facilities. (For more information on ITS, see Chapter 1050.)

High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
1410.04 Design Criteria 1410.04(1) Design Procedures 1410.04(2) Design Considerations HOV lanes are designed to the same criteria as the facilities to which they are attached. Design nonseparated and buffer-separated HOV lanes to match the vertical alignment, horizontal alignment, and cross slope of the adjacent lane.
1410.04(3) Adding an HOV Lane The options for adding an HOV lane are: reconstruction, restriping, combined reconstruction and restriping, and possibly lane conversion.
1410.04(3)(a) Reconstruction Reconstruction involves creating roadway width. Additional right of way may be required.
1410.04(3)(b) Restriping Restriping involves reallocating the existing paved roadway to create enough space to provide an additional HOV lane.
1410.04(3)(c) Combined Reconstruction and Restriping Reconstruction and restriping can be combined to maximize use of the available right of way. For example, a new lane can be created through a combination of median reconstruction, shoulder reconstruction, and lane restriping. Handle each project on a case-by-case basis. Generally, consider the following reductions in order of preference:
•
•
•
•
•
Reduction of the inside shoulder width, provided the enforcement and safety mitigation issues are addressed. (Give consideration to not precluding future HOV direct access ramps by over-reduction of the available median width.) Reduction of the interior general-purpose lane width to 11 feet. Reduction of the outside general-purpose lane width to 11 feet. Reduction of the HOV lane to 11 feet. Reduction of the outside shoulder width to 8 feet.
1410.04(3)(d) Lane Conversion If lane width adjustments are made, thoroughly eradicate the old lane markings. It is desirable that longitudinal joints (new or existing) not conflict with tire track lines. If they do, consider overlaying the roadway before restriping.
1410.04(4) Design Criteria for Types of HOV Facilities 1410.04(4)(a) Separated Roadway HOV Facilities The separated HOV facility can be single-lane or multilane and directional or reversible (see Exhibit 1410-2).

Page 1410-8
Chapter 1410
High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
Lane Widths For traveled way width (WR) on turning roadways, see Exhibit 1410-1.
Shoulder Widths The shoulder width requirements are as follows:
•
•
•
The minimum width for the sum of the two shoulders is 12 feet for one-lane facilities and 14 feet for two-lane facilities. Provide a width of at least 10 feet for one of the shoulders for disabled vehicles. The minimum for the other shoulder is 2 feet for one-lane facilities and 4 feet for two-lane facilities. The wider shoulder may be on the left or the right. Maintain the wide shoulder on the same side throughout the facility.
Total Widths To reduce the probability of blocking the HOV facility, make the total width (lane width plus paved shoulders) wide enough to allow an A BUS to pass a stalled A BUS. For single-lane facilities, the traveled way widths (WR), given in Exhibit 1410-1, plus the 12-foot total shoulder width will provide for this passing for radii (R) 100 feet or greater. For R of 75 feet, a total roadway width of 33 feet is needed, and for R of 50 feet, a total roadway width of 41 feet is needed to provide for the passing.

1410.04(4)(b) Nonseparated Freeway HOV Lanes For both inside and outside HOV lanes, the minimum lane width is 12 feet and the minimum shoulder width is 10 feet (see Exhibit 1410-2).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1410-9
Chapter 1410
High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
When a left shoulder less than 10 feet wide is proposed for distances exceeding 1.5 miles, provide enforcement and observation areas at 1- to 2 mile intervals (see Section 1410.04(7)). Where left shoulders less than 8 feet wide are proposed for lengths of roadway exceeding 0.5 mile, provide safety refuge areas at 0.5- to 1-mile intervals. These can be in addition to or in conjunction with the enforcement areas. Allow general-purpose traffic to cross HOV lanes at on- and off-ramps.
1410.04(4)(c) Buffer-Separated HOV Lanes Design buffer-separated HOV lanes the same as for inside nonseparated HOV lanes, except for a buffer 2 to 4 feet in width or 10 feet or greater in width with pavement marking, with supplemental signing, to restrict crossing. For buffer-separated HOV lanes with a buffer at least 4 feet wide, the left shoulder may be reduced to 8 feet. Buffer widths between 4 and 10 feet are undesirable because they may appear to be wide enough for a refuge area, but they are too narrow. Provide gaps in the buffer to allow access to the HOV lane.
1410.04(4)(d) Arterial Street HOV Lanes The minimum width for an arterial street HOV lane is 12 feet. Allow general-purpose traffic to cross the HOV lanes to turn at intersections and to access driveways (see Exhibit 1410-2). For right-side HOV lanes adjacent to curbs, provide a 4-foot shoulder between the HOV lane and the face of curb. The shoulder may be reduced to 2 feet with justification. For HOV lanes on the left, a 1-foot left shoulder between the HOV lane and the face of curb is required. When concrete barrier is adjacent to the HOV lane, the minimum shoulder is 2 feet.
1410.04(4)(e) HOV Ramp Meter Bypass An HOV bypass may be created by widening an existing ramp, constructing a new ramp where right of way is available, or reallocating the existing pavement width (provided the shoulders are full depth). For ramps with a single general purpose lane and an HOV bypass, consider installing an overhead signal support to allow for the installation of an overhead sign (7.5 square feet maximum) and a ramp meter display for the HOV bypass. For ramps with two general-purpose lanes and an HOV bypass, provide an overhead signal support capable of supporting the installation of a sign (7.5 square feet maximum) and a ramp meter display for the HOV bypass. Ramp meter bypass lanes may be located on the left or right of metered lanes. Typically, bypass lanes are located on the left side of the ramp. Consult with local transit agencies and the region Traffic Office for guidance on which side to place the HOV bypass. Consider the existing conditions at each location when designing a ramp meter bypass. Design a single-lane ramp with a single metered lane and an HOV bypass as shown in Exhibit 1410-4. Make the total width of the metered and bypass lanes equal to a 2-lane ramp (see Chapter 1240 and Chapter 1360). Design a ramp with two metered lanes and an HOV bypass as shown in Exhibit 1410-5. Make the width of the two metered lanes equal to a 2-lane ramp (see Chapter 1240 and Chapter 1360) and the width of the bypass lane as shown in Exhibit 1410-3. The design shown in Exhibit 1410-5 requires that the ramp operate as a single-lane ramp when the meter is not in operation. Both Exhibit 1410-4 and Exhibit 1410-5 show an observation point/enforcement area. Document any other enforcement area designs in the design documentation package. An alternative is to provide a 10 foot outside shoulder from the stop bar to the main line.

Chapter 1410
High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
1410.04(5) HOV Direct Access Ramps HOV direct access ramps provide access between an HOV lane and another freeway, a local arterial street, a flyer stop, or a park & ride facility. Design HOV direct access ramps in accordance with Chapter 1420.
1410.04(6) HOV Lane Termination Locate the beginning and end of an HOV lane at logical points. Provide decision sight distance, signing, and pavement markings at the termination points. The desirable method of terminating an inside HOV lane is to provide a straight through move for the HOV traffic, ending the HOV restriction and dropping a general-purpose lane on the right. However, analyze volumes for both the HOV lanes and general-purpose lanes, as well as the geometric conditions, to optimize the overall operational performance of the facility.
1410.04(7) Enforcement Areas Enforcement of the inside HOV lane can be done with a minimum 10-foot inside shoulder. For continuous lengths of barrier exceeding 2 miles, a 12-foot shoulder is recommended for the whole length of the barrier. For inside shoulders less than 10 feet, locate enforcement and observation areas at 1 to 2-mile intervals or based on the recommendations of the WSP. These areas can also serve as refuge areas for disabled vehicles (see Exhibit 1410-6 and Exhibit 1410-7). Provide observation points approximately 1,300 feet before enforcement areas. They can be designed to serve both patrol cars and motorcycles or motorcycles only. Coordinate with the WSP during the design stage to provide effective placement and utilization of the observation points. Median openings give motorcycle officers the added advantage of being able to quickly respond to emergencies in the opposing lanes (see Exhibit 1410-7). The ideal observation point places the motorcycle officer 3 feet above the HOV lane and outside the shoulder so the officer can look down into a vehicle. Locate the enforcement area on the right side for queue bypasses and downstream from the stop bar so the officer can be an effective deterrent (see Exhibit 1410-4 and Exhibit 1410-5). An optional signal status indicator for enforcement may be placed at HOV lane installations that are metered. The indicator faces the enforcement area so that a WSP officer can determine whether vehicles are violating the ramp meter. The indicator allows the WSP officer to simultaneously enforce two areas: the ramp meter and the HOV lane. Consult with the WSP regarding use at all locations. For additional information on enforcement signal heads, see the Traffic Manual regarding HOV metered bypasses.
1410.04(8) Signs and Pavement Markings 1410.04(8)(a) Signs Provide post-mounted HOV preferential lane signs next to the HOV lane or overhead-mounted signs over the HOV lane. Make the sign wording clear and precise, stating which lane is restricted, the type of HOVs allowed, and the HOV vehicle occupancy designation for that section of road. The sign size, location, and spacing are dependent upon the conditions under which the sign is used. Roadside signs can also be used to convey other HOV information such as the HERO program, carpool information, telephone numbers, and violation fines. Some situations may call for the use of variable message signs.

Chapter 1410
High-Occupancy Vehicle Facilities
Place overhead signs directly over the HOV lane to provide maximum visibility. Use a sequence of overhead signs at the beginning and end of freeway HOV facilities. Overhead signs can also be used in conjunction with roadside signs along the roadway.
1410.04(8)(b) Pavement Markings Provide pavement markings that conform to the Traffic Manual and the Standard Plans.
1410.04(8)(c) Interchanges In the vicinity of interchange on- and off-connections where merging or exiting traffic crosses an HOV lane, make provisions for general-purpose traffic using the HOV lane. These provisions include signing and striping that clearly show the changes in HOV versus general traffic restrictions. (See the Standard Plans for pavement markings and signing.)

1420.01 General This chapter provides WSDOT design guidance for left-side direct access facilities for high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs) between freeway HOV lanes and flyer stops within the freeway right of way or facilities outside of the right of way. Design right-side HOV-only access facilities in accordance with Chapter 1360. Direct access eliminates the need for left-side HOV lane users to cross the general-purpose lanes to right-side general-purpose ramps. Also, transit vehicles can use the HOV lane and provide service to the HOV direct access facility. Providing the HOV user access to the inside HOV lane without mixing with the general-purpose traffic saves the user additional travel time and aids in safety, enforcement, incident handling, and overall operation of the HOV facility. Locations for direct access ramps include HOV facilities on intersecting routes, park & ride lots, flyer stops, and locations with a demonstrated demand. Coordinate with the local transit agencies to identify these key locations. Give priority to locations that serve the greatest number of transit vehicles and other HOVs.
1420.01(1) Practical Design Under WSDOT practical design (see Chapter 1100 and Division 11) an important function of alternative solution formulation is to identify alternatives that address the baseline need while balancing the performance trade-offs identified in the process. Since HOV direct access connections are often added to existing corridors, performance tradeoffs to mainline GP lanes or other elements may be needed and acceptable to provide the new HOV connections. Document performance tradeoffs according to Chapter 1100 and Division 11.
1420.01(2) Reviews, Studies, and Reports The practical design project development process is to be followed when developing an HOV direct access project (see Chapter 1100). Despite the nature of the projects that are the focus of this chapter, most facets of the project development process remain unchanged. For example, early coordination with others is a vital part of developing a project. There are also environmental considerations, Community Engagement, and value engineering studies (see Chapter 310). There may also be reviews, studies, and reports required by agreements with regional transit authorities or other agencies. Provide an Access Revision Report (ARR) (see Chapter 550) when there is a proposal to add, delete, or change an access point. Provide the operational analysis from the report for all flyer stops. For left-side connections, include the commitment that the connection will be used solely by HOVs or will be closed.

Throughout the project development phase, make sure the project:
•
•
•
•
•
Need Statement (see Chapter 1101) and cost estimate are correct. Development process is on schedule. Documents are biddable. Will be constructible. Will be maintainable.
Constructability of HOV direct access facilities is an important consideration during the design phase. These facilities will typically be constructed on existing highways with traffic maintained on-site. Key goals are to:
•
•
•
•
Provide a project that can be built. Plan a construction strategy. Provide a safe work zone. Minimize construction delays.
Consider access to these facilities by maintenance crews. Avoid items that require a significant maintenance effort and might result in lane closure for routine maintenance or repair.
1420.01(3) Left-Side Connections Left-side connections are allowed only when they serve HOVs exclusively and connect to an HOV lane. The higher traffic volume associated with general-purpose traffic is not acceptable for left-side connections. If the demand for an HOV direct access decreases to the point that the HOV direct access connection is no longer desirable, the connection must be closed.
1420.02 HOV Access Types and Locations To provide direct access for high-occupancy vehicles from the HOV lane to a passenger loading facility, there are many options and many constraints. Following are some of the options (selected as being usable on Washington’s freeways) and constraints regarding their use. To select an option, first establish the need, choose possible locations, evaluate site features (such as terrain, existing structures, median widths), and evaluate existing HOV information (such as lanes, park & ride facilities, transit routes and schedules, and origin and destination studies). Choose a location that meets access point spacing requirements and will not degrade traffic operations on the main line. Important constraints to transit stop designs are:
•
•
•
Passenger access routes and waiting areas are separated from freeway traffic. Passenger access to a bus is on its right side only. Passenger access to a loading platform must accommodate individuals with disabilities.
1420.02(1) Freeway Ramp Connection Locations 1420.02(1)(a) Spacing For minimum ramp connection spacing, see Chapter 1360. When evaluating the spacing of left-side direct access ramps, include only left-side connections. Traffic operations can be degraded by the weaving caused by a left-side on-connection followed closely by a right-side off-connection (or a right-side on-connection followed by a left-side off-connection).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1420-2
Chapter 1420
HOV Direct Access
As a general rule, if the spacing between the HOV direct access ramp and the general-purpose ramp is less than one gap acceptance length (see Section 1420.03(6)(c)) per lane, make the HOV lane buffer-separated (see Chapter 1410). Conduct an analysis to make certain that the new ramp will not degrade traffic operations. (See Chapter 550 for the studies and report required for a new access point.) When an off-connection follows an on-connection, provide full speed-change lane lengths and tapers or at least sufficient distance for full speed-change lanes that connect at full width with no tapers (see Sections 1420.03(6) and 1420.03(7)). An auxiliary lane can be used to connect full-width speed-change lanes if there is not sufficient distance for both tapers.
1420.02(1)(b) Sight Distance Locate both on- and off-connections to the main line where decision sight distance exists on the main line (see Chapter 1260).
1420.02(2) Ramp Terminal Locations 1420.02(2)(a) Local Streets and Roads Access to the HOV lane can be provided by a ramp that terminates at a local street or road. The local street or road may incorporate HOV lanes, but they are not required. (See Section 1420.05 for signing and pavement markings.) Consider traffic operations on the local road. Locate the terminal where:
•
•
•
•
•
It has the least impact on the local road. Intersection spacing criteria are satisfied. Queues from adjacent intersections do not block the ramp. Queues at the ramp do not block adjacent intersections. Wrong-way movements are discouraged.
When off-ramps and on-ramps are opposite each other on the local road, consider incorporating a transit stop with the intersection.
1420.02(2)(b) Park & Ride Lots HOV direct access ramps that connect the HOV lane with a park & ride lot provide easy access for express transit vehicles between the HOV lane and a local service transit stop at the park & ride facility. Other HOV traffic using the access ramp enters through the park & ride lot, which can create operational conflicts.
1420.02(2)(c) Flyer Stops Median flyer stops do not provide general access to the HOV lane. Access is from the HOV lane to the transit stop and back to the HOV lane. No other vehicle access is provided. Ramps to and from the flyer stops are restricted to transit vehicles only.

1420.02(3) Ramp Types 1420.02(3)(a) Drop Ramps Drop ramps are generally straight, stay in the median, and connect the HOV lane with a local road or flyer stop. Following is a photo and an example of a drop ramp.

1420.02(3)(b) T Ramps A T ramp is a median ramp that serves all four HOV access movements and comes to a T intersection within the median, usually on a structure. The structure then carries the HOV ramp over the freeway to a local road or directly to a park & ride lot. Through traffic is not permitted at the T ramp; therefore, flyer stops are not allowed. A photo and an example of a T ramp are shown for reference. Also, refer to Section 1420.03(10) for added design information.

1420.02(3)(c) Flyover Ramps A flyover ramp is designed to accommodate high-speed traffic by using flat curves as the ramp crosses from the median over one direction of the freeway to a local road, a park & ride lot, or an HOV lane on another freeway. A photo and an example of a flyover ramp are shown.

1420.02(4) Transit Stops 1420.02(4)(a) Flyer Stops Flyer stops are transit stops inside the limited access boundaries for use by express transit vehicles using the freeway. They may be located in the median at the same grade as the main roadway or on a structure, on a ramp, or on the right side of the main line. The advantage of a median flyer stop is that it reduces the time for express transit vehicles to serve intermediate destinations. A disadvantage is that passengers travel greater distances to reach the loading platform.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1420-6
Chapter 1420
HOV Direct Access
With left-side HOV lanes, flyer stops located on the right side increase the delay to the express transit vehicles by requiring them to cross the general-purpose lanes. However, these stops improve passenger access from that side of the freeway. For additional design information, see Chapter 1730. 1. Side-Platform Flyer Stops Side-platform flyer stops are normally located in the median and have two passenger loading platforms: one on each side between the bus loading lane and the through HOV lane. This design provides the most direct movement for the express transit vehicle and is the desirable design for median flyer stops. This design is relatively wide. Where space is a concern, consider staggering the loading platforms longitudinally. Consider tall barrier to divide the directions of travel or staggering the loading platforms to discourage unauthorized at-grade movement of passengers from one platform to the other (see Section 1420.05(1)). The side platform flyer stop with grade-separated access to each platform is the preferred design.

Chapter 1420
HOV Direct Access
2. At-Grade Passenger Crossings This design is similar to the side-platform flyer stop, except that passengers are allowed to cross, from one platform to the other, at grade. This design might eliminate the need for passenger access to one of the loading platforms with a ramp or an elevator, and it simplifies transfers. The passenger crossing necessitates providing a gap in the barrier for the crosswalk. Only transit vehicles are allowed. Passenger/ pedestrian accommodations must comply with the ADA. Consider an at-grade passenger crossing flyer stop only when passenger volumes are expected to be low. Design at-grade passenger crossing flyer stops as the first stage of the stop, with the ultimate design being sideplatform flyer stops with grade-separated access to both platforms.

HOV Direct Access
3. Ramp Flyer Stops When ramp flyer stops are located on an HOV direct access drop ramp, the delay for the express transit vehicle will not be much more than for a median stop, and passenger access and connectivity to local service transit routes, on the local street or road, are improved. A flyer stop on a right-side ramp works well with right-side HOV lanes and diamond interchanges in which express transit vehicles can use the off-ramp to connect with a bus route on the local road and the on-ramp to return to the HOV lane. However, a stop on a general-purpose right-side ramp with a left-side HOV lane will increase the delay by requiring the express transit vehicle to use the general-purpose lanes and possibly degrade main line traffic operations by increasing weaving movements.
1420.02(4)(b) Off-Line Transit Stops i Park & Ride Stops Transit stops located at park & ride lots provide transfer points between the express transit system and the local transit system, and there is convenient passenger access to the park & ride lot. When a direct access ramp is provided, express transit delays from the HOV lane to the stop are reduced. These delays can be reduced more by providing a median flyer stop with passenger access facilities connecting the park & ride lot to the flyer stop; however, this might be more inconvenient for the passengers.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1420-9
Chapter 1420
HOV Direct Access
ii Stops at Flyer Stop Passenger Access Points To minimize the passenger travel distance between express and local service transit stops, locate local system transit stops near passenger access facilities for the flyer stops.
1420.02(5) Enforcement Areas Enforcing the vehicle occupancy requirement helps the HOV facilities function as intended. Law enforcement officers need areas for observation that are near pull-out areas, where both the violator and the officer can pull safely out of the traffic flow. Consider locating observation and pull-out areas near any point where violators can enter or exit an HOV direct access facility. Examples of potential locations are:
•
•
Freeway on- and off-connections for HOV direct access ramps. HOV direct access ramp terminals at parking lots.
For freeway HOV lanes, locate enforcement areas on the adjacent shoulders so officers and violators are not required to cross several lanes of traffic. Enforcement area guidance and designs are in Chapter 1410.
1420.03 Direct Access Geometrics HOV direct access ramps are different than other ramps because they are usually on the left side of the through lanes and they have a high percentage of buses. Design right-side HOV direct access using the procedures given in Chapter 1360. The following procedures are for the design of left-side HOV direct access. Because left-side ramps are rare and therefore less expected, signing is an important issue. (For signing guidance, see Section 1420.05(2).)
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1420-10
Chapter 1420
HOV Direct Access
When the bus percentage is high, there are several considerations:
•
•
•
When a bus enters the through lanes from the left, the driver has a relatively poor view of the through traffic. A bus requires a longer distance to accelerate than other vehicles. A bus requires a longer deceleration length for passenger comfort.
1420.03(1) Design Vehicles Use the following design vehicles for left-side HOV direct access facilities:
•
•
•
Use AASHTO’s A BUS vehicle for horizontal design. Use AASHTO’s SU-30 vehicle for vertical design. Use AASHTO’s P vehicle for stopping sight distance.
Refer to Chapter 1300 and Chapter 1730, and the AASHTO Green Book for vehicle descriptions and dimensions. Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify turning movements.
1420.03(2) Design Speeds Refer to Chapter 1360 for the design speeds for ramps. Use the design speed of the general-purpose lanes for the main line design speed.
1420.03(3) Sight Distance Provide stopping sight distance in accordance with Chapter 1260. This provides sight distance for an automobile. The longer distance needed for a bus to stop is compensated for by the greater eye height of the driver, with the resulting vertical curve length about equal to that for an automobile. Sag vertical curves may be shortened where necessary. (See Chapter 1220 for guidance.)
1420.03(4) Grades Grades for ramps are covered in Section 1360.03(3). A design analysis will be considered for:
•
•
Downgrade on-ramps with grades increased by an additional 1%. Upgrade off-ramps with grades increased by an additional 2%.
These increased grades help when geometrics are restricted, and they assist transit vehicles with the acceleration when entering and the deceleration when exiting the freeway.
1420.03(5) Ramp Widths 1420.03(5)(a) Lane Widths Use widths for separated roadway HOV facilities. (See Minimum Traveled Way Widths for Articulated Buses in Chapter 1410.) On tangents, the minimum lane width may be reduced to 12 feet.

Ramp shoulder width criteria are modified as follows:
•
•
•
The minimum width for the sum of the two shoulders is 10 feet for one-lane ramps and 12 feet for two or more lanes. The minimum width for one of the shoulders is 8 feet for disabled vehicles. The minimum width for the other shoulder is 2 feet. (See Chapter 1239 for lateral clearance to curb and barrier.) The wider shoulder may be on the left or the right. Maintain the wide shoulder on the same side throughout the ramp.
1420.03(5)(c) Total Ramp Widths When an A-BUS is the intersection design vehicle at the ramp terminal, make the total width of the ramp (lane width plus shoulders) wide enough to allow an A-BUS to pass a stalled A-BUS. This width has two components:
•
•
The vehicle width (U = 8.5 feet on tangent) for each vehicle Lateral clearance (C = 2 feet) for each vehicle
The vehicle width and the lateral clearance are about the width of an A-BUS from edge of mirror to edge of mirror. The table above gives the minimum ramp width (WR), including shoulders, at various radii (R) for an articulated bus. For ramp locations on a tangent section or on a curve with a radius greater than 150 feet, consider the WR width when requesting a reduced lane or shoulder width. For ramp curves with a radius less than 150 feet, check the total ramp width and, if necessary, widen the shoulders to provide the WR width.

1420.03(6) On-Connections 1420.03(6)(a) Parallel On-Connections For left-side on-connections, use the parallel on-connection. A parallel on-connection adds a parallel lane that is long enough for the merging vehicle to accelerate in the lane and then merge with the through traffic. This merge is similar to a lane change and the driver can use side and rear view mirrors to advantage.
Notes: [1] For acceleration lane length LA, see Section 1420.03(6)(b). Check LA for each ramp design speed. [2] Lg is the gap acceptance length. Begin Lg at the beginning of the parallel lane, as shown, but not before the end of the acceleration lane LA. (See Section 1420.03(6)(c) for the length Lg.) [3] Point Ⓐ is the point controlling the ramp design speed or the end of the transit stop zone or other stopping point. [4] For ramp lane and shoulder widths, see Section 1420.03(5). [5] A transition curve with a minimum radius of 3,000 ft is desirable. The desirable length is 300 ft. When the main line is on a curve to the right, the transition may vary from a 3,000 ft radius to tangent to the main line. The transition curve may be replaced by a 50:1 taper with a minimum length of 300 ft. [6] Angle point for width transitions, when required. (See Chapter 1210 for pavement transitions.) [7] For ramp shoulder width, see Section 1420.03(5)(b). [8] The 10 ft left shoulder is the minimum width; 14 ft is desirable. Maintain this shoulder width for at least 500 ft; 1,000 ft is desirable. [9] Radius may be reduced when concrete barrier is placed between the ramp and main line. General: For striping, see the Standard Plans. Ramp lane width shown for illustrative purposes. Determine lane width according to Section 1420.03(5). Verify ramp width selection with transit providers that may utilize these connections.

1420.03(6)(b) Acceleration Lanes The table below gives the minimum acceleration lane length (LA) for left-side HOV direct access on-connections. The buses using HOV direct access ramps merge with high-speed traffic. Acceleration lanes that are longer than normally used are needed. For left-side on-connections, consider at least the normal 10-foot-wide (14-foot desirable) left shoulder for the main line for a minimum length of 500 feet (1,000 feet desirable) beyond the end of the on-connection taper. This gives additional room for enforcement, merging, and erratic maneuvers.

For freeway-to freeway offconnections, provide a parallel lane with a length sufficient for signing and deceleration. The desirable minimum length is not less than the gap acceptance length (see 1420.03(6)(c)).
Notes: [1] For deceleration lane length LD, see Section 1420.03(7)(c). Check LD for each ramp design speed. [2] Point Ⓐ is the point controlling the ramp design speed or the end of the transit stop zone or other stopping point. [3] Ramp lane width shown for illustrative purposes. Determine lane and shoulder widths according to Section 1420.03(5). Verify ramp width selection with transit providers that may utilize these connections. [4] For ramp shoulder width, see Section 1420.03(5)(b). [5] Angle point for width transitions, when required. (See Chapter 1210 for pavement transitions.) [6] Gore area characteristics at drop ramp connections are shown on Section 1420.02(3)(a). (See Chapter 1360 for gore details at other connection types.) [7] The desirable shoulder width is 10 ft. General: For striping, see the Standard Plans.
1420.03(7)(b) Tapered Off-Connection The tapered off-connection may be used, with justification. (See Chapter 1360 for the design of tapered offconnections.)

1420.03(8) Vertical Clearance Vertical clearance for a structure over a road is measured from the lower roadway surface, including the usable shoulders, to the bottom of the overhead structure. Refer to Chapter 720 for information on vertical clearance. The minimum vertical clearance for a pedestrian grade separation over any road is 17.5 feet.
1420.03(9) Flyer Stops Design flyer-stop ramp on-connections as given in Section 1420.03(6), and design off-connections as given in Section 1420.03(7). Flyer stop connections are included in the access point spacing discussed in Section 1420.02(1)(a). Design the ramp to the flyer stop in accordance with Sections 1420.03(3), 1420.03(4), and 1420.03(5). The minimum width for the roadway at a flyer stop is 24 feet. When a flyer stop is in the median, provide enough median width for the flyer stop roadway, passenger facilities, and barrier separation without reducing the width of the through lanes or shoulders (see Section 1420.04). The approval of a flyer stop requires the operational analysis portion of the Access Revision Report (see Chapter 550).

•
Provide a staggered traffic arrow to better describe the left and right turns. Provide pavement marking extensions, using wide lines, through intersections. Use redundant directional pavement arrows at ramp terminals. Paint or use reflective sheeting to highlight barrier terminals. Locate the left barrier end to provide good visibility for left-turning traffic for both the barrier terminal and the on-ramp roadway. Extend the right barrier as far as feasible while providing a 4-foot clearance for the left-turning exiting design vehicle. Provide redundant signing. Provide enlarged warning signs.

1420.04 Passenger Access When designing transit stops, include accessibility (compliance with the ADA), safety, and the comfort of passengers. Minimize pedestrian/vehicle conflict points. Design the whole facility with security in mind by keeping lines of sight as open as possible. Traffic barriers, fencing, illumination, landscaping, seating, windscreens, shelters, enclosed walkways, telephones, and posted schedules are examples of items that contribute to passenger safety and well-being. (See Chapter 1730 for passenger amenities at transit stops.)

HOV Direct Access
1420.04(1) Passengers To encourage use of the passenger access facility for an express transit stop, provide a route that is the shortest distance to travel from the park & ride lot or local transit stop. Failure to do so might generate the use of undesirable shortcuts. To encourage local use of the passenger access facilities, provide direct access from surrounding neighborhoods. Provide grade separations for pedestrian access to transit stops in the median. Consider stairways, ramps, elevators, and escalators, but provide at least one access for the disabled at every loading platform, as required by the American with Disabilities Act of 1990. (See Chapter 1510 for guidance when designing pedestrian grade separations.) The ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities states, “Platform edges bordering a drop-off and not protected by platform screens or guard rails shall have a detectable warning … 24 inches wide running the full length of the platform drop-off.” (See the Standard Plans for the detectable warning pattern.) At transit stops, at-grade crosswalks are only permitted in the at-grade crossing flyer stop layout described in Section 1420.02(4)2. Use traffic calming techniques, such as horizontal alignment, textured pavement and crosswalk markings, barrier openings, and other treatments, to channelize pedestrian movements and slow the transit vehicle’s movements. Illuminate transit stop crosswalks (see Chapter 1040). Where at-grade crosswalks are not permitted, take steps to minimize unauthorized at-grade crossings. Fencing, taller concrete traffic barrier, enclosed walkways, and ramps are examples of steps that may be taken.
1420.04(2) Bicycles Bike lanes on nearby streets, separate bike paths, and shared-use paths encourage people to bicycle from surrounding neighborhoods. Provide these bicyclists direct access to passenger access facilities. Design bicycle access facilities in conjunction with the access for the disabled (see Chapter 1510, Chapter 1515, and Chapter 1520). Locate bicycle parking outside of the passenger walkways (see Chapter 1730). Locations near colleges and universities and locations with good bicycle access, especially near trails, will attract bicyclists. Contact the region Bicycle Coordinator for information on the predicted number of bicycle parking spaces needed and the types of bicycle racks available.
1420.05 Traffic Design Elements Traffic design elements are critical to the safe and efficient use of HOV direct access facilities. The following discusses the elements of traffic design that might be different for HOV direct access facilities.
1420.05(1) Traffic Barriers Separate the main line from the HOV direct access facilities with a traffic barrier. Whenever possible, separate opposing traffic lanes in the facility by using traffic barrier (see Chapter 1610). This is especially important in areas where opposing traffic is changing speeds to or from main line speeds. Concrete barrier is generally desirable on these facilities due to lower maintenance requirements. Provide crashworthy end treatments to the approach ends of traffic barriers (see Chapter 1620). When the operating speed is 25 mph or lower, and where an at-grade pedestrian crossing transit stop has an opening in a concrete barrier, a sloped-down end as shown in the Standard Plans is acceptable.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1420-20
Chapter 1420
HOV Direct Access
When providing a break in the barrier for turning maneuvers, consider sight distance (see Chapter 1260) when determining the location for stopping the barrier. In areas where headlight glare is a concern, consider glare screens such as taller concrete barrier. Other glare screen options that mount on the top of a barrier tend to be high-maintenance items and are discouraged. Taller barrier might also be desirable in areas where pedestrian access is discouraged, such as between opposing flyer stops or between a flyer stop and the main line.
1420.05(2) Signing Design and place HOV signing to clearly indicate whether the signs are intended for motorists in the HOV lane or the general-purpose lanes. The purposes of the signs are to:
•
•
•
•
Enhance safety. Convey the message that HOV lanes are restricted to HOVs. Provide clear directions for entrances and exits. Define vehicle occupancy requirements or other restrictions.
Because HOV facilities are not found in many regions, the signing not only considers the commuter but also the occasional user of the facility who might be unfamiliar with the HOV facility and its operation.
1420.05(2)(a) Safety Much of HOV signing relates to enhancing safety for motorists. Not only are geometrics often minimized due to the lack of right of way, but there are unusual operational characteristics such as the differential speed between the HOV vehicle and the adjacent general-purpose traffic. To allow for the lack of passing opportunities in the HOV lane and the necessity for frequent merging and weaving actions, use messages that are clear and concise, and use symbols wherever possible. Because left-side off-connections are unusual, advance warning signing alerting motorists that an exit is on the left becomes more important. For T ramps, provide traffic control at the T to assign priority to one of the turn movements and to avert wrongway movements.
1420.05(2)(b) Diamond Symbols The diamond symbol is used to designate HOV facilities where carpools are allowed. For all signs, whether regulatory, guide, or warning, the symbol is white on a black background to convey the restrictive nature of the HOV lane and to make the signs more uniformly recognizable. The use of the symbol with all HOV signs also informs drivers that the message is intended for HOVs. The diamond symbol is only for HOV lanes where carpools are allowed; it is not used for bus, taxi, or bicycle preferential lanes.
1420.05(2)(c) Selection and Location The signing details given throughout this section provide for the HOV geometric configurations used within the right of way. Signing for other types of HOV facilities (such as those used for reversible-flow and for HOV direct access between freeways and temporary HOV lanes used during construction) is designed on a case-by-case basis and requires consultation with the appropriate Headquarters and region traffic personnel. In addition to the normal regulatory signs, include HOV guide signs, both advance and action, in the design of signing for HOV direct access between freeways.

Notes: Place signs in accordance with the MUTCD. For non-HOV sign details, see the Sign Fabrication Manual.
1420.05(2)(d) Regulatory Signs Regulatory signs for HOV facilities follow the normal regulatory signing principles: black legend with a white reflective background on a rectangular panel. Keep in mind that messages conveyed by the HOV signs (such as signs concerning violations and those indicating the beginning of an HOV lane downstream) are not necessarily intended only for the HOV vehicle. Therefore, it might be prudent to place additional signs on the right side of the freeway when doing so conforms to sound engineering practice.

1420.05(2)(e) Guide Signs Guide signs for HOV facilities are generally used at intermediate on and off locations to inform HOV motorists of upcoming freeway exits and the appropriate location to exit the HOV lane. For HOV direct access to and from arterials, guide signs are used in a fashion similar to normal arterial interchange signing practice. The guide signs for HOV facilities have a black nonreflective legend on a white reflective background. The exception is the diamond, where the white reflective symbol is on a black nonreflective background. For all HOV-related guide signs, the diamond is placed in the upper left-hand corner of the sign. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Fully utilize available ITS elements in the design of HOV direct access facilities. Need for ITS elements varies depending on project features, such as facility design and operation, and whether the site has existing ITS components. ITS elements that might be applicable to HOV direct access facilities include: closed circuit television surveillance; ramp metering; data collection; exit queue detection and override; dynamic signing; transit signal priority; and automatic vehicle identification and location. Guidance on the development of ITS elements is found in Chapter 1050. Include the region Traffic Office, transit operator, and affected local agency in the coordination for the design and implementation of ITS.

Part-time Shoulder Exhibit 1430-1 Part Time Shoulder Layout [1] Exhibit 1430-2 Considerations for Part-Time Shoulder Utilization [1]
1430.01 General Part-time shoulders are managed lanes that allow vehicles to utilize the roadway’s inside or outside shoulder as a travel lane during specified periods to reduce delays and increase the roadway’s overall person throughput. This is a relatively low-cost Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) strategy that capitalizes on existing infrastructure and often requires minimal investment to implement. Typically, part-time shoulders are utilized at specific locations or along corridors that are experiencing routine congested periods coupled with a lack of sufficient capacity and where a larger capital improvement may be infeasible or cost prohibitive. Part-time shoulders are typically associated with freeway facilities but can be used on other roadways classifications, such as arterials. The operational periods of the part-time shoulders can be statically or dynamically controlled which are described later in this chapter. Access can be limited to certain vehicle classes (e.g., buses only, high occupancy vehicles, no trucks, etc.). Part-time shoulders do not have a minimum or maximum design length. The design length of the part-time shoulder can be adjusted to meet desired operational needs and should reflect logical termini conducive to the roadway’s characteristics. The operational period of the part-time shoulder use can be adjusted to meet desired operational needs and should reflect the solution needed to resolve or help resolve congestion for the target vehicles. The implementation of part-time shoulder will require a Design Analysis. This documentation level is explained in more detail later in the chapter.
1430.02 Viability Assessment Although a part-time shoulder can be an effective, low-cost operational enhancement, this managed lane option may not be conducive to all locations or corridors. When considering a part-time shoulder, conduct an assessment of the corridor’s existing infrastructure within the proposed operational limits to ensure that the facility can cost effectively accommodate or be made to accommodate a part-time shoulder operation. Existing physical features such as shoulder widths, vertical clearances, pavement depths, clear zone, barrier locations, interchange ramps and other roadway features can be important considerations that may influence the relative feasibility and costs of the proposed part-time shoulder. This assessment should include the operational parameters, safety performance, possible environmental considerations, and long term operational and maintenance costs of the proposed part-time shoulder. For example, prior to opening part time shoulder maintenance crews are often required to inspect and clear the shoulder of debris that may otherwise prohibit the use of the shoulder. The introduction of part-time shoulder operations has the potential to shift the type and frequency of crashes along the corridor. Include potential mitigation strategies in the viability assessment (see Section 1430.05(2) for more information). Based on factors like these, the viability assessment may conclude that a part-time shoulder is not a feasible or reasonable option due to existing physical features and associated cost implications.

1430.03 Operational Parameters The following operational parameters provide fundamental functional characteristics for any given part-time shoulder:
•
•
•
•
Operational Period - when the part-time shoulder(s) is operable, Static or Dynamic Control - how operation periods are controlled, Vehicular Use Restrictions – which vehicles can or cannot access the part-time shoulder; and, Termini - the beginning and end of the managed lane.
These operational parameters are described in greater detail below and will affect various design elements associated with the managed lane. Coordinate with the Region Traffic Office, Region Management, and any potential local partners that are affected by the proposed managed lane (e.g., transit agency) to establish optimal operational parameters for a potential part-time shoulder.
1430.03(1) Operational Period The operational period is the specified time(s) when the part-time shoulder is active, and vehicles are allowed to access the shoulder. The operational period(s) of a part-time shoulder can be established based on certain times, traffic conditions, levels of congestion, desired operational characteristics, and/or benefits for the facility. The operational period can be statically or dynamically controlled as described below.
1430.03(2) Static or Dynamic Control The part-time shoulder’s operational period can be statically or dynamically controlled. Both static and dynamic part time shoulder’s provide benefits to peak-period congestion and person through-put; however, dynamic control provides enhanced reliability as the part time shoulder can be opened (or remain closed) on-demand in response to real-time levels of congestion or incidents. The selection of static or dynamic control reflects the Region’s desired level flexibility in operational control/responsiveness and ability to invest in infrastructure and associated operational costs. Coordinate with Region Traffic office affected stakeholders when determining a strategy for a part-time shoulder.
1430.03(2)(a) Static Control Static control restricts use of the part-time shoulder to fixed (non-changing) conditions, such as a re-occurring operational period(s) reflecting historically congested peak periods. Other operational attributes such as operational speed and class of vehicles allowed or excluded can also be fixed. Static controls are communicated via static signing strategically placed throughout the part-time shoulder’s corridor. A statically controlled parttime shoulder does not reflect or adjust to changing needs of the roadway or incidents that block the use of the shoulder (e.g., disabled vehicle or snow storage) and may limit the overall efficacy and/or effectiveness.
1430.03(2)(b) Dynamic Control A dynamically controlled part-time shoulder adjusts the operational period, allowable vehicular classifications access and/or operational speeds to reflect the current operational demand. Such systems can also be used in response to an incident (such as a crash) as part of a Region’s Active Transportation Management (ATM) response strategy. A dynamically controlled system will require additional investment into ATM systems, power, hardware, and associated maintenance/operational costs.

Chapter 1430
New Chapter Part-Time Shoulder
1430.03(3) Vehicle Use Restrictions Use of part-time shoulder can be open to all vehicles or limited to certain vehicle classifications and/or occupancies. The geometric design requirements associated with the part-time shoulder are different depending on the vehicle classification allowed to access the managed lane. Therefore, the selection of allowable vehicle classification should take into consideration the part-time shoulder’s operational needs and underlying purpose (e.g., to reduce overall congestion, promote transit ridership, reduce delay, etc.).
1430.03(4) Termini Termini are the beginning and ending points (or limits) of the part-time shoulders. These should be established based on operational needs and physical characteristics of the roadway. Typically, there are trade-offs between the benefits associated with a part-time shoulder and physical constraints already existing in a corridor. For example, a part-time shoulder on a freeway could start at the end of an on-ramp merge or at the end of a drop lane, and the managed lane could end prior to the next off ramp. Consult with the Region Traffic Office, State Patrol HQ & District office, local transit agencies and other local partners to help determine the best apparent termini for the part-time shoulder.
1430.04 Design Criteria Design criteria outlined in the following sections are allowed with a Design Analysis. The underlying design criteria for the Design Manual is provided by AASHTO, which does not include guidance associated with parttime shoulders. During the part-time shoulder’s operational period, the use of the shoulder for the managed lane will result in shoulders and other design elements not meeting minimum AASHTO criteria. Consult with your ASDE for more information.
1430.04(1) Inside or Outside Shoulder Use A part Part-time shoulder can utilize either the outside or inside shoulder on a separated roadway, such as a freeway. Typically, part-time shoulders utilize a roadway’s outside shoulder since the outside shoulder is often wider than the inside shoulder. On the other hand, inside shoulders have less conflicts with interchange ramps. In locations with barrier, an inside shoulder alignment can help a driver feel more comfortable travelling next to a barrier on the left side of the vehicle.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1430
New Chapter Part-Time Shoulder
The selection of the most suitable shoulder for use should assess the various benefits and trade-offs between an inside or outside shoulder alignment. Consult with the Region Traffic Office, Region Management and any affected stakeholders when assessing the preferred alignment.
1430.04(2) Existing Shoulder Width During operations, vehicles will be using a facility’s existing shoulder for added capacity or through-put. The available shoulder is comprised of two parts: 1) the part-time shoulder vehicle operation width, and 2) the lateral clearance or distance to edge of pavement. See Exhibit 1430-1. Exhibit 1430-1 Part Time Shoulder Layout [1]
[1] Outside shoulder (right side) alignment shown. Inside shoulder (left side) alignment is allowable. [2] Lateral clearance or distance to edge of pavement when barrier is not present.
1430.04(3) Vehicle Operation Width For part-time shoulders, the vehicle operation width is the area of the part-time shoulder that functions as the traveled way during the operational period. See Exhibit 1430-1. Consult with local transit agencies to ensure adequate width is provided if buses are anticipated to utilize the part-time shoulder.
1430.04(4) Lateral Clearance Lateral clearance is the distance from the vehicle operation width to the edge of pavement or to a roadside object (e.g., concrete barrier, or guardrail) whichever is closer. See Exhibit 1430-1.
1430.04(5) Design Speed The design speed for the part-time shoulder is the maximum operating speed that will be allowed during operations and is another parameter that needs to be determined for part-time shoulder operation. Although this can match the posted speed of the facility, the part-time shoulder’s operating speed is typically slower than posted speed on freeway facilities. Slower operating speeds provide the following advantages: 1. Better accommodate the narrower width more commonly provided by the existing shoulder; and, 2. Diminish potential speed differential between the part-time shoulder and adjacent lane of travel that is usually moving slower or stopped. The design speed will influence the part-time shoulder’s allowable shoulder width, stopping sight distance and other critical design elements. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

[1] A Design Analysis will be needed for shoulder width, lane width and other elements. See Section 1430.04. [2] Minimum width of existing shoulder designated as part time shoulder. [3] Includes vehicle operating width plus lateral clearance or distance to edge of pavement. See Exhibit 1430-1. [4] 13 ft minimum for new construction. When transit buses are allowed to use the part-time shoulder, consider entering into an operational agreement with a local transit agency to help ensure drivers adhere to conditions associated with use of the part-time shoulder. These conditions dictate when buses are allowed to access the shoulder. Such conditions may include operational hours in which transit vehicles may occupy the part-time shoulder and/or the maximum operating speed of the bus and/or speed differential between buses and adjacent traveled lanes. For instance, some parttime shoulder applications have interagency agreements with local transit agencies that allow buses to enter the shoulder when the mainline traffic speed is slower than 35 mph and operate in the part-time shoulder at a speed not greater than 15 mph above the current speed of traffic in the adjacent traveled lane. Such operational agreements can diminish potential operational issues associated with the use of a shoulder next to the lane of traffic.
1430.04(6) Stopping Sight Distance As vehicles using a part-time shoulder occupy the existing shoulder and are inherently closer to roadside features, the presence of barriers and/or roadside objects may adversely affect horizonal and/or vertical stopping sight distance. Drivers may also encounter disabled vehicles or low-profile debris blocking the shoulder, or unauthorized pedestrians in urban areas. Assess the part-time shoulder’s stopping sight distances. A Design Analysis is required for stopping sight distances lower than applicable standards. See Design Manual Chapter 1260 Sight Distance for more information.
1430.04(7) Vertical Clearance Assess the available vertical clearance within the limits of the part-time shoulder to ensure adequate vertical clearance is provided. Per Exhibit 720-3, a Design Analysis will be required at any locations not meeting applicable Design Manual requirements.

Chapter 1430
New Chapter Part-Time Shoulder
1430.04(8) Drainage For roadways with an enclosed drainage system, drainage structures are typically located along the facilities shoulders. Drainage structures may be slightly recessed which can be problematic for vehicles and/or unable to handle loading associated with a higher volume of traffic. Additionally, shoulders may experience ponding and/or gutter line flows may extend into the part-time shoulder’s operational width. A roadway’s drainage system needs to be assessed for compatibility or possible adjustment when considering a part-time shoulder.
1430.04(9) Pavement Depth The existing shoulder’s pavement structure may not have been designed to handle an increased volume of traffic. Verify that the shoulder’s existing pavement structure depth is suitable for additional loading associated with a part-time shoulder and adjust accordingly. Consult with the Region Materials Engineer for more information about required pavement depth for this use.
1430.04(10) Interchanges and Intersections Interchanges allow traffic to enter and exit freeway facilities. Outside (right side) part-time shoulders at interchanges can introduce potential conflicts between the part-time shoulders through movements and vehicles attempting to use the interchange’s on or off ramps. Similarly, part-time shoulders, on either side, along arterials that cross intersections may introduce potential conflicts with turning movements especially turning movements with dedicated turning movement lanes. If a proposed part-time shoulder will cross on/off ramps or an intersection’s turning movements, consult with the Region Traffic Office to determine if there are any acceptable/effective forms of mitigation.
1430.04(11) Pavement Markings Pavement markings for a part-time shoulder are the same as for a standard roadway shoulder with a few additional considerations to better accommodate the managed lane. Continuous striping running along the edge of pavement or barrier may indicate the part-time shoulder is a general-purpose lane and may not be appropriate in most applications. Consult with Region Traffic Office to determine appropriate pavement markings, document the recommendations and the final design.
1430.04(11)(a) Termini Striping The termini of the part-time shoulder can be delineated with skip striping.

Chapter 1430
New Chapter Part-Time Shoulder
1430.04(11)(b) Delineating Fixed Objects As part-time shoulders are utilizing the existing shoulder to function as a traveled lane, traffic will be closer to existing barrier or curb. Consider using a supplementary short pavement marking (e.g., limited white stripe) immediately prior to the beginning of the barrier to help alert drivers to fixed object.
1430.04(11)(c) Wide Areas Consider providing hatching at locations where the existing shoulder is wider than the nominal part-time shoulder width. This will help dissuade drivers from occupying or drifting into this additional area.
1430.04(11)(d) Additional Pavement Markings Based on site conditions and/or operational needs, additional pavement markings may be deemed appropriate for use with part-time shoulder. Consult with the Region Traffic Office when assessing appropriate pavement markings.

Chapter 1430
New Chapter Part-Time Shoulder
1430.04(12) Signing Additional signing will be necessary to alert motorist to the presence of the part-time shoulder, provide instruction and manage operations. A dynamically controlled part-time shoulder will require appropriate dynamic signing that reflects changing operational needs. Consult with the Region Traffic Office when assessing appropriate signing.
1430.04(13) Clear zone As vehicles will be occupying the shoulder during the part-time shoulder’s operational period, the part-time shoulder’s functional traveled way is closer to fixed objects or obstructions. Assess the Design Clear Zone for part-time shoulders longer than 400 feet in accordance with Section 1600.02. For intermediate and high-speed facilities, the design speed for a part-time shoulder is typically slower than the roadway’s posted speed. This can result in the part-time shoulder’s clear zone being narrower than the adjacent traveled lane’s clear zone. In these situations, the effective clear zone for the facility is the part-time shoulder’s clear zone or the clear zone of the adjacent through traffic lane, whichever is greater.
1430.04(14) Roadway Cross Slope and Superelevation The roadway’s cross slope or superelevation of the shoulder may be different than the adjacent lane. Verify that the proposed part-time shoulder’s cross slope or superelevation is not more than 2% different than the adjacent lane. See Chapter 1250 for more information.
1430.04(15) Disabled Vehicles and Enforcement Areas The shoulder allows for disabled vehicles and law enforcement to occupy the shoulder under typical operations; however, during the part-time shoulder’s operation period, the shoulder will be unavailable for these critical functions. Where possible and deemed appropriate, provide additional width to accommodate disabled vehicles and law enforcement activities. Consult with law enforcement and maintenance when considering the location and frequency of possible/desirable sites. See Exhibit 1239-2 for more information.
1430.04(16) Rumble Strips Remove existing rumble strips when converting a shoulder to a part-time shoulder. Consult with Region Materials Engineer as to the best method and requirements.
1430.05 Other Considerations 1430.05(1) Environmental Although a part-time shoulder typically utilizes existing pavement, some projects may require minor widening. In either case, environmental considerations need to be assessed and documented appropriately. Environmental issues that are likely to warrant consideration for part-time shoulders utilizing the existing roadway pavement may include, but are not limited to, air quality and noise. Consult with Region Environment staff to ensure the appropriate environmental considerations are fully assessed and documented.

1430.05(2) Safety Considerations Part-time shoulder may contribute to a shift in the type and frequency of crashes along the corridor. Congestion related crashes (e.g., rear ends associated with queueing) may decrease while the risk of crashes associated with driver behavior and geometry may increase. Evaluate the safety performance in accordance with the Safety Analysis guide. Use the WSDOT Safety Analysis Guide Section 7.2.1. Mobility Projects for the analysis.

Metered Shoulder Exhibit 1440-1 Metered Shoulder Layout [1] Exhibit 1440-2 Considerations for Metered Shoulder Utilization [1]
1440.01 General A ramp meter uses a traffic signal at a freeway entrance ramp that allows a measured or regulated amount of traffic to enter the freeway. Drivers are required to stop at the specialized traffic signal before they are allowed to enter the freeway facility, usually being limited to one car per green light. Ramp meters are a relatively lowcost Transportation System Management and Operations (TSMO) alternative for freeways experiencing regular, reoccurring congestion that helps merging traffic enter the facility more efficiently by spreading the merging traffic and introducing gaps. For more information on ramp meters see Section 1360.03(7). Periodically, ramp meter locations have insufficient storage capacity to handle the on-ramp’s traffic volume. In these situations, a metered shoulder may be a viable option that utilizes a shoulder approaching a ramp meter as a temporary additional lane for storage and metered throughput during the ramp meter’s operational period. This can promote the ramp meter’s operational efficiency/flow and help prevent the ramp meter’s queueing from adversely affecting the interchanges overall operations (e.g., ramp meter queue overspill into the ramp terminal intersection and onto local street). A metered shoulder is a low-cost TMSO alternative that utilizes existing infrastructure to add capacity and promote ramp meter operations during peak periods while avoiding a larger capital investment to construct an additional on-ramp lane. Additionally, using the shoulder during peak times allows a narrower ramp and removes a lane merge condition during off-peak times which is most of the time.
1440.02 Design Considerations Design criteria outlined in the following sections are allowed with a Design Analysis. Underlying design criteria for the Design Manual is provided by AASHTO, which does not include guidance associated with part time shoulders. During the metered shoulder’s operational period, the use of the shoulder for the managed lane will result in shoulders and other design elements not meeting minimum AASHTO criteria. Consult with your ASDE for more information.

Part-Time Shoulder
1440.02(1) Inside or Outside Shoulder Use A metered shoulder can utilize either inside or outside shoulder of a ramp. Often, metered shoulders are placed on the outside shoulder because the outside shoulders are typically wider and can more readily accommodate the managed lane. Consider the ramp terminal intersection’s layout, driver behavior and potential effects on the ramp’s geometric configuration when selecting which shoulder to use (e.g., if a right turn slip lane or other features tends to direct drivers towards a particular side of the ramp then the opposite shoulder may be more appropriate to use as metered shoulder).
1440.02(2) Shoulder Width During operations, vehicles will be using a facility’s shoulder for added storage capacity. The shoulder therefore comprises both the metered shoulder’s vehicle operation width and lateral clearance or distance to edge of pavement. See Exhibit 1440-1. Exhibit 1440-1 Metered Shoulder Layout [1]
[1] Outside shoulder (right side) alignment shown. Inside shoulder (left side) alignment is allowable. [2] Lateral clearance or distance to edge of pavement when barrier is not present. Exhibit 1440-2 Considerations for Metered Shoulder Utilization [1] Roadside Features

[1] A Design Analysis will be needed for shoulder width, lane width and other elements. See Section 1440.02. [2] Width of shoulder designated as metered shoulder. [3] Includes vehicle operating width plus lateral clearance or distance to edge of pavement. [4] Increase vehicle operating width as necessary for design vehicle over tracking on ramps with tight radius, as required.
1440.02(3) Vehicle Operation Width For a metered shoulder, the vehicle operation width is the area of the metered shoulder that functions as the traveled way and is occupied by the vehicle during the ramp meter’s operational period. See Exhibit 1440-1 and Exhibit 1440-2. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1440-2
Chapter 1430
Part-Time Shoulder
1440.02(4) Lateral Clearance For a metered shoulder, the lateral clearance is the distance from the vehicle operation width to a roadside object (e.g., concrete barrier, guardrail). See Exhibit 1440-1 and Exhibit 1440-2. Due to the stop condition associated with the ramp meter, the metered shoulder will only be operated in low-speed conditions. In these situations, drivers are typically more comfortable driving closer to barrier or curb.
1440.02(5) Turning Roadway Width Increase the lane width of the metered shoulder as necessary for over tracking associated with the design vehicle on the ramp’s curve(s) (see Chapter 1240). Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify design.
1440.02(6) Disabled Vehicle and Observation/Enforcement Area The shoulder allows for disabled vehicles and law enforcement to occupy the shoulder under typical operations; however, during the metered shoulder’s operation period the shoulder will be unavailable for these critical functions. Where possible and deemed appropriate, provide additional width to accommodate disable vehicles and law enforcement. See Exhibit 1410-4, Exhibit 1410-5, and Exhibit 1239-2 for more information.
1440.02(7) Signing Additional signing is necessary to appropriately delineate and regulate use of the metered shoulder and should be posted as deemed appropriate. Coordinate with Region Traffic to develop and locate appropriate signing.
1440.02(8) Clear Zone Clear zone is available for use by errant vehicles and includes considerations for the probable distance that an errant vehicle may travel under free flow conditions. Ramp meters are typically utilized during congested periods in which operating speeds are lower than free flow conditions and control the on-ramp’s traffic flow with a stop condition. Therefore, clear zone does not need to be assessed based on vehicles utilizing the metered shoulder, unless otherwise determined by the Region Traffic Engineer. Coordinate with Region Traffic Engineer to assess the potential need for mitigation measures.

1510.01 General Pedestrian travel is a vital transportation mode. Nearly everyone uses it at some point in every trip and it is a critical link to everyday life for many. Designers must be aware of the various physical needs and abilities of pedestrians in order to ensure facilities provide universal access. The pedestrian facilities included in a project are determined during the planning phase based on: access control of the highway; local transportation plans; comprehensive plans and other plans (such as Walk Route Plans developed by schools and school districts); the roadside environment; adherence to the Complete Streets legislation; pedestrian volumes; user age group(s); and the continuity of local walkways along or across the roadway. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) require pedestrian facilities to be designed and constructed so they are readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. This chapter provides accessibility criteria for the design of pedestrian facilities that meet applicable state and federal standards.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1510-1
Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
When developing pedestrian facilities within a limited amount of right of way, designers can be faced with multiple challenges. It is important that designers are trained to understand the ADA accessibility criteria to appropriately balance intersection design with the diversity of pedestrians and other roadway users’ needs. Similar to the roadway infrastructure, pedestrian facilities (and elements) require periodic maintenance in order to prolong the life of the facility and provide continued usability. Title II of the ADA requires that all necessary features be accessible and maintained in operable working condition for use by individuals with disabilities.
1510.02 Policy 1510.02(1) General WSDOT seeks to provide appropriate pedestrian facilities along and across sections of state routes as an integral part of the transportation system. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and WSDOT policy is that bicycle and pedestrian facilities be given full consideration in the planning and design of new construction and reconstruction highway projects, except where bicycle and pedestrian use is prohibited. Use a performancebased approach to select and design the appropriate solution to address the need to accommodate pedestrian uses, including those uses associated with projects that are providing for a Complete Streets facility. See Section 1510.02(5).
1510.02(2) Jurisdiction Proposed projects in public rights of way must address ADA compliance as described in this chapter. (See Section 1510.03 for ADA requirements by project type.) Regardless of which public agency has jurisdiction within the right of way, the public agency that is sponsoring the project is responsible for ensuring ADA compliance is addressed on its project. On all state routes outside of incorporated cities and on those with limited access (full, partial, and modified) within incorporated cities, jurisdiction remains with the state unless modified by a maintenance agreement. In turnback areas where the turnback agreement has not been completed, the state maintains full jurisdiction (see Chapter 510, Chapter 520, and Chapter 530). When project work occurs on a managed access state route inside an incorporated city that has jurisdiction beyond the curbs (RCW 47.24.020), design pedestrian facilities using the city design standards adopted in accordance with RCW 35.78.030 and the most current ADA requirements. Document the coordination with the city in the Basis of Design (BOD). Refer to Chapter 300 for information about the documentation.
1510.02(3) Transition Planning Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA require all public entities to conduct a self-evaluation of their programs and activities, including sidewalks, curb ramps, and other pedestrian facilities and elements within the public right of way, to determine if barriers exist that prevent people with disabilities from being able to access programs, services, and activities. If barriers are identified, agencies with 50 or more employees must develop and implement a transition plan that describes the barriers, the modifications needed, and a schedule for when the needed work will be accomplished. Questions about ADA transition plans should be directed to the ADA compliance team in the Office of Equity & Civil Rights (OECR).

Pedestrian Facilities
1510.02(4) Maintenance (Section Rewritten 2023) Similar to the roadway infrastructure, pedestrian facilities (and elements) require periodic maintenance in order to prolong the life of the facility and provide continued usability. Title II of the ADA requires that all necessary features be accessible and maintained in operable working condition for use by individuals with disabilities. Designers must coordinate with the appropriate maintenance disciplines and consider maintenance input as outlined in Chapter 301.
1510.02(5) Design Performance Metrics – Level of Traffic Stress (New Section 2023) The Level of Traffic Stress performance metric applies to Complete Streets projects. When selecting the crosssection layout and dimensions for a Complete Street, first determine the level of traffic stress (LTS) and Route Directness Index (RDI) in both the existing and design (final) condition. The design goal is to provide for LTS of 1 or 2, and a maximum RDI value of 2. See Chapter 1520 for guidance on Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress (BLTS).
1510.02(5)(a) Pedestrian Level of Traffic Stress (New Section 2023) Use the following tables to determine the existing Pedestrian Level of Traffic Stress (PLTS) for the project vicinity, and to determine the type and dimension of pedestrian facilities and buffers or separations required for the design to achieve PLTS 1 or 2. This is called the Level of Traffic Stress. Note that speed referred to in the tables is posted speed. To achieve the required LTS, provide a separated pedestrian facility where the existing or proposed posted speed is greater than 30 mph. Separation can be provided by adding a physical barrier such as curb or traffic barrier or providing a separate facility for pedestrians such as a shared use path.

1510.02(5)(b) Refined Pedestrian Level of Traffic Stress (New Section 2023) Once the Basic PLTS for a project is determined per the tables in Section 1510.02(5) and a design is selected that meets the required PLTS 1 or 2, examine the additional issues in the list below to consider the need to provide design treatments in addition to those described in the Basic PLTS solutions. Most of the issues in the list do not provide a quantitative basis for examining the existing or proposed (design) condition. Therefore, work with Subject Matter Experts to consider each category listed and determine options for addressing each issue in order to reduce travel stress in the design for bicycles and pedestrians. The refined PLTS is considered complete when a design approach to addressing the travel stress issues listed below have been determined and documented through a collaborative process (normally during pre-design), with the intention that those approaches will be incorporated into the design. The designer documents that the Basic PLTS has now been upgraded to the Refined (and final) PLTS for the design.

1510.02(5)(c) Route Directness Index for Pedestrians (New Section 2023) Route directness is measured in terms of a Route Directness Index (RDI). Major roadways present crossing barriers for active travelers that can impose significant out of direction travel burdens. An RDI of one means direct travel is possible. An RDI of 2 means the traveler must go twice the line-of-sight distance to reach a destination because of a lack of crossing opportunities (or because an available crossing is high LTS and/or imposes undo delay). Research shows that pedestrians are unwilling to travel far out of direction to reach a destination. RDI’s greater than 2 strongly reduce the utility of active trips by increasing the travel time, physical effort, and weather exposure a traveler experiences. A minimum RDI threshold value of 2 for state routes is proposed in the WSDOT Active Transportation Plan. While this threshold for RDI has been established in the Active Transportation Plan, the process for evaluating it is still in development. In the meantime, consult Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) on the best approach to incorporating RDI concepts into the project design.

Pedestrian Facilities
1510.03 ADA Requirements by Project Type Wherever pedestrian facilities are intended to be a part of the transportation facility, federal regulations (28 CFR Part 35) require that those pedestrian facilities meet ADA guidelines. All new construction or alteration of existing transportation facilities must be designed and constructed to be accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. FHWA is one of the federal agencies designated by the Department of Justice to ensure compliance with the ADA for transportation projects.
1510.03(1) New Construction Projects New construction projects address the construction of a new roadway, interchange, or other transportation facility where none existed before. For these projects, pedestrians’ needs are assessed and included in the project. All pedestrian facilities included in these projects must fully meet the accessibility criteria when built.
1510.03(2) Alteration Projects Any project that affects or could affect the usability of a pedestrian facility is classified as an alteration project. Alteration projects include, but are not limited to, renovation; rehabilitation; reconstruction; historic restoration; resurfacing of circulation paths or vehicular ways; and changes or rearrangement of structural parts or elements of a facility. Where existing elements or spaces are altered, each altered element or space within the limits of the project shall comply with the applicable accessibility requirements to the maximum extent feasible. The following are some examples of project types that are classified as alteration projects and can potentially trigger a variety of ADA requirements:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
HMA overlay or inlay Traffic signal installation or retrofit Roadway widening Realignment of a roadway (vertical or horizontal) Sidewalk improvements PCCP panel repair/replacement Bridge replacement Raised channelization
The following are not considered alterations:
•
•
•
Spot pavement repair Liquid-asphalt sealing, chip seal (BST), or crack sealing Lane restriping that does not alter the usability of the shoulder
If there is uncertainty as to whether a project meets the definition of an alteration project, consult with the Regional ADA Liaison. The following apply to alteration projects:

All new pedestrian facilities included in an alteration project that are put in place within an existing developed right of way must meet applicable accessibility requirements to the maximum extent feasible. All existing pedestrian facilities disturbed by construction of an alteration project must be replaced. The replacement facilities must meet applicable accessibility requirements to the maximum extent feasible.

Pedestrian Facilities
An alteration project shall not decrease or have the effect of decreasing the accessibility of a pedestrian facility or an accessible connection to an adjacent building or site below the ADA accessibility requirements in effect at the time of the alteration. Within the construction impact zone of an alteration project, any existing connection from a pedestrian access route to a crosswalk (marked or unmarked) that is missing a required curb ramp must have a curb ramp installed that meets applicable accessibility requirements to the maximum extent feasible. (See Section 1510.08(2) for curb ramp accessibility criteria.) A crosswalk served by a curb ramp must also have an existing curb ramp in place on the receiving end unless there is no curb or sidewalk on that end of the crosswalk (RCW 35.68.075). If there is no existing curb ramp in place on the receiving end, an accessible curb ramp must be provided. This requirement must be met regardless of whether the receiving end of the crosswalk is located within the project’s limits. Within the construction impact zone of an alteration project, evaluate all existing curb ramps to determine whether curb ramp design elements meet the accessibility criteria. (See Section 1510.08(2) for curb ramp accessibility criteria.) Modify existing curb ramps that do not meet the accessibility criteria to meet applicable accessibility requirements to the maximum extent feasible. This may also trigger modification of other adjacent pedestrian facilities to incorporate transitional segments in order to ensure specific elements of a curb ramp will meet the accessibility criteria. Within the construction impact zone of an alteration project that includes hot mix asphalt overlay (or inlay) of an existing roadway and does not include reconstruction, realignment, or widening of the roadway, evaluate all existing marked and unmarked crosswalks. (See Section 1510.09(2) for crosswalk accessibility criteria.) If it is not possible to meet the applicable accessibility requirements for crosswalks, document this in the DDP. Within the construction impact zone of an alteration project that includes reconstruction, realignment, or widening of the roadway, evaluate all existing crosswalks (marked or unmarked) to determine whether crosswalk design elements meet the accessibility criteria. (See Section 1510.09(2) for crosswalk accessibility criteria.) Modify crosswalk slopes to meet the applicable accessibility requirements to the maximum extent feasible.
It may not always be possible to fully meet the applicable accessibility requirements during alterations of existing facilities. If such a situation is encountered, consult with the Regional ADA Liaison to develop a workable solution to meet the accessibility requirements to the maximum extent feasible. Cost is not to be used as a justification for not meeting the accessibility criteria. Physical terrain or site conditions that would require structural impacts, environmental impacts, or unacceptable impacts to the community in order to achieve full compliance with the accessibility criteria are some of the factors that can be used to determine that the maximum extent feasible is achieved. If it is determined to be virtually impossible to meet the accessibility criteria for an element, document the decision in one of the following ways, as applicable:
•
Within the construction impact zone of an alteration project that does not include reconstruction, realignment, or widening of the roadway, document the following deficient elements in the DDP: o Perpendicular curb ramp or parallel curb ramp landing cross slope that is constrained by the existing roadway gutter profile and exceeds 2%, but is less than or equal to 5%, that cannot be constructed to fully meet applicable accessibility requirements.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
o
•
Flared side of a perpendicular curb ramp that is constrained by the existing roadway gutter profile and has a slope that exceeds 10%, but is less than or equal to 16.7%, that cannot be constructed to fully meet applicable accessibility requirements. For any deficient element that does not match the preceding description, document the decision via a stamped and signed Maximum Extent Feasible (MEF) document. The MEF document will be reviewed by the appropriate Assistant State Design Engineer (ASDE) and the Headquarters (HQ) ADA Compliance Manager. If acceptable, the MEF document will be approved and included in the DDP.
1510.03(2)(a) Requirements for Crossings with Pedestrian Pushbuttons Coordinate sidewalk and curb ramp work with signal system work so that signal poles with pedestrian equipment meet accessibility requirements for APS pushbuttons to the maximum extent feasible. See Section 1510.11 for additional information on pedestrian pushbutton accessibility. For existing signal systems only, the work required for each signal system location is determined as follows: 1. If no sidewalk ramp work is being performed at a signal system location, no work is required for that signal system as part of the project. 2. If any ramp is being reconstructed at a signal system location, and the traffic signal system is owned by WSDOT, then all poles with pedestrian equipment shall be made accessible for the entire traffic signal system at that location. This may require new or relocated poles, as well as additional ramp and sidewalk work beyond that previously described in Section 1510.03(2). 3. If any ramp is being reconstructed at a signal system location, and the traffic signal system is owned by another agency, only poles with pedestrian pushbuttons serving a crossing served by a ramp that is being reconstructed are required to be made accessible as part of the project. This may require reconstruction of the ramps, landings, or sidewalk areas at both ends of the crossing. The remaining crossings and poles may be addressed if the owning agency wishes to provide funding for the additional work. If APS pushbuttons are not being installed as part of a project, any revised pole locations shall be designed to meet accessibility requirements with a conventional pushbutton installed and with an APS pushbutton installed, so that the pole does not have to be relocated when the conventional pushbutton is replaced with an APS pushbutton. Typically a location that is accessible with an APS pushbutton installed will be accessible with a conventional pushbutton installed, but verification is required. Locations where these requirements cannot be fully met shall follow the procedures for maximum extent feasible documentation as previously described.
1510.04 Pedestrian Circulation Paths Pedestrian Circulation Paths (PCP) are prepared exterior or interior ways of passage provided for pedestrian travel. They include independent walkways, sidewalks, shared-use paths, and other types of pedestrian facilities. Pedestrian circulation paths can either be immediately adjacent to streets and highways or separated from them by a buffer. PCPs that are continuous pedestrians to connect to destinations and do not require them to make multiple street crossings due to incomplete facilities. Examples of PCP are shown in Exhibit 1510-5. When the PCP is located behind guardrail, address protruding bolts. Installing a rub rail or a “W-beam” guardrail on the pedestrian side of the posts can mitigate potential snagging and also serve as a guide for sight-impaired pedestrians.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1510-9
Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
Provide a smooth finish to vertical surfaces adjacent to a PCP to mitigate potential snagging or abrasive injuries from accidental contact with the surface. Where adjacent walkway segments diverge, such as can occur if a parallel curb ramp does not occupy the entire width of a PCP, any resulting drop-offs must be protected to prevent trips or falls. When relocation of utility poles and other fixtures is necessary for a project, determine the impact of their new location on all PCP. Look for opportunities to relocate obstructions, such as existing utility objects, away from the PCP. Exhibit 1510-5 Pedestrian Circulation Paths
Highway shoulders are an extension of the roadway and are not typically considered pedestrian facilities. Pedestrians are allowed to use many state highways. Although pedestrians are allowed to travel along the shoulder in these cases, its main purpose is to provide an area for disabled vehicles, a recovery area for errant vehicles, and positive drainage away from the roadway. Shoulders may serve as a pedestrian facility when sidewalks are not provided. If pedestrian generators, such as bus stops, are present and pedestrian usage is evident, a 4-foot-wide paved shoulder is adequate. Note that detectable warning surfaces should not be installed where a sidewalk ends and pedestrians are routed onto a shoulder since the shoulder is not a vehicular traveled way. Where pedestrian traffic is evident, consider a separate PCP during the planning and programming of the project. Consult with the State Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinator.
1510.04(1) Accessibility Criteria for Pedestrian Circulation Paths The following criteria apply across the entire width of the PCP, not just within the pedestrian access route.
1510.04(1)(a) Vertical Clearance
•
•
The minimum vertical clearance for objects that protrude into or overhang a pedestrian circulation path is 80 inches. If the minimum vertical clearance cannot be provided, railings or other barriers shall be provided. The leading bottom edge of the railing or barrier shall be located 27 inches maximum above the finished surface for cane detection.
Note: Per the MUTCD, the vertical clearance to the bottom of signs is 7 feet (84 inches.)
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1510-10
Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
1510.04(1)(b) Horizontal Encroachment
•
Protruding objects on PCPs shall not reduce the clear width of the pedestrian access route to less than 4 feet, exclusive of the curb.
Note: If an object must protrude farther than 4 inches into a PCP at a height that is greater than 27 inches and less than 80 inches above the finished surface, then it must be equipped with a warning device that is detectable by a vision-impaired person who navigates with a cane. The minimum clear width of the PAR must still be provided.
1510.04(1)(c) Post-Mounted Objects
•
Objects mounted on posts, at a height that is greater than 27 inches and less than 80 inches above the finished surface, shall not protrude more than 4 inches into a pedestrian circulation path.
Note: If an object must protrude farther than 4 inches into a pedestrian circulation path at a height that is greater than 27 inches and less than 80 inches above the finished surface, then it must be equipped with a warning device that is detectable by a vision-impaired person who navigates with a cane. The minimum clear width of the pedestrian access route must still be provided.
•
Where a sign or other obstruction on a pedestrian circulation path is mounted on multiple posts, and the clear distance between the posts is greater than 12 inches, the lowest edge of the sign or obstruction shall be either 27 inches maximum or 80 inches minimum above the finished surface.
1510.05 Pedestrian Access Routes All PCPs are required to contain a continuous Pedestrian Access Route (PAR) (see Exhibit 1510-6) that connects to all adjacent pedestrian facilities, elements, and spaces that are required to be accessible. PARs consist of one or more of the following pedestrian facilities: walkways/sidewalks, crosswalks, curb ramps (excluding flares), landings, pedestrian overpasses/underpasses, access ramps, elevators, and platform lifts.

Pedestrian Facilities
1510.05(1) Accessibility Criteria for Pedestrian Access Routes 1510.05(1)(a) Clear Width The minimum continuous and unobstructed clear width of a Pedestrian Access Route (PAR) within a Pedestrian Circulation Path (PCP) shall be 4 feet, exclusive of the width of the curb. PARs that are less than 5 feet in clear width, exclusive of the width of the curb, shall provide passing spaces at intervals no farther apart than 200 feet. Passing spaces shall be at least 5 feet wide, for a minimum distance of 5 feet. PARs that are less than 5 feet in clear width, exclusive of the width of the curb, shall provide passing spaces at intervals no farther apart than 200 feet. Passing spaces shall be 5 feet wide minimum, for a minimum distance of 5 feet. Exhibit 1510-7 Obstructed Pedestrian Access Route
Provide wheel stops or a wider sidewalk to address encroachments into the PAR.
1510.05(1)(b) Cross Slope and Grade The cross slope of a PAR shall be 2% maximum. Note: It is recommended that cross slopes be designed to be less than the allowed maximum to allow for some tolerance in construction. For example: design for a maximum 1.5% cross slope (rather than 2% maximum). Exceptions: 1. Midblock crosswalks – The cross slope of the crosswalk and any connected curb ramp is permitted to match street or highway grade. 2. Crosswalks without stop sign control – The cross slope of the crosswalk can be up to 5% maximum. Where a PAR is contained within the highway right of way, its grade shall not exceed the general grade established for the adjacent roadway. Exception: The maximum grade in a crosswalk (marked or unmarked) is 5%, measured parallel to the direction of pedestrian travel in the crosswalk. Where a PAR is not contained within the highway right of way, the maximum running slope allowed is 5% unless designed as an access ramp. (See Section 1510.15(2) for access ramp accessibility criteria.) For additional criteria when a PAR is supported by a structure, see Section 1510.14.

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
1510.05(1)(c) Surface The surface of the PAR shall be firm, stable, and slip resistant. Use hard surfaces like cement concrete or asphalt concrete. Crushed gravel and other non-pavement surfaces are not considered a firm or stable surface. Vertical alignment shall be planar within curb ramps, landings, and gutter areas within the PAR and within clear spaces for accessible pedestrian signals, street furniture, and operable parts. Grade breaks shall be flush. Surface discontinuities (see Exhibit 1510-8 and Exhibit 1510-9) on existing surfaces in the pedestrian access route (such as at the joints of settled or upheaved sidewalk panels) may not exceed ½ inch maximum. Vertical discontinuities between ¼ inch and ½ inch maximum shall be beveled at 2H:1V or flatter. Apply the bevel across the entire level change. Exception: No surface discontinuity is allowed at the connection between an existing curb ramp or landing and the gutter. This grade break must be flush. Exhibit 1510-8 Beveling Options

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
Exhibit 1510-9 Surface Discontinuities (Noncompliant)
Gratings, access covers, utility objects, and other appurtenances shall not be located on curb ramps, landings, or gutters within the PAR. Locate gratings, access covers, utility objects, and other appurtenances outside the PAR on walkways and sidewalks. Where this is not possible, ensure covers, grates, and lids are designed to be slip resistant and are installed flush with the surrounding surface (see the Standard Plans).
1510.05(1)(d) Horizontal Openings Any sidewalk joints or gratings that are in the PAR shall not permit passage of a sphere more than ½ inch in diameter. Elongated openings shall be placed so that the long dimension is perpendicular to the dominant direction of travel. Openings for wheel flanges at pedestrian crossings of nonfreight rail track shall be 2½ inches maximum (3 inches maximum for freight rail track). For additional requirements when a PAR crosses a railroad, see Section 1510.13.
1510.06 Linear Pedestrian Facilities (New Section 2023) Pedestrian facilities refer to constructed features built to accommodate pedestrian travel that run generally along the same direction as the vehicle route or street. They typically serve as the Pedestrian Circulation Path (See Section 1510.04 for PCP accessibility criteria). Sidewalks, at-grade walkways with biofiltration swale, and shared-use paths are three standard types of linear pedestrian facilities. Shared-use paths may have “trail” in their names, but they are not trails. Trails, (Exp. the Pacific Crest Trail), are intended to provide and support recreational experiences and do not provide the necessary infrastructure for ADA accessibility. Parts of trails might be accessible, but trails don't need to be accessible. Trails do not usually have a firm, stable, or slip resistant surfaces, nor do they usually have accessible cross slopes, or running slopes. See Section 1710.05(17) Trails. Shoulders may provide pedestrian access, but because of the nature of the shared use with vehicles, they are not considered dedicated pedestrian facilities.

Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian facilities (sidewalks and shared-use paths) are selected to provide the required level of traffic stress as well as connections to a network of facilities in order to access travel destinations. In addition to LTS, vehicle speed, volume, and number of travel lanes are also indicators that, in combination with input from subject matter experts, help inform the selection of facility type. The following table provides a summary of these factors and likely candidates for facilities to consider in consultation with the project advisory committee and subject matter experts.

1510.07 Sidewalks (Section Rewritten 2023) A sidewalk is an independent constructed facility along a highway, road, or street intended for use by pedestrians, which is usually elevated above the vehicle travelled way, and may or may not include a buffer. Sidewalks are one type of Pedestrian Circulation Path (PCP). (See Section 1510.04 for PCP accessibility criteria.) Plan the design of sidewalks carefully to include a PAR that provides universal access. (See Section 1510.05 for PAR accessibility criteria.) Sidewalk design elements are found in Exhibit 1510-13 and details for raised sidewalks are shown in the Standard Plans. Wherever appropriate, make sidewalks continuous and provide access to side streets. TA buffer is a space between the edge of the edge of pavement or back of curb and sidewalk that separates vehicle and pedestrian traffic and may be used to reduce the Pedestrian Level of Traffic Stress (PLTS) of the facility. Buffers often contain plantings, alternative type pavement, drainage treatments, and/or utilities.

Pedestrian Facilities
1510.07(1) Designing Sidewalks and Buffers When designing sidewalks, first determine the required sidewalk and buffer widths to achieve the required level of traffic stress (LTS) (see Section 1510.02(5)). Plan the design of sidewalks to include a Pedestrian Circulation Path (PCP) (see Section 1510.05) and a Pedestrian Access Route (see Section 1510.05) enabling universal access. (See Section 1510.05 for PAR accessibility criteria.) Sidewalk design elements are found in Exhibit 1510-13 and details for raised sidewalks are shown in Standard Plans.

* If the dimensions shown exceed the dimensions given by the PLTS tables, then use the values in the PLTS table as the minimum allowable dimensions. The WSDOT minimum sidewalk width is 5 feet (excluding the curb), but providing wider sidewalks is encouraged. Wider sidewalks are desirable on major arterials, in central business districts, and along parks, schools, and other major pedestrian generators. See Exhibit 1510-2. When sidewalks abut storefronts, provide additional width to accommodate window-shoppers and to avoid conflicts with opening doors and pedestrians entering or leaving the buildings. When a buffer (vegetated as well as alternate pavement) is provided, the buffer should be at least 3 feet wide (excluding the curb). Document the decision to reduce a buffer width to less than 3 feet in the DDP. If trees or shrubs are included in a buffer, coordinate with the region or HQ Landscape Architect. Follow Design Clear Zone (see Chapter 1600) and Sight Distance (see Chapter 1260). Design subsurface infrastructure (such as structural soils) and select plants whose root systems do not cause sidewalks to buckle or heave. Coordinate buffer planting with maintenance personnel. Where possible, strive to accommodate snow storage while keeping the pedestrian route free of snow accumulation. Make sure maintenance access is not obstructed. Shoulders, bike lanes, and on-street parking are not considered buffers, but they do offer the advantage of further separation between vehicles and pedestrians.

Notes: If vertical drop is within the Design Clear Zone and the posted speed is > 35 mph, then barrier may be needed (see Chapter 1600). If vertical drop is > 2 feet 6 inches and barrier is not needed, then railing is indicated. If vertical drop is < 2 feet 6 inches and barrier is not needed, then a 4-inch curb at back of sidewalk is adequate. General: See the Standard Plan F-30.10 for details on slopes at back of sidewalk. See Section 1239.03 for selecting side slopes. Sidewalks may be sloped away from the roadway for stormwater treatment (see the Highway Runoff Manual).

1510.07(2) Sidewalks at Driveways Provide a Pedestrian Access Route (PAR) where driveways intersect a Pedestrian Circulation Path (PCP) (see Exhibit 1510-14). The Standard Plan F-80.10 shows details of driveway designs that provide a PAR. (See Section 1510.04 and Section 1510.05 for accessibility criteria.) When a driveway is signalized as part of an intersection, contact the Region ADA Liaison for guidance. Exhibit 1510-14 Typical Driveways
There are several types of driveway approach designs such as: drop curb (left picture), using a buffer (center picture), and a radius turnout (right picture).
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1510-20
Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
Exhibit 1510-15 Driveway Approach Designs (New Exhibit 2023)
Sidewalks behind the buffer zone are the preferred design. This places the driveway’s grade transition within a buffer so the sidewalk path can remain free of grade changes along its course.
Wide sidewalks can function similar to sidewalks with buffers if they have sufficient room to accommodate a driveway ramp and also allow a full PAR width.
Where buffers or wide sidewalks can’t be provided, the sidewalk alignment can go around the sloped part of the driveway to maintain the running slope and the cross slope, although the deviation from the straight path is less convenient for pedestrians. Verify that the widths of the diagonal parts are at least as wide as the sidewalk.
Depressed sidewalks are the least desirable option as the pedestrian needs walk down and then back up. This design may be necessary in some locations due to local ordinances, or rightof-way or grade constraints.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1510-21
Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
1510.07(2)(a) Radius Turnout Driveways (New Section 2023) Driveways serving larger developments and commercial centers frequently function more like roadway intersections in terms of volume and complexity of turning movements. The curbs often turn in to the adjacent parcel at these locations similar to roadway intersections. Sidewalks intersecting radius turnout driveways must either provide a raised crosswalk (preferred) or descend to the level of the driveway via a curb ramp (See Section 1510.04 and Section 1510.05 for accessibility criteria). When a driveway is signalized as part of an intersection, contact the Region ADA Liaison for guidance. The characteristics of a radius turnout driveway may increase the PLTS of the PAR at that location, even if the PLTS along the rest of the route is low. Consult with the project advisory team to determine if an intersection crossing treatment (e.g., RRFBs, protection islands, etc.) may be used to maintain a low LTS at these locations.
1510.07(3) Shared-Use Paths (New Section 2023) A shared-use path is a pedestrian facility designed for both transportation and recreation purposes and are used by pedestrians, bicyclists, skaters, equestrians, and other users. See Chapter 1515 for more information about designing shared-use paths.
1510.07(4) Shoulders (New Section 2023) Highway shoulders are not pedestrian facilities; they are an extension of the roadway cross section with several functions (see exhibit 1239-2). Shoulders are not usually considered accessible due to typical cross slopes and profile grades; however, pedestrians can use shoulders where they’re not explicitly restricted.
1510.08 Curb Ramps Curb ramps provide an accessible connection from a raised sidewalk down to the roadway surface. A curb ramp, or combination of curb ramps, is required to connect PAR to crosswalks (marked or unmarked) where curbs and sidewalks are present, except where pedestrian crossing is prohibited. (See Section 1510.09(2)(c) for guidance on closed crossings and Exhibit 1510-25 for an example.) For new construction projects, provide a curb ramp oriented in each direction of pedestrian travel within the width of the crosswalk it serves. For alteration projects, a curb ramp oriented in each direction of pedestrian travel within the width of the crosswalk it serves is desirable. Every curb ramp must have a curb ramp at the other end of the crosswalk it serves unless there is no curb or sidewalk on that side (RCW 35.68.075). Curb ramps are also required at midblock crossings where curbs and sidewalks are present.
1510.08(1) Types of Curb Ramps Different types of curb ramps can be used: perpendicular, parallel, and combination. Carefully analyze and take into consideration drainage patterns, especially when designing a parallel or combination curb ramp installation.

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
1510.08(1)(a) Perpendicular Curb Ramp Perpendicular curb ramps (see Exhibit 1510-16 and Exhibit 1510-17) are aligned to cut through the curb and meet the gutter grade break at a right angle. The landing is to be located at the top of the curb ramp.
i Advantages
•
•
•
•
Having the path of travel aligned to cross the gutter grade break at a right angle facilitates usage by individuals with mobility devices. The height of the ramp run relative to the gutter elevation may facilitate drainage. The height of the ramp run relative to the gutter elevation discourages vehicular traffic from cutting across the corner. On small-radius corners, the ramp alignment may be more closely aligned with the alignment of the crosswalk markings, which facilitates direction finding for the visually impaired.
ii Disadvantages
•
•
•
The ramp run and landing might not fit within available right of way. On small-radius corners, the flares may not fit between closely spaced perpendicular curb ramps. On larger-radius corners, there will be less facilitation of direction finding for the visually impaired due to the requirement that the path of travel cross the gutter grade break at a right angle.

Pedestrian Facilities
Exhibit 1510-17 Perpendicular Curb Ramp Common Elements
1510.08(1)(b) Parallel Curb Ramp Parallel curb ramps (see Exhibit 1510-18 and Exhibit 1510-19) are aligned with their running slope in line with the direction of sidewalk travel, parallel to the curb. The landing is located at the bottom of the curb ramp.
i Advantages
•
•
•
Requires minimal right of way. Allows ramps to be extended to reduce ramp grade within available right of way. Provides edges on the side of the ramp that are detectable to vision-impaired pedestrians who navigate with a cane.
ii Disadvantages
•
•
Depending on the style of parallel curb ramp, pedestrian through traffic on the sidewalk may need to negotiate two ramp grades instead of one, possibly making it more difficult to traverse for some. The installation of additional drainage features in the upstream gutter line may be necessary to prevent the accumulation of water or debris in the landing at the bottom of the ramp.

Pedestrian Facilities
1510.08(1)(c) Combination Curb Ramp Combination curb ramps (see Exhibit 1510-20) combine the use of perpendicular and parallel types of curb ramps. Landings may be shared by multiple ramps in this application. Buffer areas and pedestrian curbing that define the pedestrian path of travel are inherent design elements for this type of curb ramp.
i Advantages
•
•
•
•
•
Allows the elevation difference between the sidewalk and the gutter line to be transitioned with multiple ramps. This can help achieve compliant ramp running slopes. Provides additional locations in the gutter line along the radius where drainage structures can be placed outside the pedestrian access route due to the well-defined pedestrian paths of travel. Can be constructed within available right of way when the right of way boundary is located at the back of the existing sidewalk, provided sufficient buffer width is available on the roadway side of the sidewalk. Provides a way to avoid the relocation of existing features such as utility poles, fire hydrants, and signal poles by incorporating those features into the buffer areas. The pedestrian curbing that defines the buffer areas and forms the curb returns for the perpendicular ramp connections facilitates direction finding for a vision-impaired person who navigates with a cane.
ii Disadvantages
•
•
Has a higher construction cost than other curb ramp types due to extensive use of curbing and a larger footprint. Due to generally flatter ramp grades and multi-tiered ramp elements, inadequate drainage and accumulation of debris can occur.

1510.08(2) Accessibility Criteria for Curb Ramps The accessibility criteria for PCPs and PARs described in Section 1510.04 and Section 1510.05 also apply to curb ramps, except where superseded by the following additional accessibility criteria specifically for curb ramps.
1510.08(2)(a) Clear Width The clear width of curb ramps and their landings shall be 4 feet minimum, excluding flares.
1510.08(2)(b) Running Slope The running slope of curb ramps shall not exceed 8.3% maximum. Note: It is recommended that running slopes be designed to be less than the allowed maximum to allow for some tolerance in construction. For example, design for a maximum 7.5% curb ramp running slope (rather than the 8.3% maximum). The running slope of a perpendicular curb ramp shall intersect the gutter grade break at a right angle at the back of curb. If the maximum running slope of 8.3% cannot be achieved due to existing physical constraints, the ramp shall be as flat as possible, but the ramp length is not required to exceed 15 feet.
1510.08(2)(c) Cross Slope The cross slope of curb ramp shall not be greater than 2%, measured perpendicular to the direction of travel. Note: It is recommended that cross slopes be designed to be less than the allowed maximum to allow for some tolerance in construction. For example, design for a maximum 1.5% cross slope (rather than the 2% maximum). Exception: The cross slopes of curb ramps at midblock crossings are permitted to match the street or highway grade.
1510.08(2)(d) Landing A level landing is required either at the top of a perpendicular ramp or the bottom of a parallel curb ramp, as noted in Section 1510.08(1)(a) and Section 1510.08(1)(b) for the type of curb ramp used. Provide a landing that is at least 4 feet minimum length by 4 feet minimum width. The running and cross slopes of a curb ramp landing shall be 2% maximum. Note: It is recommended that cross slopes be designed to be less than the allowed maximum to allow for some tolerance in construction. For example, design for a maximum 1.5% cross slope (rather than 2% maximum). Exception: The running and cross slopes of landings for curb ramps at midblock crossings are permitted to match the street or highway grade.
1510.08(2)(e) Flares Flared sides are to be used only where a PCP crosses the curb ramp from the side. Flared sides are to have a slope of 10% maximum, measured parallel to the back of curb.
1510.08(2)(f) Counter Slope The counter slope of the gutter or street at the foot of a curb ramp or landing shall be 5% maximum.

1510.08(2)(g) Detectable Warning Surfaces Detectable warning surfaces are required where curb ramps or landings connect to a roadway. (See the Standard Plans for placement details and other applications.) They are also required where commercial driveways are provided with yield or stop control. Detectable warning surfaces shall contrast visually (either light-on-dark or dark-on-light) with the adjacent walkway surface, gutter, street, or highway. Note: Federal yellow is the color used to achieve visual contrast on WSDOT projects. Within cities, other contrasting colors may be used if requested by the city.
1510.08(2)(h) Surfaces Surfaces of curb ramps shall be firm, stable, and slip resistant. Gratings, access covers, utility objects, and other appurtenances shall not be located on curb ramps, landings, or gutters within the pedestrian access route.
1510.08(2)(i) Grade Breaks Vertical alignment shall be planar within curb ramp runs, landings, and gutter areas within the PAR. Grade breaks at the top and bottom of curb ramps shall be perpendicular to the direction of travel on the ramp run. Surface slopes that meet at grade breaks shall be flush.
1510.08(2)(j) Clear Space Beyond the curb face where the bottom of a curb ramp or landing meets the gutter, a clear space of 4 feet minimum by 4 feet minimum shall be provided in the roadway that is contained within the width of the crosswalk and located wholly outside the parallel vehicle travel lane. Note: Clear space is easily achieved when a separate curb ramp is provided, oriented in each direction of pedestrian travel within the width of the crosswalk it serves.
1510.08(3) Curb Ramp Drainage Surface water runoff from the roadway can flood the lower end of a curb ramp. Provide catch basins or inlets to prevent ponding at the base of curb ramps and landings. Exhibit 1510-21 shows examples of drainage structure locations. Verify that drainage structures will not be located in the PAR.

•
•
•

•
•
Minimize turning radii to keep speeds low. (See Section 1510.09(5)(a) for mountable truck apron and Chapter 1300 for design vehicle guidance.) Place crosswalks so they are visible and connect to the adjacent pedestrian facilities. Provide sight distance (driver to pedestrian; pedestrian to driver). Use a separate left-turn phase along with a “WALK/DON’T WALK” signal. Restrict or prohibit turns. Shorten crossing distance. Use a raised median/cut-through island for a pedestrian refuge. Use accessible pedestrian signals (APS). Use signing and delineation as determined by the region Traffic Engineer. Place crosswalks as close as practicable to the intersection traveled way. Provide pedestrian-level lighting. Provide crosswalks in the direct path of travel to transit stops. Provide a PAR that meets the accessibility criteria at all pedestrian crossings.

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
1510.09(2) Crosswalks at Intersections Provide a PAR within marked and unmarked pedestrian crossings. (See Section 1510.05 for accessibility criteria for PAR.) Crosswalks are provided on all legs of an intersection, except in rare cases. There are normally three crosswalks at a “T” intersection and four crosswalks at a “four-leg” intersection. For pedestrian route continuity, the minimum number of crosswalks is two at “T” intersections and three at “four-leg” intersections. One example where crosswalks might not be provided on all interaction legs is a diamond interchange with heavy left-turn movements from the off-ramp approach. (See Section 1510.09(2)(c) for Closed Crossings policy.) The Traffic Manual provides recommendations for determining pedestrian markings based on lane configuration, vehicular traffic volume, and speed. However, coordinate with the region Traffic Engineer early on with any existing or proposed crosswalks. The Traffic Engineer makes the final determination on appropriate signing and delineation.
1510.09(2)(a) Unmarked Crossings Legal crosswalks exist at all intersections, whether marked or not, regardless of the number of legs at the intersection of lack of prepared crossing treatments. An unmarked crosswalk (see Exhibit 1510-22) is the portion of the roadway behind a prolongation of the curb or edge of the through traffic lane and a prolongation of the farthest sidewalk connection or, in the event there are no sidewalks, between the edge of the through traffic lane and a line 10 feet from there (RCW 46.04.160).

1510.09(2)(b) Marked Crossings Marked crosswalks are used at intersections or midblock crossing and are provided at all signalized intersections except where pedestrians are prohibited, or the crossing is closed (see Section 1510.09(2)(c)). Marked Crossings should not be used indiscriminately but considered based on a thorough evaluation of site conditions. Maintenance agreements and RCW 47.24.020 provide jurisdictional authority for decisions to mark crosswalks based on a population threshold of 30,000 and should be consulted prior to a decision to mark a crosswalk. Consult region Traffic Office for “best practices” for marking crosswalks. The MUTCD, the AASHTO Guide for the Planning, Design, and Operation of Pedestrian Facilities, and the NACTO Urban Street Design Guide are all good resources to use when evaluating locations for marked crosswalks. Standard marked crosswalks are at least as wide as the walkway leading to the crossing or 10 feet wide, whichever is greater. The preferred type of marked crosswalk is a longitudinal pattern known as a Ladder Bar, which is shown in the Standard Plans and Exhibit 1510-23. Stop and yield line dimensions and placement must conform to the MUTCD and are shown in the Standard Plans. Some decorative crosswalk materials (such as colored pavement or bricks) may cause confusion for visually impaired pedestrians and can create discomfort for wheelchair users. Supplement decorative crosswalks with pavement markings to enhance visibility and delineate the crosswalk. Refer to the MUTCD and the Local Agency Crosswalk Options website: www.wsdot.wa.gov/design/standards/plansheet/pm-2.htm A marked crosswalk may be provided at unsignalized or uncontrolled intersections with public streets or highways, or at private drives with a high volume of vehicle traffic during significant hours of the day. Consult with the region Traffic Office for “best practices” for marking crosswalks. Exhibit 1510-23 Marked Pedestrian Crossing

1510.09(2)(c) Closed Crossings (Rewritten 2023) Choosing to close a crossing is a last resort and must remain infrequent. Formally closed crossings apply to all non-motorized users. The decision to close a crossing requires approval of the WSDOT Region Traffic Engineer with concurrence from the HQ ADA compliance manager and is documented in the DDP using the Pedestrian Crossing Memorandum with a copy sent to the Headquarters’ ADA Data Steward (ADASteward@WSDOT.WA.GOV). WSDOT must also ensure that affected communities are informed of any substantial impact or changes to pedestrian access resulting from a closure. Exhibit 1510-24 Essential Signal Operations at a Location That Does Not Support the Pedestrian Crossing (New Exhibit 2023)

1510.09(3) Midblock Crosswalks On roadways with pedestrian crossing traffic caused by nearby pedestrian generators, a midblock crossing may be appropriate. (See Section 1510.09(2) for crosswalk criteria and the Traffic Manual for marked crosswalk recommendations at unsignalized intersections.) The approval authority is the Traffic Engineer. Engineering judgment of conditions that might increase the value of a midblock crossing includes the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
High pedestrian crossing volume present with long block spacing. Evidence of pedestrian-vehicular midblock conflicts (site observations, law enforcement reporting, and city traffic engineers). Proposed crossing with a realistic opportunity to channel multiple pedestrian crossings to a single location. Sight lines that enable sufficient eye contact between motorists and pedestrians. Community commitment for a successful outcome. Ability to mitigate risks associated with the location using proven countermeasures such as, but not limited to, refuge islands, rectangular rapid flashing beacons, and/or pedestrian hybrid beacons. Modal interchange points where high volumes crossing pedestrians occur (e.g., transit stop to apartment complex).

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
To meet the accessibility criteria, the PAR in the crosswalk may have a cross slope that matches the grade of the roadway. An example of a midblock crossing is shown in Exhibit 1510-25. (See Chapter 530 for further information on pedestrian access and paths on limited access facilities.) Exhibit 1510-25 Midblock Pedestrian Crossing
1510.09(3)(a) Raised Crosswalks (New Section 2023) Raised crosswalks are a specialized traffic calming device and pedestrian crossing. The vertical deflection slows down motorists, increases conspicuity of crossing pedestrians, and allows pedestrians to cross the street at sidewalk level. Typical installations are mid-block crossings, roundabouts, and right-turn slip lanes that lead to a pedestrian island. Raised crosswalk use at intersections is permitted so long as the entrance and exit ramps do not encroach on crossing traffic. Placement should be considered based on the criteria for Marked Crossings (see Section 1510.09(2)(b)) in addition to the following roadway characteristics:
•
•
•
Low traffic volumes (< 9,000 AADT) Speed limits no greater than 30 mph Minimal use by heavy or long wheelbase vehicles (less than 5%)
Raised Crosswalks are not allowed in the following locations:
•
•
•
Streets with more than three lanes Truck or primary emergency vehicle routes without coordination with local emergency services and stakeholders Proximity to bus stops, as the vertical deflection may be unnerving to riders that have just boarded the bus and have yet to find a seat

Design
•
•
•
Existing guidelines for marked crossings, including accessibility criteria, should be followed (see Section 1510.09(2)(b) - Marked Crossings). The width of the tabletop must be a minimum 10 feet with detectable warning surfaces on both ends. The entrance and exit ramp length must be a minimum of 6 feet or 4% to 8.3% slope (whichever is longer) with a parabolic cross section.
Exhibit 1510-26 Raised Crosswalk Cross-Section
•
•
•
For streets with existing curb and sidewalk: o The height should match the sidewalk so pedestrians can cross at a constant grade. o If on-street parking is present, include a curb extension to make waiting pedestrians and the raised crosswalk itself more visible (see Section 1510.09(5) – Curb Extensions). For streets without existing curb and sidewalk: o The height should be 3-4 inches. o Ramps meeting the accessibility criteria must be installed on both ends of the tabletop. o Flexible delineators should be considered to prevent vehicles from swerving into the shoulder to avoid the speed table. Signage and pavement markings should follow Section 1510.09(2)(b) – Marked Crossings and MUTCD guidelines, specifically Section 3b.26 – Speed Hump Markings.
Other Considerations
•
•
•
•
Changes in drainage the raised crosswalk will cause should be accommodated. Additional drainage structures such as inlets or catch basins may be required. Consider heavy snowplow routes and work with local maintenance to determine how to best mitigate the change in grade. No alteration in design for bicycle lanes should be required, as bicyclists can typically navigate raised crosswalks without disruption. Avoid textured or decorative surfaces for the tabletop, as a smooth surface is preferable for ADA compliance.
Raised crosswalks may increase traffic noise.

1510.09(4) Sight Distance at Crosswalks Whenever an intersection crossing (marked or unmarked) or a midblock crossing is improved, provide stopping sight distance for the vehicles for pedestrians. Shrubbery, signs, parked cars, and other roadside elements can block motorists’ and pedestrians’ views of each other. Exhibit 1520-18 illustrates these sight distance concerns. See Section 1260.03(1)(a) for design stopping sight distance. Consider the need for advanced cueing strategies (e.g., flashing beacons) where sight lines are limited.

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
1510.09(5) Curb Extensions Curb extensions are traffic calming measures that may improve sight distance and reduce pedestrian crossing times, which limits pedestrian exposure. Installing a curb extension can help reduce the sight distance problem with parked cars that limit driver/pedestrian visibility. Curb extensions may allow for better curb ramp design as well as provide more space for pedestrians. Note: Curb extensions are not an option on streets with intermediate and high-speed traffic or without on-street parking because drivers would be confronted with sudden changes in roadway width. Extend the curb no farther than the width of the parking lane. (See Chapter 1230, and Chapter 1520 for shoulder/bike lane width guidance.) Design the approach nose to ensure adequate setback of vehicles to provide visibility of pedestrians. At intersections with traffic signals, the curb extensions can be used to reduce pedestrian signal timing. Examples of sidewalk curb extensions are shown in Exhibit 1510-20 and Exhibit 1510-21.

Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
Exhibit 1510-29 Curb Extension Examples
The right-turn path of the design vehicle is a critical element in determining the size and shape of the curb extension. Sidewalk curb extensions tend to restrict the width of the roadway and can make right turns difficult for large trucks. Ensure the geometry of the curb extension is compatible with the turn path for the design vehicle selected. Avoid interrupting bicycle traffic with curb extensions. Do not use curb extensions on state highways when:
•
•
•
The design vehicle (see Chapter 1300) encroaches on curbs or opposing lanes, and other solutions will not improve the circumstances. On-street parking is not provided/allowed. The posted speed is above 35 mph.
Site features such as landscaping, cabinets, poles, benches, planters, bollards, newspaper stands, and sandwich boards should be selected and placed so they do not obstruct the vision of pedestrians or drivers within curb extension areas, as shown in Exhibit 1510-21. Take into account motorist and pedestrian visibility and Design Clear Zone guidelines (see Chapter 1600).
1510.09(5)(a) Mountable Truck Apron (New Section 2023) Minimizing curb radius is a design tool for reducing turning vehicle speeds, which provides advantages and improved comfort for bicyclists and pedestrians. However, minimizing the curb return radius may result in the rear wheels of large (accommodated) vehicle tracking over the curb and encroaching on space where pedestrians and bicyclists may be queuing to cross. These encroachments can also damage curb and sidewalk structure. Provide a mountable truck apron that define the edge of the accommodated vehicle wheel path, while continuing to encourage reduced speed for the design vehicle (often a passenger car) (see Exhibit 1510-34. Design bicycle stop bars, detectable warning surfaces, traffic signal equipment, and other intersection features so that they are behind the mountable surface area. Provide a visually distinct surface for the apron as compared to the surface of the adjacent travel lane, sidewalk, and bike facility. Slope the apron from flush to the vehicle lane to 3 inches high at the curb.

1510.10 Raised Medians/Traffic Islands Wide multilane streets are often difficult for pedestrians to cross, particularly when there are insufficient gaps in vehicular traffic because of heavy volumes. Consider raised medians and traffic islands with a pedestrian refuge area (see Exhibit 1510-31) on roadways with the following conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Two-way arterial with speeds of greater than 35 mph, Moderate to high average daily traffic (ADT), High pedestrian volumes. Significant pedestrian crash history. Near a school or other community center. Crossing distance exceeds 30 feet. Complex or irregularly shaped intersections.
A traffic island used for channelized right-turn slip lanes can provide a pedestrian refuge, but the slip lanes may promote faster turning speeds. Where feasible, eliminate slip lanes. If the slip lane cannot be eliminated, minimize the turning radius of the slip lane to keep speeds as low as feasible. Also, to keep speeds low, consider ending the slip lane as a yield condition instead of a merge condition. Always keep the slip lane as narrow as practicable and design a crosswalk alignment that is at a right angle to the face of curb. (See Chapter 1310 for turn lanes, Chapter 1360 for interchange ramps, and Chapter 1320 for pedestrian accommodations in roundabouts.) The PAR through a raised median or traffic island can be either raised with curb ramps or a cut-through type (see Exhibit 1510-31). Curb ramps in medians and islands can add difficulty to the crossing for some users. The curbed edges of cut-throughs can be useful cues to the visually impaired in determining the direction of a crossing, especially on an angled route through a median or island.

Pedestrian Facilities
1510.10(1) Accessibility Criteria for Raised Medians and Traffic Islands There are many design considerations when deciding whether to ramp up to the median or island grade or create a cut-through median or island matching the roadway grade. These considerations may include the profile grade and cross slope of the road, drainage patterns, and the length or width of the median or island. The following accessibility criteria apply:
•
•
Each raised median or traffic island shall contain a PAR connecting to each crosswalk (see Section 1510.05). A passing space shall be provided that is at least 5 feet wide for a distance of at least 5 feet for each PAR in a raised median or on a traffic island (see Exhibit 1510-31).
Note: It is recommended that cut-throughs be designed to have a minimum width of 5 feet to ensure a passing space is provided.
•
•
•
•
Medians and pedestrian refuge islands shall be 6 feet minimum in length in the direction of pedestrian travel. Detectable warning surfaces are to be separated by 2 feet minimum length in the direction of pedestrian travel. Detectable warning surfaces are located at each curb ramp or roadway entrance of a PAR through a raised median or traffic island. The detectable warning surface shall be located at the back of the curb (see Exhibit 1510-31). PARs of shared-use paths that go through raised medians or traffic islands shall be the same width as the shared-use path (see Chapter 1515).

1510.11 Intersection Design (New Section 2023) Provide accommodation for pedestrian movement at and through intersections on facilities where pedestrians are allowed. Design elements to evaluate include pedestrian crossings (Section 1510.09), curb ramps (Section 1510.10), pedestrian signals and pushbuttons (Section 1510.11), curb extensions (Section 1510.09(3)(a)), and raised medians and traffic islands (Section 1510.09). See Section 1310.03 for design examples, additional design elements beyond those listed in this chapter, the appropriate configurations and dimensions of those elements, and criteria for determining suitable designs for a given intersection location.
1510.11(1) Protected Intersections (New Section 2023) Protected intersections are part of Pedestrian Circulation Paths (PCPs) where a set of treatment countermeasures are provided that improve a crossing for pedestrians and bicyclists. These include:
•
•
•
Advance stop bars, Corner protection islands, and Specialized signal phasing.
The combination of features reduces vehicle turning speeds, increases pedestrian conspicuity at the crossings, and decreases pedestrian exposure by reducing the crossing distances. See Section 1310.03(2).
1510.11(2) Roundabouts (New Section 2023) Roundabouts can incorporate designs (such as marked crossings through splitter islands) that are effectively part of the Pedestrian Circulation Path (PCP). The features of a roundabout that reduce vehicle speeds, increase pedestrian conspicuity, and decrease pedestrian exposure can improve Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) for pedestrians. Single-lane roundabouts are preferred when optimizing a crossing for pedestrians as there are fewer conflict points for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians. Some roundabouts will require additional crossing enhancements such as Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacons (RRFBs) in order to achieve the threshold refined Pedestrian Level of Traffic Stress (PLTS). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1510-40
Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
For roundabouts that do not incorporate a PCP, but where pedestrians may legally use the roadway and crossing, the design must include an obvious pedestrian path, like a break in a painted splitter island. See Chapter 1320 for roundabout design.
1510.11(3) Interchanges (New Section 2023) There are many different configurations of interchanges, but all of them require pedestrians to cross ramp terminal intersections where they meet with cross streets. Using roundabouts for ramp terminal intersections can achieve a low Level of Traffic Stress (LTS) by reducing vehicle speeds, increasing pedestrian conspicuity, and reducing crossing distances. In general, the LTS of a ramp terminal crossing can be improved for pedestrians by considering the following treatments:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Configuration (reduce/remove skews and slip lanes) Turn radius (reduce) Control (use stop control versus signalization) Speed (reduce local/crossroad speed) Lanes (reduce local/crossroad lane number) Volume (reduce local/crossroad volumes) Crossing Features (implement a suite of active transportation crossing features)
Consult with subject matter experts for appropriate application of these treatments.
1510.12 Pedestrian Pushbuttons Pedestrian pushbuttons are an operating control with their own accessibility requirements. All pedestrian pushbuttons, regardless of the type of system they are part of, require a level clear space located so that users of all types can reach the button to actuate the associated system. 1510.12(1) Accessibility Criteria for All Pedestrian Pushbuttons (including APS)
1510.12(1)(a) Location Requirements See Section 1330.04(4) for pushbutton location requirements. These location requirements limit the potential locations for the pedestrian pushbutton clear space.
1510.12(1)(b) Clear Space Requirements
•
•
Grade: 2% maximum running and cross slopes. Clear space dimensions: a. Standard: 48 inches in width by 60 inches in length, with the pushbutton located along one of the long sides of the clear space. b. Minimum: 48 inches minimum width by 48 inches minimum length. Although the ADA minimum required clear space for an operational control is 30 inches by 48 inches, the narrow dimension is increased to 48 inches to allow for maneuvering, similar to a curb ramp landing (see Exhibit 1510-32). If the clear space is constrained on three sides, such that the clear space is set back 15 inches or more from the PAR, then the clear space shall be 48 inches minimum width by 60 inches minimum length, to allow for maneuvering within the constrained space. (See Exhibit 1510-32).

Additional unobstructed or traversable space of 12 inches on either end of the clear space should be provided if possible, to allow for protruding equipment such as foot rests to extend beyond the clear space. This helps mobility assistance device users get their shoulder line closer to the pushbutton (see Exhibit 1510-32). Clear space is allowed to overlap other PAR elements (i.e., sidewalk/curb ramp landing) (Exhibit 1510-33 and Exhibit 1510-34). Clear space must be connected to the crosswalk served by the pedestrian pushbutton with a PAR.

1510.12(1)(c) Reach Range Requirements Pushbuttons are in locations considered unobstructed and follow the allowable unobstructed reach distance requirements of the ADA accessibility requirements. This manual designs clear space for pushbuttons based on a parallel approach, due to difficulties in both accessibility and design when attempting to accommodate a forward reach.
•
•
•
•
•
•
The provided clear space must be within reach range of the pedestrian pushbutton. The reach range is 10 inches maximum, as measured from the edge of the clear space to the center of the physical pushbutton (not just the housing). For new construction, the center of the physical pushbutton shall be no more than 9 inches from the edge of the clear space. It is preferable to locate the pushbutton as close to the edge of the clear space as possible. Different types of pushbuttons (front mount H-frame type versus side mount Accessible Pedestrian Signal type) will have different reach ranges on the same pole. Generally, designing for a side mount pushbutton will result in a front mount pushbutton also being within the required reach range. This is generally not true the other way around. (See Exhibit 1510-35) The center of the physical pushbutton shall be 42 inches above the surface of the clear space. Existing installations may remain if they are within a range of 36 inches minimum to 48 inches maximum above the surface of the clear space. The pushbutton shall be a minimum of 12 inches in from both ends of the clear space and should be at least 24 inches in from both ends of the clear space. Ideally, the pushbutton should be centered along one side of the clear space. If the clear space is rectangular, the pushbutton shall be located along one of the long sides of the clear space.

1510.12(2) Accessible Pedestrian Signals Accessible Pedestrian Signals (APS) are only installed where there is a pedestrian traffic signal display (walking person / hand). APS are not installed as part of crosswalk flashing beacon systems. See Chapter 1330 for additional information on APS equipment.
1510.13 At-Grade Railroad Crossings The design of pedestrian facilities that cross railroad tracks (see Exhibit 1510-36) often presents challenges due to the conflicting needs of pedestrians and trains. In particular, the flangeway gap for trains to traverse a crossing surface may create a significant obstacle for a person who uses a wheelchair, crutches, or walking aids for mobility. Whenever practicable, align pedestrian crossings perpendicular to the tracks in order to minimize potential problems related to flangeway gaps. Crossing surfaces may be constructed of timber planking, rubberized materials, or concrete. Concrete materials generally provide the smoothest and most durable crossing surfaces. When detectable warning surfaces are used at railroad crossings, place them according to the MUTCD stop line placement criteria. Exhibit 1510-36 Pedestrian Railroad Crossings
Undesirable
Recommended
There are a number of railroad crossing warning devices (see Exhibit 1510-37) intended specifically for pedestrian facilities (see the MUTCD). When selecting warning devices, factors such as train and pedestrian volumes, train speeds, available sight distance, number of tracks, and other site-specific characteristics should be taken into account. Coordinate with the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison early in the design process so that all relevant factors are considered, and an agreement may be reached regarding the design of warning devices and crossing surfaces.

Except for crossings located within the limits of first-class cities*, the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) approves proposals for any new railroad at-grade crossings or changes to warning devices or geometry at existing crossings. Additionally, any project that requires the railroad to perform work such as installation of warning devices or crossing surfaces must obtain a railroad construction and maintenance agreement. Contact the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison to coordinate with both the WUTC and the railroad company. *RCW 35.22.010: A first class city is a city with a population of ten thousand or more at the time of its organization or reorganization that has a charter adopted under Article XI, section 10, of the state Constitution. Note: There are very few first-class cities in the state of Washington. Verify with the HQ Design Office Railroad Liaison.
1510.14 Pedestrian Grade Separations (Structures) On the approach to a bridge that has a raised sidewalk, provide a ramp that transitions to the sidewalk from the paved shoulder. A ramp that transitions from a paved shoulder to a sidewalk on a bridge is to have a slope of 5% maximum and be constructed of asphalt or cement concrete. In addition to aiding pedestrian access, the ramp also serves as a roadside safety feature to mitigate the raised blunt end of the concrete sidewalk. If a PCP (such as a raised sidewalk or shared-use path) is located near the bridge, consider eliminating the gap between the bridge sidewalk and the PCP by extending the bridge sidewalk to match into the nearby PCP. At underpasses where pedestrians are allowed, it is desirable to provide sidewalks and to maintain the full shoulder width. When bridge columns are placed on either side of the roadway, it is preferred to place the walkway between the roadway and the columns for pedestrian visibility and security. Provide adequate illumination and drainage for pedestrian safety and comfort. In cases where there is a pedestrian crash history, and the roadway cannot be redesigned to accommodate pedestrians at grade, planners should consider providing a grade-separated pedestrian structure (see Exhibit 1510-38 and Exhibit 1510-39). When considering a grade-separated pedestrian structure, determine whether the conditions that require the crossing are permanent. If there is likelihood that pedestrians will not use a grade separation, consider less-costly solutions. Locate the grade-separated crossing where pedestrians are most likely to cross the roadway. A crossing might not be used if the pedestrian is required to deviate significantly from a more direct route.

Pedestrian Facilities
It is sometimes necessary to install fencing or other physical barriers to channel the pedestrians to the structure and reduce the possibility of undesired at-grade crossings. Note: The HQ Bridge and Structures Office is responsible for the design of pedestrian structures. Consider a grade-separated crossing where:
•
•
•
•
•
There is moderate to high pedestrian demand to cross a freeway or expressway. There are large numbers of young children, particularly on school routes, who regularly cross intermediate and high speed or high-volume roadways. The traffic conflicts that would be encountered by pedestrians are considered unacceptable (such as on wide streets with high pedestrian volumes combined with intermediate or high-speed traffic). There are documented crashes or close calls involving pedestrians and vehicles. One or more of the conditions stated above exists in conjunction with a well-defined pedestrian origin and destination (such as a residential neighborhood across a busy street from a school).
1510.14(1) Pedestrian Bridges Pedestrian grade-separation bridges (see Exhibit 1510-38) are more effective when the roadway is below the natural ground line, as in a cut section. Elevated grade separations in cut sections, where pedestrians climb stairs or use long approach ramps, tend to be underused. Pedestrian bridges need adequate right of way to accommodate accessible ramp approaches leading up to and off of the structure. The bridge structure must comply with ADA requirements and meet the accessibility criteria for either a pedestrian circulation path (if the grade is 5% or less) or an access ramp (if the grade is greater than 5% but less than or equal to 8.3%), and must include a pedestrian access route. (See Section 1510.04 and Section 1510.05 for PCP and PAR accessibility criteria; see Section 1510.15(2) for access ramp accessibility criteria.) For the minimum vertical clearance from the bottom of the pedestrian structure to the roadway beneath, see Chapter 720. The height of the structure can affect the length of the pedestrian ramp approaches to the structure. When access ramps are not feasible, provide both elevators and stairways. Provide railings on pedestrian bridges. Bridge fence is sometimes desirable to deter pedestrians from throwing objects from an overhead pedestrian structure (see Section 720.03(13)). The minimum clear width for pedestrian bridges is 8 feet. Consider a clear width of 14 feet where a pedestrian bridge is enclosed or shared with bicyclists, or equestrians, or if maintenance or emergency vehicles will need to access.

1510.14(2) Pedestrian Tunnels Tunnels are an effective method of providing crossings for roadways located in embankment sections. Welldesigned tunnels can be a desirable crossing for pedestrians. When feasible, design the tunnel with a nearly level profile to provide an unobstructed line of sight from portal to portal (see Exhibit 1510-39). People may be reluctant to enter a tunnel with a depressed profile because they are unable to see whether the tunnel is occupied. Law enforcement also has difficulty patrolling depressed profile tunnels. Provide vandal-resistant daytime and nighttime illumination within the pedestrian tunnel. Installing glossfinished tile walls and ceilings can enhance light levels within the tunnel. The minimum overhead clearance for a pedestrian tunnel is 10 feet. The minimum width for a pedestrian tunnel is 12 feet. Consider a tunnel width between 14 and 18 feet depending on usage and the length of the tunnel. Exhibit 1510-39 Pedestrian Tunnel
Pedestrian tunnels need adequate right of way to accommodate accessible approaches leading to the tunnel structure. The tunnel structure must comply with ADA requirements and meet the accessibility criteria for either a pedestrian circulation path (if the grade is less than or equal to 5%) or an access ramp (if the grade is greater than 5% and less than or equal to 8.3%) and must include a pedestrian access route. (See Section 1510.04 and Section 1510.05 for PCP and PAR accessibility criteria; see Section 1510.15(2) for access ramp accessibility criteria.)
1510.15 Other Pedestrian Facilities 1510.15(1) Transit Stops and School Bus Stops The location of transit stops is an important element in providing appropriate pedestrian facilities. (Coordinate with the local transit provider.) Newly constructed transit stops must conform to ADA requirements. Design newly constructed transit stops so that they are accessible from the sidewalk or paved shoulder. A transit stop on one side of a street usually has a counterpart on the opposite side because transit routes normally function in both directions on the same roadway. Provide adequate crossing facilities for pedestrians. When locating a transit stop (see Traffic Manual 7.9), consider transit ridership and land use demand for the stop. Also, take into account compatibility with the following roadway/traffic characteristics:
•
•
•
•
ADT Traffic speed Crossing distance Crash history
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
•
•
•
Sight distance Connectivity to a pedestrian access route Traffic generator density
Page 1510-50
Chapter 1510
Pedestrian Facilities
If any of these suggests an undesirable location for a pedestrian crossing, consider a controlled crossing or another location for the transit stop. (See Chapter 530 for further information on bus stops on limited access facilities.) When analyzing a transit stop location with high pedestrian crash frequency, take into account the presence of nearby transit stops and opportunities for pedestrians to cross the street in a reasonably safe manner. At-grade midblock pedestrian crossings may be effective at transit stop locations on roadways with lower vehicular volumes. Pedestrian grade separations are appropriate at midblock locations when vehicular traffic volumes prohibit pedestrian crossings at grade. (See the Traffic Manual for recommendations for marked crosswalks at unsignalized intersections.) School bus stops are typically adjacent to sidewalks in urban areas and along shoulders in rural areas. Determine the number of children using the stop and provide a waiting area that allows the children to wait for the bus. Coordinate with the local school district. Because of their smaller size, children might be difficult for motorists to see at crossings or stops. Determine whether utility poles, vegetation, and other roadside features interfere with motorists’ ability to see the children. When necessary, remove or relocate the obstructions or move the bus stop. Parked vehicles can also block visibility, and parking prohibitions might be advisable near the bus stop. Coordinate transit and school bus stop locations with the region Traffic Office.
1510.15(2) Access Ramps Serving Transit Stops, Park & Ride Lots, Rest Areas, Buildings, and Other Facilities An access ramp (see Exhibit 1510-40) provides an accessible pedestrian route from a pedestrian circulation path to a facility such as a transit stop, park & ride lot, rest area, pedestrian overcrossing/undercrossing structure, or building. When the running slope is 5% or less, it can be designed as a pedestrian circulation path that includes a pedestrian access route. When the running slope is greater than 5% to a maximum of 8.3%, it must be designed as an access ramp. (See Section 1510.04 and Section 1510.05 for PCP and PAR accessibility criteria; see Section 1510.15(2)(a) for access ramp accessibility criteria.)
1510.15(2)(a) Accessibility Criteria for Access Ramps Access ramps are composed of one or more ramp segments interconnected by level landings. Unless superseded by the following specific accessibility requirements for access ramps, the accessibility requirements for pedestrian access routes also apply:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Ramp segments shall have a maximum running slope of 8.3%. The cross slope of ramp segments shall be 2% maximum. The minimum clear width of ramps is 4 feet; however, it is desirable to match the width of the connecting pedestrian facility. The rise for any ramp segment shall be 30 inches maximum. A level landing (2% maximum running and cross slopes) shall be provided at the top and bottom of each access ramp segment. An access ramp landing’s clear width shall be at least as wide as the widest ramp segment leading to the landing. An access ramp landing’s length shall be 5 feet minimum. Access ramps that change direction between ramp segments at landings shall have a level landing 5 feet minimum width by 5 feet minimum length. All access ramp segments with a rise greater than 6 inches shall have ADA-compliant handrails (see Section 1510.15(3) for handrail accessibility criteria).

Pedestrian Facilities
Provide edge protection complying with one of the two following options on each side of access ramp segments:
•
•
The surface of the ramp segment and landing shall extend 12 inches minimum beyond the inside face of the handrail. A curb or barrier shall be provided that does not allow the passage of a 4-inch-diameter sphere, where any portion of the sphere is within 4 inches of the ramp/landing surface.
Exhibit 1510-40 Access Ramp with Accessible Handrails
1510.15(3) Railings and Handrails for Pedestrian Facilities Accessible handrails are required on stairs and also on access ramps that have a rise greater than 6 inches (see Section 1510.15(2)(a) for access ramp accessibility criteria). If the height of a drop-off (typically greater than 30 inches) adjacent to a pedestrian facility necessitates the need to protect pedestrians from falls, then a more robust railing system designed for fall protection should be used. If the drop-off is adjacent to either a stairway or an access ramp with a rise greater than 6 inches, then a combined railing system that meets the requirements for both accessibility and fall protection must be used.
1510.15(3)(a) Fall Protection Railing Railing designed for fall protection alone is typically placed adjacent to pedestrian facilities other than stairs or access ramps to prevent pedestrians or bicyclists from falls. For pedestrian-only facilities, the minimum railing height for fall protection is 42 inches. For facilities where bicycle traffic is anticipated, see Section 1520.05(4).
1510.15(3)(b) Accessible Fall Protection Railing When fall protection is needed adjacent to stairs or an access ramp that has a rise greater than 6 inches, then a combined railing system that meets both the accessibility criteria for handrail outlined in Section 1510.15(3)(d) and the requirements for fall protection must be used. The minimum railing height for pedestrian fall protection is 42 inches.

1510.15(3)(c) Accessible Handrail Accessible handrail meeting the accessibility criteria listed in Section 1510.15(3)(d) that is not designed to provide fall protection is to be used adjacent to stairs or access ramps that have a rise greater than 6 inches at locations where robust fall protection is not needed.
1510.15(3)(d) Accessibility Criteria for Handrail The following accessibility criteria apply to all handrail installations provided at stairs and access ramps that have a rise greater than 6 inches.
i Height
•
•
The top of handrail gripping surfaces shall be 34 inches minimum and 38 inches maximum vertically above walking surfaces, stair nosings, and ramp surfaces. The mounting height of the handrail shall also be at a consistent height.
ii Gripping Surface
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Clearance between handrail gripping surfaces and adjacent surfaces shall be 1½ inches minimum. Handrail gripping surfaces shall be continuous along their length and shall not be obstructed along their tops or sides. The bottoms of handrail gripping surfaces shall not be obstructed for more than 20% of their length. Where provided, horizontal projections shall be located 1½ inches minimum below the bottom of the handrail gripping surface. Handrail gripping surfaces with a circular cross section shall have an outside diameter between 1¼ inches minimum and 2 inches maximum. Handrail gripping surfaces with a noncircular cross section shall have a perimeter dimension between 4 inches minimum and 6¼ inches maximum, and a cross section dimension of 2¼ inches maximum. Handrail gripping surfaces and the surfaces adjacent to them shall be free of sharp or abrasive elements and shall have rounded edges. Handrails shall not rotate in their fittings.
iii Placement and Continuity
•
•
•
Handrails shall be provided on both sides of access ramps and stairs. Handrails shall be continuous within the full length of each access ramp run or stair flight. Inside handrails on switchback or dogleg access ramps and stairs shall be continuous between runs or flights.
iv Extensions
•
•
•
•
Access ramp handrails shall extend horizontally above the landing for 12 inches minimum beyond the top and bottom of ramp runs. At the top of a stair flight, handrails shall extend horizontally above the landing for 12 inches minimum beginning directly above the first riser nosing. At the bottom of a stair flight, handrails shall extend at the slope of the stair flight for a horizontal distance at least equal to one tread depth beyond the last riser nosing. Handrail extensions shall return to a wall, guard, or the landing surface, or shall be continuous to the handrail of an adjacent access ramp run or stair flight.

1510.15(4) Other Pedestrian Facilities, Features, and Elements This chapter covers the accessibility criteria for the most commonly encountered pedestrian design elements in the public right of way. However, there are ADA requirements that apply to any feature or element for pedestrian use, such as doorways, elevators, stairs, call boxes, and drinking fountains. For accessibility criteria for less commonly encountered pedestrian design elements, consult the applicable federal design guidance listed in Section 1510.19(2).
1510.16 Illumination and Signing In Washington State, the highest number of crashes between vehicles and pedestrians tends to occur during November through February, when there is poor visibility and fewer daylight hours. Illumination of pedestrian crossings and other walkways is an important design consideration because lighting has a major impact on a pedestrian’s safety and sense of security. Illumination provided solely for vehicular traffic is not always effective in lighting parallel walkways for pedestrians. Consider pedestrian-level (mounted at a lower level) lighting for PCPs, intersections, and other pedestrian crossing areas with high nighttime pedestrian activity, such as shopping districts, transit stops, schools, community centers, and other major pedestrian generators or areas with a history of pedestrian crashes. (See Chapter 1040 for design guidance on illumination, and Chapter 1020 and the MUTCD for pedestrian-related signing.)
1510.17 Work Zone Pedestrian Accommodation While Title II of the ADA requires that a public entity maintain its pedestrian facilities in operable working condition, including maintenance of their accessibility features, construction and maintenance activities often temporarily disrupt these facilities. When this occurs, provide access and mobility for pedestrians through and around work zones (see Exhibit 1510-41). Address this in the traffic control plans if the project occurs in a location accessible to pedestrians. The designer must determine pedestrian needs in the proposed work zone during the public input process and through field visits. Detailed guidance on work zone pedestrian accommodation can be found in the WSDOT Field Guide for Accessible Public Rights of Way, the MUTCD, and Chapter 1010. Some work zone considerations include:
•
•
•
Separate pedestrians from conflicts with work zone equipment and operations. Separate pedestrians from traffic moving through or around the work zone. Provide pedestrians with alternate routes that have accessible and convenient travel paths that duplicate, as closely as feasible, the characteristics of the existing pedestrian facilities.
Provide walkways that are clearly marked and pedestrian barriers that are continuous, rigid, and detectable to people with reduced vision who navigate with a cane. Also, keep:
•
•
•
•
The pedestrian head space clear. Walkways free from holes, debris, protruding objects, slick surfaces, unstable surfaces, and abrupt changes in grade or terrain. Access along sidewalks clear of obstructions such as construction traffic control signs. A minimum clear width path throughout: 4 feet for pedestrians or 10 feet for pedestrians and bicyclists.

Pedestrian Facilities
Temporary pedestrian facilities within the work zone must meet accessibility criteria to the maximum extent feasible. (See Section 1510.04 and Section 1510.05 for pedestrian circulation path and pedestrian access route accessibility criteria.) Consider the use of flaggers if pedestrian generators such as schools are in the work zone vicinity. Consider spotters who are prepared to help pedestrians through the work zone. Provide for advance public notification of sidewalk closures in the contract special provisions and plans. Where transit stops are affected or relocated because of work activity, provide an accessible route to temporary transit stops. Exhibit 1510-41 Work Zones and Pedestrian Facilities

1515.01 General Shared-use paths are designed for both transportation and recreation purposes and are used by pedestrians, bicyclists, skaters, equestrians, and other users. Some common locations for shared-use paths are along rivers, streams, ocean beachfronts, canals, utility rights of way, and abandoned railroad rights of way; within college campuses; and within and between parks as well as within existing roadway corridors. A common application is to use shared-use paths to close gaps in bicycle networks. There might also be situations where such facilities can be provided as part of planned developments. Where a shared-use path is designed to parallel a roadway, provide a separation between the path and the vehicular traveled way in accordance with this chapter. Shareduse paths may have “trail” in their names, but they are not trails. Trails are intended to provide and support recreational experience(s) and do not provide the necessary ADA accessible infrastructure. Parts of trails might be accessible, but trails don't need to be accessible. Trails do not usually have a firm, stable, or slip resistant surfaces, nor do they usually have accessible cross slopes, or running slopes. The Pacific Crest Trail is a good example of a trail. See Section 1710.05(17) Trails. As with any roadway project, shared-use path projects need to fit into the context of a multimodal community. Exhibits are provided throughout this chapter to illustrate possible design solutions, which should be treated with appropriate flexibility as long as doing so complies with corresponding laws, regulations, standards, and guidance. Engage various discipline experts, including landscape architects, soil and pavement engineers, maintenance staff, traffic control experts, ADA and bicycle coordinators, and others. Additionally, when designing such facilities, consider way-finding. This chapter includes technical provisions for making shared-use paths accessible to persons with disabilities. Design shared-use paths and roadway crossings in consultation with your region’s ADA Coordinator, Bicycle Coordinator, and State Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinator. For additional information on pedestrian and bicycle facilities, see Chapter 1510 and Chapter 1520, respectively.

Shared-Use Paths
Shared-Use Path Design
When designing shared-use paths, the bicyclist may not be the critical design user for every element of design. For example, the crossing speeds of most intersections between roads and pathways should be designed for pedestrians, as they are the slowest users. Accommodate all intended users and minimize conflicts. When designing to serve equestrians, it is desirable to provide a separate bridle trail along the shared-use path to minimize conflicts with horses. Exhibit 1515-1 Shared-Use Path
1515.02(1)
Design Speed
The design speed for a shared-use path is based on bicycle use and is dependent on the terrain and the expected conditions of use. Design the shared-use path to encourage bicyclists to operate at speeds compatible with other users. Higher speeds are discouraged in a mixed-use setting. Design shared-use paths to maintain speeds at or below the speeds shown in Exhibit 1515-2 by designing to the horizontal curve radii shown. Exhibit 1515-2 Bicycle Design Speeds Conditions

When minimum radius curves cannot be obtained because of right of way, topographical, or other constraints, consider installing the following mitigation measures for traffic calming to slow bicyclists when approaching curves:
•
•
•
•
Intermittent curves to slow or maintain desired speeds. Standard curve warning signs and supplemental pavement markings in accordance with the MUTCD. Perpendicular stripes painted on the pathway in decreasing intervals to provide the perception of increased speed. This has been shown to slow drivers when applied to roadways. Changes in pavement texture to encourage reductions in speed at tight curve approaches.
The negative effects of tight radius curves can also be partially offset by widening the pavement through the curves. Steeper vertical grades affect the running speed of bicycles. A shared-use path should be designed not to exceed 5%. Refer to Section 1515.02(3)(a) for further guidance.

Shared-Use Paths
Widths, Cross Slopes, Side Slopes, and Clearances
1515.02(2)(a)
Shared-Use Path Widths
The appropriate paved width for a shared-use path depends on the context, volume, and mix of users. The desirable paved width of a shared-use path, excluding the shoulders on either side, is 12 feet. The minimum paved width, excluding the shoulders on either side, is 10 feet. A paved width of more than 12 feet, excluding the shoulders on either side, may be appropriate when substantial use by both pedestrians and bicyclists is expected or maintenance vehicles are anticipated. Shared-use path shoulders are typically unpaved and 2 feet wide on either side. Exhibit 1515-3 through Exhibit 1515-7 provide additional information and cross-sectional elements. On bridges or tunnels, it is common to pave the entire shared-use path, including shoulders. This usable width can be advantageous for emergency, patrol, and maintenance vehicles and allows for maneuvering around pedestrians and bicyclists who may have stopped. It also keeps the structure uncluttered of any loose gravel shoulder material.
1515.02(2)(b)
Exceptions to Minimum Path Widths
A reduced path width of 8 feet may be designed at locations that present a physical constraint such as an environmental feature or other obstacle. Refer to the MUTCD for signing and pavement markings for such conditions. In very rare circumstances, a reduced width of 8 feet may be used where the following conditions prevail:
•
•
•
•
•
Bicycle traffic is expected to be low, even on peak days or during peak hours. Pedestrian use of the facility is not expected to be more than occasional. Horizontal and vertical alignments provide frequent, well-designed passing and resting opportunities. The shared-use path will not be regularly subjected to maintenance vehicle loading conditions that would cause pavement edge damage. The share-use path is a short distance such as a spur connection to a neighborhood.
1515.02(2)(c)
Existing Shared-Use Paths – Considerations
Some existing shared-use paths were constructed with narrower dimensions, generally providing 8 feet of pavement. Evaluate existing older paths for current needs. Consider widening an existing shared-use path to meet current geometric standards.
1515.02(2)(d)
Cross Slope
The maximum cross slope on a paved shared-use path is to be 2%. The cross slope of the shoulders can be no steeper than 6H:1V. To accommodate drainage, the entire section, including shoulders, should transition through curves. It is desirable to design the pivot point on the outside edge of one side of the shoulder or the other to avoid a pavement crown (see Exhibit 1515-3 through Exhibit 1515-7). It is best practice to design the cross slope to be less steep than the allowed maximum to account for some tolerance in construction. For example, design for a 1.5% cross slope (rather than the 2% maximum). Sloping the pavement surface to one side is desirable and usually simplifies drainage design and surface construction. Generally, surface drainage from the path is dissipated as it flows down the side slope.

1515.02(2)(e)
Shared-Use Paths
Side Slopes and Pedestrian Rail
Side slopes along shared-use paths are an important design feature. Embankment side slopes of 6H:1V or flatter provide a gently sloping path border. For shared-use paths with side slopes steeper than 3H:1V, or where obstacles or waterways may exist, evaluate the potential risk and provide mitigation such as:
•
•
•
•
•
•
A minimum 5-foot separation from the edge of the pavement to the embankment edge. This can be accomplished by providing a 5-foot shoulder as shown in Exhibit 1515-7, Example 2. A natural barrier such as dense shrubbery on the side slopes. A physical barrier, such as a pedestrian rail. Where a shared-use path is adjacent to a vertical drop of 2 feet 6 inches or more, a pedestrian rail is needed (see Exhibit 1515-7, Example 5). If the vertical drop is less than 2 feet 6 inches, a pedestrian rail, chain link fence, or 4-inch curb at the edge of the shared-use path may be installed to delineate the edge. Where a shared-use path is constructed on the side of a hill, drainage facilities may need to be considered.
1515.02(2)(f)
Clearances
The minimum horizontal clearance from the edge of pavement to an obstruction (such as bridge piers or guardrail) is 2 feet. For vertical clearances see Section 1515.04 Grade Separation Structures. Exhibit 1515-3 Two-Way Shared-Use Path: Independent Alignment
[1] Consult Region Materials Engineer (RME) for cut back slopes steeper than 2:1. [2] See Section 1515.02(2)(e) for other side slope options and pedestrian railing when needed.

Shared-Use Paths
Exhibit 1515-7 Shared-Use Path Side Slopes and Railing Example 1: Embankment Based on context, flatter slopes are desirable.
Example 2: Shoulder widening to 5 feet or more Used with steeper fill slopes to provide clear space between the hinge point and path. Vegetation can also be used as a buffer on slopes. Consider a natural or physical barrier in lieu of 3 ft additional widening. Example 3: Cut section with ditch Consult with the Region Materials Engineer to determine for appropriate cut slopes.
Example 4: Barriers, railings, fences, or walls that are 5 feet or closer to shared-use paths or bike lanes, need to be a minimum of 42 in. high above the traveling surface. Where a barrier is needed and bicycle speeds are likely to be high (such as on a downgrade), where high winds are typical (such as on bridges), or where a bicyclist could impact the object at a 25-degree angle or greater (such as on a curve), consider a continuous vertical element 54 inches high. See Section 1520.05(4). Example 5: Railing used for fall protection Apply railing or fencing a minimum of 54 inches high when a drop off is present, such as along a retaining wall. Consult with the Region Materials Engineer to determine if the shoulder along the wall should be paved. See Section 1520.05(4).

Running Slopes
Design running slopes (grades) on shared-use paths less than or equal to 5% to accommodate all user types, including pedestrians with disabilities. When the path is within the highway right of way, its running slope can match the general grade established for the adjacent roadway.
1515.02(3)(b)
Landings
Shared-use path landings provide users a level place to rest on extended grades. Exhibit 1515-8 and Exhibit 1515-9 show these features. Design landings to:
•
•
•
•
Permit users to stop periodically and rest. Not exceed maximum running slopes and cross slopes of 2%. Be in line and as wide as the shared-use path. Landings are to be at least 5 feet long. Avoid abrupt grade changes or angle points. Design transitions to landings using vertical curves.

•
•
The maximum running slope and cross slopes are 2%. The minimum size is to be 5 feet by 5 feet. If features such as benches are provided, they must meet ADA requirements; consult with the region ADA Coordinator for guidance.

Pavement Structural Section
Design the pavement structural section of a shared-use path in the same manner as a highway, considering the quality of the subgrade and the anticipated loads on the path. (Design loads are normally maintenance and emergency vehicles.) Provide a firm, stable, slip-resistant pavement surface. Design the pavement structural section as recommended by the Region Materials Engineer. Use crushed rock or other suitable material for shoulder graded areas as recommended by the Region Materials Engineer. On bridges or tunnels, it is common to pave the entire shared-use path, including shoulders across the structure. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

1515.02(5)
Stopping Sight Distance
The distance needed to bring a shared-use path user to a complete stop is a function of the user’s perception and braking reaction time, the initial speed, the coefficient of friction between the wheels and the pavement, the braking ability of the user’s equipment, and the grade. Exhibit 1515-17 and Exhibit 1515-18 provide a graph and an equation to obtain minimum stopping sight distances for various design speeds and grades.
1515.02(5)(a)
Stopping Sight Distance on Crest Vertical Curves
Exhibit 1515-19 provides a chart or equations to obtain the minimum lengths of crest vertical curves for varying stopping sight distances and algebraic differences in grade. The values are based on a 4.5-foot eye height for the bicyclist and a 0-foot height for the object (path surface).
1515.02(5)(b)
Stopping Sight Distance on Horizontal Curves
Exhibit 1515-20 gives the minimum clearances to line-of-sight obstructions for sight distance on horizontal curves. Provide lateral clearance based on the sum of stopping sight distances from Exhibit 1515-17 and Exhibit 1515-18 for bicyclists traveling in both directions and the proposed horizontal curve radius. Where this minimum clearance cannot be obtained, provide curve warning signs and use centerline pavement markings in accordance with the MUTCD. Exhibit 1515-17, Exhibit 1515-18, Exhibit 1515-19, and Exhibit 1515-20 are presented at the end of the chapter.
1515.03
Intersections and Crossings Design
This section covers path/roadway intersections and grade-separated crossings. Detectable warning surfaces are required where shared-use paths connect to the roadway.
1515.03(1)
Intersections with Roadways
Clearly define who has the right of way and provide sight distance for all users at shared-use path and roadway intersections. The common types of shared-use path/roadway at-grade intersection crossings are midblock and adjacent. For roadway intersections with roundabouts, see Chapter 1320. Midblock crossings are located between roadway intersections. When possible, locate the path crossings far enough away from intersections to minimize conflicts between the path users and motor vehicle traffic. It is preferable for midblock path crossings to intersect the roadway at an angle as close to perpendicular as practicable. A minimum 60-degree crossing angle is acceptable to minimize right of way needs. A diagonal midblock crossing can be altered as shown in Exhibit 1515-10. There are other considerations when designing midblock crossings. They include traffic right of way assignments; traffic control devices; sight distances for both bicyclists and motor vehicle operators; refuge island use; access control; and pavement markings.

Shared-Use Paths
Exhibit 1515-10 Typical Redesign of a Diagonal Midblock Crossing
Notes: For path and highway signing and markings, see the MUTCD and the Standard Plans. www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/Standards/english/PDF/m09.60-00_e.pdf For radii approaching roadway intersections, see Exhibit 1515-2. Adjacent path crossings are located at or near public intersection crosswalks and are normally placed with them. These crossings are usually placed with pedestrian crossings, where motorists can be expected to stop. If alternate intersection locations for a shared-use path are available, select the one with the greatest sight distance. Adjacent path crossings occur where a path crosses an existing intersection of two roadways, a T intersection (including driveways), or a four-way intersection, as shown in Exhibit 1515-11. It is desirable to integrate this type of crossing close to an intersection so that motorists and path users recognize one another as intersecting traffic. The path user faces potential conflicts with motor vehicles turning left (A) and right (B) from the parallel roadway and on the crossed roadway (C, D, and E). Consider crossing improvements on a case-by-case basis. Suggested improvements include: move the crossing; evaluate existing or proposed intersection control type; change signalization timing; or provide a refuge island and make a two-step crossing for path users. Important elements that greatly affect the design of these crossings are traffic right of way assignments, traffic control devices, and the separation distance between path and roadway.

Shared-Use Paths
Exhibit 1515-11 Adjacent Shared-Use Path Intersection
Note: For signing and pavement markings, see the MUTCD and the Standard Plans. Additional Roadway/Path Intersection Design Considerations Additional roadway/path intersection design considerations include the following:
Evaluate Intersection Control Determine the need for traffic control devices at path/roadway intersections by using MUTCD warrants and engineering judgment. Bicycles are considered vehicles in Washington State, and bicycle path traffic can be classified as vehicular traffic for MUTCD warrants. Provide traffic signal timing set for pedestrians.
Signal Actuation Mechanisms Place the manually operated accessible pedestrian pushbutton in a location that complies with ADA requirements. For additional information, see Chapter 1330 and Chapter 1510. A detector loop in the path pavement may be provided in addition to the manually operated accessible pedestrian push button.
Signing Provide sign type, size, and location in accordance with the MUTCD. Place path STOP signs as close to the intended stopping point as feasible. Do not place the shared-use path signs where they may confuse motorists or place roadway signs where they may confuse shared-use path users. For additional information on signing, see the MUTCD and Chapter 1020. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1515-12
Chapter 1515
Shared-Use Paths
Approach Treatments Design shared-use path and roadway intersections with level grades, and provide sight distances. Provide advance warning signs and pavement markings that alert and direct path users that there is a crossing (see the MUTCD). Do not use speed bumps or other similar surface obstructions intended to cause bicyclists to slow down. Consider some slowing features such as horizontal curves (see Exhibit 1515-2 and Exhibit 1515-10). Avoid locating a crossing where there is a steep downgrade where bike speeds could be high.
Sight Distance Sight distance is a principal element of roadway and path intersection design. At a minimum, provide stopping sight distance for both the roadway and the path at the crossing. Decision sight distance is desirable for the roadway traffic. Refer to Chapter 1260 for stopping sight distance for the roadway and Section 1515.02(5) for shared-use path stopping sight distance.
Curb Ramp Widths Design curb ramps with a width equal to the shared-use path. Curb ramps and barrier-free passageways are to provide a smooth transition between the shared-use path and the roadway or sidewalk (for pedestrians). Curb ramps at path/ roadway intersections must meet the requirements for curb ramps at a crosswalk. For design requirements, see Chapter 1510, and for curb ramp treatments at roundabouts, see Chapter 1320.
Refuge Islands Consider refuge islands where a shared-use path crosses a roadway when one or more of the following applies:
•
•
•
High motor vehicle traffic volumes and speeds Wide roadways Use by the elderly, children, the disabled, or other slow-moving users
The refuge area may either be designed with the storage aligned perpendicularly across the island or be aligned diagonal (as shown in Exhibit 1515-12). The diagonal storage area has the added benefit of directing attention toward oncoming traffic since it is angled toward the direction from which traffic is approaching.
1515.03(2)
At-Grade Railroad Crossings
Wherever possible, design the crossing at right angles to the rails. For signing and pavement marking for a shared-use path crossing a railroad track, see the MUTCD and the Standard Plans. Also, see Chapter 1510 for design of at-grade pedestrian railroad crossings.

Shared-Use Paths
Grade Separation Structures
Provide the same minimum clear width as the approach paved shared-use path plus the graded clear areas. Carrying full widths across structures has two advantages:
•
•
The clear width provides a minimum lateral clearance from the railing or barrier. It provides needed maneuvering room to avoid pedestrians and other bicyclists.
For undercrossings and tunnels, it is the Designer’s responsibility to determine the correct minimum vertical clearance (shared use path pavement surface to overhead obstruction) of each undercrossing or tunnel based on coordination with maintenance and emergency services. Many types of maintenance and emergency vehicles need more than the 10 feet of vertical clearance needed for bicyclists and/or equestrians. Engage Region Maintenance, Emergency Services, and others that need to cross under or through the facility to determine an appropriate minimum vertical clearance. Account for existing or proposed overhead obstructions (lighting, signals, sign, etc.) that would reduce the available vertical clearance. Consult the region Maintenance Office and the HQ Bridge Preservation Office to verify that the planned path width and vertical clearance meets their needs. If not, widen and/or increase vertical clearance to their specifications. Use expansion joints that accommodate shared-use path users. Expansion joints should be perpendicular to the path and have a maximum gap of ½ inch or be covered with a slip-resistant plate. Installing bridge fence is analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Refer to Section 720.03(13) for guidance. Exhibit 1515-13 Shared-Use Path Bridge and Approach Walls

1515.05
Signing, Pavement Markings, and Illumination
Generally, WSDOT does not provide continuous centerline striping or channelization for user modes on shareduse paths. However, signing and pavement markings can be beneficial to warn shared-use path users of curves, grades, obstructions, and intersections. Refer to the MUTCD for guidance and directions regarding signing (regulatory, warning, and way finding) and pavement markings. The Standard Plans shows shared-use path pavement markings at obstructions in accordance with the MUTCD and also shows placement of detectible warning surfaces. For pavement marking around bollards and other obstructions, see Standard Plan M-9.60: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/standards/english/pdf/m09.60-00_e.pdf The level of illumination on a shared-use path is dependent on the amount of nighttime use expected and the nature of the area surrounding the facility. If illumination is used, provide illumination in accordance with Chapter 1040.

Shared-Use Paths
Fencing
Limited access highways often require fencing or other forms of controlling access. Shared-use paths constructed within these corridors, such as shown in Exhibit 1515-15, likely require fencing. For guidance on fencing, limited access controls, and right of way, refer to Division 5 of the Design Manual. Evaluate the impacts of fencing on sight distances. Exhibit 1515-15 Shared-Use Path in Limited Access Corridor
1515.06(2)
Preventing Motor Vehicle Access (Rewritten 2023)
At locations where shared use paths meet roadways, design and sign shared-use path entries and crossings to clearly indicate that motor vehicle access is prohibited. Use design features to reduce the probability of either intentional or accidental access by motor vehicles. Effective prevention of motor vehicle entry is often possible using signage and pavement markings. Additional treatments include path geometry and splitter islands as discussed below. The primary method of controlling motor vehicle access at path/roadway intersections is the use of pavement markings and signage to indicate that motor vehicle access is prohibited. However, where there is a documented history of unauthorized intrusion at a specific location, use path geometry curvature and/or splitter islands as described below. A common design feature to incorporate into the shared-use path geometry, ahead of the point of crossing, is a reverse curve in the shared-use path. A reverse curve can both slow higher speed shared-use path users and also alert all shared-use path users to the upcoming crossing, as well as dissuade vehicular intrusion into the pathway. Do not use barriers such as z-gates and fences located within the width of a shared-use path. These features, as well as bollards, create fixed objects to path users on new or upgraded path entries. Barriers can also slow access for emergency responders. Determined violators often gain entry despite these barriers and can damage path structures/adjacent vegetation in the process. A Design Analysis is required to use bollards within the width of the shared-use path.

Shared-Use Paths
1515.06(2)(a) Shared-Use Path Splitter Islands (Rewritten 2023) When pavement markings, signage and shared-use path geometry are not sufficient to prevent motor vehicle intrusion, the preferred method of physically restricting entry of motor vehicles is to split the path into two narrower pathways at the roadway intersection, separated by a median island. This method directs path users around an island rather than installing a bollard or other barrier within the usable width of the pathway. Design islands to allow emergency/maintenance vehicle access if alternate access points are not provided. Design features of splitter islands include:
•
•
•
•
Use mountable cement concrete traffic curb (see Standard Plan F-10.12) around the perimeter of the island to reduce the potential for pedal strikes. Paint perimeter curbing yellow to increase visibility of the island. For islands that include plantings, use low-growing, hardy vegetation capable of withstanding the occasional emergency/maintenance vehicle traveling over it. Consult with your region landscape architect for appropriate landscape design. Design path sections around the island to be half the primary path width, but not more than 6 feet wide. Delineate the approach to the island with solid line pavement markings as shown in Exhibit 1515-16.

1520.01 General The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) encourages and relies upon bicycle use on and interconnecting with its facilities. Bicycle facilities or improvements for bicycle transportation are included in WSDOT’s project development and highway programming processes. This chapter is a guide for designing bicycle transportation facilities within state highway right of way or between the curb lines on city streets designated as state highways. When designing facilities outside of state highway right of way or beyond the curb on city streets designated as state highways, use the local agency’s design guidance. Guidance in this chapter applies to typical situations encountered on state highways and includes options for intersection and interchange design. Unique design challenges are resolved using expertise and guidance from the regional Bicycle Coordinator, or if none exists, the WSDOT headquarters Bicycle Coordinator. Additional concepts to resolve unique bicycle facility design situations can be found in guides referenced (Section 1520.07), but may require additional approvals for signing, pavement markings, or bike facility types not presented within this chapter. The Region Traffic Engineer is responsible for determining which sections of state highways are inappropriate for bicycle traffic. The State Traffic Engineer, after consultation with the HQ Design and HQ Active Transportation, prohibits bicycling on sections of state highways through the traffic regulation process.
1520.02 Policy (New Section 2023) WSDOT seeks to provide appropriate bicycle facilities along and across sections of state routes as an integral part of the transportation system. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and WSDOT policy is that bicycle facilities be given full consideration in the planning and design of new construction and reconstruction highway projects, except where bicycle use is prohibited. Use a performance-based approach (see next section) to select and design the appropriate solution to address the need to accommodate bicycle uses, including those uses associated with projects that are providing for a Complete Streets facility.

Roadway Bicycle Facilities
1520.03 Bicycle Facility Selection (Section Rewritten 2023) Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress (BLTS) can inform facility selection because the ranking system is tied to roadway characteristics and facility types that support the Safe System Approach and a user’s willingness to use a given facility. This section provides additional information on facility selection based on the Safe System Approach. Facilities that reduce driver operating speeds, reduce bicyclist exposure to potential crashes with motor vehicles, increase the predictability of motor vehicle and bicycle interactions, and increase the conspicuity of vulnerable road users decrease the likelihood of a serious injury or fatality crash. See Exhibit 1520-5. Reduce operating speeds: Measures to reduce operating speeds of roadways (see Section 1103.05(2)). Bike facilities do not necessarily reduce operating speeds, rather different bike facility types are chosen to mitigate for higher speed conditions. Some bicycle facilities such as protected intersections, and protected roundabouts directly influence vehicle turning speeds. Reduce bicyclist exposure to potential crashes with motor vehicles: Bike facilities generally reduce bicyclist exposure to potential crashes along roadways. Exposure decreases as separation and protective elements increase. Exposure can also be decreased by reducing the number or length of conflict zones or crossing areas with motor vehicle traffic, or by controlling traffic movements at points of conflict (i.e., signalized control of conflicting movements). Protected intersections and protected roundabouts provide significant reductions in bicyclist exposure at intersections. Increase predictability of motor vehicle/bicycle interactions: Bike facilities provide a means for increasing the predictability of interactions between motor vehicle and bicycle traffic by providing an identified and recognizable space for bicycle traffic to travel, especially in locations where most cyclists are traveling at a slower speed than motor vehicle traffic. At intersections separated or marked bike facilities help establish both where differing traffic modes can be expected to travel as well as indicating locations where the paths of differing modes cross one another. Signalized intersections with dedicated signal phases for cyclists can further support predictable traffic movements through intersections. Increase bicyclist conspicuity: Bike facilities do not necessarily make it easier for drivers to see bicyclists. However, bike facilities may increase a driver’s attention to the fact that bicyclists may be present and bike facility enhancements such as green paint can accentuate this effect. Raised bike lanes (i.e., bicycle facilities that are vertically separated from the adjacent travelled lane) may directly increase bicyclist conspicuity. Protected intersections and separated bike lanes through roundabouts can directly address bicyclist conspicuity at intersections. Use the table below to select an appropriate bicycle facility based on the roadway context. See Chapter 1510 for guidance on Pedestrian Level of Traffic Stress (PLTS).
1520.03(1) Speed Considerations (New Section 2023) While Exhibit 1520-2, Exhibit 1520-3,Exhibit 1520-4, and Exhibit 1520-5 provide ranges of roadway speeds in which different types of bike facilities may be appropriate, it is critical to understand that motor vehicle speed plays a significant role in crash severity between motor vehicles and cyclists. When designing multimodal facilities, a target speed selection within the low-speed design control is encouraged. Safety performance increases as motor vehicle speeds are decreased. See Chapter 1103 for further discussion on target speed and speed management treatments.

Roadway Bicycle Facilities
1520.03(2) Roadway Bicycle Facilities (Section Rewritten 2023) There are three general types of dedicated bicycle facilities. See Exhibit 1520-1. Conventional bike lanes (CBLs) have a paint stripe, signing, and pavement markings to provide a clear indication to bicyclists and drivers about the purpose of the facility. See Exhibit 1520-7. Buffered bike lanes (BBLs) are similar to conventional bike lanes, except they also provide a painted buffer to improve rider comfort and provide the benefit of having greater space between cyclists and motor vehicle traffic. See Exhibit 1520-8. Separated bike lane (SBLs) also provide a painted buffer, but also include vertical elements to further improve rider comfort and improve the buffer’s visibility and the driver’s awareness of the buffer. See Exhibit 1520-10. The width of a bicycle lane with a buffer (BBLs and SBLs) does not include the width of the buffer. Shared-use paths (see Chapter 1515) are another option for providing physical separation from traffic. Exhibit 1520-1 Roadway Bicycle Facilities

Chapter 1520
Roadway Bicycle Facilities
1520.03(2)(a) Conventional Bike Lane Conventional bike lanes are at grade and adjacent to motor vehicle traffic lane. They are designated by a single solid wide stripe between the motor vehicle lane and bike lane. Additional bike markings (see the Standard Plans) in the bike lane and signage are also employed. The minimum width for a conventional bike lane is 5 feet (not including the gutter pan, where present); the minimum width is 6 feet, not including gutter pan, when the posted speed is > 30 mph and the bike lane is either adjacent to vehicle parking or a sharp pavement drop off, or there is a higher volume of vehicle traffic (> 6,000 vehicles per day or > 5% heavy trucks). Exhibit 1520-2 Conventional Bike Lane
* 6 feet min. when the posted speed is > 30 mph and the bike lane is either adjacent to vehicle parking or a sharp pavement drop off, or when higher than 6,000 vehicles per day or 5% heavy trucks. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Chapter 1520
Roadway Bicycle Facilities
1520.03(2)(b) Buffered Bike Lane As the name suggests, a buffered bike lane is a bike lane with a marked buffer between the bike lane and adjacent motor vehicle traffic. The buffer is typically placed between the bike lane and an active traffic lane but can also be placed between a bike lane and a curbside parking lane. The buffer treatment consists entirely of pavement markings (including RPMs in some cases) with no vertical elements. Provide a minimum 2-foot buffer strip, and a 5 foot wide minimum bike lane (not including the gutter pan, if present). Widths in excess of the minimum are normally associated with the need to accommodate bicycle passing due to higher volumes, mix of bicycle traffic (i.e., bicyclists with differing levels of aptitude and/or types of bicycles) or steep uphill grade.

Page 1520-5
Chapter 1520
Roadway Bicycle Facilities
1520.03(2)(c) Separated Buffered Bike Lanes Separated bike lanes include a bike lane and a buffer area that includes a vertical element in addition to the horizontal offset between bike lane and motor vehicle traffic. Bike markings (see the Standard Plans) in the bike lane and signage are also employed. For these designs, provide a minimum 5 foot wide bike lane (not including the gutter pan, where present). Widths in excess of the minimum are normally associated with the need to accommodate bicycle passing due to higher volumes, mix of bicycle traffic (i.e., bicyclists with differing levels of aptitude and/or types of bicycles) or steep uphill grade. Provide a minimum 2 foot wide buffer, or 3 feet wide if the buffer is adjacent to parked cars or includes traffic barrier. By incorporating vertical features into the buffer as described below, BLTS is improved. Install one of the vertical features available for this purpose in the center of the designated buffer area. Acceptable vertical features include tubular markers, precast or cast in place curb, traffic barrier, vehicle parking, or a curbed planter strip. Other physical separation features may be used; consult with your region Bicycle Coordinator or headquarters Active Transportation Division. If a curb or traffic barrier is used, review the recommended lateral clearances to vehicle traffic appropriate for the design speed of the roadway in Section 1239.06. Use bike markings in the bike lane and signage as shown in the Standard Plans). If curb is used with a street level separated bike lane and without any other vertical elements, paint the curb white and provide guideposts to mark the ends. Exhibit 1520-4 Separated Bike Lane (tubular markers shown as vertical feature)
* 2 foot minimum. 3 feet minimum if the separation is adjacent to parked cars or has a traffic barrier. Contact HQ Roadside Safety if considering concrete barrier for additional width requirements. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Roadway Bicycle Facilities
1520.03(2)(d) Bike Boulevard (New Section 2023) Bike boulevards (also known as Neighborhood Greenways, Bicycle Priority Streets, and other names) can be used on low-speed streets with low vehicle volumes. Bike boulevards are designed to give bicyclists and pedestrians priority. Signs, pavement markings, speed humps, chicanes, diverters, and other tools discourage vehicle through travel and encourage low speeds. Bike boulevards may be used on state highways with ASDE approval; however, it is more likely that bike boulevards will interface with state highways through crossing situations. It is important to consider how to configure an intersection or dedicated bicycle crossing location when intersecting with a bicycle boulevard network (see Section 1520.04(5)).
1520.03(2)(e) Shoulder Use by Bikes (New Section 2023) Accommodating bicycle use on the shoulder is common on state highways that are not designated as Complete Streets. Shoulder improvements to facilitate bicycle travel include widening the shoulders to a minimum width of 4 feet, removing surface obstacles, and reviewing existing drain grates for compatibility with bicycles. If shoulder rumble strips are present, provide for at least 4 feet of usable shoulder between the rumble strip and the outside edge of shoulder. When barrier is present, provide for at least 5 feet of shoulder between the edge of traveled way (or rumble strip if present) and the face of the traffic barrier. Note that shoulders wide enough for bicycles are not dedicated bicycle facilities, and bicycle users do not have the same operating privileges as with designated roadway bike facilities. In rural to suburban/urban transition areas consider adding bike facilities, both to encourage speed management of motor vehicle users through the transition and to establish a dedicated special-use lane for cyclists to tie into the local network. Rumble strips are common on rural highways, and properly installed rumble strips (see Section 1600.05(1)) and routine maintenance provide for greater bicyclist comfort and usability.
1520.03(3) Design Performance Metric – Level of Traffic Stress (New Section 2023) The Level of Traffic Stress performance metric applies to Complete Streets projects. When selecting the crosssection layout and dimensions for a Complete Street, first determine the level of traffic stress (LTS) in both the existing and design (final) condition. The design goal is to provide for a LTS of 1 or 2. Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress (BLTS) data ranks highway segments from 1 to 4 based on roadway characteristics, with BLTS 1 being deemed suitable for all ages and abilities. LTS 2 is considered suitable for most bicyclists. BLTS 3 and BLTS 4 represent functional gaps in active transportation networks that present systemic safety issues and likely deter the use of active modes. The data provided in Exhibit 1520-2 - Exhibit 1520-5 provide BLTS (see Section 1520.03(2)(a) i and is not a substitute for detailed investigation of a location when specific investment decisions are being considered. The specific characteristics of locations with the same LTS rankings could vary considerably. It is important to note that an LTS 1 or 2 location might have additional, unmeasured characteristics that reduce its presumed suitability for active travel (see Section 1520.03(2)(a) ii). In addition, provide a buffered bike lane or separated bike lane where the existing or proposed posted speed is greater than 30 mph. Separation can be provided by adding a physical barrier such as tubular markers, curb, traffic barrier, or other (see Section 1520.03) or providing a separate facility for pedestrians such as a shared use path. See Chapter 1510 for guidance on Level of Traffic Stress for pedestrians (PLTS).

These tables can also be used to identify potential changes needed to achieve BLTS 1 or 2 for an alternative – including additional bicycle infrastructure, speed reductions, and/or lane reductions. Note that speed referred to in the tables is target speed. For more information about the definitions of bicycle facilities referenced in these tables see Section 1520.05.

1520.03(3)(b) Refined Bicycle Level of Traffic Stress (New Section 2023) Once the BLTS for a project alternative is determined per the tables above, examine the additional issues shown in Exhibit 1520-9 below to consider the need to provide design treatments in addition to those described in the BLTS solutions. This refinement is required for the project preferred alternative, but optional at the alternative’s formulation and comparison phase, based on an examination of the expectation of the value to the comparison process of the additional detail required to perform the refinement. Most of the issues in the following list do not provide a quantitative basis for examining the existing or proposed (design) condition. Therefore, work with subject matter experts and the project Advisory Team to consider each category listed and determine options for addressing each issue in order to reduce travel stress in the design for bicycles and pedestrians. The refined BLTS is considered complete when a design approach to addressing the travel stress issues listed below have been determined and documented through a collaborative process, with the intention that those approaches will be incorporated into the design. The designer documents that the BLTS has now been upgraded to the Refined (and final) BLTS for the design. Exhibit 1520-9 Refined BLTS Criteria (New Exhibit 2023) Characteristic

1520.04 Intersection Design (New Section 2023) Provide accommodation for bicycle movement at and through intersections on facilities where bicycles are allowed. See Section 1310.03 for design examples, additional design elements beyond those listed in this chapter, and criteria for determining level of traffic stress, and the appropriate and configurations and dimensions of those elements.
1520.04(1) Intersection Design Treatments Design intersections for bicycle mobility and safety performance to provide a visible, distinct, predictable, and clearly designated path leading to and through the intersection while managing potential conflicts between all other users and cyclists. This chapter covers options for intersection design for bicyclists while chapters in the 1300 series provide guidance for intersection control type selection and design. Intersection design in terms of bicycle safety and mobility performance is unique to each location. In every case, provide clear delineation of the bike facility leading up to and through the intersection, as well as segregating or prioritizing movements where appropriate. Although intersection treatments and design methods depicted in this manual are considered state-of-the-practice for WSDOT, certain pavement markings or configurations may not currently appear in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. In these cases, contact the Region Traffic Engineer for more information about documentation requirements.
1520.04(1)(a) Bike Lane Through Intersection The approach to intersections needs to balance the bicycle user’s safety needs with the mobility needs of other users. Eliminate or minimize conflict areas especially at intersections. If conflict areas exist, use dotted lines to identify the conflict area. Colored pavement markings can be used to further enhance and delineate the conflict area. Exhibit 1520-11 shows different applications of the approach through lane most likely to be encountered. There are several different ways to delineate bike lanes through the intersection. Dotted lines are the basic treatment that can be supplemented with green pavement markings (see Section 1520.05(1)) to further enhance the bike facility’s presence and position within an intersection.
1520.04(2) Intersection Bike Boxes (Section Rewritten 2023) An intersection bike box is a designated area on the approach to a signalized intersection, between an advance stop line and the intersection stop line, intended to provide bicycles a space in which to wait in front of stopped motor vehicles during the red signal phase so that they are more visible to motorists at the start of the green signal phase, as shown in Exhibit 1520-10. Bike boxes are used at signalized intersections and increase both mobility and safety performance for the bicycle mode. Intersection Bike Boxes are permitted throughout the state of Washington under FHWA approval number IA-18.35. Additional information regarding the use and application of Intersection Bike Boxes is found in FHWA Interim Approval IA-18. Applying a bike box (see Exhibit 1520-13) assists mobility performance by prioritizing the bicycle movement at an intersection. Positioning bicyclists in the center of the appropriate lane allows them to turn from a location where they are more visible to surrounding traffic, can increase the visibility of stopped bicycle traffic at an intersection, can reduce conflicts between bicycles and motor vehicles, can help mitigate intersection right-turn ("right-hook") conflicts, and can help group bicycles together to clear intersections more quickly. Bike boxes have also been found to prevent cyclist and motor vehicle encroachment into the pedestrian crossing, reducing conflicts with pedestrians at intersections. Bicycle safety performance is improved by increasing the visibility of the cyclist, and by reducing conflicts between motor vehicles making a right turn and the bicycle through movement (also known as “right-hook” conflict).

1520.04(3) Two-Stage Bicycle Boxes The two-stage bicycle turn box is an area set aside for bicyclists to queue to turn at a signalized intersection outside of the traveled path of motor vehicles and other bicycles. When using a two-stage bicycle turn box to make a left turn, a bicyclist would proceed on a green signal indication to the turn box on the right-hand side of the travel lanes, and then turn left within the turn box and wait for the appropriate signal indication on the cross street to proceed. Two-stage bicycle turn boxes can also be used with a left-side bicycle facility to facilitate bicyclists turning right. In addition to mitigating conflicts inherent in merging across traffic to turn, two-stage bicycle turn boxes reduce conflicts between bicycles and pedestrians and separate queued bicyclists waiting to turn from through bicyclists moving on the green signal. Two-Stage Bicycle Turn Boxes are permitted throughout the state of Washington under FHWA approval number IA-20.17. Additional information regarding the use and application of Intersection Bike Boxes is found in FHWA Interim Approval IA-20. Exhibit 1520-13 shows an example of a two-stage left-turn design for bicycle users (two-stage right-turns are available). This design utilizes a rectangular bike box to enable cyclist queueing at the crossroad signal phase. The bicyclist passes partway through the intersection to access the bike box, and then waits for the crossroad next signal phase to eliminate the bicyclist left turn movement. This treatment’s best application is at intersections with significant volumes of motor vehicle traffic or large volumes of left-turn cyclists, or when separated or buffered roadway bicycle facilities are used on the segment. This treatment can increase safety performance by reducing conflicts between cyclists and other users, segregating motor vehicle and bicycle users, and separating turning cyclists from through cyclists. The position of the queue box is a critical aspect of this intersection design. Depending on the size and configuration of the intersection, it may present a modal performance trade-off between bicycle mobility and safety versus motor vehicle mobility performance. Use turn simulation software to verify the queue box is outside the crossroad left-turn path, or restrict left turns at the crossroad to accommodate the queue box. The two-stage turn box should be positioned out of the path of travel of conflicting through traffic proceeding through the intersection on a green light, including other bicycle traffic passing through the intersection on the same signal phase as the bicycle traffic that will be using the turn box. Use turn simulation software to verify the turn box is outside the crossroad left-turn path, or restrict left turns at the crossroad to accommodate the turn box. Similarly, right turns from the crossing road may need to be restricted on red lights if the path of the right turn passes over the turn box. Avoid placing the turn box in a position where it lies between lanes of the crossing street, unless accompanied by a traffic island (e.g., where a right turn lane on the crossing street passes to the right of a traffic island on the approach to the intersection).

1520.04(4) Traffic Signals Considerations Consider bicycle needs and intersection geometry when timing the traffic signal cycle and when selecting the method of detecting the presence of cyclists. Contact the regional Active Transportation Coordinator and region Traffic Engineer for assistance in determining the timing criteria. At a minimum consider safety performance needs, projected bicycle volume, motor vehicle volume, traffic delay, roadway grade and the types of bicyclists using the intersection that may require more time to clear the intersection. Consider the installation of effective loop detectors or other methods of detecting a bicycle within the bike lane (in advance of the intersection) and turn lanes. Select detectors sensitive enough to detect bicycles and use a bike detector symbol to identify detector presence. Push button actuators may also be used to facilitate movement of bicyclists through a signalized intersection. However, requiring bicyclists to go out of their way to use push button actuators may create motor vehicle driver confusion of the bicyclists intended path through the intersection, as well as inconveniencing the bicyclist. If pushbutton actuators are used, consider their position relative to the bike facility. Pushbutton actuators are more effective when the bike facility is adjacent to the curb (curb extensions at intersections can create this environment). Consider an additional push button actuator for the exclusive use of cyclists when positioning of the actuator is in conflict with ADA design requirements (see Chapter 1510). For additional guidance on signal design, see Chapter 1330.
1520.04(4)(a) Bike Signals Intersections with separated bike lanes, other complex multimodal intersection treatments or those with a specific baseline need to increase bicycle user safety performance may incorporate a dedicated bike signal head with detection or actuation systems. Bike signal heads further separate modal user movements at intersections, while also allowing for priority to cyclists at intersections. Contact the region Traffic Engineer for approval for application of this treatment. At the time of this publication, bike signal faces are subject to requirements of FHWA Interim Approval IA-16.
1520.04(5) Median Diverter A median diverter prohibits drivers at side street approaches from traveling straight or left at an intersection and drivers on the mainline from turning left while still allowing pedestrian and bicyclists to cross. Median diverters can also provide refuge for pedestrians and bicyclists at a multi-stage crossing. The channelization reduces cut through traffic to create lower vehicular volume facilities and improve pedestrian and bicyclist comfort while also allowing pedestrians and bicyclists to cross one direction of vehicle traffic at a time. Consider a median diverter when one or more of the following occurs:
•
•
•
•
Bike facilities cross a roadway with median restricted left turns. Neighborhood greenways Used on the cross street. There is a performance need to restrict motor vehicle through traffic on a bike route.
Exhibit 1520-13 shows an example of a median diverter designed to accommodate bicyclist through traffic. Design refuge areas between 4 and 5 feet wide (longitudinally with respect to the median), additional width may be needed if high volumes of cyclists exist or are anticipated at the crossing. It is best to provide separate cutthroughs in the median for each direction of bicycle traffic in order to preserve the diverter function of the median.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1520-17
Chapter 1520
Roadway Bicycle Facilities
However, if the bi-directional bicycle movement is accommodated by a single median cut-through, a tubular marker or other treatment may be needed in the center of the cut-through in order to enforce the diverter function of the median. Consider the types of cyclists and destinations when determining the median refuge length (lateral dimension with respect to the median) to adequately store the bicycle. Consider what locations may need to accommodate the length of a bicycle and trailer. The refuge area is to be in alignment with the approach and receiving lanes of the crossroad. In other situations, the median refuge island may be designed for both pedestrians and bicycle users. When this is the case, design the median refuge predominately for the pedestrian as with midblock crossings (See Chapter 1510), note that additional lateral and longitudinal dimensions will be necessary.
1520.05 Additional Bicycle Design Requirements and Considerations 1520.05(1) Signing and Pavement Markings Use the MUTCD and the Standard Plans for signing and pavement marking criteria. (See Chapter 1020 for additional information on signing and Chapter 1030 for information on pavement markings). Pavement marking and signing options for bicycle facilities are rapidly changing. Situations may exist where unique project concerns may necessitate innovative pavement markings or signage. Consult, as appropriate, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) MUTCD website for bicycle facilities for a listing of the current status of bicycle-related pavement markings and treatments: www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/bicycle_pedestrian/guidance/mutcd/index.cfm HQ Traffic Office approval is necessary for traffic control devices not currently approved for use through the MUTCD.
1520.05(1)(a) Green Pavement Marking – Criteria for Consideration Green-colored pavement markings are a traffic control device that’s used as a supplemental treatment for standard striping configurations for bicycle facilities. Green colored pavement markings are used to help mitigate the effects of conflicts between cyclists and other design users, areas where other design users are intended to yield to cyclists, provide corridor or network continuity, and help prevent non-bicycle uses (such as vehicle parking). The use of green colored pavement for bike lanes is permitted throughout the state of Washington under FHWA approval number IA-14.20. Additional information regarding the use and application of green colored pavement for bike lanes is found in FHWA Interim Approval IA-14. The below criteria are provided when evaluating the need to apply green colored pavement markings. 1. Existing Bike Facilities – retrofitting an existing facility with green pavement may be considered when two or more of the following apply: a. It is the engineering judgment of the Region Traffic Engineer b. There is an existing traffic conflict area, such as bike lane crossing a motor vehicle turn lane, and there are one or more observed motor vehicle and bicyclist crashes in the last 5 years. c. The bike mode is a modal priority (see Chapter 1103), and there is a baseline or contextual need identified associated with increasing safety performance of the mode. d. When a bike route intersects a multilane highway, and the crossing is neither signalized nor a roundabout.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1520-18
Chapter 1520
Roadway Bicycle Facilities
2. Changing of Bike Facility Type –consider green pavement markings when one or more of the following apply: a. It is the engineering judgment of the Region Traffic Engineer. b. A transition from a separated facility through a functional intersection or interchange area necessitates additional delineation to create a clear, visible, predictable and distinct travel path for bike users, and a bike signal or actuation device is not used. c. The facility type change does not substantively alter the configuration of an existing conflict area, and there are one or more observed motor vehicle and bicyclist crashes in the last 5 years at that conflict area. 3. New Bike Facility – Generally, the immediate application of green colored pavement on a new bike facility is discouraged until the need for increased safety performance is demonstrated. This said, consider green colored pavement when two or more of the following conditions exist: a. It is the engineering judgment of the Region Traffic Engineer b. The bike mode is a modal priority (see Chapter 1103), and there is a baseline or contextual need in which the application of green colored pavement markings is needed to meet the stated modal safety performance target (see Chapter 1101). c. The bike facility nodes and/or crossings are within 1 mile of activity centers, such as schools, libraries, colleges, etc. d. The bike facility crosses a motor vehicle free right turn to or from an interchange ramp. e. The bike facility is a bike route or bike boulevard (for definition, see NACTO’s Urban Bikeway Design Guide). f. The state route is also a city street, and the city policy or municipal code requires green colored pavement markings as their standard. g. The bike facility is raised and curb separated, and the city engineer requests green colored pavement markings at either crossings or conflict areas.
1520.05(1)(b) Green Pavement Marking – Configuration Use green pavement markings to supplement the conventional white bike lane striping as required by the MUTCD and FHWA IA-14. Apply green colored pavement markings in conflict areas where bike lanes cross driveways and intersections. If closely spaced conflict areas exist, it may be appropriate to carry solid green into the next conflict area as determined by the Region Traffic Engineer. Additional configurations or styles exist for the application of green colored pavement and can be used with the approval of HQ Traffic Office. Consider specifically when bike route continuity with a local agency’s bike facilities is a concern.
1520.05(2) Drainage Grates and Manhole Covers Locate drainage inlet grates and manhole covers to avoid bike lanes. When drainage grates or manhole covers are located in a bike lane, minimize the effect on bicyclists. Consider providing 3 feet of lateral clearance between the edge of a drainage inlet grate and the bike lane stripe, when practicable. Install and maintain grates and manhole covers level with the surface of the bike lane. Provide drainage inlet grates on bicycle facilities that have openings narrow enough and short enough that bicycle tires will not drop into the grates. Replace existing grates that are not designed for bicycles: a WSDOT vanned grate, herringbone grate, or other grate with an opening 4 inches or less center to center and perpendicular to the direction of travel.

1520.05(3) At-Grade Railroad Crossings Whenever a bike lane crosses railroad tracks, continue the crossing at least as wide as the bike lane. Use special construction and materials to keep the flangeway depth and width to a minimum. Wherever possible, design the crossing at right angles to the rails. Where a skew is unavoidable, widen the shoulder or bike lane, to permit bicyclists to cross at right angles. Exhibit 1520-14 shows options and details to consider for at-grade railroad crossings. Exhibit 1520-14 At-Grade Railroad Crossings
Notes:
•
•
Provide additional width at railroad crossings to allow bicyclists to choose their own crossing routes. When pedestrians are provided for, design as a shared-use path (see Chapter 1510 and Chapter 1515).

Chapter 1520
Roadway Bicycle Facilities
1520.05(4) Barrier, Railing, Fence, or Wall When the edge of the bike lane is within 5 feet of a vertical object like a barrier, railing, fence, or wall, provide a minimum object height a of 42 inches or more to reduce the potential for bicyclists to fall over the object. Where bicycle speeds are likely to be high (such as on a downgrade), where high winds are typical (such as on bridges), or where a bicyclist could impact a barrier, railing, fence, or wall at a 25-degree or greater angle (such as on a curve or an angle point in the alignment), a higher 48 in. to 54 in. continuous vertical element may be considered to account for the higher center of gravity of a bicycle rider. If the object is needed for bicycle fall protection because of a vertical drop of 30 inches or greater, or on a bridge the minimum height of the vertical object is 54”. If the object is concrete barrier, consider using or converting to single slope barrier to alleviate conflicts with the barrier and bicycle pedal movement that can occur with other barrier designs. On existing structures, the bridge railing type and height are part of the structure design. Contact the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for additional information. (See Section 1610.07 for further considerations.)
1520.05(5) Transit Considerations Transit and bicycle facilities can generate unique conflicts because of their typical position within the geometric cross section of the traveled way zone. Where public transport and cycling facilities meet, an integrated design that does not inconvenience either mode is desirable to meet the performance needs of these modes. Consider the following:
•
•
•
Route the bike lane behind the transit stop location using a raised bike lane or outer separation for that spot location. Ensure the resulting outer separation provided for the transit stop meets the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements (see Chapter 1510). Ensure signing and pavement markings are used to alert cyclists and pedestrians of the conflict area created with this design. Provide additional delineation in the bike lane to highlight the pedestrian and cyclist conflict, when separated buffered bike lanes and in-lane transit stops are used. Bus loading and other conflict areas will need to meet ADA requirements (see Chapter 1510) and those of the transit agency. Where bus operating speeds are low, consider a bus-bicycle shared lane with the transit agency.
Consider providing bicycle parking facilities near public transportation stops to improve accessibility performance needs.
1520.05(6) Interchange Considerations Crossing bicycle facilities through an interchange functional area has a greater potential for conflict because of higher travel speeds and lane configurations. Interchange crossings designed in a manner similar to intersection crossings are more compatible to bicyclists. Exhibit 1520-15 through Exhibit 1520-18 illustrate design options for bike facilities design through an interchange functional area. Interchanges can be special environments to evaluate the safety and mobility needs of the bike mode. The specific challenge is often the inclusion of motor vehicle free right turns to or from interchange ramps. The preferred configuration for bicycle safety performance at an interchange will not provide the motor vehicle free right turn and will realign ramps to intersect perpendicular with the crossroad (see off ramp terminal in Exhibit 1520-16). In some cases, it is possible to align the bike facility to cross an off ramp with a more direct path for the bike crossing (see Exhibit 1520-18). Breaking up the workload for the motor vehicle driver is one advantage of this configuration, similar to pedestrian treatments common in roundabout design. Shortening the crossing distance required for the bicyclist is another advantage with this configuration. Consider the inclusion of Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFB) or a refuge island when there are multiple travel lanes. This configuration may also require additional speed management (see Section 1103.05(2), signing or striping treatments on the ramp. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

1520.05(7) Sight Triangles at Intersections and Conflict Areas The visibility of all users is to be evaluated at intersections. Identifying sight triangles can help determine the optimal configuration of bicycle and pedestrian crossings. See Chapter 1310 for determining sight distance at an intersection, and Chapter 1340 for sight distance at road approaches near midblock crossings. Visibility is impacted by both speed and the configuration of the intersection. There are multiple benefits in multimodal intersection configurations to proactively manage motorized vehicle speeds (see Chapter 1103 for speed reducing traffic calming treatments) at intersection locations, rather than widening the intersection and/or removing elements from the roadside or streetside zone to obtain the needed sight distance. The primary objective at intersections and interchanges is to create a clear, distinct, and predictable travel path for all users through the intersection.
1520.05(8) Maintenance Considerations Consult with all maintenance jurisdictions for partnering opportunities and clearly understand which jurisdiction will be responsible for specific elements of the bike facility maintenance. Some maintenance jurisdictions may be better equipped to maintain the bike facility than others. Certain bike facilities, like the raised and curb separated, clearly fall within the jurisdictional authority of an incorporated city (see Chapter 1103 and Chapter 1600 for more information). For other facility types it may be more advantageous to discuss the capabilities of each maintenance jurisdiction and develop a maintenance agreement (see Chapter 301). It is important to obtain information from maintenance regarding the facility type and dimensioning and discuss methods for maintaining the facility. The Maintenance Owner’s Manual (See Chapter 301) is suggested to contain frequency, equipment needs and material types necessary for the continual maintenance of facility features, including but not limited to:
•

•
•

1600.01 General Roadside safety addresses the area outside the roadway and is an important component of total highway design. There are numerous reasons why a vehicle leaves the roadway, including driver error and behaviors. Regardless of the reason, a roadside design can reduce the severity and subsequent consequences of a roadside encroachment. From a crash reduction and severity perspective, the ideal highway has roadsides and median areas that are relatively flat and unobstructed by objects. It is also recognized that different facilities have different needs and considerations, and these issues are considered in any final design. It is not possible to provide a clear zone free of objects at all locations and under all circumstances. The engineer faces many tradeoffs in design decision-making such as balancing needs of the environment, right of way, and various modes of transportation. The fact that recommended design values related to the installation of barrier and other mitigation countermeasures are presented in this chapter, does not mean that WSDOT is required to modify or upgrade existing locations to meet current criteria. Roadside safety may be addressed by projects identified through priority programming, during certain preservation project activities (See Chapter 1120), or may be considered by projects as part of a safety analysis (See Chapter 321). Elements such as sideslopes, fixed objects, and water are all features that a vehicle might encounter when it leaves the roadway and become part of such an analysis. Roadside safety devices, such as traffic barriers, bridge barriers, transitions, impact attenuators, and breakaway devices, are features that may be installed to mitigate a specific roadside condition. On projects where the need to mitigate objects is determined based on location related to Design Clear Zone, consider the following mitigation measures in this order: (See Section 1600.02 Clear Zone) 1. Remove 2. Relocate 3. Redesign a fixed object by using breakaway features or making the fixed object traversable (See Section 1600.03) 4. Shield with a traffic barrier 5. Delineate (To only delineate requires a Design Analysis. If this seems to be your only option, consult your Region traffic barrier expert or your Region’s ASDE.) Factors for selecting a mitigation measure include, but may not be limited to:
•
•
•
Crash severity potential Maintenance needs Cost (initial and life cycle costs)
Rumble strips can be employed to reduce the potential for lane departure or roadside encroachment in certain contexts (see Section 1600.05(1)). Use traffic barriers when other measures cannot reasonably be accomplished, and conditions are appropriate based on an engineering analysis (See Chapter 1610). WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1600-1
Chapter 1600
Roadside Safety
1600.02 Clear Zone A clear roadside border area beginning at the edge of the traveled way is a primary consideration with existing or new roadside and median features (see Section 1600.03). The intent is to provide a clear, traversable area for a vehicle driver or bicyclist to recover when their path is altered due to environmental, human, or vehicle or bicycle factors. The Design Clear Zone indicates the target value for the clear roadside area (clear zone) and the level of documentation associated with roadside design. When a project will be addressing clear zone (see Exhibit 1105-1), compile an inventory of roadside and median features when they are located entirely or partially inside the Design Clear Zone, whether they are existing or proposed by the project. Document each inventoried feature location, the corrective actions considered, estimated cost to correct, and if the correction is planned or not using the Design Clear Zone Inventory Form. In cases where no action is taken, provide the reason(s) on the back of the form. In situations where the Design Clear Zone is beyond WSDOT right of way, evaluate options on a case-by-case basis. Consider the nature of the objects within the Design Clear Zone, the roadway geometry, traffic volume, and crash history. Coordinate with adjacent property owners when proposed options include any work beyond WSDOT right of way. At a minimum, provide clear zone to the limits of the WSDOT right of way. Clear zone is measured from the edge of the through traveled way, representing the intended lane of travel by any and all vehicles using the facility, and in both directions of travel on two-way facilities (see Exhibit 1600-1). All projects that alter the relationship between the through lane and the roadside by widening or realignment have altered the existing clear zone and require an evaluation of objects in the clear zone. Design Clear Zone principles apply to an auxiliary lane that operates as a through lane (such as a passing lane, truck climbing lane, etc.) while excluding turn lanes for at-grade intersections from applying Design Clear Zone principles.

1600.02(1) Design Clear Zone along Limited Access State Highways and Other State Highways Outside Incorporated Cities and Towns Use the Design Clear Zone Inventory form to identify features to be mitigated and propose actions taken to address those features. Guidance for establishing the Design Clear Zone for highways outside incorporated cities is provided in Exhibit 1600-3. This guidance also applies to limited access facilities within the city limits. Providing a clear recovery area that is consistent with this guidance does not require any additional documentation. However, there might be situations where it is not practicable to provide these recommended distances. In these situations, document the decision as a Design Analysis as discussed in Chapter 300. There is flexibility in establishing the Design Clear Zone in urbanized or urbanizing areas where operating speeds are 35 mph or less. To achieve this flexibility, use a Design Analysis to establish the Design Clear Zone that presents the tradeoffs associated with the decision. Provide information on the benefits and effects of the Design Clear Zone selected in the Design Analysis, including safety, aesthetics, the environment, economics, modal needs, and access control. Although not a WSDOT policy document on clear zone, Chapter 10 of the AASHTO Roadside Design Guide provides information to consider when performing a Design Analysis in urbanized areas. In curbed sections, and where applicable (e.g., parking), provide an 18-inch operational offset beyond the face of curb for lateral clearance to accommodate opening car doors or large side mirrors.
1600.02(2) Design Clear Zone Inside Incorporated Cities and Towns For managed access state highways within an urban area, it might not be practicable or appropriate to provide the Design Clear Zone distances shown in Exhibit 1600-3. Roadways within an urban area generally have curbs and sidewalks and might have objects such as trees, poles, benches, trash cans, landscaping, and transit shelters along the roadside. For projects on city streets as state highways that include work in those areas that are the city’s responsibility and jurisdiction (see Exhibit 1600-2), design the project using the city’s development/design standards. The standards adopted by the city must meet the requirements set by the City Design Standards Committee for all arterial projects, bike projects, and federal-aid projects. See the Local Agency Guidelines, Chapter 42, for more information on this Committee. Exhibit 1600-2 City and State Responsibilities and Jurisdictions

1600.02(2)(a) Roadside and Median For managed access state highways inside incorporated cities, it is the city’s responsibility to establish an appropriate Design Clear Zone in accordance with guidance contained in the City and County Design Standards (Local Agency Guidelines, Chapter 42.) Exhibit 1600-2 shows an example of state and city responsibilities and jurisdictions. Document the Design Clear Zone established by the city in the Design Documentation Package. Have the responsible transportation official from the city (e.g., City Engineer) document the Design Clear Zone, and their acknowledgement and acceptance of the design and maintenance responsibilities for project roadsides and medians, in a letter addressed to WSDOT, and file this letter as part of the local agency coordination in the Design Documentation Package. Respond to the sender acknowledging receipt.
1600.02(3) Design Clear Zone and Calculations Use Exhibit 1600-3 to determine the Design Clear Zone based on posted speed, sideslopes, and traffic volume at any given location. Note that there are no Design Clear Zone distances in the table for 3H:1V fill slopes. Fill slopes steeper than 4H:1V, but not steeper than 3H:1V are considered traversable if free of fixed objects. However, these slopes are also defined as nonrecoverable slopes. On nonrecoverable slopes, a vehicle might be able to begin recovery on the shoulder but will be unable to further recover control until it reaches a flatter area (4H:1V or flatter fill slope/3H:1V or flatter cut slope) beyond the toe of the nonrecoverable slope. Under these conditions, the Design Clear Zone distance is called a recovery area. The method used to calculate the recovery area and an example are shown in Exhibit 1600-4. For ditch sections, the following criteria determine the Design Clear Zone: a) For ditch sections with foreslopes 4H:1V or flatter (see Exhibit 1600-5, Case 1, for an example), the Design Clear Zone distance is the greater of the following: o The Design Clear Zone distance for a 10H:1V cut section based on speed and the average daily traffic (ADT); or o A horizontal distance of 5 feet beyond the beginning of the backslope. b) For ditch sections with foreslopes steeper than 4H:1V and backslopes steeper than 3H:1V, the Design Clear Zone distance is 10 feet horizontal beyond the beginning of the backslope (see Exhibit 1600-5, Case 2, for an example). c) For ditch sections with foreslopes steeper than 4H:1V and backslopes 3H:1V or flatter, the Design Clear Zone distance is the distance established using the recovery area formula (see Exhibit 1600-4; also see Exhibit 1600-5, Case 3, for an example).

*When the fill section slope is steeper than 4H:1V, but not steeper than 3H:1V, the Design Clear Zone distance is modified by the recovery area formula (see Exhibit 1600-4) and is referred to as the recovery area. The basic philosophy behind the recovery area formula is that the vehicle can traverse these slopes but cannot recover (control steering); therefore, the horizontal distance of these slopes is added to the Design Clear Zone distance to form the recovery area. Provide a minimum of 10 feet at the toe of all traversable, non‐recoverable fill slopes. Notes: For Roadside and Median areas on managed access state highways within incorporated cities, see Section 1600.02 for guidance. Curb is not considered adequate to redirect an errant vehicle. Design Clear Zone distances are given in feet, measured from the edge of traveled way.

* When the fill section slope is steeper than 4H:1V, but not steeper than 3H:1V, the Design Clear Zone distance is modified by the recovery area formula (see Exhibit 1600-4) and is referred to as the recovery area. The recovery area formula can be used in certain situations with foreslopes steeper than 3H:1V (see Section 1600.03(1)(a) and Exhibit 1600-5: Case 3 for more information). The basic philosophy behind the recovery area formula is that the vehicle can traverse these slopes but cannot recover and return to the roadway (control steering); therefore, the horizontal distance of these slopes is added to the Design Clear Zone distance to form the recovery area.

1600.03 Mitigation Guidance There are three general categories of features to be mitigated: sideslopes, fixed objects, and water. This section provides guidance for determining when these objects are to be mitigated. For each case, the following conditions need consideration:
•
•
•
•
•
Locations with an expected elevated crash frequency. Locations with pedestrian and bicyclist usage (See Chapter 1510, Pedestrian Facilities, Chapter 1515, Shared-Use Paths, and Chapter 1520, Roadway Bicycle Facilities). Locations where speed management measures are present or contemplated (See Chapter 1103). Locations with playgrounds, monuments, and other locations with high social value. Locations where redirectional landforms, also referred to as earth berms, were installed to mitigate objects located in depressed medians and at roadsides. They were constructed of materials that provided support for a traversing vehicle. With slopes in the range of 2H:1V to 3H:1V, they were intended to redirect errant vehicles. The use of redirectional landforms has been discontinued as a means for mitigating fixed objects. Where redirectional landforms currently exist as mitigation for a fixed object, provide designs where the landforms, and the feature(s) they were intended to mitigate, are removed, relocated, made crashworthy, or shielded with barrier.
The use of a traffic barrier for mitigation of features other than those described in the section below requires justification.
1600.03(1) Side Slopes 1600.03(1)(a) Fill Slopes Fill slopes can increase the crash potential for an errant vehicle with the degree of severity dependent upon the slope and height of the fill. Providing fill slopes that are 4H:1V or flatter can mitigate this condition. If flattening the slope is not feasible or cost-effective, the installation of a barrier might be appropriate. Exhibit 1600-6 represents a selection procedure used to determine whether a fill sideslope constitutes a condition for which a barrier is a cost-effective mitigation. The curves shown on Exhibit 1600-6 are based on the severity indexes and represent the points where total costs associated with a traffic barrier are equal to the predicted cost of crashes over the service life for selected slope heights without traffic barrier. Using Exhibit 1600-6, if the ADT and height of fill intersect below the “Slope Mitigation Required” side of the given embankment slope curve, then flatten the slope. Otherwise, provide a barrier if flattening the slope is not feasible. In new construction or reconstruction, a design analysis is required when not flattening slopes nor installing barrier in instances where Exhibit 1600-6 indicates that mitigation is required, or when installing barrier in instances where Exhibit 1600-6 indicates mitigation is not required. Do not use Exhibit 1600-6 for fill slope design. First, design slopes following guidance in Chapter 1239 by evaluating side slope designs with clear, traversable slopes before pursuing a barrier option. Then, use Exhibit 1600-6 to verify whether slope flattening or barrier is required for the slope.

Chapter 1600
Roadside Safety
1600.03(1)(b) Cut Slopes A traversable cut slope reduces crash potential. The exception is a rock cut with a rough face that might cause vehicle snagging rather than providing relatively smooth redirection. Analyze the location and evaluate the roadside characteristics, crash potential, and other benefits of treatment of rough rock cuts located within the Design Clear Zone. Conduct an individual investigation for each rock cut or group of rock cuts. A cost-effectiveness analysis that considers the consequences of doing nothing, removal, smoothing of the cut slope, grading at the base of the rock cut to provide a smooth surface, and other viable options to reduce the severity of the condition can be used to determine the appropriate treatment. Some potential mitigative options are roadside barrier and rumble strips.
1600.03(2) Fixed Objects Use engineering judgment when considering the following objects for mitigation:
•
•
•
•
•
Wooden poles or posts with cross-sectional areas greater than 16 square inches that do not have breakaway features. Signs, illumination, cameras, weather stations, and other items mounted on non-breakaway poles, cantilevers, or bridges. Trees with a diameter of 4 inches or more, measured at 6 inches above the ground surface. Fixed objects extending above the ground surface by more than 4 inches; for example, boulders, concrete bridge rails, signal/electrical/ITS cabinets, piers, and retaining walls. Drainage elements, such as culvert and pipe ends.
1600.03(2)(a) Trees When evaluating new plantings or existing trees in the Design Clear Zone, consider the maximum allowable diameter of 4 inches, measured at 6 inches above the ground when the tree has matured. When removing trees within the Design Clear Zone, complete removal of stumps is preferred. However, to avoid significant disturbance of the roadside vegetation, larger stumps may be mitigated by grinding or cutting them flush to the ground and grading around them. Removal of trees may reduce the severity of impacts of roadway departure. It is recognized that different facilities have different needs and considerations, and these issues are considered in any design. For instance, removal of trees within the Design Clear Zone may not be desirable in suburban, urban, or urban core areas, or in other land use contexts that provide for non-motorized uses, such as a forest, park, or within a scenic and recreational highway. In these situations, analyze crash reports’ contributing factors to determine whether roadside vegetation is contributing to the severity of crashes. If large vegetation is removed, consult guidance contained in established vegetation management plans, corridor plans, or the WSDOT Roadside Manual. Additional guidance for maintenance of roadside vegetation can be found for some routes in the Memorandum of Understanding between the US Forest Service and WSDOT, Highways Over National Forest Lands, dated . In incorporated cities, refer to guidance in Section 1600.02(2).

1600.03(2)(b) Mailboxes For mailboxes located within the Design Clear Zone, provide supports and connections as shown in the Standard Plans. The height from the ground to the bottom of the mailbox may vary from 3 feet 5 inches to 3 feet 9 inches.) Coordinate with homeowners when upgrading mailboxes. Where sidewalks are present, contact the postal service to determine the most appropriate mailbox location. Locate mailboxes on limited access highways in accordance with Chapter 530, Limited Access. A turnout, as shown in Exhibit 1600-7, is not needed on limited access highways with shoulders of 6 feet or more where only one mailbox is to be installed. On managed access highways, mailboxes are to be on the right-hand side of the road in the postal carrier’s direction of travel. Avoid placing mailboxes along high-speed, high-volume highways. Locate Neighborhood Delivery and Collection Box Units outside the Design Clear Zone. Exhibit 1600-7 Mailbox Location and Turnout Design

Roadside Safety
1600.03(2)(c) Culvert Ends Provide a traversable end treatment when the culvert end section or opening is within the Design Clear Zone. No part of the culvert or end treatment should protrude more than 4" above the ground line. Traversable end treatments include:
•
•
Culverts perpendicular to direction of travel: o Culverts 36” and smaller as measured parallel to the direction of travel (Consider treating these culvert ends even outside Design Clear Zone) ▪ For roadway side slopes 4:1 or steeper, see Standard Plan B-70.20 ▪ For slopes flatter than 4:1 (see Standard Plan B-70.20 and note “treatment for slopes flatter than 4:1”) o Culverts larger than 36 inches, as measured parallel to the direction of travel, require Type 1 safety bars. (See Standard Plan B-75.50) Culverts parallel to direction of travel require safety bars: o Type 2 safety bars are used for circular culverts up to 36 inches. (See Standard Plan B-75.60) o Type 3 safety bars are used for metal end sections of circular culverts between 36 inches and 60 inches and for metal end sections of arched culverts between 30 inches and 72 inches. (See Standard Plan B-80.20) o Type 4 safety bars are used for metal end sections of circular culverts between 15 inches and 60 inches and for metal end sections of arched culverts between 18 inches and 72 inches. (See Standard Plan B-80.40)
Bars are permitted where they will not significantly affect the stream hydraulics and where debris drift is minor. Consult the Region Maintenance Office and Region Hydraulics to verify these conditions. If debris drift is a concern, consult Region Hydraulics for options to reduce the amount of debris that can enter the pipe.
1600.03(2)(d) Signposts Whenever possible, locate signs behind the standard run, but not the end terminals, of existing or planned traffic barrier installations to eliminate the need for breakaway posts, and place them such that the sign face is behind the barrier. (See Chapter 1020 for additional information regarding the placement of signs.) Use the MUTCD to guide placement of the warning sign. Signposts with cross-sectional areas greater than 16 square inches that are within the Design Clear Zone and not located behind a barrier are to have breakaway features as shown in the Standard Plans. Sign bridges and cantilever sign supports are designed for placement outside the Design Clear Zone or must be shielded by barrier.
1600.03(2)(e) Traffic Signal Standards/Posts/Supports A design analysis is not required to install signal poles at intersections inside the Design Clear Zone because it is a common practice and practicable mitigation options for locating signal poles at these locations are limited. Although locating a signal pole outside the Design Clear Zone is desirable, this mitigation option is not feasible in many cases. Other possible mitigation options for overhead signals including breakaway supports or placing barrier to shield a signal pole are generally not feasible or desirable. Using barrier is typically not feasible due to geometric constraints and the need to accommodate pedestrians and bicyclists. Supports for overhead ramp meter signals are generally not breakaway, but traffic barrier is an available mitigation option in most cases.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1600-13
Chapter 1600
Roadside Safety
Shorter vertical signal supports are available with breakaway features. Vertical poles greater than 10-feet in height require additional grading for the breakaway features to function properly. This additional grading is the same as that required for breakaway light standards (See Section 1600.03(2)(h)).
1600.03(2)(f) Fire Hydrants Fire hydrants are typically allowed on WSDOT right of way by franchise or permit. Fire hydrants that are made of cast iron can be expected to fracture on impact and can therefore be considered a breakaway device. Any portion of the hydrant that will not be breakaway must not extend more than 4 inches above the ground. In addition, the hydrant must have a stem that will shut off water flow in the event of an impact. Provide mitigation to address potential vehicle impact with hydrant types not expected to fracture on impact.
1600.03(2)(g) Utility Objects Because utilities often share the highway right of way, utility objects such as poles, guy wires, and pedestals are often located along the roadside. These features are installed in the right of way under a variety of occupancy rights; including franchises, permits, or easements. The responsibilities and liabilities associated with the presence of these objects is directly related to the documentation authorizing their installation. Importantly, the rights contained within these authorizing documents include cost responsibility for relocation. Contact the region Utility Engineer to determine if action is needed regarding utility objects located within the project limits, and the occupancy rights in effect for the objects. For policy and guidance on locating new, and mitigating existing, utility objects along state highways, see Chapter 9 of the Utilities Manual. Coordinate with the region Utilities Office to obtain guidance on utility object design or to determine mitigation requirements for existing utility objects.
1600.03(2)(h) Light Standards Provide breakaway light standards unless fixed light standards can be justified, even if outside of the Design Clear Zone. Fixed light standards may be justified if one of the following criteria are met:
•
•
•
•
•
Posted speed is below 35 MPH (See Section 1600.02(1) for Design Clear Zone in urbanized and urbanizing areas, and Section 1600.02(2) in cities). Mounted on barrier (top or elbow mount). Behind traffic barrier, beyond the barrier’s deflection design value (see Chapter 1610). Within a parking lot. Along isolated walkways and shared-use paths that are outside of Design Clear Zone.
Breakaway light standards require additional embankment widening to ensure proper operation, as shown in the Standard Plans and shall be provided in the contract plans (see WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual Section 700.08(3)). For cut sections, a culvert may be required in front-of or behind the foundation to maintain a ditch line. If this additional embankment widening cannot be constructed, such as in cases where the toe of slope will extend beyond right of way or into a water body or other sensitive area, fixed bases and traffic barrier may be considered. Document the decision to use fixed bases in the Design Documentation Package. Breakaway poles outside of the Design Clear Zone do not require additional embankment widening if the grade is constant within a 15-foot radius of the pole.

1600.03(2)(i) Horizontal Chain-link Fence Rails (New Section 2023) When an existing chain link fence with one or more horizontal rails is located within the Design Clear Zone, replace or modify the chain link fence to omit horizontal rails. When installing new chain link fencing within the Design Clear Zone, provide chain link fencing with no horizontal rails. See Standard Plan L-20.10.
1600.03(3) Water Water with a depth of 2 feet or more and located with a likelihood of encroachment by an errant vehicle is to be evaluated for mitigation. Perform a benefit-cost analysis that considers the consequences of doing nothing versus installing a longitudinal barrier to determine the appropriate treatment (see Chapter 321 for more information). For fencing considerations along water features see Chapter 560.
1600.04 Medians Median barriers are normally used on limited access, multilane, high-volume highways. These highways generally have posted speeds of 45 mph or higher. Median barrier is normally placed on limited access state highways. Where median barrier is used on managed access highways where bicyclists, pedestrians, and transit users are present, consider providing accessible barrier openings at crossing locations. Install end treatments where median barrier openings are provided. Provide median barrier on full access control multilane highways with median widths of 50 feet or less and posted speeds of 45 mph or higher. Consider median barrier on highways with wider medians or lower posted speeds when there is a history of cross-median crashes. Contact the HQ Design Office for more information. In diverging diamond interchanges that involve a single bridge structure, or in which travel directions share a continuous surface, provide a barrier in order to separate travel directions or to separate vehicles from a pedestrian facility in the median regardless of the posted speed or median width. Barrier type and design may be either project specific or selected from standard plans. Contact the HQ Design Office for more information. Provide a left-side shoulder when installing median barrier using width criteria given in Chapter 1230. Consider a wider shoulder area where the barrier might cast a shadow on the roadway and hinder the melting of ice. (See Chapter 1239 for additional criteria for placement of median barrier, Chapter 1610 for information on the types of barriers that can be used, and Chapter 1260 for lateral clearance on the inside of a curve to provide the needed stopping sight distance.) Consider the need to accommodate drainage as a result of the addition of median barrier treatments. When median barrier is being placed in an existing median, identify the existing crossovers and enforcement observation points. Provide the needed median crossovers in accordance with Chapter 1370, considering enforcement needs. Chapter 1410 provides guidance on HOV enforcement.
1600.05 Other Roadside Safety Features 1600.05(1) Rumble Strips and Rumble Stripes Rumble strips are milled grooves or rows of raised pavement markers placed perpendicular to the direction of travel, or a continuous sinusoidal pattern milled longitudinal to the direction of travel, intended to alert inattentive drivers to a potential lane departure. A sinusoidal pattern can be used when a low noise design is desired.

Roadside Safety
The pavement receiving rumble strips needs to be in good condition and thick enough to support the rumble strips. Certain pavement types, such as open graded pavements, are not suitable for rumble strip installation. Grinding rumble strips into inadequate pavement will lead to premature deterioration of the surrounding pavement. Areas where the pavement is inadequate for rumble strip installation require removal and replacement of the existing pavement at and adjacent to the location of the rumble strip. Consult with the Region Materials Engineer to determine whether the existing pavement is adequate for rumble strip installation. The Region Materials Engineer will provide a pavement design for removing and replacing the existing pavement near the rumble strip if needed. When installing both rumble strips and recessed lane markers, follow the Standard Plan to avoid overlapping the grindings. Contact HQ Bridge to confirm if rumble strips are appropriate to be installed on bridges included in the project. Installing rumble strips in bituminous surface treatment (or BST) or other thin surface treatments can expose pavement structure and lead to delamination. In new rumble strip locations where a BST will be applied on top of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) pavement, install the rumble strips in the HMA pavement before placing the BST. Increase the milling depth of the rumble strips in order to maintain the plan rumble depth by accounting for the BST thickness (see WSDOT Standard Plans). See guidance in Section 1120.02(11) for any type of project that applies a BST (chip seal) on top of an existing rumble strip. Provide an offset to the longitudinal paving joint so that rumble strips are not ground into the joint where practicable. For additional guidance on surface preparation and pavement stability, refer to the WSDOT Pavement Policy. The noise created when vehicle tires contact a rumble strip may adversely impact nearby residences and other land uses. Left-turning or passing vehicles, frequent passing maneuvers on two lane highways, and off-tracking of vehicles or trailers in tight radius curves, are examples of situations where incidental contact can happen. Noise impacts may be anticipated, and a low noise rumble strip design may be appropriate for use at these locations when installing rumble strips in urban growth areas, and/or within 600 feet of a residence, school, church, or campground. In situations where a low noise rumble strip is desired but is not feasible, measures can still be taken to reduce incidental contact, including discontinuing the rumble strip through frequently used road approaches, through passing zones, and in tight radius curves. Contact HQ Design for more information about low noise rumble strip designs, noise mitigation strategies, and the criteria for employing them. There are three types of rumble strip functions: transverse, shoulder, and centerline, and each are described in the following sections.
1600.05(1)(a) Transverse Rumble Strips Transverse rumble strips are placed transversely in the traveled way to alert drivers who are approaching a change of roadway condition or object that requires substantial speed reduction or other maneuvering. Transverse rumble strips may be placed in advance of locations such as:
•
•
•
•
Stop-controlled intersections Port of entry/customs stations Lane reductions where crash history shows a pattern of driver inattention, and Horizontal alignment changes where crash history shows a pattern of driver inattention.
Transverse rumble strips may also be placed at locations where the character of the roadway changes, such as at the end of a freeway. Contact the HQ Design Office for additional guidance on the design and placement of transverse rumble strips. Document decisions to use transverse rumble strips in the Design Documentation Package.

Roadside Safety
1600.05(1)(b) Shoulder Rumble Strips and Rumble Stripes Shoulder rumble strips (SRS) are placed parallel to the traveled way just beyond the edge line to warn drivers they are entering a part of the roadway not intended for routine traffic use. Shoulder rumble stripes are rumble strips placed immediately under the shoulder delineation paint, with any excess width milled or placed outward towards the shoulder. Shoulder rumble stripes are only installed where there is insufficient space to install shoulder rumble strips per one of the standard configurations (see Section 1600.05(1)(b)ii Undivided Highways). When shoulder rumble strips and shoulder rumble stripes are used, discontinue them where no edge stripe is present, such as at intersections and where curb and gutter are present. Discontinue shoulder rumble strips and rumble stripes where shoulder driving is allowed. Shoulder rumble strip and rumble stripe patterns vary depending on whether bicyclists are expected to use the highway shoulder, and whether they are placed on divided or undivided highways. Rumble strip patterns for undivided highways are shallower and may be narrower than patterns used on divided highways. Rumble strips and rumble stripes installed on undivided highways also provide gaps in the pattern, providing opportunities for bicycles to move across the pattern without having to ride across the grooves. There are four shoulder rumble strip and four shoulder rumble stripe patterns. Consult the Standard Plans (rumble strips) or Plan Sheet Library (rumble stripes) for patterns and construction details.
i Divided Highways Install shoulder rumble strips on both the right and left shoulders of rural Interstate highways. Consider them on both shoulders of rural divided highways. Use the Shoulder Rumble Strip or rumble stripe Type 1 pattern on divided highways. Omit shoulder rumble strips or rumble stripes along highway segments where any of the following conditions occur:
•
•
•
•
When another project scheduled within two years of the proposed project will overlay or reconstruct the shoulders or will use the shoulders for detours. At locations where the overall shoulder width is: o Less than 4-feet wide on the left (median) side of the roadway. o Less than 6-feet wide on the right side of the roadway (5-feet wide where rumble stripes are used). At locations where it’s been determined that noise is an issue, and a low noise design is not appropriate (see Section 1600.05(1)). As per Standard plan M-60.10.
ii Undivided Highways Shoulder rumble strips or rumble stripes are typically considered on undivided highways during centerline rumble strip installation or pavement rehabilitation. A list of prospective locations are provided to regions by HQ Design as a starting point in their development of a final list. The final list is compiled based on a field review of the prospective locations. Omit shoulder rumble strips or rumble stripes along highway segments where any of the following conditions occur:
•
•
Where usable shoulder for bicycles will be reduced to less than 4-feet (5-feet where barrier is present). Field-verify these dimensions. Where downhill grades exceed 4% for more than 500 feet in length along routes where bicyclists are frequently present.

Roadside Safety
At locations where it’s been determined that noise is an issue, and a low noise design is not appropriate (see Section 1600.05(1)). As per Standard plan M-60.10.
Document decisions to omit prospective rumble strip or rumble stripe locations in the final list of locations. When selecting a rumble strip or rumble stripe design, consult the Standard Plans and Plan Sheet Library for the patterns and construction details, and apply the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
Consider using a low noise pattern, or employ measures to reduce incidental contact, in areas where noise impacts are anticipated (apply criteria in Section 1600.05(1)). Consider using a rumble stripe in narrower sections where they can help provide the required 4-feet of usable shoulder (5-feet where guardrail is present). Use Shoulder Rumble Strip Type 2 or Type 3 pattern on highways with minimal bicycle traffic. Use the Shoulder Rumble Strip Type 4 pattern where the bicycle traffic level on the shoulder is determined to be high. Consult the region and Headquarters Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinators to determine the bicycle traffic level and engage them in decision-making processes related to the use of rumble strips or rumble stripes on bike touring routes, and/or on other routes where bicycle events are regularly held.
1600.05(1)(c) Centerline Rumble Strips Centerline rumble strips are installed on the centerline of undivided highways to alert drivers that they are entering the opposing lane. Centerline rumble strips are installed with no differentiation between passing permitted and no passing areas. See WSDOT Standard Plan M-65.10 that shows when to continue or discontinue centerline rumble strip installation at certain roadway locations (i.e., intersections, bridges, road approaches, etc.). Refresh pavement markings when removed by centerline rumble strips. When installing both centerline rumble strips and recessed lane markers, follow Standard Plan M-65.10 to avoid overlapping the grindings. Centerline rumble strips are typically installed on rural highways where the posted speed is 45 mph or higher. They may also be installed on urban routes with posted speeds as low as 35 mph. A list of prospective centerline rumble strip installation locations is provided to regions by HQ Design as a starting point in their development of a final list. The final list is compiled based on a detailed review of the prospective locations using the following criteria.
•
•
•
•
•
Field verify lane and shoulder widths. See Chapter 1230 for guidance on lane and shoulder widths. Centerline rumble strips are only installed where the combined lane and shoulder width in either direction is greater than 12 feet. In locations where the combined lane and shoulder width in either direction is 14 feet or less, consider the level of bicyclist and pedestrian use along the route before installing centerline rumble strips. When drivers shift their lane position away from centerline to avoid the rumble strips, they are moving closer to pedestrians and bicyclists on the shoulder. Consider using a low noise rumble strip design in locations where noise is an issue or employ measures for reducing incidental contact where a low noise design is not feasible (apply criteria in Section 1600.05(1)). In urban areas, do not consider installing rumble strips where the need to interrupt the rumble strip pattern to accommodate left-turning vehicles is very frequent, or where the posted speed is 35 mph and below. Do not use centerline rumble strips where two way left-turn lanes exist.

Document the decision to omit centerline rumble strips in a Design Analysis, when that decision is outside of the policy provided in this section (see Chapter 300.)
1600.05(2) Headlight Glare Considerations Headlight glare from opposing traffic is most common between opposing main line traffic. Glare screens can be used to mitigate this condition. Other conditions for which glare screen might be appropriate are:
•
•
•
Between a highway and an adjacent frontage road, shared-use path, or parallel highway, especially where opposing headlights might seem to be on the wrong side of the driver. At an interchange where an on-ramp merges with a collector-distributor and the ramp traffic might be unable to distinguish between collector and main line traffic. Where headlight glare is a distraction to adjacent property owners. Playgrounds, ball fields, and parks with frequent nighttime activities might benefit from screening if headlight glare interferes with these activities.
Glare screening is normally not justifiable where the median width exceeds 20 feet, and the ADT is less than 20,000 vehicles per day. Document the decision to use glare screening using the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Higher frequency of night crashes compared to similar locations or based on statewide experience. Higher than normal ratio of night-to-day crashes. Unusual distribution or concentration of nighttime crashes. Over-representation of older drivers in night crashes. Combination of horizontal and vertical alignment, particularly where the roadway on the inside of a curve is higher than the roadway on the outside of the curve. Direct observation of glare. Public complaints concerning glare.
There are currently three basic types of glare screening available: chain link (see the Standard Plans), vertical blades, and concrete barrier (see Exhibit 1600-8). When the glare is temporary (due to construction activity), consider traffic volumes, alignment, duration, presence of illumination, and type of construction activity. Glare screening may be used to reduce rubbernecking associated with construction activity, but less expensive methods, such as plywood that seals off the view of the construction area, might be more appropriate.

Chapter Organization: Sections 1610.01 Introduction and 1610.02 Barrier Impacts present information to consider when deciding whether or not to install a barrier. Section 1610.03 General Barrier Design contains guidance common to ALL barrier types; such as deflection distance, minimum/maximum system lengths, length of need, and sight distance. The remaining sections, 1610.04 through 1610.08, present design information organized by specific barrier type (beam guardrail, cable barrier, concrete barrier, bridge traffic barrier, and other barriers). Refer to the Glossary of Terms for many of the terms used in this chapter. Refer to Chapter 300 and Section 1610.01(1) for design documentation requirements.
1610.01 Introduction WSDOT uses traffic barriers to reduce the overall severity of crashes. Consideration is given as to whether a barrier is preferable to the recovery area it may replace. In some cases, installation of a traffic barrier may result in more crashes as it’s an object that can be struck. Barriers are designed so that such encounters might be less severe and not lead to secondary or tertiary crashes. However, traffic barriers are not guaranteed to redirect an impacting vehicle without resulting injury to its occupants or triggering additional crashes. Barrier performance is affected by the characteristics of the vehicles that collide with them. Different vehicles will react differently given the characteristics and dynamics of the crash. Therefore, vehicles will be decelerated and redirected differently given the size, weight and direction of force imparted from the vehicle to the barrier. Barriers are not placed with the assumption that the system will restrain or redirect all vehicles in all conditions. It is recognized that the designer cannot design a system that will address every potential crash situation. Instead, barriers are placed with the assumption that, under typical crash conditions, they might decrease the potential for excessive vehicular deceleration or excessive vehicle redirection when compared to the location without the barrier. Traffic barriers do not prevent crashes or injuries from occurring. They often lower the potential severity for crash outcomes. Consequently, barriers should not be used unless a reduced crash severity potential is likely. No matter how well a barrier system is designed, optimal performance is dependent on drivers’ proper maintenance and operation of their vehicles and the proper use of passenger restraint systems. Site constraints play a major role in decisions regarding barrier selection and placement.

Page 1610-1
Chapter 1610
Traffic Barriers
Depending on the location, these constraints may include environmental considerations, topographic challenges, restricted right-of-way, geologic concerns, or conflicts with other infrastructure. Barrier systems and vehicle fleets continue to evolve. The choice of a barrier is based on the characteristics of today’s vehicle fleet and testing criteria, not on speculative assumptions of future vehicle designs. This continuum of change does not allow engineers to predict the future with any degree of certainty. Consequently, engineering decisions need to be made based on the most reliable and current information. Engineers are constantly striving to develop more effective design features to improve highway safety. However, economics, asset management and maintenance needs, and feasibility do not permit the deployment of new designs as soon as they become available on the market or are invented by a manufacturer. Further, most new designs only make marginal changes to systems and do not imply that old designs are unsafe or need modification. Solutions may consider crash frequency and severity. As discussed previously, performance of the system relies on the interaction of the vehicle, driver, and system design at any given location. Additionally, the ability to safely access, maintain and operate over time is incorporated into the final barrier decision. When barriers are crash-tested, it is impossible to replicate the innumerable variations in highway conditions under which the barrier applications occur. Therefore, barriers are crash-tested under standardized conditions. These standard conditions were previously documented in National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Reports 230 and 350. These guidelines have been updated and are now presented in the AASHTO publication, Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH). Roadside safety hardware (barriers, devices, etc.) are accepted for use by WSDOT following a review of its performance with respect to a crash testing standard. Documented evidence of performance includes, but is not limited to, crash testing results, a comparison to similar crash tested designs, or an engineering analysis of the system and/or its components. Following a successful review, the device is then considered “compliant” with the applicable standard (e.g., MASH-compliant). The latest roadside safety hardware standard (MASH) is being implemented by WSDOT product category. Implementation takes place as designs and products are reviewed by WSDOT, determined to be MASHcompliant, and accepted for use. Following acceptance, implementation is documented through modifications to the corresponding standard specification(s), standard plan(s), and/or are accepted to the Qualified Products List (in the case of proprietary hardware). The policy on work zone devices is described in Chapter 1010. To learn more about MASH implementation at WSDOT see the following website: Roadside safety | WSDOT (wa.gov)
1610.01(1) Documentation Document barrier location decisions, including any site constraints encountered that influenced those decisions. A decision to install barrier using criteria outside the guidance provided in this chapter requires a Design Analysis, unless otherwise directed by the ASDE.
1610.02 Barrier Impacts Engineering judgment is required in determining the appropriate placement of barrier systems, therefore consider the location of the system and the possible impacts the barrier may have to other highway objectives.

Chapter 1610
Traffic Barriers
1610.02(1) Assessing Impacts to Stormwater and Wetlands The presence of stormwater facilities or wetlands influence the choice and use of barrier systems. For example, the placement of concrete barrier may increase the amount of impervious surface, which could then result in retrofit or reconstruction of the existing retention/detention systems and environmental impact requirements and studies. Assess whether concrete barrier or beam guardrail placement will cause the need for an evaluation by the HQ Environmental Services Office. Conduct this evaluation early in the project’s development process to allow adequate time for discussion of options.
1610.02(2) Assessing Impacts to Wildlife The placement of concrete barriers in locations where wildlife frequently crosses the highway can influence wildlife-vehicle crash potential. When wildlife encounters physical barriers that are difficult to see beyond or cross, such as concrete barriers, they often stop or move parallel to those barriers, increasing their time on the highway and their exposure. Traffic-related wildlife mortality may play a role in the decline of some species listed under the Endangered Species Act. To address wildlife concerns, see Exhibit 1610-1 to assess whether barrier placement needs to have an evaluation by the HQ Environmental Services Office to determine its effect on wildlife. Conduct this evaluation early in the project development process to allow adequate time for discussion of options. Exhibit 1610-1 Concrete Barrier Placement Guidance: Assessing Impacts to Wildlife

1610.03 General Barrier Design Apply the policy and guidance in this chapter when directed to do so in Exhibit 1105-1, and following an examination of the potential alternative mitigation measures described in Section 1600.01. Chapter 1120 identifies those elements and features to be evaluated and potentially addressed during the course of many Preservation projects (see Exhibit 1105-1). Once the use of a barrier has been selected as the mitigation measure for a condition, select a particular barrier type by considering the barrier system’s deflection characteristics, cost, maintainability and impacts to traffic flow during repair. Barriers are categorized as flexible, semi-rigid, or rigid depending on their deflection characteristics (see Exhibit 1610-3). Barrier types include:
•
•
•
•
•
Beam Guardrail Cable Barrier Concrete Barrier Bridge Traffic Barrier Other Barriers
1610.03(1) New Roadside Safety Hardware Since non-rigid systems typically sustain more damage during an impact, consider the amount of traffic exposure maintenance crews might incur with the more frequent need for repairs. The costs for procuring and maintaining the barrier system are important factors when considering what system to install. Considerations may include:
•
•
•
•
•
Consultation with the Area Maintenance Superintendent to identify needs or recommendations. Drainage, alignment, and drifting snow or sand are considerations that can influence the selection of barrier type. Beam guardrail and concrete barrier can contribute to snow drifts. Consider long-term maintenance costs associated with snow removal at locations prone to snow drifting. Cable barrier is not an obstruction to drifting snow. Analysis of potential reduction of sight distance due to barrier selection and placement. Additional widening and earthwork requirements. With some systems, such as concrete barrier and beam guardrail, the need for additional shoulder widening or slope flattening is common. Selection of these types of barriers may require substantial environmental permitting or roadway reconstruction. Permits issued under the SEPA and NEPA processes may lead to the use of a barrier design, such as cable barrier, which has fewer potential environmental impacts and costs. For concrete barrier systems: o Lower maintenance costs than for other barrier types. o Deterioration due to weather and vehicle impacts is less than most other barrier systems. o Unanchored precast concrete barrier can usually be realigned or repaired after a vehicle impact. However, heavy equipment may be necessary to reposition or replace barrier segments. Therefore, in medians, consider the shoulder width and the traffic volume when determining the acceptability of unanchored precast concrete barrier versus rigid concrete barrier. See Exhibit 1610-3 for deflection area requirements.

1610.03(2) Existing Roadside Safety Hardware When directed in Exhibit 1105-1 to apply the policy and guidance in this chapter, evaluate the need to upgrade existing roadside safety hardware to a MASH-compliant product or design. Consider the standard to which the existing barrier or device was originally designed and tested: MASH, NCHRP 350, and pre-NCHRP 350. The decision to replace existing hardware that is not MASH-compliant is based on the project type as follows:
•
•
•
All projects directed to use this chapter in Exhibit 1105-1 are required to replace pre-NCHRP 350 hardware, except for breakaway cable (guardrail) terminals, which have their own independent replacement program. In addition, all improvement and preservation projects directed to use this chapter in Exhibit 1105-1 may leave in place existing NCHRP 350 compliant hardware that is still in serviceable condition, or alternatively may relocate it within the project limits. Note that NHCRP 350 hardware found to be in serviceable condition that is temporarily moved as part of work zone activity may also be reinstalled in its original location without the need to upgrade. See Section 1620.03(2)(a thru c) to determine if existing roadside safety hardware is in serviceable condition. See Section 1610.04(5) for additional evaluation instructions for beam guardrail terminals.
See Chapter 1120 for additional policy on addressing existing roadside safety hardware in Preservation projects. When leaving existing barrier in place per the direction above, confirm that the configuration and layout (height, length, offset, etc.) are according to the original standard, and correct if necessary. Consult with your ASDE for more information and for the latest guidance on documenting the decision to replace or not replace NCHRP 350 hardware on a project.
1610.03(2)(a) Guardrail and Guardrail Terminal Condition (New Section 2023) Examine guardrail condition using the procedure and metrics in the WSDOT publication “Field Guide for Guardrail Condition Assessment,” which is found on the Roadside Safety webpage. Establish and record the specific locations that match damage classes Medium and High as described in the guide and provide a replacement or repair of the hardware at those locations as part of the project. For replacement of sections in Type 1 guardrail runs involving six or more (75-feet or more) adjacent rail panels or posts and hardware associated with the adjacent panels, replace the damaged length with Type 31 guardrail components including adaptor sections to the rest of the run (see Std Plans C-20.10 and C-25.80). When the rail damage is within 100 feet of the end of a run, replace the end of the run and upgrade the terminal if it is not MASH compliant per Section 1610.04(5).
1610.03(2)(b) Concrete Barrier Condition (New Section 2023) Examine the condition of the concrete barrier with respect to the following criteria.
•
•
Replace concrete barrier having one or more of the listed issues: o One or more cracks that penetrate through the entire section. o One or more spalls in the concrete with a depth of greater than 1.5 inches. o Exposed rebar or bolts that are protruding through the barrier surface. o Cracked or broken concrete that could be easily dislodged if struck by a vehicle. o End connection hardware that is deformed, bent, broken, corroded/rusted, or no longer functional. Concrete barrier does not need to be replaced when having one or more of the following: o Only minor blemishes (e.g., dirt, scuffs, traffic marks, superficial surface cracking, etc.).

1610.03(2)(c) Other Roadside Safety Device Condition (New Section 2023) Replace other types of roadside safety devices not discussed in 1610.03(2)(a or b) which the responsible maintenance superintendent has identified as “unable to be serviced or repaired” (e.g., impact attenuators, inertial sand barrels, etc.). It is permissible not to replace roadside safety devices if they are functional and are: (1) being addressed in an upcoming funded or programmed project, or (2) already being addressed by maintenance activities. Consult with your ASDE when not replacing a roadside safety device for any other reason.
1610.03(3) Barrier Placement Proper installation of a barrier system is required for the system to perform similar to the crash tests that resulted in its acceptance for use on our highways. Maximize the distance between the barrier and the travelled way. See Chapter 1239 for minimum lateral clearance requirements.
1610.03(3)(a) Placement on a Slope Slopes may affect barrier placement. Considerations for barrier placement on a slope include:
•
•
For slopes that are 10:1 or flatter, concrete barrier, beam guardrail or cable barrier can be installed anywhere beyond the edge of shoulder. See Exhibit 1610-2. For additional placement guidance see Section 1610.05(1) for cable barrier, see Section 1610.04(2) for beam guardrail, and see Section 1610.06 for concrete barrier.

•
•
•
Contact HQ Design when retrofitting non-freeways with median barrier (regardless of median width). Address the design deflection characteristics of the barrier to avoid placement of barrier where the design deflection extends into oncoming traffic. Barrier may be provided under certain conditions as separation between a freeway mainline and collector-distributor road (see Chapter 1360). When W-beam barrier is placed in a median as a countermeasure for cross-median crashes, design the barrier to be struck from either direction of travel. For example, the installation of beam guardrail might be double-sided (Type 31-DS). Narrow medians provide little space for any maintenance activities, including repair or repositioning of the barrier. Installing barriers in medians that provide less than 8 feet from the edge of the traveled way to the face of the barrier will likely require temporarily closing the adjacent lane during maintenance activities. This will impact the travelling public and impact maintenance staff, and maintenance staff should be consulted. See Chapter 301 Design and Maintenance Coordination. Use single slope high performance concrete barrier (HP barrier) on freeways with medians 22-feet wide and less. Any barrier type listed above may be used on freeways with medians greater than 22-feet wide. In general, cable barrier is recommended with medians that are 30 feet or wider. However, cable barrier may be appropriate for narrower medians if adequate deflection distance exists. In wider medians, the selection and placement of barrier might depend on the slopes in the median. At locations where the median slopes are relatively flat (10H:1V or flatter), unrestrained precast concrete barrier, beam guardrail, and cable barrier can be used depending on the available deflection distance. At these locations, position the barrier as close to the center of the median as possible so that the recovery distance can be maximized for both directions. There may be a need to offset the barrier from the flow line to avoid impacts to the drainage flow. At locations where the roadways are on independent alignments and there is a difference in elevation between the roadways, the slope from the upper roadway might be steeper than 6H:1V. In these locations, position the median barrier along the upper roadway and provide deflection and offset distance as discussed previously. Barrier is generally not needed along the lower roadway except where there are fixed features in the median.
For additional placement guidance see Section 1610.05(1) for cable barrier, see Section 1610.04(2) for beam guardrail, and see Section 1610.06 for concrete barrier.
1610.03(3)(c) Placing Barrier Next to Dissimilar-Height Barrier, Walls, Columns, or Other Structures (New Section 2023) (This section will refer to the group of “barriers, walls, columns, or other structures” collectively as a “structure”.) At times, project conditions may require placing barrier next to a structure with a different height (See Photos A & B). This difference in height could cause an errant vehicle to lean over the shorter barrier and strike the exposed edges of the taller structure (See Photo C). A height difference of 2-inches or less is allowable between a barrier placed adjacent to a structure. Provide mitigation for barriers placed adjacent to a structure with a height difference over 2-inches that are in the Design Clear Zone and addressing any exposed edges for:

Heights up to 6’-5” (77”) measured from the roadway surface and extending out for the given deflection distance behind the face of rail of beam guardrail (i.e., Type 31 Guardrail, Thrie Beam Guardrail, etc.) Heights up to 15’-1” (181”) measured from the roadway surface and extending out to 5’-3” (63”) behind the top front edge of high-performance concrete barrier (i.e., High Performance Single Slope Barrier (42” min. height), etc.). Contact HQ Bridge for locations requiring Test Level 5 barrier (Note: TL-5 barriers are specialty types of barrier not commonly used by WSDOT that may be used in front of bridge piers or other spot locations).
Possible mitigation strategies include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
•
Placing the shorter barrier run in front of the taller structure with the top front edge or face of rail of the shorter barrier meeting or exceeding the offset requirements from the taller structure as described above. Providing a height transition (e.g., height transition barrier, sloped wall segment, other) with a top slope of 6:1 or flatter connecting the barrier run to the dissimilar-height structure (See Photo D).

1610.03(4) Sight Distance When selecting and placing a barrier system, consider the possible impact the barrier type and height may have on sight distance. In some cases, barriers may restrict the sight distances of road users entering the roadway, such as from road approaches, intersections, and other locations. In these cases, the barrier may need to be adjusted to meet the sight distance requirements at these locations.

Traffic Barriers
1610.03(5) Barrier Deflections Expect all barriers, except for certain types of rigid barriers (such as concrete bridge rails, barrier integral to retaining walls, or embedded cast-in-place barriers), to deflect when hit by an errant vehicle. The amount of deflection is primarily dependent on the stiffness of the system. However, vehicle speed, angle of impact, and weight of the vehicle also affect the amount of barrier deflection. For roadside or wide median installations of flexible and semi-rigid roadside barriers (high tension cable barrier and beam guardrail), the deflection distance is designed to prevent the impacting vehicle from striking the object being shielded. For unrestrained rigid systems (unanchored precast concrete barrier), the deflection distance is designed to help prevent the barrier from being knocked over the side of a drop-off or steep fill slope (2H:1V or steeper). For narrower median installations, design systems so that the anticipated deflection will not enter the lane of opposing traffic. When evaluating new barrier installations, consider whether impacts would require significant traffic closures to accomplish maintenance. Rigid embedded barrier systems are used when no barrier deflection is necessary or desired (areas such as narrow medians, at the edge of bridge decks, or other vertical drop-off areas). Runs of rigid embedded concrete barrier can be precast, cast in place, or extruded with appropriate footings. In locations where deflection distance is limited, precast concrete barrier can be anchored. Some movement can be expected for rigid anchored barrier systems and repairs may be more expensive (anchoring pins may damage the asphalt or concrete surface that the barrier is placed upon during a vehicle collision). Use of an anchored precast concrete barrier and other deflecting barrier systems placed on top of a retaining wall at less than the deflection distances provided in Exhibit 1610-3 requires approval from the HQ Design Office. See Section 1610.06 for more information on concrete barrier. Exhibit 1610-3 provides barrier deflection design values when selecting standard runs of longitudinal barrier. This exhibit does not provide deflection values for specialty barrier systems or installations (for example long span guardrail systems (Std. Plan C-20.40), box culvert guardrail systems(Std. Plan C-20.41 or C-20.43), Type 31 guardrail installed on a flare, the ends of Type 31 guardrail runs when terminated with an anchor (Std. Plan C20.14 or C-20.18), etc.). Refer to related Standard Plans showing specialty barrier systems or installation placement cases for additional details about deflections and dimensions that are useful in design or contact HQ Design for specialty barrier systems or installations deflections. The deflection values for cable and beam guardrail are minimum distances measured between the face of the barrier to the fixed feature. The deflection values for concrete barrier are minimum distances measured from the back edge of the barrier to the fixed feature, drop-off, or slope break.

Notes: This exhibit provides deflection values for standard runs of barrier. It does not provide deflection values for specialty barrier systems or installations (e.g. long span guardrail systems(Std. Plan C-20.40), box culvert guardrail systems (Std. Plan C-20.41 or C-20.43), Type 31 barrier installed on a flare, the ends of Type 31 guardrail runs when terminated with an anchor (Std. Plan C-20.14 or C-20.18), etc.). Refer to related Standard Plans of specialty barrier systems or installation placement cases showing additional details about deflections and dimensions that are useful in design. [1] See Section 1610.05(2) [2] When used as temporary bridge rail, anchor all barrier when the back of barrier is located within 3 feet of a drop-off. [3] Place any new objects a minimum of 5 feet from the face of existing beam guardrail type 1. [4] Steel barrier is also available for temporary applications. See Chapter 1010 for more information. [5] When anchoring temporary precast concrete barrier on bridges or other drop-offs, see applicable Standard Plans for anchorage details, lateral offsets, and deflection distances. [6] When placed in front of a fill slope or on top of an MSE wall, provide a minimum distance of 2-feet of widening with a 10:1 or flatter slope from the back of barrier to the slope break point or inner face of wall. Contact HQ Bridge when placing embedded single slope barrier on an MSE wall to ensure proper wall/parapet design.

1610.03(6) Minimum/Maximum Barrier System Lengths At times, the barrier Length of Need (LON) formulas may calculate barrier run lengths that are quite short in order to shield an object or feature. Regardless of the calculated barrier Length of Need, barrier runs require a minimum installed length in order to retain their ability to contain and redirect an impacting vehicle. In addition, a maximum allowable run length is required for longer runs of high-tension cable barrier. Longer runs of high-tension cable barrier can be more difficult to maintain. Exhibit 1610-4 gives the required minimum and maximum lengths for standard runs of barriers currently used by WSDOT: Exhibit 1610-4 Barrier Standard Run Minimum/Maximum Lengths Barrier Type

Contact HQ Bridge for required minimum lengths of these types of barriers.
1610.03(7) Flare Rate A roadside barrier is considered flared when it is not parallel to the edge of the traveled way. Flare the ends of longitudinal barriers where site constraints allow (see Section 1610.01). The four functions of a flare are to:
•
•
•
•
Maximize the distance between the barrier (and its terminal) and the travelled way. Reduce the length of need. Redirect an errant vehicle. Minimize a driver’s reaction to the introduction of an object near the traveled way.
Keeping flare rates as flat as site constraints allow preserves the barrier’s redirectional performance and minimizes the angle of impact. It has also been shown that an object (or barrier) close to the traveled way might cause a driver to shift laterally, slow down, or both. The flare reduces this reaction by gradually introducing the barrier so the driver does not perceive the barrier as an object to be avoided. The flare rates in Exhibit 1610-5 are intended to satisfy the four functions listed above. Flares that are more gradual may be used. Flare rates are offset parallel to the edge of the traveled way. Transition sections are not flared.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Traffic Barriers
Situations exist where hardware installations may have barrier flare rates different than shown in Exhibit 1610-5. If a Standard Plan for a barrier installation shows a different flare rate than is shown in Exhibit 1610-5, use the flare rate shown on the Standard Plan (see Std. plan C-2c and C-4f for bullnose terminals, and Std. Plan C-22.16 for buried terminals). Exhibit 1610-5 Longitudinal Barrier Flare Rates Posted Speed (mph)

1610.03(8) Length of Need Length of need refers to the total length of longitudinal barrier needed to shield a fixed feature. See length of need calculation spreadsheet. In many cases, there may be a portion of the traffic barrier installation that is not redirective in capability. For instance:
•
•
if a run of concrete barrier is terminated with an impact attenuator, there will likely be a section of the impact attenuator that is not redirective (see Chapter 1620 for more information). If a run of guardrail is terminated with a non-flared terminal or anchor, there will likely be a section of the non-flared terminal or anchor that is not redirective (see Standard Plans C-22.40, C-22.45, or C23.70).
Therefore, in most cases, the Length of Need does not equal (i.e., it is shorter than) the actual physical length of the traffic barrier installation required to achieve that length of need. Length of need is dependent on the location and geometrics of the object, direction(s) of traffic, posted speed, motor vehicle traffic volume, and type and location of traffic barrier. When designing a barrier for a fill slope (see Chapter 1600), the length of need begins at the point where the need for barrier is recommended. For fixed objects and water, Exhibit 1610-6 shows design parameters for determining the needed length of a barrier for both adjacent and opposing traffic on relatively straight sections of highway. When barrier is to be installed on the outside of a horizontal curve, the length of need can be determined graphically as shown in Exhibit 1610-8. For installations on the inside of a curve, determine the length of need as though it were straight. Also, consider the flare rate, barrier deflection, and barrier end treatment to be used. When beam guardrail is placed in a median, consider the potential for impact from opposing traffic when conducting a length of need analysis. When guardrail is placed on either side of objects in the median, consider whether the trailing end of each run of guardrail will shield the leading end of the opposing guardrail.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1610-12
Chapter 1610
Traffic Barriers
Shield the leading end when it is within the Design Clear Zone of opposing traffic (see Exhibit 1610-9). This is also a consideration when objects are placed in the outer separations between the main line and collectordistributors. Before the actual length of need is determined, establish the lateral distance between the proposed barrier installation and the object shielded. Provide a distance that is greater than or equal to the anticipated deflection of the longitudinal barrier. (See Exhibit 1610-3 for barrier deflections.) Place the barrier as far from the edge of the traveled way as possible while maintaining the deflection distance. If the end of the length of need is within 300 feet of another barrier run (either existing or proposed), it is recommended that the barriers be connected to form a continuous run except where the gap involves a buried terminal and cut slope. In these cases and where practicable, extend barrier runs beyond the length of need to a backslope and provide a buried terminal (see Section 1610.06(3) for concrete barrier buried terminal, and Section 1610.04(5) and Standard Plan C-22.16 for beam guardrail buried terminal). Where access is needed behind a barrier (e.g., maintenance access, utility objects, road approaches, etc.) and an alternative approach to providing access is not practicable, provide a gap in the barrier that meets the access need using a configuration where the termination of the downstream run is situated behind the upstream run, or is otherwise outside the Design Clear Zone. Where this overlapping configuration is not practicable, provide a minimum size gap in the guardrail run to meet the access need and evaluate the need for barrier terminals on the upstream and downstream runs.

L1 = Length of barrier parallel to roadway from adjacent-side fixed feature to beginning of barrier flare. This is used if a portion of the barrier cannot be flared (such as a bridge rail and the transition). L2 = Distance from adjacent edge of traveled way to portion of barrier parallel to roadway. L4 = Length of barrier parallel to roadway from opposite-side fixed feature to beginning of barrier flare. L5 = Distance from centerline of roadway to portion of barrier parallel to roadway. Note: If the fixed feature is outside the Design Clear Zone when measured from the centerline, it may only be necessary to provide a crashtested terminal for the barrier (see Section 1610.04(7)(a) Beam Guardrail Placement Cases). LH1 = Distance from outside edge of traveled way to back side of adjacent-side fixed feature. Note: If a fixed feature extends past the Design Clear Zone, the Design Clear Zone can be used as LH1. LH2 = Distance from centerline of roadway to back side of opposite-side fixed feature. Note: If a fixed feature extends past the Design Clear Zone, the Design Clear Zone can be used as LH2. LR = Runout length, measured parallel to roadway. X1 = Length of need for barrier to shield an adjacent-side fixed feature. X2 = Length of need for barrier to shield an opposite-side fixed feature. F = Flare rate value. Y = Offset distance needed at the beginning of the length of need. Different end treatments need different offsets:

1610.04 Beam Guardrail Strong post W-beam guardrail and thrie beam guardrail are semi-rigid barriers used predominantly on roadsides. They have limited application as median barrier. A strong-post W-beam (commonly referred to as WBeam) guardrail system is the most common type of guardrail system used. The design uses wood or steel posts, rail, and blockouts to support the rail away from the post. The system resists a vehicle impact through a combination of the tensile and flexural stiffness of the rail and the bending or shearing resistance of the post. Installed incorrectly, strong post W-beam guardrail can cause vehicle snagging or spearing. This can be avoided by lapping the rail splices in the direction of traffic (as shown in the Standard Plans), by using crash-tested end treatments, and by blocking the rail away from the posts. Beam guardrail systems are shown in the Standard Plans.
1610.04(1) Beam Guardrail Systems 1610.04(1)(a) Type 31 Beam Guardrail Use Type 31 guardrail for new installations. The Type 31 system uses many of the same components as the old WSDOT Type 1 system. The main differences are that the blockouts extend 12 inches from the posts, the rail height is 31 inches from the ground to the top of the rail, the deflection requirements are 2 feet greater, and the rail elements are spliced between posts. Type 31 guardrail offers tolerance for future HMA overlays. The system allows a 3-inch tolerance from 31 inches to 28 inches without adjustment of the rail element. Type 31 guardrail is available double-sided, which can be used in medians.
1610.04(1)(b) (Old) Type 1 Beam Guardrail Previous WSDOT standard practice was to install W-beam guardrail at a rail height of 27 to 28 inches and is referred to as “Type 1” guardrail. WSDOT is phasing out the use of Type 1 guardrail. Do not use Type 1 guardrail for new installations, except when the Type 1 guardrail weak post system is the best choice at an intersection due to site constraints (see Section 1610.04(7)(a)). Place new objects a minimum of 5 feet behind the face of existing beam guardrail type 1. For more information on (Old) Beam Guardrail Type 1, see: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/roadside-safety. Existing runs of Type 1 guardrail are acceptable to leave in place. If an existing run of Type 1 guardrail requires extending, use the Beam Guardrail Type 31 to Beam Guardrail Type 1 Adaptor shown in the Standard Plans, and complete the guardrail extension using Type 31 guardrail.
1610.04(1)(c) Other Guardrail Types W-beam guardrail Type 2 and Type 3 have a height of 30 inches and utilize a rubrail. A rubrail is a structural steel channel added below the W-beam rail and is used in these specific designs to reduce vehicle snagging on the post. Existing runs of Type 2 or Type 3 guardrail are acceptable to leave in place. If the existing run of Type 2 or 3 requires extending contact WSDOT Design Office to identify appropriate extension methods. Type 4 guardrail is a double-sided version of the Type 1 guardrail system. For new installation, use the Type 31 double-sided w-beam guardrail instead of Type 4 guardrail. Existing runs of Type 4 guardrail are acceptable to leave in place. If the existing run of Type 4 requires extending contact WSDOT Design Office to identify appropriate extension methods to transition to the Type 31 double-sided system.

Traffic Barriers
Type 10 and Type 11 are thrie-beam guardrail systems. Existing runs of Type 10 or 11 guardrail are acceptable to leave in place. If an existing run of Type 10 or Type 11 guardrail requires extending, contact the WSDOT Design Office to discuss options. Weak post W-beam guardrail (Type 20) and thrie beam guardrail (Type 21) are flexible barrier systems primarily used in conjunction with a Service Level 1 bridge rail system for bridges with timber decks. These systems use weak steel posts. For information on Type 20 and Type 21 guardrail see: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineeringstandards/design-topics/roadside-safety
1610.04(2) Beam Guardrail Placement There are a number of considerations regarding guardrail placement. These include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

During the project development processes, consult with maintenance staff to help identify guardrail runs that may need to be modified. When existing Type 1 guardrail is replaced by Type 31 guardrail along existing shoulders with a width greater than 4 feet (5 feet for bicycles), the shoulder width may be reduced by 4 inches to accommodate the 12-inch blockout. A Design Analysis is not required for the reduced shoulder width. If the remaining shoulder width is 4 feet or less, see Chapter 1030 for barrier delineation guidance. Keep the slope of the area between the edge of the shoulder and the face of the guardrail 10H:1V or flatter. Type 31 or Type 1 beam guardrail can be placed anywhere outside of the shoulder on fill slopes 10:1 or flatter. Type 1 beam guardrail can be placed on fill slopes between 6H:1V and 10H:1V at the slope break point of the shoulder or at least 12 feet from the slope breakpoint. This placement case does not apply to Type 31 beam guardrail. Do not place Type 31 or Type 1 beam guardrail with standard length posts on a fill slope steeper than 6H:1V. See Exhibit 1610-10 for allowable placement exceptions on fill slopes steeper than 6H:1V using long post beam guardrail. On the high side of superelevated sections, place beam guardrail at the edge of shoulder prior to the slope breakpoint. For W-beam guardrail installed at or near the shoulder, 2 feet of widening behind the barrier is generally provided from the back of the post to the slope breakpoint of a fill slope (see Exhibit 1610-10, Case 2). If the slope is 2H:1V or flatter, this distance can be 2.5 feet measured from the face of the guardrail rather than the back of the post (see Exhibit 1610-10, Case 1). On projects where no roadway widening is proposed and site constraints prevent providing the 2-foot shoulder widening behind the barrier, long post installations are available as shown in Exhibit 1610-10, Cases 3, 4, 5, and 6. When installing guardrail where the roadway is to be widened or along new alignments, the use of Cases 5 and 6 requires a Design Analysis.

Use Cases 1 and 3 when 2.5-foot or greater shoulder widening exists or will be constructed from face of guardrail to the slope breakpoint. The use of Case 3 is not allowed on slopes steeper than 1H:1V. Use Case 2 when 4.0-foot or greater shoulder widening exists or will be constructed from face of the guardrail to the slope breakpoint. Use Cases 4, 5, and 6 when less than a 2.5-foot shoulder widening exists or will be constructed from face of guardrail to the slope breakpoint (see Section 1610.04(2)). The use of Case 4 is not allowed on slopes flatter than 2H:1V. The use of Case 6 is not allowed on slopes steeper than 1H:1V. Cases shown do not apply to terminals, transition sections, or anchors. Install terminals, transition sections, and anchors per applicable Design Manual requirements and Standard Plans. Cases shown only apply to standard guardrail run installations that are placed parallel to the roadway. Apply Case 2 when installing guardrail on a flare (see Section 1610.03(7)) or on a radius (see Section 1610.04(7)(a)). See Exhibit 1239-4 for shoulder widening/grading details associated with guardrail. See Exhibit 730-12 for beam guardrail placement in front of retaining walls.

1610.04(3) W-Beam Barrier Height See Chapter 1120 when evaluating guardrail system height on Preservation (P1, P2, P3) projects. For other projects requiring evaluation of guardrail (see Section 1105.02(1)), evaluate the guardrail system height as follows:
•
•
For existing Type 1 guardrail with heights falling outside the range from 26.5 inches to 31 inches, adjust or replace the rail to a minimum height of 28 inches up to a maximum height of 30 inches, or replace the run with 31-inch-high Type 31 beam guardrail. For existing Type 31 guardrail runs with heights falling outside the range of 28 to 32 inches, adjust or replace the rail to a height of 31 inches, or replace the run with a new run of 31-inch-high Type 31 beam guardrail.
For Type 1 and Type 31 standard run W-beam guardrail, the blockout and rail element may be raised up to 4 inches by field drilling a new hole in the guardrail post. Verify that the condition of the posts and blockouts are suitable for raising in this manner. If not, the post or block will need to be replaced. See the Standard Plans. If Type 1 Alternative W-beam guardrail is present, the blockout and rail element may be raised after each overlay by using the pre-drilled holes in the guardrail posts. See Section 1610.04(5) for information on adjusting the height of guardrail terminals.
1610.04(4) Additional Guidance Additional guidance related to w-beam guardrail:
•
•
•
Crossroad and driveway locations cause gaps in the guardrail creating situations requiring special consideration. The preferred solutions are either to eliminate the need for the barrier or realign the crossroad or driveway to accommodate the necessary guardrail run length. Alternatively, an intersection design guardrail system can be installed at the intersection. See Section 1610.04(7)(a) for more information. At these locations, a barrier flare might be needed to provide sight distance. Snowload post and rail washers are not used in new guardrail installations or guardrail terminal installations. Snowload post and rail washers installed on existing guardrail installations may remain in place except when the rail element is removed from post for any reason. If this occurs, remove and discard the snowload post and rail washers before reassembling the guardrail components. The use of curb in conjunction with beam guardrail is a special application. When a curb is needed place the curb as follows: o For Type 1 W-beam guardrail, a 3-inch-high curb is preferred, and the front face of the curb is placed flush with the face of rail or placed behind the face of the rail. The 3-inch-high curb can be used at any posted speed. If necessary, a 4-inch-high extruded curb with the front face of the curb placed flush with the face of rail or placed behind the face of the rail can be used at any posted speed. Finally, a 6-inch-high extruded curb with the front face of the curb placed flush with the face of rail or placed behind the face of the rail can be used where the posted speed is 50 mph or below. When replacing extruded curb at locations where the posted speed is above 50 mph, use 3-inch-high or 4-inch-high curb. (See Standard Plan F-10.42 for extruded curb designs and Standard Plan F-10.40 for extruded curb placement under guardrail.) o For Type 31 W-beam guardrail, a 3-inch, 4-inch, or 6-inch curb can be placed at any posted speed with the front face of the curb placed flush with the face of rail or placed behind the face of the rail. Use the shortest height curb feasible. An acceptable option is to install a 3-

inch, 4-inch, or 6-inch-high extruded curb with the front face of the curb placed at a maximum 6-inch offset in front of the rail face at any posted speed. It is acceptable to place Type 31 W-beam guardrail behind curb and sidewalk when utilizing a proper offset behind the curb and sidewalk. Type 31 W-beam guardrail shall be placed 4- to 12-feet behind the front face of a 3-inch, 4-inch, or 6-inch curb and sidewalk for posted speeds of 45 mph or below. Use the shortest height curb possible. Do not place Type 31 guardrail behind curb and sidewalk in locations with posted speeds greater than 45 mph. Guardrail posts should be able to rotate when the rail is impacted. When installing strong post W-beam guardrail posts in a rigid surface such as asphalt or concrete pavement, use leave-outs. Leave-outs are areas around the post that has no rigid material, which allows the post to rotate. Contact the WSDOT Design Office for more information. For (Old) Guardrail Types 1, 2, 3, and 4, it is acceptable to use blockouts that extend the rail element from the post for a distance not to exceed 16 inches. Where it is not feasible to install a post on a Type 31 system (i.e. utility or drainage conflict), one post may be omitted every 56.25 feet (9th post), except that an omitted post must be a minimum of 75 feet from an anchorage post, a minimum of 35 feet from the beginning of a thrie beam transition, and a minimum of 35 feet from the point where a terminal system joins the standard run. o Do not omit posts in guardrail runs with posts placed less than 2 feet from the slope break point. Guardrail runs with omitted posts must have at least 2 feet of 10:1 or flatter embankment behind them as shown in DM Exhibit 1610-11 Case 2. o Do not omit posts where curb is in front of the guardrail. o Consult HQ Design for acceptable conditions to omit single posts in guardrail runs with 12’ – 6”, 18’ – 9”, or 25’ – 0” span systems (see Std. Plan C‐20.40) placed within the run. o List all the locations of omitted posts in the project plans to ensure that posts are omitted following the conditions described in this section. In locations where shallow fill depth prevents the installation of standard-length guardrail posts (i.e., box culverts, drainage), guardrail can be spanned over the location or be attached to the top of the structure (see standard plans). When a barrier design requires the guardrail posts to be attached to the top of a structure, either: (1) Notify the structure designer from HQ Bridge about the guardrail post attachment requirement, or (2) Follow the design requirements for a structure with attached guardrail posts provided in Chapter 8 of the Bridge Design Manual. Other shallow fill designs are available. Contact HQ Design for more information about these alternative designs.
1610.04(5) Terminals and Anchors A guardrail anchor is required at the end of a run of guardrail to develop tensile strength throughout its length. In addition, when the end of the guardrail is within the Design Clear Zone and subject to head-on impacts, a crash-tested guardrail terminal is required (see the Standard Plans). See Chapter 1120 for guidance regarding the evaluation of terminals on Preservation projects (P1, P2, and P3). For projects that require the evaluation of terminals (see Section 1105.02(1)), evaluate the terminals as follows:
•
Replace guardrail terminals that do not have a crash-tested design with MASH compliant crash-tested guardrail terminals. Common features of systems that do not meet current crash-tested designs include: o No cable anchor. o A cable anchored into concrete in front of the first post. o Second post not breakaway (CRT).

o
•
Design A end section (see Beam Guardrail End Sections plan sheet in the Traffic Barrier (TB) section of the Plan Sheet Library). o Design C end sections may be left in place if the terminal is otherwise a crash-tested design —see the Standard Plan C-7 for end section details. o Buried guardrail terminals that slope down such that the guardrail height is reduced to less than 28 inches (measured in relation to a 10H:1V line extended from the breakpoint at edge of shoulder). When the height of a terminal or anchor, as measured from the ground to the top of the rail element, will be affected by the project, adjust the terminal or anchor based upon the following criteria: o If the height of the terminal or anchor adjoining Types 1, 2, 3, or 4 guardrail will be reduced by the project to be less than 26.5 inches or increased to greater than 30 inches, adjust the height of the terminal to a minimum of 28 inches and a maximum of 30 inches. A terminal height of 30 inches is desirable to accommodate future overlays. o If the height of the terminal or anchor adjoining Type 31 guardrail will be reduced by the project to be less than 28 inches or increased to greater than 32 inches, adjust the height to 31 inches. o When adjusting terminals that are equipped with CRT posts, the top-drilled holes in the posts need to remain at the surface of the ground. o When adjusting the height of a terminal or anchor, adjust it by raising the posts of the terminal or anchor and tamping the ground around the posts to prevent settlement of the raised posts. Note: do not raise the blockouts or rail of the terminal or anchor by drilling new holes in the terminal posts.
One terminal that was used extensively on Washington’s highways was the Breakaway Cable Terminal (BCT). This system used a parabolic flare similar to the Slotted Rail Terminal (SRT) and a Type 1 anchor (Type 1 anchor posts are wood set in a steel tube or a concrete foundation). For guidance regarding BCT’s and other terminals on Preservation projects see Chapter 1120. For non-Preservation projects, replace BCTs with a currently approved terminal using the following guidance:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Verify length of need, and adjust the terminal location as required. Replace adjacent transition sections that are not compliant with Section 1610.04(6). Transition from Type 1 to Type 31 using the adaptor (Standard Plan C‐25.80) where required. Raise or replace the entire run if engineering judgement indicates that it is prudent for that situation. Use the grading criteria shown on the terminal standard plans (C‐22.40 or C‐22.45). When using existing grading, check to see that it complies with the grading criteria shown on the current terminal standard plans. Remove curbs from in front of terminals if hydraulically acceptable.

Chapter 1610
Traffic Barriers
1610.04(5)(a) Buried Terminal for Type 31 Beam Guardrail A Buried Terminal (BT) is designed to terminate the guardrail by burying the end in a backslope. The BT is the preferred terminal because it eliminates the exposed end of the guardrail. For new BT installations, use the Buried Terminal Type 2. Previously, another BT option (the Buried Terminal Type 1) was an available choice. For existing installations, it is acceptable to leave this option in service as long as height requirements and other design criteria is met. See Beam Guardrail Type 1 – Buried Terminal Type 2 plan sheet in the Traffic Barrier (TB) section of the WSDOT Plan Sheet Library. The BT uses a Type 2 anchor to develop the tensile strength in the guardrail. The backslope needed to install a BT is to be 3H:1V or steeper and at least 4 feet in height above the roadway. The entire BT can be used within the length of need for backslopes of 1H:1V or steeper if the barrier remains at full height in relation to the roadway shoulder to the point where the barrier enters the backslope. For backslopes between 1H:1V and 3H:1V, design the length of need beginning at the point where the W-beam remains at full height in relation to the roadway shoulder—usually beginning at the point where the barrier crosses the ditch line. If the backslope is flatter than 1H:1V, provide a minimum 20-foot-wide by 75-foot-long clear area that is free of fixed features behind the barrier and between the beginning length of need point at the terminal end to the mitigated object to be protected. Flare the guardrail to the foreslope/backslope intersection using a flare rate that meets the criteria in Section 1610.03(7). Provide a 4H:1V or flatter foreslope into the face of the guardrail and maintain the full guardrail height to the foreslope/backslope intersection in relation to a 10H:1V line extending from edge of shoulder breakpoint. (See the Standard Plans for details.)
1610.04(5)(b) Non-flared Terminals for Type 31 Beam Guardrail Install a non-flared terminal when a buried terminal cannot be installed as described in Section 1610.04(5)(a). WSDOT does not use flared terminals on Type 31 guardrail systems. Non-flared terminals typically use w-beam guardrail, proprietary hardware, and an impact head mounted at the leading end. These systems also include an anchor to provide tensile strength for the guardrail. Non-flared terminals absorb energy during head-on impacts by processing the rail through the impact head in varying ways depending on the manufacturer’s own proprietary approach. Although these terminal systems are called non-flared, all manufacturers allow for an offset to move the impact head away from traffic. For non-flared terminal installations, the following apply:
•
•
•
Select non-flared terminals based on the posted speed as follows: o Non-flared terminals restricted to locations 45 mph or below (TL-2, Standard Plan C-22.45); o or non-flared terminals that can be installed at any posted speed (TL-3, Standard Plan C22.40). Where practicable, provide an offset of up to one-foot over the length of the non-flared terminal (TL-2, Standard Plan C-22.45) or up to two feet over the length of the non-flared terminal (TL-3, Standard Plan C-22.40) in reference to the roadway alignment. Non-flared terminal offsets can be provided to increase the clearance between the impact head and traffic to reduce the potential of incidental hits. It is acceptable to install non-flared terminals following the alignment of flared standard runs of guardrail with flare rates of 25:1 or flatter in reference to the roadway alignment. For standard runs of guardrail with flare rates steeper than 25:1, the non-flared terminal cannot follow the standard run flared alignment and can only be offset up to 1-foot (TL-2, Standard Plan C-22.45) or 2-feet (TL-3, Standard Plan C-22.40) in reference to the roadway alignment.

Include or confirm that embankment widening is provided as part of the non-flared terminal design and installation (see Standard Plan C-22.40 or C-22.45). Where practicable, install non-flared terminals on tangent sections of roadway. It is acceptable to extend the length of a guardrail run beyond its required Length of Need distance so that a non-flared terminal can be installed outside the limits of a horizontal curve. For non-flared terminals whose manufacturer allows installation on horizontal curves: o It is acceptable to install non-flared terminals with up to a full offset on horizontal curves with radii of 750-feet or greater (radius as measured along the shoulder). o Contact HQ Design when installing non-flared terminals on horizontal curves with radii between 500-feet and 750-feet (radius as measured along the shoulder). o Do not install non-flared terminals on horizontal curves with radii steeper than 500-feet (radius as measured along the shoulder). Do not install snowload rail or post washers within the limits of the non-flared terminals. Do not install non-flared terminals behind or coincident with curbs. Do not place curbs in advance of non-flared terminals within the limits of widened embankment (see Standard Plans C-22.40 or C-22.45 for widened embankment dimensions). Refer to Standard Plans C-22.40 or C-22.45 for additional details about non-flared terminal layout and dimensions that are useful in design including: o Terminal lengths and pay limits o Embankment widening dimensions o Location of the Length of Need point on the terminal as it varies by manufacturer
The roadside safety website provides information on availability or acceptance of different terminal systems including approved shop drawings. (See https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/roadsidesafety)
1610.04(5)(c) Terminal Evolution Considerations Some currently approved terminals have been in service for a number of years. During this time, there have been minor design changes. However, these minor changes have not changed the devices’ approval status. Previous designs for these terminals may remain in place. Note: If questions arise concerning the current approval status of a device, contact the HQ Design Office for clarification when replacement is being considered.
1610.04(5)(d) Anchors A guardrail anchor is needed at the end of a run of guardrail to develop tensile strength throughout its length.
•
•
Use the Type 11 anchor to develop the tensile strength of the guardrail on the end of Type 31 guardrail runs where a crash-tested terminal is not needed. A Type 2 anchor is used with the buried terminal.
For information on anchor types used in runs of (Old) Beam Guardrail Type 1, see: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/roadside-safety.

1610.04(6) Transitions and Connections When there is an abrupt change from one barrier type to a more rigid barrier type, a vehicle hitting the more flexible barrier may be caught in the deflected barrier pocket and directed into the more rigid barrier. This is commonly referred to as “pocketing.” A transition stiffens the more flexible barrier by decreasing the post spacing, increasing the post size, and using stiffer beam elements to reduce the possibility of pocketing. When connecting beam guardrail to a more rigid barrier or a structure use the transitions and connections that are shown in Exhibit 1610-11 and Exhibit 1610-12 and detailed in the Standard Plans. Verify the length of need (see Section 1610.03(8)) when designing transitions, particularly transitions between beam guardrail or end terminals to bridge structures. Type 21 transitions can be used on highways with all posted speeds to connect w-beam guardrail to single slope, safety shape or vertical concrete barriers. Type 22 and Type 23 transitions are used to connect w-beam guardrail to thrie beam on bridges. Type 24 transitions can be used on highways with a posted speed of 45 mph or less to connect w-beam guardrail to single slope, safety shape or vertical concrete barriers. When connecting a Type 21 or Type 24 Transition to an existing vertical faced bridge rail with a low parapet, a special connection plate may be required. Coordinate with the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office (BSO). The transition pay item includes the connection. Install transitions on 10:1 or flatter slopes with the 10:1 or flatter slope extending a minimum of 2 feet behind the guardrail transition post similar to what is shown in DM Exhibit 1610-10 Placement Case 2.

1610.04(7) Guardrail Placement Cases The Standard Plans and Plan Sheet Library contain placement cases that show beam guardrail elements needed for typical situations. For new installations, use the appropriate Type 31 placement option (except as noted below). Information regarding placement cases for (Old) Type 1 beam guardrail can be found at https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/roadside-safety.
1610.04(7)(a) Beam Guardrail Placement Cases
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Case 1-31 is used where there is one-way traffic. It uses a crash-tested terminal on the approach end and a Type 11 anchor on the trailing end. Case 2-31 is used where there is two-way traffic. A crash-tested terminal is used on both ends. Case 3-31 is used at railroad signal supports on one-way or two-way roadways. A terminal is used on the approach end, but usually cannot be used on the trailing end because of its proximity to the railroad tracks. If there is a history of crossover collisions, consider additional protection such as an impact attenuator. Case 4-31 is used where guardrail on the approach to a bridge is to be shifted laterally to connect with the bridge rail. A terminal is used on the approach end and a transition is needed at the bridge end. Curves (bends) are shown in the guardrail to shift it to the bridge rail. However, the length of the curves are not critical. The criterion is to provide smooth curves that are not more abrupt than the allowable flare rate (see Exhibit 1610-5). Case 5-31 is a typical bridge approach where a terminal and a transition are needed. Case 10 (A-31, B-31, and C-31) is used at roadside fixed features (such as bridge piers) when 5 or more feet are available from the face of the guardrail to the feature. The approach end is the same for oneway or two-way traffic. Case 10A-31 is used with two-way traffic; therefore, a terminal is needed on the trailing end. Case 10B-31 is used for one-way traffic when there is no need to extend guardrail past the fixed feature and a Type 11 anchor is used to end the guardrail. Case 10C-31 is used for one-way traffic when the guardrail will extend for a distance past the fixed object. The Beam Guardrail Type 31 Placement 12'-6", 18'-9", or 25'-0” Span design is used when it is necessary to omit one, two, or three posts. This application is typically used when guardrail is installed over a shallow buried obstruction, such as drainage structures. This design may be used in other situations where there are no above ground objects located behind the guardrail and within the lateral deflection distance. Three CRT posts are provided on each end of the omitted post(s). Type 31 guardrail (including terminals and anchors) must extend at least 62.5 feet (10 posts) upstream and downstream from the ends of the outer CRT posts (furthest from obstruction) in order for the guardrail system to function as designed during a vehicle crash. Also, this guardrail design has specific grading requirements, see applicable standard plan. Note: This guardrail design may require fall protection. See Section Chapter 1060 for worker fall protection requirements. See Section 1510.15(3) for pedestrian fall protection requirements. When a fall protection system is located within the deflection zone of the barrier system, contact HQ Design for options.

Traffic Barriers
Guardrail Placement at intersections – Two solutions are currently available for use where bridge ends or similar conditions exist in close proximity to a roadway intersection or driveway. These designs are used at crossroads or road approaches where a barrier is needed and where the length of need cannot be achieved using standard components such as standard longitudinal barrier runs, transitions, and terminals. The “Strong Post Intersection Design” uses Type 31 guardrail and is available for use in new installations. A “Weak Post Intersection Design,” which uses Type 1 guardrail, is available and may also be used in new installations (see Section 1610.04(1)(b)).
1610.05 High-Tension Cable Barrier Cable barrier is a flexible barrier system that can be used on a roadside or as a median barrier. Early cable barrier designs centered around low-tension cable systems. With research and crash analysis of these systems, the designs evolved into high-tension cable systems. These high-tension cable systems are primarily used in medians and are preferred for many installations due in part to high benefit-to-cost ratios. There are a number of manufacturers of high-tension cable barrier systems. These systems have been designed using either three or four-cables fixed to metal posts placed at a fixed spacing. Each cable system has specially designed anchors placed at both ends of the barrier run to provide the proper tensioning in the cables. Currently, both three and four-cable high-tension cable barrier systems are installed along WSDOT state routes. Use four-cable high-tension cable barrier systems for all new installations.
1610.05(1) High-Tension Cable Barrier Placement High-tension cable barrier can be placed in a median or along the roadside. Note: For non-typical installations, such as double runs of cable barrier or median ditch cross sections that differ significantly from those shown, contact the HQ Design Office for guidance.

Install the cable barrier as far from the edge of traveled way as site constraints allow. Consider a minimum placement distance of 8 feet from the edge of traveled way to allow vehicles to use this area for refuge. Install cable barrier on slopes 6H:1V or flatter. There are approved high-tension cable barrier systems that can be placed on slopes as steep as 4H:1V. The use of these systems requires special placement considerations, contact the HQ Design Office for guidance. Provide an obstruction free zone within the cable barrier system’s lateral deflection distance (see Section 1610.05(2)). On tangent sections of a roadway where no ditch is present, consider installing the cable barrier in the middle of the median. See Exhibit 1610-13. Along horizontal curves, consider installing the cable barrier along the inside of the curve. Reduce the post spacing per manufacturer’s recommendations. In medians with ditches, install the cable barrier as follows (See Exhibit 1610-13): o The preferred location is to install the cable barrier at an 8-foot or greater offset from the ditch centerline. o Alternatively, the cable barrier can be installed at the centerline of the ditch out to a 1-foot offset either side of the ditch centerline. While permissible, this is not the preferred area to install cable barrier due to the potential of post scour, possible interference with drainage structures, and maintenance concerns. o Do not install cable barrier in the area between 1-foot to 8-foot offset from the ditch centerline to avoid “under-riding” of vehicles crossing the ditch. In some situations, it may be advantageous to terminate a run of cable barrier on one side of the median (to provide maintenance access to a feature, for example) and then begin an adjacent cable barrier run on the opposite side of the median. In this application, it is important to provide adequate cable barrier overlap distance between the two runs. For placement guidance, see Exhibit 1610-15. Narrow medians provide little space for maintenance crews to repair or reposition the barrier. Wherever site conditions permit, provide at least 14 feet of clearance from the adjacent lane edge to the face of the cable barrier.

1610.05(1)(b) Roadside Applications For typical non-median roadside applications, the following apply:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Install the cable barrier as far from the edge of traveled way as site constraints allow. Consider a minimum placement distance of 8 feet from the edge of traveled way to allow vehicles to use this area for refuge. Install cable barrier on slopes 6H:1V or flatter. There are approved high-tension cable barrier systems that can be placed on slopes as steep as 4H:1V. The use of these systems requires special placement considerations, contact the HQ Design Office for guidance. Along horizontal curves, consider installing along the inside of the curve. Reduce post spacing per manufacturer’s recommendations. Provide an obstruction free zone within the cable barrier system’s lateral deflection distance, see Section 1610.05(2).
Exhibit 1610-14 Roadside Cable Barrier Placement
Notes: 1
Provide an obstruction free zone within the cable barrier’s lateral deflection distance, see Section 1610.05(2).
1610.05(2) High-Tension Cable Barrier Lateral Deflection Distances Depending on the high-tension cable barrier system, lateral deflection distances for each barrier system vary based upon the length of the barrier run, the spacing of the end anchors, and post spacing. Provide an obstruction free zone within the system’s lateral deflection distance for the following situations: 1. In the direction of travel (located in the median or along roadside), locate the cable barrier system so that there are no fixed objects within the limits of the cable barrier lateral deflection distance. 2. For opposing traffic (where present), locate the cable barrier to provide lateral deflection distance to prevent a vehicle’s encroachment into the opposite lane of travel. 3. Low–tension cable barrier systems require 12 feet of lateral deflection. Use high-tension cable barrier systems in new cable barrier installations. 4. High-tension barrier systems have lateral deflection distances between 6 to 10 feet. Specify the maximum allowable lateral deflection distance in the contract documents in order for the contractor to select a cable barrier manufacturer that meets the lateral deflection requirements.

Chapter 1610
Traffic Barriers
Note: There are new high-tension cable barrier systems under development that may change selection and placement criteria. For example, newer systems may allow placement on steeper slopes or have reduced deflection distances. Contact the HQ Design Office for guidance.
1610.05(3) High-Tension Cable Barrier Termination Manufacturers of high-tension four-cable barrier systems provide designed anchors for the ends of cable barrier runs. Whenever practicable, locate high-tension cable barrier terminals in areas where they are least likely to be hit by errant vehicles (e.g., located outside clear zone, located behind another barrier system). Often, high-tension cable barrier systems will overlap/interface with a stiffer barrier system (typically beam guardrail but can be concrete barrier). When terminating a cable barrier run to begin a beam guardrail run, there are essentially four choices for the overlap/interface of the two barrier systems (contact HQ Design when terminating a cable barrier run to begin a concrete barrier run). The four choices are: Connect Cable Barrier to Beam Guardrail: This placement connects the cable barrier directly onto the beam guardrail runs (such as cable barrier connected to beam guardrail transitions coming off bridge rails) or to a different cable barrier anchorage system. When connecting cable barrier onto beam guardrail, the guardrail must continue at least 75 feet downstream from the point where the cable barrier attaches to the beam guardrail, or the beam guardrail needs to be connected to a stiffer system (i.e., bridge rail, concrete barrier) to reduce the chance of beam guardrail posts pulling out of the ground from the tension in the cable barrier system. When terminating cable barrier in this manner; review field conditions, check local maintenance personnel needs, and specify the required connection option in the contract documents. When cable barrier is connected directly to a more rigid barrier, a transition section is typically needed. Contact the HQ Design Office for further details. Install Cable Barrier Behind Beam Guardrail: This placement terminates the cable barrier behind the beam guardrail system. Ensure the lateral distance between the two barrier systems exceeds the deflection distance of the beam guardrail system placed in front of the cable barrier system. This will reduce the chances of having the two barrier systems interfering with each other during a vehicle impact, or having an errant vehicle rebound off the cable barrier into the back of the beam guardrail during a vehicle impact. Exhibit 1610-16 shows an example of terminating cable barrier behind a beam guardrail system. Install Cable Barrier in Front of Beam Guardrail: This placement terminates the cable barrier in front of the beam guardrail system. Ensure that the standard run of cable barrier extends to, or past, the Length of Need post of the beam guardrail terminal and provide a minimum lateral distance of 4-feet between the two barrier systems. This will reduce the chances of having the two barrier systems interfere with each other during a vehicle impact. Exhibit 1610-16 shows an example of terminating cable barrier in front of a beam guardrail system.

Traffic Barriers
Terminate Cable Barrier in Advance of Beam Guardrail: This placement terminates the cable barrier in advance of the beam guardrail system. This placement leaves a gap in guardrail coverage and can be a maintenance concern if both terminals are hit by an errant vehicle. However, this placement can be used when side slope grades become an issue (i.e., slope is too steep to place cable barrier or beam guardrail, slope widening requires large amounts of fill to accommodate barrier systems). Exhibit 1610-16 shows an example of terminating cable barrier in advance of a beam guardrail system. Exhibit 1610-15 Cable Barrier Placement: Overlap on Divided Highways

1610.05(4) High-Tension Cable Barrier Curb Placement Avoid the placement of curb in conjunction with high-tension cable barrier systems. Currently, there are no known acceptable cable barrier systems that have been successfully crash tested with this feature present.
1610.06 Concrete Barrier Concrete barriers are identified as either rigid, rigid anchored, or unrestrained rigid systems. They are commonly used in medians and as shoulder barriers. These systems are stiffer than beam guardrail or cable barrier and impacts with these barriers tend to be more severe. Consider the following when installing concrete barriers:
•
•
•
•
For slopes 10H:1V or flatter, concrete barrier can be used anywhere outside of the shoulder. Do not use concrete barrier at locations where the foreslope into the face of the barrier is steeper than 10H:1V. Light standards mounted on top of precast concrete median barrier must not have breakaway features. (See the concrete barrier light standard section in the Standard Plans.) When considering concrete barrier use in areas where drainage and environmental issues (such as stormwater, wildlife, or endangered species) might be adversely impacted, contact the HQ Hydraulics Office and/or the appropriate environmental offices for guidance. Also, refer to Section 1610.02.
1610.06(1) Concrete Barrier Shapes Concrete barriers use a single-slope or safety shape (New Jersey or F-Shape) to redirect vehicles while minimizing vehicle vaulting, rolling, and snagging. A comparison of these barrier shapes is shown in Exhibit 1610-17. The single-slope barrier face is the recommended option for embedded rigid concrete barrier applications. Exhibit 1610-17 Concrete Barrier Shapes
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1610-35
Chapter 1610
Traffic Barriers
The New Jersey shape and F-shape barriers are commonly referred to as “safety shapes.” The New Jersey shape and F-shape have an initial overall height of 32 inches. As part of the implementation of MASH-compliant hardware, WSDOT has transitioned from using New Jersey shape barrier (Type 2 barrier) for precast concrete barrier to using F-shape concrete barrier (Type F barrier) instead. F-Shape (Type F) barrier is used in permanent or temporary installations. New Jersey shape (Type 2) barrier is only allowed to be used in temporary installations. Existing runs of Type 2 barrier permanently installed are allowed to remain in place (see Section 1610.03(2) for more information). Use Type F when replacing existing concrete barrier. If an existing run of Type 2 barrier requires extending, use Standard Plan C-60.30 Concrete Barrier Transition Type F to (32”) Type 2 (Precast), and complete the barrier extension using Type F barrier. When removing and resetting Type 2 barrier, contact HQ Design for more details.
1610.06(1)(a) Safety Shape Barrier Concrete Barrier Type F (see the Standard Plans) is a freestanding precast barrier that has the F-shape on both sides. The F-Shape barrier is used in permanent or temporary installations. It can be used for both median and shoulder installations. Unanchored units are connected with steel pins through metal loops. For permanent unanchored Type F barrier installations, this barrier is placed on a 10:1 or flatter paved surface with 3-feet minimum of 10:1 or flatter paved surface provided beyond the back of the barrier for deflection. For temporary unanchored Type F barrier installations, this barrier is placed on a 10:1 or flatter paved or compacted unpaved surface with a minimum of 3-feet of the 10:1 or flatter respective surface provided beyond the barrier for deflection. Do not anchor Type F barrier on a compacted unpaved surface. See Exhibit 1610-3 for deflection requirements. Concrete Barrier Type 2 (see the Standard Plans) is a freestanding precast barrier that has the New Jersey shape on both sides. The Type 2 barrier is only used in temporary installations. It can be used for both median and shoulder installations. Unanchored units are connected with steel pins through wire rope loops. For temporary unanchored Type 2 barrier installations, this barrier can be placed on a 10:1 or flatter paved surface or compacted unpaved surface with a minimum of 3-feet of the 10:1 or flatter respective surface provided beyond the barrier for deflection. Do not anchor Type 2 barrier on a compacted unpaved surface. See Exhibit 1610-3 for deflection requirements. The cost of precast safety shape barrier is significantly less than the cost of the cast-in-place barriers. Therefore, consider the length of the barrier run and the deflection needs to determine whether transitioning to precast barrier is desirable. If precast safety shape barrier is used for the majority of a project, use the single slope barrier for small sections that need cast-in-place barrier (such as for a light standard section). See standard plans for precast concrete barrier transitions between different shapes of concrete barrier. Type F narrow base is a precast, single-faced F-Shape barrier. These units are not freestanding and are to be placed against a rigid structure (or anchored to the pavement in temporary installations). If Type F narrow base barriers are used back-to-back, fill any gap between them to prevent tipping. Type F barrier can be anchored where a more rigid barrier is needed. The barrier can be anchored in permanent or temporary installations on asphalt pavement, concrete pavement, or bridge decks (Anchoring methods and the required distances of 10:1 or flatter pavement beyond the back of barrier are shown in the Standard Plans). Consult with the WSDOT BSO when anchoring permanent precast concrete barrier to a rigid (Portland cement concrete) pavement or bridge deck.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1610-36
Chapter 1610
Traffic Barriers
Type 2 barrier can be anchored where a more rigid barrier is needed. The barrier can be anchored in temporary installations using Type 1 and Type 2 anchors for rigid concrete pavement, and Type 3 anchors for asphalt pavement (Anchoring methods and the required distances of 10:1 or flatter pavement beyond the back of barrier are shown in the Standard Plans). Consult with the WSDOT BSO when anchoring precast concrete barrier to a bridge deck. Precast barrier used on the approach to bridge rail is to be connected to the bridge rail by installing loops or a loop bar embedded into the bridge rail with epoxy resin and as detailed in the Standard Plans. Place unrestrained (unanchored) precast concrete barrier on slopes of 5% (20H:1V) or flatter where possible. The maximum slope for placement of concrete barrier is 10% (10H:1V).
1610.06(1)(b) Single-Slope Barrier Single-slope barrier is available in various heights as shown in the Standard Plans. Single-slope concrete barrier can be cast-in-place or precast. Single-slope barrier is considered a rigid system regardless of the construction method used provided that:
•
•
•
•
precast barrier is embedded a minimum of 3-inches in the roadway wearing surface (asphalt or concrete) on both sides; precast barrier is embedded a minimum of 10-inches in compacted base material (e.g., CSBC, select borrow, gravel borrow, native soil, etc.) on both sides; precast barrier is embedded a minimum of 10-inches when embedded in roadway wearing surface (asphalt or concrete) on one side and compacted base material (e.g., CSBC, select borrow, gravel borrow, native soil, etc.) on the other side; and, cast-in-place barrier is embedded a minimum of 3-inches in the roadway wearing surface (asphalt or concrete) or compacted base material (e.g., CSBC, select borrow, gravel borrow, native soil, etc.) on both sides.
For new installations in asphalt, concrete, or compacted base material; the minimum height of the single-slope barrier above the roadway is 2 feet 10 inches which allows a 2-inch tolerance for future overlays. The minimum total height of the barrier section is 3-feet-6 inches (including embedment). The single-slope barrier can be installed with grade separation between roadways as follows:
•
•
•
For cast-in-place barrier with a minimum 3-inch embedment, or pre-cast barrier installed in asphalt or concrete with a minimum 3-inch embedment; a grade separation of up to 4-inches is allowed when using a 3-foot-6-inch tall barrier section, a grade separation of up to 7-inches is allowed when using a 4foot tall barrier section, and a grade separation of up to 10-inches is allowed when using a 4-foot-6-inch tall barrier section as shown in the Standard Plans. For pre-cast barrier installed in compacted base material with a minimum 10-inch embedment; a grade separation of up to 4-inches is allowed when using a 4-foot-tall barrier section, and a grade separation of up to 10-inches is allowed when using a 4-foot-6 inch tall barrier section as shown in the Standard Plans. The barrier is to have a depth of embedment equal to or greater than the grade separation as shown in the Standard Plans. Contact the WSDOT BSO for grade separations greater than 10-inches.

Traffic Barriers
1610.06(1)(c) High-Performance Concrete Barrier High-Performance Concrete Barrier (HP Barrier) is a rigid barrier with a minimum height of 3-foot-6-inch above the roadway surface. This barrier is designed to function more effectively during heavy-vehicle crashes. This taller barrier may also offer the added benefits of reducing headlight glare and reducing noise in surrounding environments. WSDOT HP Barrier utilizes the single-slope shape. (See the Standard Plans for barrier details.) Use HP Barrier in freeway medians of 22 feet or less. Also, use HP Barrier on Interstate or freeway routes where crash history suggests a need or where roadway geometrics increase the possibility of larger trucks hitting the barrier at a high angle (for example, on-ramps for freeway-to-freeway connections with sharp curvature in the alignment). Consider the use of HP Barrier at other locations such as highways with narrow medians, near highly sensitive environmental areas, near densely populated areas, over or near mass transit facilities, or on vertically divided highways.
1610.06(1)(d) Low-Profile Barrier Low-profile barrier designs are available for median applications where the posted speed is 45 mph or below. These barriers are normally used in urban areas. They are typically 18 to 20 inches high and offer sight distance benefits. For barrier designs, terminals, and further details, contact the HQ Design Office.
1610.06(1)(e) Concrete Barrier Transitions At times, runs of concrete barrier will require a shape and/or stiffness transition to another type of concrete barrier/bridge rail. The following list provides a brief description of the most common types of concrete barrier transitions: Bridge Transitions: When single-slope or F-Shape faced bridge barrier is used on bridges or structures and precast barrier is selected for use on the approaches to the bridge or structure; a transition section is needed to provide gradual stiffening from the less rigid precast barrier system to the more rigid bridge rail/bridge barrier system. In addition, a transition is needed to ensure that no vertical edges of barrier are exposed to oncoming traffic due to the difference in shapes and height between the two different barrier systems. Note: See Standard Plans for concrete barrier bridge transitions. See the Bridge Design Manual for details on bridge rails/bridge barrier. Roadside and Median Shape Transitions: Use a transition section when it is necessary to change the shape of the barrier within a single run (i.e., Type F to Single Slope, Type 2 to Type F) of barrier. Transition designs will differ when used on roadside/wide median applications (barrier subject to vehicle impacts on one side only), or narrow median applications (barrier subject to vehicle impacts on both sides). Note: See Standard Plans for concrete barrier transitions between different shapes of concrete barrier. Stiffness Transitions: Use an anchoring transition section when changing the stiffness of the barrier system within a single run of barrier but not the barrier shape (i.e., Type F anchored to Type F unanchored). This type of transition requires a change in anchoring pin configuration when moving from an unanchored barrier system to an anchored barrier system. There is no other change to the barrier other than the anchoring pin configuration. Note: See Standard Plans for barrier stiffness transitions. For aesthetic reasons, avoid changes in the shape of the barrier face within a project or corridor whenever possible.

Traffic Barriers
1610.06(2) Concrete Barrier Height Pavement overlays are allowed to be placed in front of concrete barriers per the following allowable minimum height guidance for each type of barrier:
•
•
•
Allow no less than 32-inches from the new pavement surface to the top of standard height (not high performance) single-slope barrier. Allow no less than 36-inches from the new pavement surface to the top of high performance singleslope barrier. Overlays are not allowed in front of safety shape barriers. Safety shape barriers must be adjusted to maintain their 32-inch height, or they must be replaced when an overlay is being placed in locations with these types of barrier.
Note: When placing overlays in front of single slope concrete barriers, ensure that the overlay does not cause the barrier grade separation height to exceed the depth of barrier embedment (see Section 1610.06(1)(b) and Standard Plan C-70.10 or C-80.10 for more information).
1610.06(3) Concrete Barrier Terminals Whenever possible, bury the blunt end of a concrete barrier run into the backslope of the roadway. If the end of a concrete barrier run cannot be buried in a backslope or terminated as described below, terminate the barrier using a guardrail terminal and transition or an impact attenuator (see Chapter 1620). To bury the blunt end of the barrier into a backslope, the following conditions must be met:
•
•
•
•
The backslope is 3H:1V or steeper The backslope extends minimum of 4 feet in height above the edge of shoulder Flare the concrete barrier into the backslope using a flare rate that meets the criteria in Section 1610.03(7) Provide a 10H:1V or flatter foreslope into the face of the barrier and maintain the full barrier height until the barrier intersects with the backslope. This might create the need to fill ditches and install culverts in front of the barrier face.
The 7-foot-long Type F barrier terminal (precast) and the 10- to 12-foot single-slope barrier terminal (precast or cast-in-place) may be used in the following conditions:
•
•
•
•
Outside the Design Clear Zone. On the trailing end of the barrier when it is outside the Design Clear Zone for opposing traffic. On the trailing end of one-way traffic. Where the posted speed is 25 mph or below.
See the Standard Plans for barrier terminal details.
1610.06(4) Concrete Barrier Placement in Front of Bridge Piers Existing barrier in front of bridge piers may remain in place in preservation (P1, P2, P3) projects. For all other projects, contact the HQ Bridge traffic barrier specialist when an existing or proposed bridge pier is in the Design Clear Zone, regardless of whether a barrier currently exists.

Traffic Barriers
1610.07 Bridge Traffic Barriers Bridge traffic barriers redirect errant vehicles and help to keep them from going over the side of the structure. See the Bridge Design Manual for information regarding bridge barrier on new bridges and replacement bridge barrier on existing bridges. When considering work on a bridge traffic barrier consult the WSDOT Bridge and Structures Office (BSO). The standard bridge traffic barrier is a 3 foot 6 inch single slope or F Shape traffic barrier. For corridor continuity, a 2 foot 10 inch single slope or 2 foot 8 inch F Shape traffic barrier may be used with a pedestrian railing attached to the top for a total height of 3 foot 6 inch height inches. This also meets requirements for worker fall protection. Approach barriers, transitions, and connections are usually needed on all four corners of bridges carrying twoway traffic and on both corners of the approach end for one-way traffic. See Section 1610.04(6) for guidance on beam guardrail transitions. See standard plans for concrete barrier bridge transitions. Bridge railing attaches to the top of the bridge barrier. When bridge barrier is included in a project, the bridge rails, including crossroad bridge rail, are to be addressed. Consult the WSDOT BSO regarding bridge rail selection and for design of the connection to an existing bridge.
Consider the following:
•
•
•
•
Use an approved, NCHRP 350 or MASH crash-tested bridge traffic barrier on new bridges or bridges to be widened. The Bridge Design Manual provides examples of typical bridge rails. The BSO’s minimum crash test level for all state and interstate bridges is a TL-4. An existing bridge rail on a roadway with a posted speed of 30 mph or below may remain in place if it is not located on a bridge over a National Highway System (NHS) highway. When Type 7 bridge rail is present on a bridge over an NHS highway with a posted speed of 30 mph or below, it may remain in place regardless of the type of metal rail installed. Other bridge rails are to be evaluated for strength and geometrics. (See Section 1610.07(1) for guidance on retrofit techniques.) The Type 7 bridge rail is common. Type 7 bridge rails have a curb, a vertical-face parapet, and an aluminum top rail. The curb width and the type of aluminum top rail are factors in determining the adequacy of the Type 7 bridge rail, as shown in Exhibit 1610-18. Consult the WSDOT BSO for assistance in evaluating other bridge rails. When considering an overlay on a bridge, consult the WSDOT BSO to verify the overlay depth can be placed on the bridge deck based on the type of traffic barrier. There may be instances where the height of the bridge barrier will not allow for the planned overlay depth without removal of existing pavement.

1610.07(1) Bridge Barrier Retrofit If the bridge barrier system does not meet the criteria for strength and geometrics, modifications to improve its redirectional characteristics and its strength may be needed. Consult the WSDOT BSO to determine which retrofit method described below can be completed.
1610.07(1)(a) Concrete Safety Shape Consult the WSDOT BSO to determine whether the existing bridge deck and other superstructure elements are of sufficient strength to accommodate this bridge barrier system and provide design details for the retrofit. Retrofitting with a new concrete bridge barrier is costly and requires authorization from Program Management when no widening is proposed.
1610.07(1)(b) Thrie Beam Retrofit Retrofitting the bridge barrier with thrie beam is an economical way to improve the strength and redirectional performance of a bridge barrier. The thrie beam can be mounted to steel posts or the existing bridge barrier, depending on the structural adequacy of the bridge deck, the existing bridge barrier type, the width of curb (if any), and the curb-to-curb roadway width carried across the structure. Exhibit 1610-19 shows typical retrofit criteria. Note that Bridges designated as historical landmarks may not be candidates for thrie beam retrofitting. Contact the Environmental Services Office regarding bridge historical landmark status.

1610.08 Other Barriers 1610.08(1) Redirectional Landform Redirectional landforms, also referred to as earth berms, were formerly installed to help mitigate crashes with fixed objects located in depressed medians and at roadsides. They were constructed of materials that provided support for a traversing vehicle. With slopes in the range of 2H:1V to 3H:1V, they were intended to redirect errant vehicles. The use of redirectional landforms has been discontinued. Where redirectional landforms currently exist as mitigation for a fixed object, provide alternative means of mitigating the fixed object, such as removing, relocating, changing the fixed object to a crash-tested breakaway system, or shielding with barrier.
1610.08(2) Aesthetic Barrier Treatment An aesthetic barrier may be desired on a project, or it may be required by a memorandum of understanding, a Scenic Byway designation, an easement or corridor management plan, or as a result of stakeholder engagement. Contact the region or HQ Landscape Architect Office to confirm this requirement, and to verify any specific conditions with respect to the barrier’s appearance in the applicable plan or corridor document. Reactive coloring agents and powder coating are approved treatment options for w-beam guardrail and may be applicable to other barrier types. Check with the manufacturer and/or the product documentation when specifying aesthetic treatment for proprietary devices, such as guardrail terminals. One alternative to the use of aesthetic treatments are barriers designed to be aesthetic, such as steel-backed timber guardrail and stone guard walls. These alternative barriers will likely necessitate a partnering effort because of their higher costs, although grants may be available for this purpose if the need is identified early in the project definition phase.
1610.08(3) Steel-Backed Timber Guardrail Steel-backed timber guardrails consist of a timber rail with a steel plate attached to the back to increase its tensile strength. There are several variations of this system that have passed crash tests. The nonproprietary systems use a beam with a rectangular cross section that is supported by either wood or steel posts. A proprietary (patented) system, called the Ironwood Guardrail, is also available. This system uses a beam with a round cross section and is supported by steel posts with a wood covering to give the appearance of an all-wood system from the roadway. The incorporation of the Ironwood Guardrail will need to be documented. Consult with the Assistant State Design Engineer to determine what justification (proprietary or a public interest finding) will be required. The most desirable method of terminating the steel-backed timber guardrail is to bury the end in a backslope, as described in Section 1610.04(5). When this type of terminal is not possible, use of the barrier is limited to highways with a posted speed of 45 mph or below. On these lower-speed highways, the barriers can be flared away from the traveled way as described in Section 1610.03(7) and terminated in a berm outside the Design Clear Zone. For details on these systems, contact the HQ Design Office.

Traffic Barriers
1610.08(4) Stone Guardwalls Stone guardwalls function like rigid concrete barriers but have the appearance of natural stone. These walls can be constructed of stone masonry over a reinforced concrete core wall or of simulated stone concrete. These types of barriers are designed to have a limited textured projection of the stones to help aid in the redirectional characteristics of the barrier. The most desirable method of terminating this barrier is to bury the end in a backslope, as described in Section 1610.06(3). When this type of terminal is not possible, use of the barrier is limited to highways with a posted speed of 45 mph or below. On these lower-speed highways, the barrier can be flared away from the traveled way and terminated in a berm outside the Design Clear Zone. For details on these systems, contact the HQ Design Office.
1610.08(5) Dragnet The Dragnet Vehicle Arresting Barrier consists of chain link or fiber net that is attached to energy absorbing units. When a vehicle hits the system, the Dragnet brings the vehicle to a controlled stop with limited damage. Possible uses for this device include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Reversible lane entrances and exits Railroad crossings Truck escape ramps (instead of arrester beds—see Chapter 1270) T-intersections Work zones Swing span bridges

Impact Attenuator Systems Exhibit 1620-1 Impact Attenuator Distance Beyond Length of Need
1620.01 General Impact attenuator systems are protective systems that help aid an errant vehicle from impacting an object by either gradually decelerating the vehicle to a stop when hit head-on or by redirecting it away from the feature when struck on the side. These systems are used for rigid objects or other features that cannot be removed, relocated, or made breakaway. Install impact attenuator systems that have been determined to be MASH compliant and accepted for use by WSDOT (see Section 1610.01 for more information on MASH product acceptance and implementation). In general, existing impact attenuators that are fully functional may remain in service and be repaired as needed; however, when roadside safety hardware is included in the project per Chapter 1105, replace any impact attenuators falling under the existing roadside safety hardware replacement criteria shown in Section 1610.03(2).
1620.02 Design Criteria The following design criteria apply to new, existing, or reset permanent and temporary impact attenuators. Impact attenuators are placed so that they do not present a feature that requires mitigating in relation to opposing traffic. For median and reversible lane locations, the backup structure or attenuator-to-object connection is designed to help in aiding opposing traffic from being snagged. Avoid placement of curbs between attenuators and traffic. Refer to the specific attenuator manufacturer’s instructions if considering placement of curbing between an attenuator and the travelled way. It is desirable that existing curbing be removed, and the surface smoothed with asphalt or cement concrete pavement before an impact attenuator is installed. However, mountable curbs 4 inches or less in height may be retained depending on the feasibility of removal and as long as the manufacturer’s installation requirements are met. In general, attenuators are aligned parallel to the roadway. Consult with the Area Maintenance Superintendent who will be maintaining the system prior to selecting the attenuator systems to include in a construction contract.
1620.03 Selection Considerations WSDOT classifies impact attenuators as permanent (for final installations that will remain in place) or temporary (for systems that will be in place during work zone traffic control operations and then removed). Some impact attenuator systems can be used in both a temporary capacity and then in a final/permanent installation. For approved systems to choose from, see the WSDOT Impact Attenuator Design page at www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/design/ProductFolder/PENDING_Impact_Attenuator_Design.docx Consider that each application is unique when selecting impact attenuators for use in particular applications. This applies to both permanent and temporary installations.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Impact Attenuator Systems
To select an appropriate impact attenuator system, the following factors must be assessed:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Posted speed Operating speed Average daily traffic (ADT) Repair crew exposure Proximity to the roadway Anticipated number of yearly impacts Available space (length and width) Lifecycle Maintenance costs Initial cost Duration (permanent or temporary use) Portion of the impact attenuator that is redirective/gating (see Exhibit 1620-1) Width of object to be shielded
Entries on the WSDOT Impact Attenuator Design page indicate whether the system is National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 350 or MASH-compliant. If it’s determined that a MASH-compliant system is not available for the specific configuration required, document the selection of an NCHRP 350 system as described in Section 1620.03(2). When selecting the appropriate impact attenuator system, consider the portion that is designed to redirect vehicles during a side impact of the unit, such that fixed objects, either permanent or temporary (such as construction equipment), are not located behind the gating portion of these devices (see Exhibit 1620-1). Exhibit 1620-1 Impact Attenuator Distance Beyond Length of Need

Chapter 1620
Impact Attenuator Systems
Select the system and configuration appropriate for the posted speed. In the interest of a cost-effective design, selecting a system applicable for the posted speed is recommended (although using a system tested for a higher speed is acceptable). Note that attenuators used on highways with posted speeds of 70 mph have additional considerations discussed below. Where there is evidence that the average operating speed of the facility is higher than the posted speed, consider selecting an attenuator system rated at the facility’s operating speed. Manufacturer’s product information may indicate that a different system is required for speeds of 70 mph or greater. These models are generally referred to as “high speed” or “70 mph” systems. Use of these systems on facilities with 70 mph posted speeds is not required, and selection of a system rated for at least 60 mph will typically be appropriate for most sites on these facilities. For permanent installations where unusual conditions warrant consideration of a high-speed device, these systems are available and may be used with justification. Contact the HQ Design Office for guidance when considering one of these systems. For information regarding spatial requirements and initial cost information related to impact attenuator systems, see the Attenuator Selection Template. When considering maintenance costs, anticipate the average annual impact rate. If few impacts are anticipated, lower-cost devices might meet the need. (See Chapter 301 for examples of how to determine lifecycle costs for proposed hardware). Attenuators with the lowest initial cost and initial site preparation will have high maintenance costs after each impact. Labor and equipment are needed to clean up the debris and install a new attenuator, as the lowest cost attenuators are typically destroyed after a single impact. Attenuators with higher initial installation cost typically have lower maintenance costs. In selecting a system, one consideration is the anticipated exposure to traffic that the workers making the repairs may encounter. In areas with high traffic exposure, a low-maintenance system that can be repaired quickly is most desirable. Some systems need nearly total replacement or replacement of critical components (such as cartridges or braking mechanisms) after a head-on impact, while others simply need to be reset. When a transition to connect with a concrete barrier, fixed object, or beam guardrail is needed, the transition type and connection may need to be specified (see the impact attenuator descriptions accessible through the Attenuator Selection Template). In most cases, the transition type and connection required will be a custom design per the manufacturer (these transitions are included in the cost of the impact attenuator). In a few cases, the transition type and connection to use will be as described in Chapter 1610 and the Standard Plans (these transition sections are not included in the cost of the impact attenuator and must be included as a separate bid item in the construction contract). Consult with the Area Maintenance Superintendent who will be maintaining the systems before finalizing the list of attenuators to be included in the contract.
1620.03(1) Low-Maintenance Category Low maintenance devices have a higher initial cost, requiring substantial site preparation, including a backup or anchor wall in some cases, and cable anchorage at the front of the installation. However, repair costs are very low, with labor typically being the main expense. Maintenance might not be needed after minor side impacts with these systems. Installation of a low-maintenance device is desirable at locations that meet at least one of the following criteria:
•
•
•
Sites with an ADT of 25,000 or greater Sites with a history/anticipation of more than one impact per year Sites with unusually challenging conditions, such as limitations on repair time, a likelihood of frequent night repairs, or narrow gore locations
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1620-3
Chapter 1620
Impact Attenuator Systems
Document the decision in the DDP to use any device other than a low-maintenance device at locations meeting at least one of the criteria above. The HQ Design Office conducts a periodic review of maintenance records to consider which devices should be included in the Low-Maintenance category. For a description of requirements that need to be met in order to be included in the Low-Maintenance category, see: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/design/roadsidesafety/low_maint.pdf
1620.03(2) Documenting Attenuator Selection As the factors discussed previously are analyzed, identify inappropriate systems and eliminate them from further consideration. List the systems that are not eliminated in the contract. When the site conditions vary, it might be necessary to have more than one list of acceptable systems within a contract. Acceptable systems cannot be eliminated without documented justification as to why they should not be used. Also, wording such as “or equivalent” is not to be used when specifying these systems. If it’s determined that a MASH-compliant attenuator system is not available for a specific configuration and that an NCHRP 350-compliant attenuator system must be used, then document the design decision using a Design Analysis unless otherwise directed by the ASDE. Document attenuator selection using the Attenuator Selection Template.
1620.04 Transportable Attenuators (Truck-Mounted and Trailer-Mounted) Truck Mounted Attenuators and Trailer-Mounted Attenuators are portable systems mounted on trucks or trailers. They are intended for use in work zones and for temporary applications.
1620.05 Older Systems Many older systems are in use on Washington State highways and may be left in place or reset with concurrence of the WSDOT Area Maintenance Superintendent who maintains the system. New installations of these systems are not allowed. For a list of older systems see: www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/fulltext/design/ProductFolder/PENDING_Impact_Attenuator_Design.docx.
1620.06 Inertial Barrier Systems (Sand Barrels) Inertial barrel systems (sand barrels) commonly provide advantages in temporary installations where the locations change and there is sufficient space available or in permanent locations where there is a lower risk of collisions and where the debris, from the initial barrier when hit, will have a minimal impact to traffic. Refer to the manufacturer for system dimensions and specifications.

1710.01 General The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has developed a statewide system of traveler stopping opportunities along Interstate highways and state routes. This system includes safety rest areas (see Exhibit 1710-1), roadside parks, and viewpoints. These services provide universal access for rest, traveler information, and restroom facilities. Benefits include improved safety by reducing driver fatigue and the number of vehicles parked on the shoulders of state routes, refuge from adverse driving conditions, and increased tourism promotion. Safety rest areas are planned and designed by a multidisciplinary team lead through the Facilities Administrator in the Capital Facilities Office, a branch of Maintenance Operations. (See Section 1710.04 for an expanded discussion on team roles and membership.) Exhibit 1710-1 WSDOT Safety Rest Area

1710.03 Definitions Ancillary Services: Those secondary services, also considered amenities, provided at safety rest areas that include, but are not limited to, vending machines, picnic areas, interpretive signing, telephones, recreational vehicle (RV) sanitary disposal facilities, trails, scenic viewpoints, commercial and public information displays, and visitor information centers. Recreational Vehicle Account: In 1980 the RV account was established for use by the department of transportation for the construction, maintenance, and operation of recreational vehicle sanitary disposal systems at safety rest areas (RCW 46.68.170). A recreational vehicle sanitary disposal fee is required for registration of a recreational vehicle (RCW 46.17.375). Adjustments to the recreational vehicle fee by the department of transportation may be implemented after consultation with the citizens’ representatives of the recreational vehicle user community (RCW 47.01.460). Roadside Park: A roadside user facility for safe vehicular parking off the traveled way and separated from the highway by some form of buffer. These sites might be equipped with features or elements such as points of interest, picnic tables, and/or vault toilet buildings. Unlike a safety rest area, a roadside park does not always provide a permanent restroom building. Safety Rest Area (SRA): A roadside facility equipped with permanent restroom building(s), a parking area, picnic tables, refuse receptacles, illumination, and other ancillary services. SRAs typically include potable water and might include traveler information and telephones. Safety Rest Area Strategic Plan: Developed in 2008 under a stakeholder-coordinated effort of executive and advisory team members, this plan provides guidance for current and future management of the SRA program. Traveler Information: Commercial and noncommercial information that informs and orients the traveling public. This includes access information for food, gas, lodging, local attractions, regional tourist attractions, roadway conditions, and construction schedules. Universal Access: Access for all persons regardless of ability or stature. Viewpoint: A roadside stopping opportunity with a view of some point of interest or area scenery. This area is not typically separated from the traveled way by some form of highway buffer. Visitor Information Center (VIC): A staffed or nonstaffed booth or separate building that displays and dispenses free tourist travel maps and brochures. These are typically located at border-entry SRAs to provide travel information to highway users as they enter the state.
1710.04 Safety Rest Area Project Team The Capital Facilities Office has primary responsibility for program oversight and communication and is the primary point of contact for questions concerning SRAs. Duties include planning and programming for capital WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22

Preservation and Improvement projects, maintenance operations oversight and policy development, and project delivery. Exhibit 1710-2 and Exhibit 1710-3 outline the many disciplines involved with SRA planning, design, construction, and maintenance. The exhibits outline roles during the different phases of SRA management. Services are provided by internal WSDOT staff, other government agencies, and private consultants.
1710.05 Location, Access, and Site Design 1710.05(1) Conformance with the Safety Rest Area Strategic Plan Regional planners, in coordination with the Capital Facilities Office, will use the Safety Rest Area Strategic Plan as a guide to determine which areas in the state are potential areas of need for a new facility. Verify current locations of SRAs, roadside parks, viewpoints, and undeveloped SRA properties that could be utilized for development of a new SRA. Coordinate all SRA planning and design efforts with the SRA Program located in the Capital Facilities Office.
1710.05(2) Highway Spacing Guidelines It is preferred to space SRAs and roadside parks approximately every 60 miles on the National Highway System and Scenic Byways. Consider the location of other available public facilities when deciding where to locate an SRA. Other public or private facilities may offer stopping opportunities that could mitigate the need for construction of a new SRA. Reference the SRA Strategic Plan for potential areas of need for new stopping opportunities.

Note: Recreational Vehicle Citizens Advisory Committee: The department utilizes a volunteer citizen-based group of recreational vehicle users to help define the RV needs at SRAs. This group provides guidance on the expenditure of funds from the RV account and fee adjustments. The fee adjustments must be preceded by an evaluation per RCW 47.01.460.
1710.05(3) Adjacent Land Use Consult local planning offices for information about zoning and expected development in the area of a proposed site to ensure compatibility with a new safety rest area or roadside park. Acquire a buffer area or scenic easement on adjacent lands, if possible, to protect scenic views and existing vegetation. Incorporate any cultural, historical, or scenic points of interest into the site design to enhance visitor experience and area education. For Interstate safety rest areas, vehicular ingress and egress will be from the main line only.
1710.05(4) Availability of Utilities Determine the proximity and availability of water, power, and sewer systems prior to site acquisition. Prepare required legal documents such as well agreements, easements, water rights, and acquisition documents. The Capital Facilities Office uses annual traffic data in the area to estimate the number of rest area users and determine the adequacy of potable water supply, power capacity, parking space needs, and sewage disposal system options. New construction should meet the 20-year projected growth rate based on potential traffic increases.

1710.05(5) Level of Development Roadside facilities have different levels of development and require varying site size and amenity levels. Exhibit 1710-4 shows recommended site sizing and amenities for SRAs, roadside parks, and viewpoints.
1710.05(6) Site Conditions SRAs need large parcels of land to provide adequate space for parking passenger vehicles and trucks, on-site sewage treatment, and on-site water systems if provided. Any selected site should consider the terrain to allow for safe ingress and egress from the highway. Other considerations are:
•
•
•
•
•
Grades and slopes to accommodate parking, sewage treatment, and the building site. High water level, particularly if the site is in a floodplain. Soil conditions and soil type for structural designs and the on-site sewage treatment system. Vegetation and natural features to understand potential mitigation costs from impacts to existing wetlands or stormwater drainage, etc. Prevailing wind direction and typical wind velocities that can affect building siting/design and visitor experience.
1710.05(7) Site Security Design the facility to maximize line of sight for rest area users. Design vegetation for visibility to avoid hiding places on-site. If electrical power is available on-site, provide lighting around all parking areas, buildings, and other site amenities that are made available to the public.
1710.05(8) Site Sustainability During site development, adhere to the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards where practicable. Strive for energy efficiency, water conservation, and low operational costs in building designs. Ensure landscaping features will be durable and easy to maintain. Contact the Capital Facilities Office for minimum requirements and standard details.
1710.05(9) Stormwater Management For stormwater management, particularly in areas covered by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, make an effort to minimize the use of storm drainage devices such as catch basins, oilwater separators, and retention vaults. Design the site to accommodate sheet flow off paved surfaces to vegetative areas for on-site infiltration and management of stormwater where practicable. (See the Highway Runoff Manual for stormwater design information.)
1710.05(10) Traffic Ingress and Egress Design connections to the main line highway in accordance with Design Manual chapters in Division 13. Consult with the HQ Access and Hearings Section for establishing new or modifying existing highway access points.

1710.05(11) ADAAG Compliance You must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) for all site components that are made available to the public. Provide at least one accessible route of travel, defined in ADAAG, from the parking area to each on-site amenity or ancillary service.
1710.05(12) Parking Area Design Consider the parking area layout when generating a site master plan. Include stages of construction if applicable. Provide separate parking areas for trucks/RVs/buses and passenger cars. For new designs, locate large-vehicle parking on the far side of the site away from the highway for improved highway visibility and site security purposes. Provide shade for vehicles where practicable. Exhibit 1710-5 shows an example of a truck parking area layout. AASHTO’s Guide for Development of Rest Areas on Major Arterials and Freeways provides parking area design considerations. Consider areas for snow storage needs. Refer to the Hydraulics Manual for drainage design. Preserve existing landscape features to the greatest extent possible. Design vehicular and pedestrian routes to be safe, simple, direct, and obvious. Meet local building codes and ADAAG requirements for public parking.
1710.05(13) Recreational Vehicle Sanitary Disposal Facilities Construct RV sanitary disposal facilities (dump stations) only at sites served by municipal sewage disposal systems, or at sites served by sewage lagoons with adequate capacity. On-site septic systems with drainfields are not an option for RV dump stations because of sewage volume, technical/maintenance requirements, and costs. Contact the Capital Facilities Office for details on RV dump station design and operation.
1710.05(14) Walkways Design walkways for direct pedestrian movement to all facilities and comply with ADAAG requirements. Provide sidewalk width a minimum of 48 inches, which exceeds ADAAG requirements.
1710.05(15) Vegetation Vegetation enhances the physical environment by providing shade, shelter from wind, visual screening, wildlife habitat, and other benefits. Landscape Architects engaged in the project employ designs that emphasize lowmaintenance practices and obstacle-free lawns, and minimize water usage for irrigation and impacts to existing native vegetation where practicable.
1710.05(16) Picnic Tables Provide one picnic table for every ten passenger car parking stalls, with a minimum of four tables per SRA where practicable. Provide shelters for 50% of the picnic tables on-site. Provide windscreens for picnic tables exposed to frequent high winds. Each SRA is required to provide a minimum of one picnic table that complies with ADAAG requirements. Place picnic tables near walkways but also provide privacy from restroom users.

1710.05(19) Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations are provided at select sites. One ADAAG-compliant parking stall with an accessible route is required when EV charging stations are installed. Because EV charging is not the primary purpose of SRAs, locate the EV parking stalls at the ends of the passenger vehicle parking area.
1710.05(20) Bicycle Facilities Provide bicycle racks where this type of active transportation mode is accessible to an SRA. (See Chapter 1520 for more information about roadway bicycle facilities.)
1710.06 Buildings 1710.06(1) Codes Comply with current versions of the International Building Code, International Plumbing Code, National Electric Code, Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines, and all applicable state and local code requirements.
1710.06(2) Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines You must comply with accessibility guidelines specified in ADAAG for all building components that are available to the public. Design restrooms, ancillary service buildings, picnic benches, and information kiosks to ADAAG standards.
1710.06(3) Restroom Capacity Provide a male/female restroom stall ratio of 40:60, and one unisex restroom that can be opened to allow for daily cleaning operations where practicable. If the unisex restroom is the only ADAAG-compliant toilet stall onsite, it must remain open at all times. Contact the Capital Facilities Office for restroom standards and to verify the number of stalls that should be provided at each site.
1710.06(4) Building Security Design rest area buildings to provide a safe, comfortable experience for the traveling public. Avoid building designs with potential hiding places, and ensure adequate building lighting is provided around the perimeter.
1710.06(5) Building Sustainability Buildings and systems are to adhere to the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards where practicable.

1710.06(11) Rehabilitation and Expansion Minor renovation projects to address specific building and system deficiencies such as roofs, interior fixtures and partitions, wall and floor surfaces, HVAC, electrical, water, and sewer will extend the usefulness of the building and minimize maintenance and operations costs. When major renovations are needed, consider restroom capacity increases to meet current standards based on expected user volumes. Other facility components that will eventually need rehabilitation are kiosks, irrigation systems, sidewalks, picnic tables, parking areas, and RV dump stations. All projects must meet current ADAAG building and site requirements. Consider efficiency improvements that can be made to reduce operational costs. Coordinate with the Capital Facilities Office for all renovation or expansion projects.
1710.07 Utilities Contact the region Utilities Office for acquisition of Utility Service Agreements for any utility needs. Coordinate with the Capital Facilities Office for long-term planning considerations. Telephones are provided at most SRAs and must meet ADAAG requirements. Because of the availability of cellular phones, and due to vandalism and other reasons, public telephone service may be cancelled after coordination between the Capital Facilities Office and region Maintenance.
1710.07(1) Power Capacity A new or upgraded electrical service provided on-site will meet the projected needs of the facility over the next 20 years where practicable. Provide three-phase service where available. Consider building capacity increases, site lighting improvements, electric vehicle charging stations, truck parking electrification, and other potential needs. Contact the Capital Facilities Office for site-specific details or master plans.
1710.07(2) Water & Sewer Systems Refer to the Hydraulics Manual for information on water and sewage disposal systems, including reservoirs, long-distance pressure sewers, septic tanks, drainfields, and sewage lagoons. Install separate water meters to quantify irrigation, building, RV dump stations, and source water where practicable. Consider maintenance needs for water and sewer system designs. Coordinate with the Capital Facilities Office for all issues related to water and sewer systems at SRAs.
1710.07(3) Stormwater Systems Stormwater management and treatment systems are to meet the guidelines and requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). Ensure runoff from impervious surfaces at SRAs is managed onsite using typical best management practices. Contact the Hydraulics Office for specific design recommendations, and the Maintenance Operations Office for specific site requirements noted in the statewide NPDES permit.
1710.07(4) Future Utilities Provide sleeves and conduits for future utilities in accordance with the site master plan for water, sewer, power, and telephone. Address site-specific agreements by coordinating with region Maintenance, utility companies, the Capital Facilities Office, and others during site design.

1720.01 General Truck weighing facilities are needed to protect state highways from overweight vehicles, to provide for vehicle safety inspection, and to provide a source of data for planning and research. The development, construction, and maintenance of these facilities is a cooperative effort between the WSDOT and the Washington State Patrol (WSP).
1720.02
Definitions
Note: For definitions of roadway, traveled way, lane, median, outer separation, shoulder, decision sight distance, sight distance, and stopping sight distance, see the Glossary of Terms. Commercial Vehicle Information Systems and Networks (CVISN) A network that links intelligent transportation systems (ITS) to share information on commercial vehicles. When in operation at a weigh site, it can enable commercial vehicles to clear the facility without stopping. Frontage road: An auxiliary road that is a local road or street located beside a highway for service to abutting property and adjacent areas and for control of access. Static scale: A scale that requires a vehicle to stop for weighing. Usable shoulder: The width of the shoulder that can be used by a vehicle for stopping. Weigh in motion (WIM): A scale facility capable of weighing a vehicle without the vehicle stopping.
1720.03
Planning, Development, and Responsibilities
The WSP works with WSDOT Strategic Planning and Programming to develop a prioritized list of weigh facility needs for each biennium. The list includes:
•
•
•
•
•
•
New permanent facilities. New portable facilities. New shoulder sites. WIM equipment. Vehicle inspection facilities. Scale approach slab reconstruction.
The WSP provides the Program Management Office of Strategic Planning and Programming a Project Definition, which includes:
•
•
A statement of need, the purpose of the project, and the type of work. The general location of the project.

Weigh Sites
Program Management sends this information to the region for preparation of a Project Summary. The region works with the WSP to identify the specific location of the facility. The region then prepares a design decision estimate and submits it to Program Management. The region negotiates and the Regional Administrator executes any formal agreements with the WSP required for the design, construction, or maintenance of vehicle weighing and inspection facilities. The Memorandum of Understanding Related to Vehicle Weighing and Equipment: Inspection Facilities on State Highways, Exhibit 1720-8, contains details about the various responsibilities of WSDOT and the WSP.
1720.04
Permanent Facilities
Permanent truck weighing facilities have permanent scales and may have buildings. When these facilities are in operation, trucks are required stop. However, when Weigh In Motion (WIM) and Commercial Vehicle Information Systems and Networks (CVISN) capabilities have been installed, the driver may be notified to continue without stopping. The notification to continue may be through the use of signs or transponders.
1720.04(1)
Site Locations
The exact location of a truck weighing facility is generally controlled by topography, highway alignment, and geometrics. It is also desirable to select a site where adequate right of way is already available. Select the most economical site to minimize site preparation, expense, and impact on the environment. Water, electricity availability, and sewage treatment and disposal are other considerations for site selection. Additionally, use the following criteria:
•
•
•
•
Locate the facility such that its operation will not hinder the operation of the highway or other related features such as intersections and interchanges. To the extent feasible, eliminate options for truck traffic to bypass the weigh site. Base the site selection on the type and volume of trucks using the route. Evaluate the operational and safety performance of proposed weigh sites on freeways. The operational and safety evaluation is submitted to HQ Design for concurrence and for FHWA concurrence when on the interstate.
1720.04(2)
Design Features
On multilane highways, provide off- and on-connections as shown in Chapter 1360. Exhibit 1710-1 is the minimal design of a weigh site on multilane highways. Design weigh facilities on two-lane highways to best fit the existing conditions, with particular consideration given to the matter of access to and from the site. Off- and on-connections, as shown in Chapter 1360, are preferred. However, with justification, on-connections may be designed as intersections (see Chapter 1310). Exhibit 1710-2 is a guide for the design of weigh sites on two-lane highways.

Weigh Sites
The following special design features apply to weigh sites:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

•
Level cement concrete approach slabs are required at both ends of the scales. Hot mix asphalt (HMA) approach slabs will be allowed only when adequate soil conditions exist, projected truck volume is light, and benefit/cost analysis justifies the HMA based on the small percentage of time the scales will be in operation. The approach slabs must be level and in the same plane as the scale. Provide adequate parking and storage to ensure trucks do not impede the main line through traffic. The WSDOT Regional Administrator and the WSP agree on the area to be provided. On multilane divided highways, install illuminated electronically controlled “open” and “closed” message signs that can be operated from the scalehouse or the control cabinet. Provide permanent signing for the facility, as requested by the WSP. The need for a vehicle safety inspection facility at any site is identified by the WSP. Exhibit 1710-3 is a guide for a site plan for a single-bay vehicle inspection facility. Additional bays and site adaptation will be on a site-by-site basis. The WSDOT Regional Administrator and the WSP agree on the area to be provided. The need for some form of approach protective treatment for the scale house or a protective fence between the scale and roadway is identified by the WSP and agreed upon by the WSDOT Regional Administrator and the WSP. The need for the device is to protect the scale house from errant vehicles. (See Chapter 1600 for additional clear zone considerations.) The need for WIM or CVISN capabilities is identified by the WSP. Design the in-place facilities to provide the ability to notify drivers whether to continue on or to stop for further investigation before they reach the exit for the static scale. The design is agreed upon by the WSDOT Regional Administrator and the WSP. When WIM and CVISN are not included in the project, provide conduit for their future installation. With justification, at locations where space is limited, the depressed outer separation between the weigh facility and the through lanes may be replaced with concrete traffic barrier. (See the CollectorDistributor: Outer Separations exhibit in Chapter 1360.) Provide a clear view of the entire weigh site for the facility’s operator and the driver of an approaching vehicle. Hot mix asphalt is acceptable for use on the ramp and storage areas. Design the depth in accordance with the surfacing report. To optimize scale efficiency, make the storage area flat; however, to facilitate drainage, the slope may be up to 2%. Provide illumination when requested by the WSP. Illumination is required if the facility is to be operated during the hours of darkness and may be desirable at other locations to deter unauthorized use of the facility. (See Chapter 1040 for additional information on illumination.)
1720.05
Portable Facilities
Portable truck weighing facilities have no permanent scales or buildings. When these facilities are in operation, they operate in the same manner as permanent facilities.

Weigh Sites
1720.05(1)
Site Locations
Design portable truck weighing facilities located on two-lane and multilane roadways to best fit the existing conditions. Minor portable scale sites, as shown in Exhibit 1710-4, are used with two-way traffic and on multilane highways with low traffic volumes. Major portable scale sites (see Exhibit 1710-5) are for use on expressways, freeways, and where traffic volumes are high. Locate the weighing facility such that its operation will not hinder the operation of the highway or other related features such as intersections. An ARR is required for weigh sites on multilane divided highways with access control (see Chapter 550).
1720.05(2)
Design Features
The following special design features apply to portable facilities:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Off- and on-connections, as shown in Exhibit 1710-4 and Exhibit 1710-5, are preferred; however, with justification on highways with no access control, on-connections may be designed as intersections (see Chapter 1310). With justification, at locations where space is limited, the depressed outer separation between the weigh facility and the through lanes may be replaced with concrete traffic barrier. (See the CollectorDistributor: Outer Separation exhibit in Chapter 1360.) Provide adequate parking and storage to ensure trucks do not impede the main line through traffic. The WSDOT Regional Administrator and the WSP agree on the area to be provided. Hot mix asphalt is acceptable for use on the ramp and storage areas. Design the depth in accordance with the surfacing report. To optimize portable scale efficiency, make the storage area flat; however, to facilitate drainage, the slope may be up to 2%. Provide permanent signing for the facility, as requested by the WSP. Provide illumination when requested by the WSP. Illumination is required if the facility is to be operated during the hours of darkness and may be desirable at other locations to deter unauthorized use of the facility. (See Chapter 1040 for additional information on illumination.)
1720.06
Shoulder Sites
Shoulder sites are used by the WSP to pull a truck over for inspection and weighing with portable scales.
1720.06(1)
Site Locations
Design shoulder sites to best fit the existing conditions. Small shoulder sites (see Exhibit 1720-6) are for use on lower-volume roadways (ADT 5000 or less) with two-way traffic. Large shoulder sites (see Exhibit 1720-7) are to be used with higher-volume two-way roadways and multilane highways. Locate the weighing facility so that its operation will not hinder the operation of the highway or other related features such as intersections.
1720.06(2)
Design Features
Shoulder sites are designed in coordination with the WSP. Input from the local WSP Commercial Vehicle Enforcement personnel will ensure the proposed site will meet their needs without over-building the facility. Obtain written concurrence from the WSP for the length, width, and taper rates before the design is finalized.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1720-4
Chapter 1720
Weigh Sites
When the ADT is 1,500 or less, and with the written approval of the WSP, the tapers at small shoulder sites may be eliminated. The shoulders on either side of the site may be used as acceleration and deceleration lanes, whether or not they were designed for this use. Therefore, provide adequate strength to support truck traffic. Hot mix asphalt is acceptable for use on all shoulder sites. Design the depth in accordance with the surfacing report. Design the shoulder pavement at this depth for a length not less than the deceleration lane length before, and the acceleration lane length after, the site (see Chapter 1360). When the shoulders are designed to be used for deceleration and acceleration lanes, the minimum width is 12 feet with full pavement depth for the deceleration/ acceleration lane lengths (see Chapter 1360). Use a maximum 2% slope in order to optimize portable scale efficiency and facilitate drainage.
1720.07
Federal Participation
Federal funds appropriate to the system being improved may be used for the acquisition of right of way and the construction of truck weighing facilities and vehicle inspection facilities. This includes, but is not limited to, onand off-ramps, deceleration/acceleration lanes, passing lanes, driveways, parking areas, scale approach slabs, vehicle inspection facilities, roadway illumination, and signing.
1720.08
Procedures
Prepare site plans for all truck weighing facilities that include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Class of highway and design speed for main line (see Chapter 1103). Curve data on main line and weigh site. Number of lanes and width of lanes and shoulders on main line and weigh site. Superelevation diagrams for the main line and weigh site. Stationing of ramp connections and channelization. Illumination. Signing. Water supply and sewage treatment. Roadside development.
Get WSP approval of the site plans before the final plan approval.

1730.01 General This chapter provides general siting and design information for transit facilities. It is intended for Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) engineering and planning staff, local transit providers, developers, and local agencies engaged in the collaborative development of transit facilities on or adjacent to state highways. The main points covered in this chapter are:
•
•
•
•
•
Bus Stop Policy: WSDOT’s policy for developing bus stops on state highways is presented. The policy calls for WSDOT and the transit provider to work together to locate stops on state highways. Bus stop placement considerations are also provided. Park and Ride Lots: Basic guidelines for development of park and ride lots are presented. Transit/Transfer Centers: Guidance on these centers is provided. Guidance in the Park and Ride section may apply as well. Universal Access: The requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) apply to bus stops and shelters, park and ride lots, and transit centers. This information is presented in various sections of the chapter, with additional references provided. Tools and Resources: Additional guidance and criteria are recommended and referenced, such as: other chapters in the Design Manual for designing intersections and road approaches; the Roadside Manual for parking lot design; the local transit authority’s own standards; and AASHTO.
The design and planning information that follows supports the development of public transit infrastructure and services on state highways. Design Manual topics and chapters commonly used in conjunction with this chapter include:
•
•
•
•
Right of way and access control: Chapter 510 through Chapter 560. Intersections and road approaches: Chapter 1300 through Chapter 1370. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and sidewalk design: Chapter 1510. High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) facilities: Chapter 1410 and Chapter 1420.
1730.02 Bus Stops and Pullouts WSDOT’s Modal Integration Goal seeks to optimize existing system capacity through better interconnectivity of all transportation modes. In support of this goal, WSDOT promotes safe and efficient public transportation services on state highways, including transit routes and stops. On limited access facilities, bus stops are only allowed at designated locations, such as flyer stops. (See Chapter 520, Chapter 530, and Chapter 540 for access control policy and guidance.)
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1730-1
Chapter 1730
Transit Facilities
Bus stops may be approved on non-limited access facilities at the transit agency’s request and upon formal review by WSDOT for sight distance and universal access requirements at the proposed location. At a transit agency’s option, a bus stop on these highways may be located either within the travel lane, or outside the travel lane in a pullout. Contact the State Traffic Engineer for information on how to process a transit agency proposal for either an in-lane or pullout bus stop and for more information about the approval process. Refer to WAC 468-46, Transit Vehicle Stop Zones, for additional details. The bus stop is the point of contact between the passenger and the transit services. The simplest bus stop is a location by the side of the road. The highest quality bus stop is an area that provides passenger amenities and protection from the weather. Bus stops are typically maintained by the transit agency. The bus boarding and alighting pad, the path to the shelter, and the area within the shelter must meet the requirements for universal access. Coordinate with the local transit agency regarding the location and what type of bus stop to use. For additional information on bus stop treatments, see Understanding Flexibility in Transportation Design – Washington and the transit agency’s standards for treatment.
1730.02(1) Bus Stop Placement Guidelines The information in this section is offered as an example of good practice, and is not intended to be binding by either the transit agency or WSDOT. Placement of bus stops addresses the needs and convenience of transit providers, riders, and highway or street operations. Basic considerations include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The need for safe, secure, and convenient service for patrons Access for people with disabilities Convenient passenger transfers to other intersecting bus routes or transfer points Connection to nearby pedestrian circulation systems Presence and width of sidewalks, crosswalks, and curb ramps Pedestrian activity through intersections Ability of the stop to accommodate transit dwell time and the loading/unloading of wheel chairs and bicycles Adequate curb space for the number of buses expected at the stop at one time Ease of reentering traffic stream (if a pullout) Design characteristics and operational considerations of the highway or street Presence of on-street automobile parking and truck delivery zones Traffic control devices near the bus stop, such as signals or stop signs Volumes and turning movements of other traffic, including bicycles Proximity and traffic volumes of nearby driveways Street grade Proximity to rail crossings Accommodating transit priority equipment at signalized intersections Transit queue bypass at signalized intersections Often stops are paired on each side of a highway or street Proximity to intersections

Where blocks are exceptionally long or where bus patrons are concentrated well away from intersections, midblock bus stops and midblock crosswalks may be beneficial. Contact the Region Traffic Engineer when a midblock bus stop is being considered on a multilane roadway to determine crossing design details and treatments that may be required. (See Chapter 1510 and the Traffic Manual for more information on midblock crossings.) It is common to clearly mark the bus stop as a NO PARKING zone or as a BUS ONLY zone with signs and/or curb painting. The remainder of this section discusses three types of bus stops:
•
•
•
Far-side, with a stop located just past an intersection Near-side, with a stop located just prior to an intersection Midblock, with a stop located away from an intersection
Exhibit 1730-1 illustrates these three types of stops and provides some general dimensions. Consult the AASHTO Guide for Geometric Design of Transit Facilities on Highways and Streets for additional guidelines on bus stop spacing, including information on these types of stops. Examine each case separately and determine the most suitable location, giving consideration to service and safety of patrons, efficiency of transit operations, and traffic operation in general.
1730.02(1)(a) Far-Side Bus Stops Sight distance conditions generally favor far-side bus stops, especially at unsignalized intersections. A driver approaching a cross street on the through lanes can see any vehicles approaching from the right. With near-side stops, the view to the right may be blocked by a stopped bus. Where the intersection is signalized, the bus may block the view of one of the signal heads. Advantages:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Right turns can be accommodated with less conflict. Minimum interference is caused at locations where traffic is heavier on the approach side of the intersection. Stopped buses do not obstruct sight distance for vehicles entering or crossing from a side street. At a signalized intersection, buses can often find a gap to enter the traffic stream, except where there are heavy turning movements onto the street with the bus route. Waiting passengers assemble at less-crowded sections of the sidewalk away from the intersection corners. Buses in the bus stop do not obscure traffic control devices or pedestrian movements at the intersection.
Disadvantages:
•
•
Intersections may be blocked if other vehicles park illegally in the bus stop or if more buses than the stop can accommodate arrive at the same time. If signal priority is not used, the bus stops at the red light and again at the far-side stop, interfering with traffic and efficient bus operations.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1730-3
Chapter 1730
Transit Facilities
1730.02(1)(b) Near-Side Bus Stops Advantages:
•
•
•
•
•
May be considered in cases where a far-side bus stop location does not provide a secure, convenient, or feasible boarding location for passengers. Minimum interference is caused where traffic is heavier on the departure side than on the approach side of the intersection. Less interference is caused where the cross street is a one-way street from right to left. Passengers generally exit the bus close to the crosswalk. There is less interference with traffic turning onto the bus route street from a side street.
Disadvantages:
•
•
•
•
Can cause conflicts with right-turning traffic. Buses often obscure sight distance to stop signs, traffic signals, or other control devices, as well as to pedestrians crossing in front of the bus. Where the bus stop is too short to accommodate buses arriving at the same time, the overflow may obstruct the traffic lane. If a queue bypass or bus lane is not used at a signalized intersection, then vehicles waiting at a red signal may block buses from accessing the bus stop, which will require the bus to wait through multiple signal cycles to enter and then depart the bus stop.
1730.02(1)(c) Midblock Bus Stops Midblock stop areas are desirable under the following conditions: where traffic or physical street characteristics prohibit a near- or far-side stop adjacent to an intersection, or where large factories, commercial establishments, or other large bus passenger generators exist. Locate a midblock stop at the far side of a pedestrian crosswalk (if one exists), so that standing buses do not block an approaching motorist’s view of pedestrians in the crosswalk. Advantages:
•
•
•
Buses cause a minimum of interference with the sight distance of both vehicles and pedestrians. Stops can be located adjacent to major bus passenger generators and attractors. Allows riders to board buses closest to the crosswalk.
Disadvantages:
•
•
•
Increases walking distance for passengers crossing at intersections. Buses may or may not have difficulty reentering the flow of traffic. Driveway access may or may not be negatively impacted.

Important elements of a bus stop include:
• ADA Standards
• Protection from passing traffic
• Lighting
• Security
Transit Facilities
•
•
•
•
Paved surface Protection from the environment Seating or other street furniture (if the wait may be long) Information about routes serving the stop
Providing protection from passing traffic involves locating stops where there is enough space, so passengers can wait away from the edge of the traveled roadway. The buffering distance from the roadway increases with traffic speed and traffic volume. Where vehicle speeds are 30 mph or below, 5 feet is a satisfactory distance. In a heavy-volume arterial with speeds up to 45 mph, a distance of 10 feet provides passenger comfort. Passengers arriving at bus stops, especially infrequent riders, want information and reassurance. Provide information that includes the numbers or names of routes serving the stop. Other important information may include a system route map, the hours and days of service, schedules, and a phone number for information. Information technology systems are evolving and some transit agencies now provide information about wait time until the next bus and kiosks to purchase the fare before boarding. Where shelters are not provided, a bus stop sign and passenger bench are desirable, depending on weather conditions. The sign indicates to passengers where to wait and can provide some basic route information. The information provided and format used is typically the responsibility of the local transit agency.
1730.03(2) Passenger Shelters Passenger shelters provide protection for waiting transit users and create driver awareness of intermodal connections involving vulnerable users. Locate the shelter conveniently for users, without blocking the sidewalk or the drivers’ line of sight. Providing shelters (and footing for shelters) is normally the responsibility of the local transit agency; it provides for shelter design and footing needs. State motor vehicle funds cannot be used for design or construction of shelters, except for the concrete pad. Lighting can enhance passenger safety and security. Lighting makes the shelter visible to passing traffic and allows waiting passengers to read the information provided. General street lighting is usually sufficient. Where streetlights are not in place, consider streetlights or transit shelter lights. For information on illumination, see Chapter 1040. A properly drained paved surface is needed so passengers do not traverse puddles and mud in wet weather. Protection from the environment is typically provided by a shelter, which offers shade from the sun, protection from rain and snow, and a wind break. Shelters can range from simple to elaborate. The latter type may serve as an entrance landmark for a residential development or business complex and be designed to carry through the architectural theme of the complex. If a non-public transportation entity shelter is provided, its design and siting must be approved by the local transit agency. The reasons for this approval include safety, barrier-free design, intermodal connections, and long-term maintenance concerns. Consider shelters at bus stops in new commercial and office developments and in places where large numbers of elderly and disabled persons wait, such as at hospitals and senior centers. In residential areas, shelters are placed at the highest-volume stops.

Transit Facilities
In order to use buses that are accessible, bus stops must also be accessible. The nature and condition of streets, sidewalks, passenger loading pads, curb ramps, and other bus stop facilities can constitute major obstacles to mobility and accessibility. State, local, public, and private agencies need to work closely with public transportation officials to provide universal access. Involve the local transit agency in the bus stop pad design and location so that lifts can actually be deployed at the site. In order to access a bus stop, it is important that the path to the stop also be accessible. This can be accomplished by the use of sidewalks with curb ramps. For sidewalk design and curb ramp information, see Chapter 1510 and the Standard Plans. Exhibit 1730-5 depicts ADA standards for bus stop locations. Exhibit 1730-5 Bus Stop Accessibility Features

1730.04 Park and Ride Lots Park and ride lots provide parking for people who wish to transfer from private vehicles, bicycles, and other modes to public transit or carpools/vanpools. Most park and ride lots located within urban areas are served by transit agencies. Leased lots, such as at churches or shopping centers, or park and rides in rural locations, may have no bus service and only serve carpools and vanpools.
Park and ride lot
HOV facilities are often considered and included in larger park and ride lots, to improve access for transit and carpools (see Chapter 1410). Park and ride needs and locations are determined through planning processes typically conducted by transit agencies, WSDOT, and/or RTPOs/MPOs. Once the need is identified, then the project lead should be identified. Early and continual coordination between the project lead and other stakeholders, authorities, and agencies is critical. A Cooperative Agreement is written by Headquarters (HQ) Real Estate Services for the purpose of assigning maintenance and/or operational responsibilities for a WSDOT park and ride lot to a transit agency or local governmental agency. See the Agreements Manual and the HQ Real Estate Services Cooperative Agreement form (Consultants: Please contact your WSDOT Project Manager for access to the Agreements Manual). When a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or other formal agreement exists that outlines the design, funding, maintenance, and operation of park and ride lots, it must be reviewed for requirements pertaining to new lots. If the requirements in the MOU or other formal agreement cannot be met, the MOU must be renegotiated.
1730.04(1) Site Selection In determining the location of a park and ride lot, public input is a valuable tool. Estimated parking demand and other factors determine the size of the lot. Traveler convenience is an important siting factor. Locations that minimize overall trip travel time are most attractive to commuters. Park and rides near freeway access tend to be heavily used because they minimize overall trip travel time for the most people. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1730-11
Chapter 1730
Transit Facilities
Freeway proximity makes it easier for transit authorities to provide frequent route service. Other factors that may affect the initial size of the park and ride lot may include available land, the state of the economy, energy availability and cost, perceived congestion, transit service frequency, and environmental controls. Consider sizing the facility to allow for a conservative first-stage construction with expansion possibilities. As a rule of thumb, 1 acre can accommodate approximately 90 vehicles in a park and ride lot. This allows approximately 40% of the area for borders, landscaping, passenger amenities, bus facilities for larger lots, and future expansion. (See the AASHTO Guide for Geometric Design of Transit Facilities on Highways and Streets, Appendix E, for complementary information.) The local transit authority can give critical input on the need for and design of the park and ride lot. The comprehensive transit plan may already specify a location, and coordination with the transit agency will ensure the site works well for transit vehicle access. Good coordination with the transit agencies through the entire design process is necessary to ensure a well-planned facility that meets the needs of all modal users. Develop a list of potential sites to identify properties that can be most readily developed for parking and that have suitable access. Sources for selecting sites can include State Route Corridor Sketches and useful tools such as GIS or existing aerial photos, detailed land use maps, or property maps. Factors influencing site selection and design of a park and ride facility include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Local transit authority master plan Regional transportation plan Local agency codes Ability to use existing underutilized paved parking areas within proximity of the desired location Local public input Proximity to demand Local traffic operations, characteristics, parking availability, and roadway geometry Local government zoning Social and environmental impacts Local land use compatibility with current or future development patterns Cost and benefit/cost Access by all modes of travel Security and lighting impacts Maintenance Stormwater treatment and outfall Available utilities Existing right of way or sundry site Potential for future expansion
Purchasing or leasing property increases costs. Therefore, the first choice is state- or transit-owned right of way, assuming the other selection criteria are favorable. Also, give prime consideration to the use of city- or countyowned right of way. Select a site that complements the current and future land use and highway needs. Investigate each potential site in the field. The field survey serves to confirm or revise impressions gained from the office review. When conducting the investigation, consider the following:
•
•
•
Physical characteristics of the site Current use and zoning of the area Land use surrounding the property (such as residential or commercial use)

Transit Facilities
Street network and condition of the roadways Visibility from adjacent streets to enhance security Potential for additional expansion Ability to meet ADA requirements and accessibility for motorists and other modes of travel, including transit Proximity of any existing parking facilities (such as church or shopping center parking lots) that are underutilized during the day Potential for joint use of facilities with businesses (such as day care centers or dry cleaners) or land uses compatible with park and ride patrons Congestion and other design considerations Avoiding locations that encourage noncommuter use (such as proximity to a high school)
The desirable location for park and ride lot along one-way couplets is between the two one-way streets, with access from both streets. When this is not achievable, provide additional signing to guide users to and from the facility. Establish potential sites, with transit agency input, and complete public meetings and environmental procedures prior to finalizing the design. Follow the procedures outlined in Chapter 210.
1730.04(2) Design Guidance The remainder of this section covers basic design principles and guidance for park and ride lots. Design features are to be in compliance with local requirements. In some cases, variances to local design requirements may be needed to provide for the safety and security of facility users. Common design components with park and ride lots include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Chapter 1730
Transit Facilities
The degree to which the desirable attributes of any component are sacrificed to obtain the benefits of another component can only be determined on a site-specific basis. However, these guidelines present the optimum design elements of each factor. Large park and ride lots are intended to be transfer points from private automobiles and other modes to transit buses. The same basic principles are used in designing all park and ride lots. Park and Ride lots that serve a large number of buses and/or routes may also serve as Transfer/Transit Centers; in these cases section Section 1730.05 would also apply.
1730.04(2)(a) Access Provide for all modes of transport used to arrive at and depart from transit facilities. The six basic modes are pedestrian, bicycle, motorcycle, automobile, vanpool, and bus. Coordinate with the local jurisdiction and transit authorities to develop the park and ride lot’s ingress and egress locations for transit and for other vehicles. Design the access route, circulation patterns, and return routes to minimize travel time. Exclusive direct connections for buses, vanpools, and carpools may reduce transit costs and save time for riders. Design transit facility access points on intersecting collector or local streets where possible. Locate the access to avoid the queues from nearby intersections. Provide vehicle storage lanes for entering and exiting vehicles to ensure ease of access and encourage use of the facility. To avoid increasing congestion on the highway or the community that the facility serves, locate entrances and exits where a traffic signal, or other intersection control type (see Chapter 1300), can be reasonably installed at a later time, if needed. Entrances and exits to park and rides range in scale from full public intersections to driveways, depending on contextual factors such as traffic volumes and remoteness. Design access points using criteria in the 1300 chapter series (Division 13) or other published design guidelines used by the local agency. When locating access points on a state highway, see chapters in the 500 series (Division 5) for information about access control types (managed or limited access) and standard access spacing and other requirements. When designing the entrance/exit locations used by buses, start the design using a 15-foot lane width, and then adjust as needed using the bus design vehicle and turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify the design.
1730.04(2)(b) Internal Circulation Provide walkways to minimize pedestrian use of a circulation road or an aisle to minimize pedestrian conflict points with other modes. Make the pedestrian circulation path from any parking stall to the loading zone as direct as possible. Where pedestrian movement originates from an outlying part of a large parking lot, consider a walkway that extends toward the loading zone in a straight line. For additional criteria for pedestrian movement, see Design Manual Chapter 1510 and Chapter 630 of the Roadside Manual.
WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1730-14
Chapter 1730
Transit Facilities
Pedestrian Access Route
Locate major vehicular circulation routes within a park and ride lot at the periphery of the parking area to minimize vehicle-pedestrian conflicts. Take care that an internal intersection is not placed too close to a street intersection. Consider a separate loading area with priority parking for vanpools. Wherever possible, do not mix buses and auto circulation. Close coordination with the local transit authority is critical in the design of internal circulation for buses and vanpools. Design bus circulation routes to provide for easy movement, with efficient terminal operations and convenient passenger transfers. Design bus routes within the internal layout, including entrance and exit driveways, to the turning radius of the design bus vehicle. Additional considerations for internal circulation are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Base the general design for the individual user modes on the priority sequence of: pedestrians, bicycles, feeder buses, and park and ride area. Design the different traffic flows (auto, pedestrian, bicycle, and bus) circulating within the lot to be understandable to all users, and to minimize conflicting movements between modes. Disperse vehicular movements within the parking area by the strategic location of entrances, exits, and aisles. Do not confront drivers with more than one decision at a time. Provide clear signing for all modes. Make the pedestrian circulation routes ADA-compliant (see Chapter 1510). Parking stall and access aisle surfaces shall be even and smooth, with surface slopes not exceeding 2%. Consider future expansion. Align parking aisles to facilitate convenient pedestrian movement toward the bus loading zone. Locate the passenger loading zone either in a central location, to minimize the pedestrian walking distance from the parking area to the loading zone, or near the end of the facility, to minimize the transit travel time. In large lots, you may need to provide more than one waiting area for multiple buses.
1730.04(2)(c) Parking Area Design Refer to the Roadside Manual for detailed guidance on parking area design. Some general guidelines follow. Normally, internal circulation is two way with 90° parking. However, one-way aisles with angled parking may be advantageous in a smaller lot due to the limited available space or to promote a specific circulation pattern. WSDOT Design Manual M 22-01.22 
Page 1730-15
Chapter 1730
Transit Facilities
Provide parking for bicycles, motorcycles, and private automobiles, as well as carpools, vanpools, and buses. Locate accessible parking stalls close to the transit loading and unloading area. Two accessible parking stalls may share a common access aisle. For information on the number and design of accessible stalls, see the Roadside Manual and the parking space layouts in the Standard Plans. Sign accessible parking stalls in accordance with the requirements of RCW 46.61.581. Parking stalls and access aisle surfaces shall be even and smooth, with surface slopes not exceeding 2%. Locate the bicycle-parking area relatively close to the transit passenger loading area, separated from motor vehicles by curbing or other physical barriers, without landscaping that hides the bike area from view, and with a direct route from the street.
•
•
Design the bike-parking area to discourage pedestrians from inadvertently walking into the area and tripping. Provide lots that are served by public transit, with lockers or with a rack that will support the bicycle frame and allow at least one wheel to be locked. Consider providing shelters for bicycle racks. For bicycles, the layout normally consists of stalls 2.5 feet x 6 feet, at 90° to aisles, with a minimum aisle width of 4 feet. Coordinate decisions to provide bicycle lockers, racks, and shelters with the local transit authority and the region subject matter experts.
For more information, see Understanding Flexibility in Transportation Design – Washington. It is complementary to the content in this chapter, and provides more insights to modal designs, environment and aesthetics, community engagement, jurisdictional coordination.
1730.04(2)(d) Drainage Provide sufficient slope for surface drainage, as ponding of water in a lot is undesirable for both vehicles and pedestrians. This is particularly true in cold climates where freezing may create icy spots. The maximum grade is 2%. Install curb, gutter, and surface drains and grates where needed. Coordinate designs for drainage and pedestrian access routes to avoid conflicts. Coordinate drainage design with the local agency to make sure appropriate codes are followed. For additional drainage information, see Design Manual Chapter 800 and the Roadside Manual.
1730.04(2)(e) Pavement Design Design pavement to conform to design specifications for each of the different uses and loadings that a particular portion of a lot or roadway is expected to handle. Bus lanes are typically Portland cement concrete pavement. Within the parking area, HMA-type pavements are typically used. Coordinate the pavement designs with the local transit agency and local jurisdiction. Consult with the Region Materials Engineer on pavement section requirements. There may be benefits to permeable pavement if space for stormwater facilities is limited.
1730.04(2)(f) Driver Guidance Provide a well thought out design for traffic movements within the lot using the proper pavement markings and signage for safe and efficient use by all users of the lot. Typically, reflectorized markings for centerlines, lane lines, channelizing lines, and lane arrows are needed to guide or separate patron and transit traffic. Install park and ride identification signs. For signing and pavement markings, see Chapter 1020 and Chapter 1030 and the MUTCD.

1730.04(2)(g) Shelters Coordinate with the transit agency on the need, location, design, and installation of pedestrian shelters. To satisfy local needs, shelters may be individually designed, provided by the transit agency, or selected from a variety of commercially available designs. These designs must meet ADA accessibility requirements. Consider the following features in shelter design:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Select open locations with good visibility for user safety. Situate enclosed shelters away from edges of driveways and roadways to keep users dry. Select materials and locations where the bus driver can see waiting passengers. Avoid using doors, for ease of maintenance and to limit vandalism opportunities. Allow for a small air space along the bottom of the enclosure panels, to permit air circulation and reduce debris collection. Optional features you may provide are: lighting; heat; telephone; static or electronic travel information (schedules); electronic fare collection equipment; commercial advertisements for revenue generation; and trash receptacles.
For additional information on passenger amenities, see Section 1730.03.
1730.04(2)(h) Illumination, Safety, and Security Lighting is important from a safety standpoint and as a deterrent to criminal activity in both the parking area and the shelters. For guidance, see Design Manual Chapter 1040, Chapter 630 of the Roadside Manual, local agency criteria, and AASHTO. The Guide for Geometric Design of Transit Facilities on Highways and Streets, AASHTO, 2014, states: “Security at stations and major stops—both manned and unmanned—should be achieved by closed circuit television monitoring, provision of call boxes, good visibility and lighting, police surveillance, and effective designs. Both the actual security and the passengers’ perceptions of security are important for a viable service or operation.” (See the Guide for more information.)
1730.04(2)(i) Planting Areas Selectively preserve existing vegetation and provide new plantings to afford a balanced environment for the park and ride lot user. For guidance and policy, see the Roadside Manual and the Roadside Policy Manual, respectively.
1730.04(2)(j) Fencing For fencing guidelines, see Chapter 560 and discuss with the partnering transit agency.
1730.04(2)(k) Maintenance Maintenance of park and ride lots outside state right of way is the responsibility of the local transit authority. Negotiate maintenance agreements with local transit authorities or other appropriate parties during the design phase, to identify the requirements and responsibilities for the maintenance. A Cooperative Agreement is written by HQ Real Estate Services for the purpose of assigning maintenance and/or operational responsibilities for a WSDOT park and ride lot to a transit agency or local governmental agency. See the Agreements Manual and the HQ Real Estate Services Cooperative Agreement form (Consultants: Please contact your WSDOT Project Manager for access to the Agreements Manual).

1730.05 Transfer/Transit Centers Transfer/transit centers are large multimodal bus stops where buses on a number of routes converge to allow riders the opportunity to change buses or transfer to other modes. Transit centers are frequently major activity centers and serve as destination points. Many factors dictate the particular needs of each transit center. Design of a transit center considers such features as passenger volume; number of buses on the site at one time; local auto and pedestrian traffic levels; and universal access. Transit agencies generally lead in the development of transfer/transit centers, and their standards apply. Consult the AASHTO Guide for Geometric Design of Transit Facilities on Highways and Streets for more comprehensive overviews and design guidelines for these facilities.
1730.05(1) Bus Platforms At a transit center where several transit routes converge and where buses congregate (lay over), multiple bus berths or spaces are typically needed, along with areas where passengers boarding or alighting the bus can take refuge. Typically, there are several design styles for multi-berth bus platforms (see AASHTO). Parallel and sawtooth types are described below. An important aspect in multiple bus berthing is proper signing and marking for the bus bays for both operators and passengers. Clearly delineate the route served by each bay. Consider pavement marking to indicate stopping positions. Separate layover bays may be needed for terminating bus routes, or the layover function can be provided at the passenger platform if the platform only serves a single route. Consider future service plans and maximize flexibility in the design of transit center bays and circulation. Portland cement concrete pavement is desirable for pedestrian walkways on the platform, for ease of cleaning. Where buses are equipped with a bicycle rack, provide for the loading and unloading of bicycles. Exhibit 1430-6 shows typical parallel and sawtooth designs for parking 40-foot buses for passengers boarding and alighting at a platform. The sawtooth design does not require buses to arrive or depart in any order.

Exhibit 1730-7 is an example of a platform design that has a combination of parallel and sawtooth bus berths at a platform. The sawtooth design provides more space-efficient berthing, as the parallel design shown may require that buses arrive and/or depart in order. Coordinate the bus berth style and platform design with the local transit authority throughout the design process, and obtain its concurrence for the final design. In the design of parallel bus berths, additional roadway width is needed for swing-out maneuvers if shorter bus loading platforms are utilized. The roadway width and the amount of lineal space required at the bus platform are directly related where designs allow departing buses to pull out from the platform around a standing bus. The shorter the berth length allowed, the wider the roadway. Use turn simulation software (such as AutoTURN®) to verify the design. Considerable length is needed in a parallel design to permit a bus to pass and pull into a platform in front of a parked bus. Design the bus aisle so that a bus can by-pass another bus stopped at the platform. The decision to provide a parallel design to accommodate a by-pass maneuver may depend on how many routes service the location, and the frequency of service.
1730.05(2) Flow/Movement Alternatives Two primary alternatives for vehicle and passenger movement are possible for transfer centers, regardless of the type of bus berths used, as shown in Exhibit 1730-6. Buses may line up along one side of the transfer center. This type of arrangement is generally suitable for a limited number of buses due to the walking distances for transferring passengers. For a larger number of buses, an arrangement similar to Exhibit 1730-7 can minimize transfer time by consolidating the buses in a smaller area. Consult the AASHTO Guide for Geometric Design of Transit Facilities on Highways and Streets for more comprehensive overviews and design guidelines.

1730.06(1) Pavement Coordinate the pavement design (type and thickness) of a transit project, whether initiated by a public transportation agency or a private entity, with WSDOT or the local agency public works department, depending on highway, street, or road jurisdiction. These agencies play a major role in determining the paving section for the particular project. Consult with the Region Materials Engineer on pavement section requirements.

1730.06(2) Grades Roadway grades refer to the maximum desirable slope or grade, or the maximum slope based on the minimum design speed that a 40-foot bus can negotiate efficiently. For roadway grade guidance, see Chapter 1220 or the Local Agency Guidelines. Bus speed on grades is directly related to the weight/horsepower ratio. Select grades that permit uniform operation at an affordable cost. In cases where the roadway is steep, a climbing lane for buses and trucks may be needed. For climbing lane guidance, see Chapter 1270. Avoid abrupt changes in grade due to bus overhangs and ground clearance.
1730.06(3) Lane Widths Guidance on roadway and lane widths is given in Chapter 1230 or the Local Agency Guidelines, based on the context, modal users, needs of the highway or road, and jurisdiction.
1730.06(4) Design Vehicle Characteristics Most transit agencies operate several types of buses within their systems. Vehicle sizes range from articulated buses to passenger vans operated for specialized transportation purposes and vanpooling. Several bus types are listed below. (See Chapter 1103, Design Controls, and Chapter 1300 for design vehicle guidance.)
1730.06(4)(a) City Buses (CITY-BUS) These traditional urban transit vehicles are typically 40 feet long and have a wheelbase of approximately 25 feet. Many of these vehicles are equipped with either front or rear door wheelchair lifts or a front “kneeling” feature that reduces the step height for mobility-impaired patrons. Installing higher curb can reduce the time it takes to kneel a bus and thus increase reliability.
1730.06(4)(b) Articulated Buses Because articulated buses (A-BUS) are hinged between two sections, these vehicles can turn within a relatively short radius. Articulated buses are typically 60 feet in length, with a wheelbase of 22 feet from the front axle to the mid axle and 19 feet from the mid axle to the rear axle. If articulated buses are the common bus using a stop, adjust the length of the pullout accordingly to avoid conflicts.
1730.06(4)(c) Small Buses Some transit agencies operate small buses, which are designed for use in low-volume situations or for driving on lower-class roads. Small buses are also used for transportation of elderly and disabled persons and for shuttle services. Passenger vans are a type of small bus used for specialized transportation and vanpooling. Since the vehicle specifications vary so widely within this category, consult the local transit authority for the specifications of the particular vehicle in question.

1730.06(5) Intersection Radii A fundamental characteristic of transit-accessible development is convenient access and circulation for transit vehicles. It is important that radii at intersections be designed to accommodate turning buses. Radii that accommodate turning buses reduce conflicts between automobiles and buses, reduce bus travel time, and provide maximum comfort for the passengers. Refer to Chapter 1300 and Chapter 1310 for intersection design guidance, and take the following factors into consideration in designing intersection radii:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Right of way availability Angle of intersection Width and number of lanes on the intersecting streets Feasibility of channelization adjustments such as set-back stop bar or adjusted center line Design vehicle turning radius On-street parking and/or curb extensions (see Chapter 1510) Allowable bus encroachment Operating speed and speed reductions Adequate intersection sight distance Needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and other design users (see chapters in the 1100 series (Division 11) for contextual discussions and Chapter 1230 for roadway types.)
Because of space limitations and generally lower operating speeds in urban areas, curve radii for turning movements are typically smaller than those used in rural areas.

If a crosswalk (marked or unmarked) will be reconstructed, paved (overlay or inlay), or otherwise altered as part of a project, then the curb ramps that serve that crosswalk are within the construction impact zone. (ADA term) context Refers to the environmental, economic, and social features that influence livability and travel characteristics. Context characteristics provide insight into the activities, functions, and performance that can be influenced by the roadway design. Context also informs roadway design, including the selection of design controls, such as target speed and modal priority, and other design decisions. See Chapter 1102. context categories The naming convention used to describe either a land use or transportation context (see Chapter 1102). context characteristic A distinguishing trait within a context, either land use or transportation. Chapter 1102 lists several common characteristics that help distinguish between one type of context versus another. There may be additional traits not covered in the chapter. contextual performance metric A restatement of a contextual performance need in terms that can be measured or assessed in both the existing and proposed (future) state.

It can only be accurately determined in locations where there is a permanent traffic recording device active 365 days of the year. It correlates to the peak hour (see peak hour), but it is not equivalent. In some circumstances, it is necessary to use the peak hour data instead of DHV because peak hour can be collected using portable traffic recorders. design speed A design control; the speed used to determine the various geometric design features of the roadway. design up An approach to developing project alternatives utilizing the smallest dimensions that meet the need by providing the desired performance. design users A broad term intended to capture all modal users that currently utilize or are legally permitted on a roadway segment or node. design variance Same as Design Analysis. design vehicle See intersection design vehicle. design year The forecast year used for design as described in Chapter 1103.

freeway A divided highway that has a minimum of two lanes in each direction for the exclusive use of traffic and with full control of access. frontage road An auxiliary road that is a local road or street located beside a highway for service to abutting property and adjacent areas and for control of access. functional classification The grouping of streets and highways according to the character of the service they are intended to provide. G geocomposites Prefabricated edge drains, wall drains, and sheet drains that typically consist of a cuspated or dimpled polyethylene drainage core wrapped in a geotextile. The geotextile wrap keeps the core clean so that water can freely flow through the drainage core, which acts as a conduit. Prefabricated edge drains are used in place of shallow geotextile-wrapped trench drains at the edges of the roadway to provide subgrade and base drainage. Wall drains and sheet drains are typically placed between the back of the wall and the soil to drain the soil retained by the wall. Geographic Information System (GIS) A computerized geographic information system used to store, analyze, and map data. Data may be used with GIS if the data includes the Accumulated Route Mile (ARM) or State Route Milepost (SRMP) programs. Global Positioning System (GPS) technology provides a means of collecting data and is an alternative to ARM and SRMP. WSDOT’s primary desktop tool to view and analyze GIS data is ArcGIS software. geogrids A polymer grid mat constructed either of coated yarns or a punched and stretched polymer sheet. Geogrids usually have high strength and stiffness and are used primarily for soil reinforcement. geomembranes Impervious polymer sheets that are typically used to line ponds or landfills. In some cases, geomembranes are placed over moisture-sensitive swelling clays to control moisture. geonets Similar to geogrids, but typically lighter weight and weaker, with smaller mesh openings. Geonets are used in light reinforcement applications or are combined with drainage geotextiles to form a drainage structure. geosynthetic erosion control The minimizing of surficial soil particle movement due to the flow of water over the surface of bare soil or due to the disturbance of soil caused by construction activities under or near bodies of water. This is the primary function of geotextiles used as silt fences or placed beneath riprap or other stones on soil slopes. Silt fences keep eroded soil particles on the construction site, whereas geotextiles placed beneath riprap or other stones on soil slopes prevent erosion from taking place at all. In general, the permanent erosion control methods described in Chapter 630 are only used where more natural means (like the use of biodegradable vegetation mats to establish vegetation to prevent erosion) are not feasible. These functions control some of the geosynthetic properties, such as apparent opening size (AOS) and permittivity, and in some cases load-strain characteristics. The application will also affect the geosynthetic installation conditions. These installation conditions influence the remaining geosynthetic properties needed, based on the survivability level required. geosynthetic filtration The passage of water through the geosynthetic relatively unimpeded (permeability or permittivity) without allowing passage of soil through the geosynthetic (retention). This is the primary function of geotextiles in underground drainage applications. geosynthetic survivability The ability of the geosynthetic to resist installation conditions without significant damage, such that the geosynthetic can function as intended. Survivability affects the strength properties of the geosynthetic required.

Glossary
geotextiles (nonwoven) A sheet of continuous or staple fibers entangled randomly into a felt for needlepunched nonwovens and pressed and melted together at the fiber contact points for heat-bonded nonwovens. Nonwoven geotextiles tend to have low-to-medium strength and stiffness with high elongation at failure and relatively good drainage characteristics. The high elongation characteristic gives them superior ability to deform around stones and sticks. geotextiles (woven) Slit polymer tapes, monofilament fibers, fibrillated yarns, or multifilament yarns simply woven into a mat. Woven geotextiles generally have relatively high strength and stiffness and, except for the monofilament wovens, relatively poor drainage characteristics. gore The area downstream from the intersection of the shoulders of the main line and exit ramp. Although generally referring to the area between a main line and an exit ramp, the term may also be used to refer to the area between a main line and an entrance ramp. gore nose At an exit ramp, the point at the end of the gore area where the paved shoulders of the main line and the ramp separate (see Chapter 1360) or the beginning of traffic barrier, not including any impact attenuator.

The HSP is the starting point for the state highway element of the CIPP and the state Highway Construction Program. It is periodically updated to reflect completed work and changing transportation needs, policies, and revenues. It compares highway needs to revenues, describes the “constrained” costs of the highway programs, and provides details of conceptual solutions and performance in the improvement program. Highways of Statewide Significance (HSS) Include interstate highways and other principal arterials that are needed to connect major communities in the state.

This signal is most commonly operated in pairs, with one signal at each end of the work zone. This eliminates the need for 24-hour flagger control. The traffic signal provides alternating right of way assignments for conflicting traffic movements. The signal has an adjustable vertical support with two three-section signal displays and is mounted on a mobile trailer with its own power source. positive illumination Lighting the surface of the object as the driver views it. posted speed The maximum legal speed as posted on a section of highway using regulatory signs. Practical Design/Practical Solutions An approach to making project decisions that focuses on the specific problem the project is intended to address. This performance-based approach looks for lower cost solutions that meet outcomes that WSDOT, partnering agencies, communities and stakeholders have identified. Practical design is a fundamental component to the vision, mission, values, goals, and reforms identified in Results WSDOT- WSDOT’s Strategic Plan. With practical solutions, decision-making focuses on maximum benefit to the system, rather than maximum benefit to the project. Focusing on the specific project need minimizes the scope of work for each project so that system-wide needs can be optimized. prehearing packet A concise, organized collection of all necessary prehearing data, prepared by the region and approved by the HQ Access and Hearings Section Manager prior to the hearing (see Chapter 210). preliminary engineering (PE) A term used to describe the Project Delivery process from project scoping through PS&E review. principal arterial system A connected network of rural arterial routes with appropriate extensions into and through urban areas, including routes designated as part of the Interstate System, that serves corridor movements with travel characteristics indicative of substantial statewide and interstate travel (RCW 47.05.021).

T tangent runout The length of highway needed to change the cross slope from normal crown to a section with adverse crown removed (level). target speed A proactive approach to establishing a speed consistent with the context characteristics. Target speed is the design operating speed, which aligns design, posted and operating speed as the same value. temporary traffic signal A conventional traffic signal used during construction to control traffic at an intersection while a permanent signal system is being constructed. A temporary traffic signal is typically an inexpensive span-wire installation using timber strain poles. tradeoffs analysis An analysis method for balancing factors, performance or outcomes, which are not attainable at the same time. traffic barrier A longitudinal barrier, including bridge rail or an impact attenuator, used to redirect vehicles from fixed features located within an established Design Clear Zone, help mitigate median crossovers, reduce the potential for errant vehicles to travel over the side of a bridge structure, or (occasionally) protect workers, pedestrians, or bicyclists from vehicular traffic. traffic barrier/longitudinal barrier A device oriented parallel or nearly parallel to the roadway whose primary function is to contain or safely redirect errant vehicles away from fixed features or to (occasionally) protect workers, pedestrians, or bicyclists from vehicular traffic. Beam guardrail, cable barrier, bridge rail, concrete barrier, and impact attenuators are barriers, and they are categorized as rigid, rigid anchored, unrestrained rigid, semirigid, and flexible. They can be installed as roadside or median barriers. traffic calming Design techniques that have been shown to reduce traffic speeds and unsafe maneuvers. These techniques can be stand-alone or used in combination, and they include lane narrowing, curb extensions, surface variations, and visual clues in the vertical plane. (ADA term) traffic calming treatments Treatments along the roadway that can be used to reduce speeds through a section of roadway (see Chapter 1103). Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA) (sometimes called Traffic Impact Study (TIS)) If a traffic analysis is not an ARR it is a TIA. TIAs are used for environmental reviews and developer projects (see Chapter 320). trails Trails are intended to provide and support recreational experience(s) and do not provide necessary infrastructure for ADA accessibility and may not provide connectivity for the transportation network. Although trails may be used by multiple user types (such as pedestrians, bicyclists or equestrian activities), they are not designed based on ADA guidance like shared-use paths and sidewalks are. The Pacific Crest Trail is a good example of a trail. Parts of trails might be accessible, but trails don't need to be accessible. Trails do not usually have a firm, stable, or slip resistant surfaces, nor do they usually have accessible cross slopes, or running slopes. transit A general term applied to passenger rail and bus service used by the public. transit facility A capital facility that improves the efficiency of public transportation or encourages the use of public transportation. transit flyer stop A multimodal connection located within the boundaries of a limited access facility. transition A section of barrier used to produce the gradual stiffening of a flexible or semirigid barrier as it connects to a more rigid barrier or fixed object.

transitional segments Segments of a pedestrian circulation path that blend between existing undisturbed pedestrian facilities and newly altered pedestrian facilities. Use of transitional segments may permit the work of the alteration to more nearly meet the new construction standards. At a later time, when other segments of the pedestrian circulation path are altered, the noncomplying transitional segments can be removed and replaced with pedestrian facilities that meet the accessibility criteria. (ADA term) transit lane A lane for the exclusive use of transit vehicles. transit stop A facility for loading and unloading passengers that is set aside for the use of transit vehicles only. transit vehicle A bus or other motor vehicle that provides public transportation (usually operated by a public agency).

Transportation Management Area (TMA) Urbanized areas with populations of 200,000 or greater are federally designated as Transportation Management Areas. transportation management plan (TMP) A set of traffic control plans, transportation operations plans, and public information strategies for managing the work zone impacts of a project. A TMP is required for all projects to address work zone safety and mobility impacts. Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO) TSMO is applying cost-effective solutions that are multimodal, cross jurisdictional, and applicable across the transportation system. TSMO strategies are flexible solutions that can be applied as standalone solutions, combined with other solutions, and/or mitigation for performance tradeoffs prior to future expansion. See https://tsmowa.org/ for more information. travel demand The demand travelers will make on the system based on the number and types of trips they will take and the mode and routes they will use. Local travel demand represents short trips that should be made on the local transportation system, such as intracity roads and streets. Regional travel demand represents long trips that are made on the regional transportation system, such as Interstate, regional, and/or intercity/interregional roads, streets, or highways. traveled way The portion of the roadway intended for the movement of vehicles, exclusive of shoulders, auxiliary lanes, turning lanes, parking, and gutter pans colored differently than the lane. traveler information Commercial and noncommercial information that informs and orients the traveling public. This includes access information for food, gas, lodging, local attractions, regional tourist attractions, roadway conditions, and construction schedules. traveling public Motorists, motorcyclists, bicyclists, pedestrians, and pedestrians with disabilities. traversable slope A slope on which a vehicle is not likely to overturn and is free of fixed objects. Slopes 3H:1V or flatter are considered traversable slopes. trips Short trips are normally local. Long trips are normally interstate, regional, or interregional. truck apron The optional mountable portion of the central island of a roundabout between the raised nontraversable area of the central island and the circulating roadway (see Chapter 1320). turning radius The radius that the front wheel of the intersection design vehicle on the outside of the curve travels while making a turn (see Chapter 1320). turning roadway A curve on an open highway, a ramp, or the connecting portion of the roadway between two intersecting legs of an intersection.

urban area An area designated by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) in cooperation with the Transportation Improvement Board (TIB) and Regional Transportation Planning Organizations (RTPO), subject to the approval of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). urbanized area An urban area with a population of 50,000 or more. usable shoulder The width of the shoulder that can be used by a vehicle for stopping. V validation A process to confirm the reasonableness, accuracy and completeness of estimated costs and quantities. Value Engineering (VE) Analysis A systematic approach to identifying and removing unnecessary costs which do not contribute to a desired result by analyzing cost versus function. Value Engineering Change Proposal (VECP) A construction contract change proposal submitted by the construction contractor based on a VECP provision in the contract. The intent of these types of proposals is to (1) improve the project's performance, value, and/or quality, (2) lower construction costs, or (3) shorten the delivery time, while considering their impacts on the project's overall life-cycle cost and other applicable factors. Value Engineering (VE) Job Plan A systematic and structured action plan (see Chapter 310) for conducting and documenting the results of the VE analysis. While each VE analysis shall address each phase in the VE Job Plan, the level of analysis conducted and effort expended for each phase should be scaled to meet the needs of each individual project. The WSDOT VE analysis uses the Seven-Phase Job Plan shown in Exhibit 310-1. veiling luminance The stray light produced within the eye by light sources produces a veiling luminance that is superimposed on the retinal image of the objects being observed. This stray light alters the apparent brightness of an object within the visual field and the background against which it is viewed, thereby impairing the ability of the driver to perform visual tasks. Conceptually, veiling luminance is the light that travels directly from the luminaire to the observer’s eye. viewpoint A roadside stopping opportunity with a view of some point of interest or area scenery. This area is not typically separated from the traveled way by some form of highway buffer. violation rate The total number of violators divided by the total number of vehicles on an HOV facility. visioning exercises a process of determining the goals for a facility or place. Visitor Information Center (VIC) A staffed or nonstaffed booth or separate building that displays and dispenses free tourist travel maps and brochures.

(ADA term) walkway The continuous portion of the pedestrian access route that is connected to street crossings by curb ramps. (ADA term) warning beacon A beacon that supplements a warning or regulatory sign or marking. The display is a flashing yellow indication. These beacons are not used with STOP, YIELD, or DO NOT ENTER signs or at intersections that control two or more lanes of travel. A warning identification beacon is energized only during those times when the warning or regulation is in effect. warrant A minimum condition for which an action is authorized. Meeting a warrant does not attest to the existence of a condition that needs attention. Further justification is required. Washington Transportation Plan (WTP) A WSDOT planning document developed in coordination with local governments, regional agencies, and private transportation providers. The WTP addresses the future of transportation facilities owned and operated by the state as well as those the state does not own but in which it has an interest.
