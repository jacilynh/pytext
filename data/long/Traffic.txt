Signs
General
Effective signing is the primary method to provide regulatory, warning, and guidance information to transportation system users (motorized vehicles, pedestrians, and bicyclists).
Signing that is clear, concise, and accurate supports safe behaviors and safe operation, legal, and orderly travel on public roadways and transportation facilities. Sign use must be limited and conservative since signs can lose their effectiveness when used to excess. Signs are not typically used to confirm Rules of the Road.
This chapter contains information about signing on the state highway system and is intended for persons involved in traffic operations or traffic design. Specific policies and guidelines are included that clarify the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) information. Situations not addressed in this chapter or the MUTCD may need to be determined on a case-by-case basis using engineering judgment.
Where a change to the current sign installation is indicated by information in this chapter, replace as the current sign’s service life is reached. For MUTCD Target Compliance Dates, see page I-4, Table I-2 for required sign replacements.
State law requires the department to adopt uniform standards for traffic control devices, including signs, along public roadways. WAC 468-95 adopts the MUTCD and
Washington State Modifications to the MUTCD as these standards. The MUTCD and
WSDOT modifications provide guidance on the intended use and placement of regulatory, warning, guide, and motorist information signs, as well as specific information on sizes and installation.
This chapter supplements the MUTCD and WSDOT modifications with specific interpretations and unique applications for signs on the state highway system.
Guidelines for the use of traffic control signs are discussed in the following

Sign Design
The WSDOT Sign Fabrication Manual M 55-05 contains geometric layout details for most signs used by the department.
The sign number codes indicated in the Sign Fabrication Manual and other departmental publications are exclusive to WSDOT and may not correspond to MUTCD number codes for similar signs.
Any modification to a symbol regulatory or warning sign requires FHWA experimentation approval, contact HQ’s Traffic.
Any non-standard sign design shall be submitted to the State Sign Engineer for the State
Traffic Engineer’s approval.

2-2.1
Designing a Sign Message
This section contains information about layout and fabrication of signs that are not addressed in the Sign Fabrication Manual.
A.
Message Content – A sign message must convey the necessary information in a simple, direct manner using clear and concise wording. English language is used on signs on the state transportation system. Historical names (including non-English) may be used for place names such as for a town or natural or cultural feature. Native Tribal language may be used on jurisdictional boundary and geographic features signs.
B.
Letter Sizing – Letter sizes for primary and supplemental guide signs are determined by roadway type and operating speed. A sign message must be large enough to give the viewer adequate time to read and comprehend the information, and to respond with a driving task or other action as required. MUTCD Tables 2E-2 through 2E-5 show the appropriate standard letter sizes to be used. Signs on non-roadway portions of the transportation system (i.e., bicycle or pedestrian paths, transit stations) are sized to reflect the specific conditions of use.
Studies indicate the average driver comprehends three words per second, after a message perception time of up to two seconds. Unique messages require more perception time than messages that are commonly used. Determine the needed letter height for a particular sign by using the following formula that combines the comprehension rate and the perception time with the operational speed of the roadway.
LETTER HEIGHT = (N/3 + 2) f
Where:

Page 2-2
N =
Number of words in the message. f =
Legibility factor (see Exhibit 2-1). (Found by dividing vehicle speed in feet per second (fps) by 30, the legibility distance per inch of letter height.)

C.
Message Layout and Spacing – Sign message layout and spacing requirements are specified in the Sign Fabrication Manual.
D.

Abbreviations – Abbreviations must be immediately recognizable by the viewer and are only used to avoid excessively long sign messages. Do not use abbreviations if the controlling (longest) message line is long enough to allow use of the complete word.
Do not abbreviate place names except for those approved in the list below.
To maintain statewide uniformity, the Headquarters Traffic Office must approve abbreviations other than those listed below. Periods are not used in sign abbreviations, except for British Columbia (B.C.) and United States (U.S. Customs).

Sign Location, Installation, and Storage
Sign Location
Signs shall be located and positioned according to standards outlined in the MUTCD Section address sign mounting height and lateral and longitudinal placement. • Place signs in a manner that provides a clear view for the roadway user and to not obstruct other signs. • Space signs to allow the roadway user time for making required decisions and to safely execute any necessary maneuver. • Overloading roadway users with too much information may cause confusion; use engineering judgment based on Perception Reaction Time (PRT) and posted speed limit. • Signs should be individually installed on separate posts or mountings except where one sign supplements another or where route or directional signs must be grouped.
An exception is an Adopt A Highway sign with a Milepost marker. • Signs should be located as far from the traveled way as possible, while remaining visually effective (road user’s cone of vision). They should be placed on the backslope of a ditch, rather than the inslope or bottom. • Sign spacing on Freeways and Expressways: – Minimum mainline spacing between all primary and supplemental guide signs shall be 800 feet. – Minimum sign spacing between all other signs except Milepost (MP) and
Object Marker signs shall be 500 feet. This shall include spacing to primary and supplemental guide signs, and Highway Advisory Radio (HAR and Variable Message

Temporary and Permanent Attention Devices
Attention getting devices, such as flags, may be used temporarily with newly installed warning or regulatory signs. They can draw attention to a traffic revision such as a speed limit change or the addition of a traffic signal. Temporary attention devices are fluorescent yellow in color. They are generally displayed for a minimum of two weeks and a maximum of one month. Devices may be displayed up to two months when greater conspicuity is needed.
Attention devices may be permanently placed when a high impact continues to be needed to improve compliance with a specific traffic regulation or other traffic control. Permanent attention devices have been used on Interstate or other major roadways where there is a speed limit reduction of 10 mph or greater.
Permanent attention devices shall be fluorescent yellow prismatic sheeting and must be approved by the region traffic engineer following an engineering investigation, which includes a review of crash and speed data. The unnecessary use of attention devices erodes their effectiveness and must be avoided. Therefore, permanent attention devices must be re-evaluated every 12 to 24 months for continued effectiveness and re-approved by the
Region Traffic Engineer.

Controlling Vegetation Around Signs
The department’s maintenance crews are responsible for maintaining visibility to signs by clearing vegetation that obscures the full view of a sign face. Thoughtful sign placement can reduce the need for vegetation control.
The following guidance will generally provide sign visibility. Greater clearing may be necessary in some situations to achieve full visibility to the sign.

800 feet *Distance is measured in the direction that the sign faces, along the edge of the traveled way. **Width varies. Clear vegetation from edge of pavement to 5 feet beyond the sign edge that is farthest from the roadway, or to the edge of the right of way.
For vegetation control at grade intersections with county roads, the department is only responsible for vegetation within state highway right of way. The county is responsible for the vegetation on their legs of the intersection outside of state highway right of way. For vegetation on private property, the department has no authority to remove or cut back.
Maintenance should try working with the property owner on these vegetation issues.

2-3.5
Sign Storage
Store signs to prevent damage to the sign face. Sign sheeting is damaged by exposure to dirt and water during storage, which can reduce its retroreflectivity. Never store signs lying flat.
Moisture accumulation between signs will cause sheeting failure.
Store all packaged signs on edge and indoors. If packaged signs become wet, unpack them immediately and separate the signs to dry (clothespins work well). Provide ample space between signs to allow free air circulation and moisture evaporation from each sign face.
If outdoor storage is required for short periods, remove all packing materials so nothing is against the sign face. Store signs on edge, separated with clothespins, and set above the ground in a clean area. 2-4
Sign Installation and Maintenance Jurisdiction
Jurisdictional responsibility for traffic control signs (and other traffic control devices) on public highways is assigned through several state statutes. • The department is responsible for erecting and maintaining traffic control signs upon every state highway (RCW 47.36.050) and (WAC 468-18-040). Local jurisdictions are assigned the responsibility to erect and maintain traffic control signs on roadways within their jurisdiction (RCW 47.36.060).

Signs
These responsibilities are further defined: – On limited access roadways, including any interchange cross-streets, the department is responsible for signing (RCW 47.52.020 and RCW 47.24.020(2)).
This can be superseded by an agreement with a local agency that designates other responsibility arrangements (RCW 47.52.090). – Responsibility for signing along city streets that are part of the state highway system is assigned based on the population of the city (RCW 47.24.020(12) and (13)) and is shown in Exhibit 2-4. Population is determined by the Washington State
Office of Fiscal Management and can be found at www.ofm.wa.gov/sites/default/ files/public/dataresearch/pop/april1/ofm_april1_population_final.pdf.
It is important to work with each city to ensure that city signs are not installed on department sign posts and that adequate sign spacing is maintained. The only exception is for STREET NAME signs above a STOP sign. Cities are to obtain approval from the department prior to installing their signs on a state highway (RCW 46.61.085).

Traffic Sign Management System (TSMS)
TSMS is a statewide sign inventory computer program that provides both a complete inventory and a history of maintenance actions for each sign on the state highway system.
The Headquarters and Region Traffic Offices use TSMS to provide accurate records regarding: • Sign location. • Original installation and replacement dates. • Sign message. • Sign size. • Letter height. • Direction of sign face. • Sheeting type and color. • Program Code (What Program – M, Q, or Other paid for the last Maintenance Action). • Maintenance history.
The Region Traffic Offices are the data stewards and are responsible for keeping the TSMS up to date including: • Entering new sign data. • Conducting periodic field inventories. • Inventorying all signs installed by contract. • Updating inventory after construction projects are completed. • Night reflectivity review.
Maintenance personnel in Eastern, Olympic, and South Central regions are responsible for filling out a Sign Activity Report (SAR) that details each activity performed. This provides important history and identifies needed maintenance actions. The SAR is sent to the region
Traffic Office for input into the TSMS. In some regions, maintenance personnel input SAR data directly into TSMS.NET in cooperation with the region Traffic Office.
Regions also provide TSMS reports to Traffic, Maintenance, or other offices as requested.
The Headquarters Traffic Operations Office is responsible for maintaining and updating the TSMS program to meet the department’s business needs, including data storage and selective retrieval of sign inventory and maintenance activity data.

Regulatory Signs
Regulatory signs alert transportation system users to applicable traffic laws or regulations, and provide information and instructions required for compliance. Regulatory signs, whose installation is required for enforcement of a law, are listed in Section 2-6.
All Regulatory sign sizes are per Table 2B-1 in the MUTCD, unless specifically stated otherwise in the Regulatory sign section.

2-7.1
Stop Signs
The department shall install and maintain all STOP (R1-1) signs at the intersections of county roads with state highways (RCW 47.36.100).
The department shall install and maintain all STOP signs at the intersections of city streets with state highways within the corporate limits of cities having populations less than 27,500 (RCW 47.24.020(13)).
STOP signs shall be a minimum 36 × 36 inches on all roadways. A 48 × 48 inch sign may be used on divided highways with at-grade intersections, at ramp terminals, or where otherwise indicated by engineering judgment. On low-volume roads (under 400 ADT), that intersect with a state highway a 30 × 30 inch STOP sign may be used in lieu of 36 × 36 inch
STOP sign.
Existing STOP signs with smaller sign sizes, as described above, may remain in place until they need to be replaced. 2-7.2
Yield Signs
YIELD (R1-2) signs are installed to assign right of way to traffic on certain approaches to an intersection. In addition to guidance in the MUTCD, YIELD signs are installed as follows: • They shall be installed to assign right of way at the entrance to a roundabout intersection per the MUTCD. • They should be installed along freeway or expressway on-ramps where acceleration ramp geometry and/or sight distance do not meet Design Manual minimum standards.
Install the Yield sign so that it is primarily visible only to ramp traffic. • They may be installed at entrances to ramp and at-grade intersections with right turn islands. minimum length for the acceleration lane portion of an on-ramp.

Signs
Speed Limit Signs
SPEED LIMIT (R2-1) signs are installed to display the maximum allowable vehicle speed as established by law or regulation. Install a TRUCKS XX (R2-2) sign below the standard speed limit sign where a special speed limit is mandated for trucks over 10,000 pounds gross weight, or vehicles in combination, or where the maximum speed limit for cars and trucks is different.
Speed limit signs are prominently located for maximum awareness at the following locations: • At the location where a speed limit changes to another. • On the far side of major interchanges or intersections, including between state highways. • At entrances to Washington State and at boundaries of cities and towns. • In rural areas, at 10- to 20-mile intervals.
On conventional roadways, locate a sign for each direction of travel, opposite one another at the speed zone boundary. If existing features prohibit opposite installation, the signs may be offset up to 150 feet in either direction from the speed zone boundary and located a maximum of 300 feet apart. If the signs cannot be installed within these parameters, the speed zone boundary may be changed by the State Traffic Engineer to accommodate sign installation.
On multilane divided highways, install signs on both the right and left sides of the roadway at speed zone boundaries. Confirmation speed limit signs may be installed on the right side only.
On freeways, install signs a minimum of 1,500 feet beyond on-ramp acceleration lanes (MUTCD Section 2E-38). Where interchange ramps are closely spaced, use engineering judgment to determine the most effective intervals for posting speed limit signs. On freeways with three or more lanes in one direction consider installing signs on both the right and left sides of the roadway. Do not place a speed limit sign between a CURVE or TURN warning sign and the roadway curve or turn itself. Adjust the speed limit boundary location if necessary, to avoid this placement.
See Appendix 2-1 for typical Speed Limit sign layout. See Section 2-8.4 for use of the
SPEED REDUCTION (W3-5) warning sign.
See Chapter 6 for information on setting permanent speed limits and Chapter 5 for guidelines on temporary construction zone speed limits.

2-7.4
U-Turn Prohibition & U-Turns Allowed
The MUTCD states that TURN PROHIBITION signs (R3-1 through R3-4, R3-18) shall be installed where U-turns are prohibited. U-turns are allowed where the maneuver can be made safely, without interfering with other traffic, and at least 500 feet from a horizontal or vertical curve (RCW 46.61.295).
On limited access roadways, with median sections, restricted U-turn locations are installed for use by law enforcement, maintenance, and emergency vehicles only (RCW 47.52.120).
Sign these median locations with a NO U-TURN (R3-4) sign.
Page 2-14
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Signs
Chapter 2
U-Turns are allowed at some roadway intersections, both inside and outside of cities and towns. Signing may be installed to designate where U-turns are allowed and that the side street must yield to the U-turn movement. Appendix 2-2 shows typical U-turn signing associated with left turn lanes at signalized intersections.

2-7.5
Two-Way Left Turn Lane
TWO-WAY LEFT TURN ONLY signs may be installed where a lane in the center of a highway is reserved for the use of left-turning vehicles (in either direction) and is not used for passing or overtaking. The post-mounted (R3-9a or R3-9b) or the overhead mounted (R3-9) sign may be used to supplement two-way left turn lane pavement markings. A plaque indicating
BEGIN or END may be mounted above either sign to identify the limits of the two-way left turn area.
Additional WSDOT criteria apply to the use of two-way left turn lane signs: • Install the initial sign near the beginning of the two-way left turn lane and repeat installation as necessary, based on engineering judgment. • BEGIN or END plaques are not installed where a two-way left turn lane is interrupted by left turn channelization on either one or both intersection approaches. 2-7.6
Auxiliary Climbing and Passing Lanes
For sections of state highway that include auxiliary climbing lanes: • Install a TRUCK LANE XXX FEET (R4-6) sign in advance of the climbing lane. • Install a SLOWER TRAFFIC KEEP RIGHT (R4-3) sign near the beginning of the climbing lane. • Install a RIGHT LANE ENDS (W9-1R) in advance of the climbing lane terminus, where spacing allows. • Install a LANE ENDS (W4-2L) sign in advance of the climbing lane terminus. A distance plaque may be installed as a supplement to this sign.
See Appendix 2-3 for signing layout.
For sections of state highway that include auxiliary passing lanes: • Install a PASSING LANE XXX MILES (R4-601) sign ¼ to ½ mile in advance of the passing lane. Show the approximate distance to the passing lane, measured to the nearest ¼ mile. • Install a KEEP RIGHT EXCEPT TO PASS (R4-301) sign at the beginning of the passing lane. • Install a RIGHT LANE ENDS (W9-1R) sign in advance of the passing lane terminus, where spacing allows. • Install a LANE ENDS (W4-2L) sign in advance of the passing lane terminus. A distance plaque may be installed as a supplement to this sign. • An optional NEXT PASSING LANE XXX MILES (R4-602) sign may be installed up to
500 feet beyond the passing lane terminus to show the approximate distance to the next passing lane.
See Appendix 2-4 for signing layout.

Keep Right Except to Pass
The KEEP RIGHT EXCEPT TO PASS sign (R4-301) may be used on multi-lane roadways to remind motorists of state law RCW 46.61.100 which requires vehicles to stay in the right lane of multilane roadways, except to pass. The sign has also been installed at the request of law enforcement agencies to aid their enforcement efforts at specific locations.
Use the following criteria when determining sign locations: • The preferred sign location is in the median. • Signs are not to be placed within ½ mile in advance of an interchange. • Signs are not to be placed through an interchange area. • Signs are not to be placed within 5 miles of each other in the same direction of travel. 2-7.8
Vehicles Over 10,000 lbs. Prohibited in Left Lane
VEHICLES OVER 10,000 LBS. PROHIBITED IN LEFT LANE (R4-302) signs shall be installed on multilane roadways with three or more lanes in one travel direction to remind drivers of large vehicles that they are prohibited from travelling in the left lane per RCW 46.61.100(3) and WAC 468-510-020. 2-7.9
Do Not Enter and Wrong Way Signing
DO NOT ENTER (R5-1) signs shall be installed at every location where traffic is prohibited from entering a restricted roadway. ONE WAY (R6-1) signs are to be installed above DO
NOT ENTER signs. Install WRONG WAY (R5-1a) signs as a supplement to the DO NOT
ENTER signs at each location. WRONG WAY signs are placed further from the crossroad than DO NOT ENTER sign.
Complete WRONG WAY signing for freeway at-grade intersections, interchange ramps, and roundabouts shall be installed as shown in Appendices 2-5, 2-6 and 2-7.

Bicycle and Motorized Foot Scooters Prohibition
As part of vehicular traffic, bicycles are permitted on all state highways except where restricted by regulation (RCW 46.61.160 and WAC 468-58-050).
Additionally, “motorized foot scooters may have access to highways of the state to the same extent as bicycles” (RCW 46.61.710(5)); thus, they are also restricted in the same areas as bicycles. Restrictions are located primarily on limited access freeways, but may be determined for other locations based on an engineering investigation. They are noted at www.wsdot.wa.gov/bike/closed.htm.
Install advance signing to inform bicyclists and motorized foot scooter riders of the upcoming restricted section, and to give alternate route directions. • On the mainline, install a BICYCLES AND MOTORIZED FOOT SCOOTERS MUST
EXIT 1/4 MILE (R5-602) sign in advance of the prohibited area. • Install a BICYCLE AND MOTORIZED FOOT SCOOTERS MUST EXIT (R5- 601 with arrow) sign at the closest off-ramp or intersection in advance of the restricted segment.

Place in advance of the initial turnout. • Install the DELAY OF 5 VEHICLES ILLEGAL (I8-201) sign in advance of each turnout. • Install the SLOW VEHICLE TURNOUT XXX FT/MILE (I8-401) sign in advance of each turnout. • Install a SLOW VEHICLE TURNOUT “arrow” (I8-301) sign at the beginning of each turnout. • NO PARKING (R8-3) or NO PARKING SYMBOL (R8-3A) signs may be installed within the turnout area.
See Appendix 2-9.

2-7.19
Range Area
A RANGE AREA sign (I2-401) shall be installed wherever a state highway enters an open range area, as determined by the local county government (RCW 16.24.060). Repeat signing at points designated by the governing county commissioners and install signs at county boundaries if the range area spans adjoining counties. Some county websites list the designated range areas within their county.
Install the LEAVING RANGE AREA (I2-501) sign where a state highway leaves an open range area. 2-7.20
Unmuffled Compression Brakes
It is against the law to use unmuffled compression brakes (RCW 46.37.395). The department installs signs (R4-605) near border crossings used by trucks, a few miles inside state boundaries and along the ramps to or from weigh stations to inform drivers of this regulation.
When installing a R4-605 use these guidelines to determine spacing between a R4-605 sign and other roadway signing: • On freeway installations, use a minimum spacing of 500 feet. • On multilane high speed roadways with at grade intersections, use a minimum spacing of 400 feet. • On two-lane, high-speed roadways, use a minimum spacing of 300 feet. • On multilane and two-lane, low speed facilities within incorporated areas, use a minimum spacing of 150 feet.
The department will not install these signs on non-access controlled highways within incorporated areas. The local agency may install and maintain such signing.

Compression Brake Prohibition
Signs prohibiting compression brake use may be installed only where a local agency ordinance prohibiting their use has been adopted (RCW 70A.20.060(3)) and where sign spacing is available. The local agency must agree to pay the fabrication, installation, and subsequent maintenance costs.
Install signs (R4-604) before the restricted area as follows: • On limited access routes, install signs beyond major interchanges. Locate between the route marker assembly and the speed limit signs. Where sign space is limited, install below the city entrance marker. • Along non-access controlled routes outside corporate limits, install signs upon leaving corporate limits, and beyond the junction of major intersections, not to exceed one sign every 5 miles. • Along non-access controlled city streets that are also state highways, the local agency may work with the department to install signs about the prohibition.
When installing a R4-604 use these guidelines to determine spacing between a R4-604 sign and other roadway signing: • On freeway installations, use a minimum spacing of 500 feet. • On multilane high speed roadways with at grade intersections, use a minimum spacing of 400 feet. • On two-lane, high-speed roadways, use a minimum spacing of 300 feet. • On multilane and two-lane, low speed facilities within incorporated areas, use a minimum spacing of 150 feet.
Note: Compression brake regulations are noise regulations rather than traffic regulations.
The department does not regulate compression brake use. 2-7.22
Traction Device Requirements for Snow Prone Areas
Install TRACTION DEVICE REQUIREMNTS (R16-2100 Series) signs per RCW 47.36.250 for snow prone areas approaching mountain passes and other areas where snow and ice are prevalent during winter months.

Warning Signs
Warning signs are installed to alert roadway users to unexpected conditions on or adjacent to the roadway that require special attention and that may require a reduction in speed or other action desired from the road users while operating on the roadway. These conditions may include expected presence of pedestrians and/or bicyclists.
Determine the appropriate placement of warning signs based on the MUTCD Guidelines for
Advanced Placement of Warning Signs, Table 2C-4, and on an engineering judgment. The guidelines provide minimum advance placement distances, based on vehicle speeds and location specific conditions.
Warning signs are installed on both sides of the road on multilane divided roadways that have two or more lanes in one direction. Speed limit signs should not be located between any warning sign and the condition warned for, when the warning sign indicates a need to reduce speed.
Warning signs may be supplemented with a warning beacon(s) when additional warning is needed for vehicles approaching a crossing or other locations. Some examples are: midblock crossings; narrow shoulders with bicyclists and/or pedestrians and less than adequate stopping sight distance per MUTCD Section 4L.03.
Yellow is the standard background color for warning signs. Fluorescent yellow/green (FYG) may be used for bicycle, pedestrian, or playground signs where there are an unusual number of conflicts or where greater attention is needed for the sign because of distracting surroundings.

The CURVE (W1-2) sign is used where the engineering and traffic investigation indicates the advisory speed for a horizontal curve to be from 35 mph to 65 mph.
Install the appropriate TURN or CURVE sign where the recommended curve speed is 5 MPH or more below the posted speed limit.
Install a supplemental ADVISORY SPEED PLAQUE (W13-1) below the TURN or CURVE sign if the advisory speed is 5 mph or more below the posted speed limit, or if engineering judgment indicates the need for the sign.
If a supplemental DISTANCE PLAQUE is used, such as beneath a WINDING ROAD (W15L/R) sign, show the distance as a fraction of a mile rather than a decimal (½ mile rather than .5 mile). The fraction is more quickly read and easily understood by the motorists.
The placement of the horizontal alignment signs should be located per MUTCD Table 2C-4.

2-8.2
Hairpin Curve
Install a HAIRPIN CURVE sign (W1-901L/R) where the change in the roadway horizontal alignment is 135 degrees or more, and: • A traffic engineering analysis of roadway, geometric, and operating conditions shows the recommended curve speed to be 30 mph or less. • The recommended curve speed is equal to or less than the posted speed limit.
Install a supplemental advisory speed plaque (W13-1) below the HAIRPIN CURVE sign if an engineering and traffic investigation indicates the need for the sign. Large arrow sign(s) (W1-6) or chevron alignment signs (W1-8) should be used in conjunction with the hairpin curve sign. 2-8.3
Large Arrow
LARGE ARROW (W1-6) signs are used at curves with a curve speed advisory is 15 mph or more below the speed limit, or when a curve is 1200 feet radius or less, or when there is not space to install three chevrons in sequence, or where run off the road crashes have demonstrated an operational deficiency. 2-8.4
Chevron Alignment
CHEVRON ALIGNMENT (W1-8) signs are used to provide emphasis and guidance for a change in horizontal road alignment. When the curve advisory speed is 15 mph or more below the speed limit, CHEVRONS shall be installed.
If used, CHEVRONS shall be installed on the outside of a turn or curve, in line with and at approximately a right angle to approaching traffic. Install a minimum of three signs in a series, with at least two signs visible to the motorist at all times throughout the curve.
They should be installed on circular interchange ramps, or on other curving alignments where run off the road crashes have demonstrated an operational deficiency.

Low Vertical Clearance
For the installation of new low vertical clearance warning signs or the replacement of existing low vertical clearance warning signs shall be as follows:
The maximum legal vehicle height permitted on state highways is 14 feet (RCW 46.44.020).
At the direction of the MUTCD, and through operational experience, a 15-inch buffer (which includes 3 inches for frost heave) has been added to the 14-foot maximum legal height, setting the minimum LOW CLEARANCE signing threshold at 15′3″.
The advance posting of a low vertical clearance is to be consistent with (RCW 46.61.450).
The MUTCD defines “Traveled Way” as the portion of the roadway for the movement of vehicles, exclusive of the shoulders, berms, sidewalks, and parking lanes. The MUTCD defines “Roadway” a portion of a highway improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel and parking lanes, but exclusive of the sidewalk, berm, or shoulder even though such sidewalk, berm, or shoulder is used by persons riding bicycles or other humanpowered vehicles. In the event a highway includes two or more separate roadways, the term roadway as used in this manual shall refer to any such roadway separately, but not to all such roadways collectively. RCW 46.04.500 defines “Roadway” a portion of a highway improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel, exclusive of the sidewalk or shoulder.

The Bridge Office periodically measures vertical clearance heights for bridges and tunnels during inspections. The actual clearance height is to the nearest inch rounded down (actual measurement of 15’ 1-3/4” equals 15’1”). Bridge clearance data is available through the Bridge Engineering Information System (BEIST) at: http://beist/InventoryAndRepair/
Inventory/BRIDGE.
Criteria for new or replacement of existing LOW CLEARANCE (W12-2; W12-301 or W12-302L/R) warning signs: • A bridge or a tunnel is signed for a low vertical clearance of 15’-3” or less, the height on the low vertical warning signs shall be the actual measured opening minus three inches.
Criteria for replacing existing LOW CLEARANCE (W12-2; W12-301 or W12-302L/R) warning signs: • If the actual measured opening for a bridge or tunnel increases by 2” or less the existing signing may remain. (e.g. a bridge clearance changes from 15’-0” to 15’-2”, the existing warning sign of 14’-9” may remain.) • If the actual measured opening for a bridge or tunnel increases by more than 2” the signs shall be replaced. (e.g. a bridge clearance changes from 14’-9” to 15’-0”, the existing warning sign of 14’-6” shall be corrected.) • If the actual measured opening for a bridge or tunnel decreases by 1” or less the existing signs may remain. (e.g. a bridge clearance changes from 15’-0” to 14’-11”, the existing warning sign of 14’-9” may remain.) • If the actual measured opening for a bridge or tunnel decreases by more than 1” the existing signs shall be replaced. (e.g. a bridge clearance changes from 14’-10” to 14’-8”, the existing warning sign of 14’-7” shall be corrected.)

Intersection Warning
The INTERSECTION WARNING (W2 Series) sign indicates the presence of an intersection with the possibility of turning or entering traffic and the possibility of pedestrian/bicyclist crossing at the intersection. Consider installing this sign where the side road approach is not continuously visible to mainline traffic for a minimum distance as shown in MUTCD Table 2C-4, use engineering judgment to place the sign for distance greater than the MUTCD minimums and where any of the following conditions exist: • The intersection is not channelized. • Left-turning vehicles may queue in the traveled lane. • Approach to the intersection does not provide adequate stopping sight distance. • Un-signalized channelized intersections.
Do not use INTERSECTION WARNING signs on approaches controlled by STOP or YIELD signs, or at signalized intersections.
INTERSECTION WARNING signs may be modified to show offset intersection geometrics or approach curves. The relative importance of the roadways may be shown by varying the line widths used.
As guidance to motorists, the INTERSECTION WARNING sign shall be supplemented with the black on yellow ROAD NAME (D3-201) sign. The road name should be upper/ lower case letters. Refer to the MUTCD Section 8B.06, for installation criteria for railroad/ intersection signs, W10-2, W10-3, and W10-4. 2-8.16

Vehicular Traffic Signs
Vehicular traffic signs may be used to alert roadway users to locations where entering traffic would be unexpected; where road users may encounter other modes of transportation in the traveled lanes or on the shoulder; or where sight distance for the road user ahead is restricted. The vehicular traffic signs may be supplemented with an activated flashing beacon(s) when there is sight distance restrictions and/or when there is narrow or no shoulders.
A.

Bicycle – A BICYCLE SYMBOL (W11-1) may be used to alert road users to locations where there is restricted stopping sight distance or where unexpected entries into the roadway by bicyclists may occur, such as at bicycle path crossings. It may also be considered where there are conflicts between users of different modes. Use
Fluorescent yellow green sheeting as the background color in areas where extra attention must be drawn to the crossing, such as urban areas with many distractions.
B.
Bikes on Road – The BICYCLE SYMBOL sign (W11-1) may be used with the BIKES ON
ROAD plaque (W11-101) to alert motorists to narrow shouldered roadway sections where bicyclists may be in the lanes. Use a mileage plaque to inform motorists of the distance they can expect to encounter people biking in the traveled lane. Do not install these signs on highways that have designated bicycle lanes. Consider using these signs on sections of state highway where the paved shoulder width is less than 4 feet and one or more of the following conditions are met: • Average Daily Traffic volume is greater than 1,700 vehicles, based on the WSDOT’s
Traffic Geoportal: www.wsdot.wa.gov/data/tools/geoportal/?config=traffic. • The state highway is part of a recreational or commuter bicycle route that is officially recognized by the department, or a county or regional transportation organization, such as a Regional Transportation Planning Organization or Municipal
Planning Organization. • When there is a history of public complaints, or ongoing operational issues observed by law enforcement and/or department staff. • Install the BICYCLE sign with BIKES ON ROAD plaque in advance of or within the first 300 feet of the narrow shoulder area. If the narrow shoulder distance is between 3 and 8 miles, a reminder sign should be placed at mid-point.
If the mileage distance exceeds eight miles, reminder signs should be placed at 5-mile spacing. • This sign can be modified to read “BIKES ON BRIDGE” and installed at bridge locations where there is inadequate shoulder (less than 4 feet) for bicyclists. • This sign can be modified to say “BIKES ON SHOULDER” and should be installed at the beginning of highway sections where shoulder driving is allowed and there is less than minimum stopping sight distance for vehicles approaching bicyclists on the shoulder.

D.
Fire Station/Emergency Vehicle – FIRE STATION/EMERGENCY VEHICLE (W11-8) signs with the EMERGENCY SIGNAL AHEAD (W11-12P) supplemental plaque shall be placed in advance of all emergency vehicle traffic control signals. The signs may also be installed at locations where there is limited sight distance to the fire station road approach or where the approach is in an area where a motorist would not normally expect to see a fire truck or emergency vehicle enter the roadway. Fire station/ emergency vehicle warning signs are not generally used at intersections, unless an emergency vehicle traffic control signal is present.
E.
Snowmobile – A snowmobile crossing which is located at least 100 feet from any public roadway intersection (RCW 46.10.460) may be signed with SNOWMOBILE (W11-6) signs. This sign is seasonal and should be removed, folded, or covered when the condition does not exist.
F.
Farm Machinery – FARM MACHINERY signs (W11-5, W11-5A) may be installed at locations where farm machinery or equipment enters, crosses, or travels along a roadway and where there is limited sight distance or an operational concern. If the farm machinery will be on the roadway for more than ¼ mile, a supplemental
DISTANCE PLAQUE (W13-401) may be added. Consider sign installation where: • There is limited stopping sight distance to the farm machinery crossing or entrance onto the roadway. • The road user would not normally expect to see a farm vehicle, such as where a farm is operating in an area that has or is being developed for residential or commercial use. • There is less than minimum stopping sight distance to a slow moving vehicle along the roadway. • There is a history of police, farmer, or public complaints, or operational conflicts.
To reduce operational conflicts, work with the farmer to restrict highway driving to daylight hours and non-peak periods, to drive on the shoulder if possible, and to use alternate routes if available.
Farm equipment used on the roadway must be equipped with a reflective hazard triangle sign and a flashing beacon (RCW 46.37.160).

Deer Crossing – Install DEER CROSSING (W11-3) signs to alert motorists when approaching an area where deer or elk may unexpectedly enter the roadway.
Gather information from the following sources when considering sign installation: • Region Maintenance personnel. • WSDOT Headquarters Environmental Services Office, Fish and Wildlife program.
They compile a Wildlife Carcass Removal data base which notes deer and other wildlife killed on state highways. • Records of crashes with wildlife, maintained by the WSDOT Travel and Collision
Data Office. • The Department of Fish and Wildlife’s regional biologists have additional information on concentrations and migratory routes of deer.
Consider the following criteria before installing DEER CROSSING (W11-3) signs: • Minimum of five documented deer/vehicle collisions per mile per year for at least two of the past 10 years. The crash data is available through Cognos. • Minimum of 10 carcass counts per one mile per year for at least three of the past
10 years. The carcass information can be found in HATS, for Choose Type: select
Roadkill from pull down menu, for Activity: select 1671 – Roadkill/Animal Disposal, fill in the begin date and end date, select SR, and fill in Start SRMP and End SRMP. • Concurrence from region maintenance personnel.
Existing DEER CROSSING sign locations should be reviewed every five years.

B.
Cattle Crossing (Livestock) – The CATTLE CROSSING (W11-4) or HORSE CROSSING (W11-7) sign may be used where there are frequent cattle, horse, or other livestock crossings at a specific site. Consider each request based on roadway type, traffic volumes, and number of crossings. A crossing site used once a day would warrant a sign, whereas one used once a month would not.
Cattle signs are not used for the movement of livestock along a highway such as a sheep or cattle drive. Requests for temporary traffic control to accommodate livestock movement are handled by the region on a case by case basis.

Traffic Office should determine appropriate placement of these signs, based on an engineering judgment.
On multilane divided roadways, post signs on both sides of the roadway. 2-8.26
Rocks
The ROCKS sign (W8-1701) may be installed to alert roadway users to roadway sections that are known to have or are subject to frequent rockfall occurrences.
Maintenance crew’s track and input “Roadway Rock Removal” activities into Highway
Activities Tracking System (HATS) https://hats.wsdot.wa.gov/OtherActivityRecords/Records.
The department Material Lab developed a numerical rating system for identifying and ranking unstable slopes and is available at: Unstable Slope information.
When a potential rockfall location has a numerical rating of 200 points or greater, a ROCK sign should be installed. A separate sign is not required at each location if adjacent locations can be combined using a FOR NEXT XX MILES sign.

Signs
Left Turning Vehicles Ahead
The LEFT TURNS AHEAD (W2-601) sign may be used in advance of intersections to alert to possible left turning movement conflicts, as determined by an engineering judgment.
Consider installing this sign at locations where any of the following conditions exist: • The intersection is not channelized. • Left-turning road users with a history of rear-end crashes. • Approach to the intersection does not provide less than minimum stopping sight distance. 2-8.29
Lateral Clearance Markers (Object Markers)
The department installs Type 3 OBJECT/LATERAL CLEARANCE MARKERS (W12-401 L/R) to identify objects or conditions within or adjacent to the roadway such as: • narrow bridges with reduced width shoulders • drop-offs • small traffic islands • underpass piers • bridge abutments • barriers • handrails • culvert headwalls
IMPACT ATTENUATOR MARKERS (W12-501 and W12-502) are used to identify the nose section of an impact attenuator. Install a W12-501 when traffic approaching an attenuator passes only one side of the attenuator. Install a W12-502 when approaching traffic passes on both sides of the attenuator.
MUTCD Section 2C.64 and 2C.65 addresses appropriate use and installation requirements of lateral clearance markers. See Appendix 2-11 and 2-11A.

2-8.30
Water Over Roadway
The WATER OVER ROADWAY (W8-501) sign may be installed where water periodically and consistently accumulates. Hinge the sign to allow crews to open and close it as needed based on field personnel observations in the vicinity of the sign. 2-8.31
Severe Side Winds Ahead
The SEVERE SIDE WINDS AHEAD (W14-801) sign may be installed where geologic or geographic features or other unique situations create unexpected and severe windy conditions that can impact the handling of a vehicle based on engineering judgment.

Watch for Ice
The department no longer routinely uses WATCH FOR ICE (W8-1601) signs. They may be considered in unique conditions such as where a natural or manmade feature causes consistent roadway wetness and where ice is likely to form during cold temperatures.
Examples may include, but are not limited to locations where: • A waterfall causes roadway moisture. • An industrial facility consistently causes spray on the roadway. • There is wetness from short or long-term drainage problems. • Pavement sensors connected to the WATCH FOR ICE sign discern the outside temperature and flash an alert to motorists about the potential of ice on the roadway. • Moisture vapor forms on the highway.
Any decision to post a WATCH FOR ICE sign must be based on a traffic engineering analysis and approved by the State Traffic Engineer, in consultation with the appropriate Region
Traffic Engineer.

2-8.33
Grooved Pavement
Install the GROOVED PAVEMENT sign (W8-2001) where the roadway surface features closely spaced longitudinal grooves. Do not use this sign in areas of rutted pavement.
RCW 47.36.200 notes that where a GROOVED PAVEMENT sign is used, a MOTORCYCLES
USE EXTREME CAUTION (W21-1701) sign must also be used. 2-8.34
School Areas
School related signing is installed to alert motorists to an upcoming school bus stop or school crossing, and the possible presence of children standing near, walking along, or crossing the roadway. Fluorescent yellow-green (FYG) is the standard background color for school signs.
The department is responsible for school bus stop and crossing related signing. Additional signs (such as an overhead School Crossing sign) are generally the responsibility of the school district requesting them. 2-8.35
School Bus Stops
Install a SCHOOL BUS STOP AHEAD (S3-1) sign where there is less than minimum stopping sight distance to the bus stop, or when engineering judgment indicate the need for a warning sign. Where there is less minimum stopping sight distance to the bus stop, it should be relocated if possible to provide ample visibility. All school bus stops requiring an advance school bus stop sign must be reviewed and approved by the Region Traffic Operations staff.
Because of the frequent changes to bus stop locations, they should be reviewed before the start of each school year for possible sign removal or relocation.
The Region Traffic Engineer must approve any school bus stops on limited access facilities (WAC 468-58-030) and provide this information to the State Traffic Engineer who maintains an inventory of the locations.

School Bus Turnaround
The SCHOOL BUS TURNAROUND sign (S3-201) may be installed to alert motorists to an upcoming school bus turnaround location, where minimum sight distance to the turnaround is less than that shown in MUTCD Table 2C-4, or when other operational factors indicate the need for a warning sign. Department policy is to not use the SCHOOL BUS TURN
AHEAD sign as shown in the MUTCD. 2-8.37
Signing for Reduced School Zone Speed Limit
Reduced speed limits in school zones are established in compliance with RCW 46.61.440(1) which establishes a 20 mph speed zone at a marked school or playground crosswalk when the crosswalk is posted with standard school or playground speed limit signing, or on a roadway bordering a school or playground when posted. See Section 6-4 for additional information on reduced school speed zones.
Standard reduced school zone speed limit signing at a marked school or playground crosswalk is shown in Appendix 2-12 and includes: • The SCHOOL (S1-1) sign with AHEAD plaque (W16-9P). • The SCHOOL SPEED LIMIT (S5-101) sign assembly. • The SCHOOL (S1-1) sign with ARROW plaque (W16-7P). • The END SCHOOL ZONE (S5-2) sign with the subsequent SPEED LIMIT (R2-1) sign below.
The SCHOOL SPEED LIMIT (S5-501) sign assembly consists of three sections: • SCHOOL legend (S4-3) with black letters on a fluorescent yellow green background. • 20 MPH SPEED LIMIT sign (R1-1). • WINDOW OF ENFORCEMENT legend.
The enforcement legend is determined by the school district and can be any of the following: • WHEN FLASHING (S5-1) used in conjunction with a flashing beacon above the sign, as described in MUTCD Section 4L.04. • WHEN CHILDREN ARE PRESENT (S5-101) used in conjunction with definitions provided in WAC 392-151-035 and WAC 468-95-350. • WHEN FLAGGED (S5-102) used in conjunction with warning flags that are installed on the sign during the window of enforcement. The school is responsible for installation and removal of the flags. • X:00 A.M. TO X:00 A.M./P.M. (S4-5) used to display the specific hours of the school speed limit.

Chapter 2
Flashing Beacons or Flags
The SCHOOL SPEED ZONE sign assembly may be supplemented with flashing beacons or flags to draw attention and increase compliance with the reduced speed zone. A Washington
State Traffic Safety Commission study noted that WHEN FLASHING school zone signs were more effective in slowing vehicles than either WHEN CHILDREN ARE PRESENT or WHEN
FLAGGED signs. The study notes that where the approach speed to a school speed zone is 35 mph or above, schools with WHEN FLASHING signs had significantly fewer vehicles travelling in excess of 35 mph (only 3 percent) than WHEN CHILDREN ARE PRESENT signs (30 percent) and WHEN FLAGGED signs (23 percent).
On highways where the approach speed to a school speed zone is 35 mph or more, or where a wide roadway increases children’s exposure, consider the use of flashing beacons above the SCHOOL SPEED ZONE assembly. Beacons are generally paid for by the school district requesting the speed zone. 2-8.39
School Crossings
School crossings may be established either adjacent to the school or as part of a school pedestrian route. Install a SCHOOL sign (S1-1) with a Diagonal Arrow plaque (W16-PL) at or near the crossing, and a SCHOOL sign (S1-1) with an AHEAD plaque (W16-9P) in accordance with MUTCD Table 2C-4. • The SCHOOL (S1-1) sign may be installed at a crossing controlled by a traffic signal. • Do not install a SCHOOL (S1-1) sign at an intersection crossing controlled by a STOP or
YIELD sign.

2-8.40
Overhead School Crosswalk Sign
The OVERHEAD CROSSWALK (W11A-301) sign is used only at marked school crosswalks where a traffic engineering study has determined that conventional traffic control measures are not adequate. The sign is installed in addition to the standard school crosswalk signing.
The OVERHEAD CROSSWALK sign must include pedestrian or school activated flashing lights. The MUTCD allows the option to use the STOP FOR PEDESTRIANS overhead sign (R1-9a) instead. Consider these factors when determining installation of this sign: • Approach speed of traffic. • Width of crossing. • Number of lanes.
Costs associated with installing and maintaining this traffic control device generally are the responsibility of the requesting school district.

Guide Signs
Guide signs direct roadway users along roads and highways by providing information about: • Route designation. • Directional and distance information (includes multimodal connections: air, rail, ferries, or transit stations. • Geographical, recreational, or cultural points of interest. • Motorist services.
The department receives frequent requests for guide signs. The quantity and spacing of guide signs is controlled so that the roadway user has adequate time to read, understand, and respond to the sign messages.
The Design Manual notes that guide sign plans are needed for Interstate highways and require Headquarters Traffic approval. Where a highway passes through a national forest or national park, there may be agreements in place that designate which agency is responsible for each sign type, as well as design requirements for signs. Sign design must consider these requirements.
Review sign requests by considering both the MUTCD sign purpose and the sign spacing criteria. Work with local groups to review conflicting requests, and to determine the most essential and effective signing. It may be necessary to remove or relocate existing signs to accommodate the addition of a more important sign, while avoiding sign proliferation.
Guide signs shall not include advertising.

2-9.1
Types of Guide Signs
Guide signs are grouped by their purpose. Their use is determined according to standards and guidance in the MUTCD. • Route Markers display the official highway number or US Bicycle Route number and direction of travel. • Primary Guide Signs include advance directional signs, exit directional signs, diagrammatic signs and pull-through signs. They direct roadway users to exit points for principal destinations served by intersections or interchanges, and to cities located on intersecting state routes. • Distance Signs display distances to destinations and junctions along state routes. • Supplemental Guide Signs provide direction to major traffic generators or other points of interest, or to destinations preempted from the primary guide sign. • Follow-Through Signs provide continued direction, beginning at the point of exit from the state highway, and following through to the destination displayed on the guide sign. • General Motorist Service Signs (MSS) provide information for the unfamiliar traveler about services available at or accessed from upcoming intersections and interchanges. • Motorist Information Signs (MIS) provide information about specific businesses that meet certain service criteria. The MIS program is regulated by RCW 47.36.310,
RCW 47.36.320, and WAC 468-70.

Chapter 2
Where sign space is available, guide signs on expressways or freeways generally include: • One or two advance directional signs where interchange spacing allows. • An exit directional sign. • One supplemental guide sign, installed approximately halfway between the advance directional and exit directional sign. It is only installed if spacing requirements can be met.
MUTCD minimum spacing requirements between directional guide signs are: • 800 feet for freeway and expressways. • 500 feet for two-lane, high-speed roadways. • 300 feet for high speed multilane with at-grade intersections • 200 feet for two-lane and multilane low speed highways within incorporated areas.

2-9.2
Guide Sign Color
Guide signs are generally white letters on a green background. However, some types of signs use other background colors to distinguish the type of destination to which they are signing.
Following are standard guide sign background colors: • Brown – Heritage Markers, State Parks, National parks, U.S. Forest Service facilities,
Department of Natural Resources campgrounds, Recreation Activity signs with symbols,
Watchable Wildlife, State Public fishing areas. • Blue – Motorist Service signs (MSS), Motorist Information signs (MIS), Washington
State Patrol, fire district boundary, fish related signs. • Green – All other guide signs. 2-9.3
Guide Signs On Conventional Roads
Install guide signs in accordance with guidelines in MUTCD Chapter 2D. Guide sign installation for route intersections is shown in Appendix 2-13 for: • Junctions of state highways. • Junctions of county roads or city streets that lead to significant destinations. 2-9.4
Guide Signs On Expressways and Freeways
Install guide signs in accordance with guidelines in MUTCD Chapter 2E. Guide sign installation illustrations are shown in Appendices 2-14 through 2-22 for: • Crossroad Interchange Approach (Appendix 2-14) • Expressway Intersection Approach (Appendix 2-15) • Expressway Interchange Approach (Appendix 2-16) • Freeway Interchange Approach (Appendix 2-17) • Freeway Exit Ramp (Appendix 2-18) • Freeway Post Interchange (Appendix 2-19) • Auxiliary Freeway Lane – Less than ¼ mile long (Appendix 2-20) • Parallel On Connection – More than ¼ mile long (Appendix 2-21) • Auxiliary Freeway Lane – More than ¼ mile long (Appendix 2-22)

Route Signs
A route sign assembly consists of a route sign and auxiliary signs that further identify the route and indicate direction of travel. For conventional roadways, MUTCD Section 2D.29 through 2D.32 provide guidance for the various types of route sign assemblies.
For expressways and freeways, route sign assemblies are typically used for route confirmation and trailblazing purposes. In addition to the guidance provided in MUTCD
Section 2E.25, install route confirmation sign assemblies at these locations: • Entrances to Washington State. • Beyond interchanges. • On the far side of intersections with other numbered routes or major local roads. • Beyond city limits.
In urban and residential areas, install route confirmation sign assemblies at intervals that will keep an unfamiliar motorist informed of the route. Note that where interchanges and intersections are closely spaced and available sign space is limited, speed limit signs are a higher priority than route confirmation sign assemblies. 2-11
Primary Guide Signs

2-11.1
General
Advance directional, exit directional, diagrammatic, and pull-through signs are all considered primary guide signs that provide guidance to the motorist about destinations served by upcoming exits or intersections. The MUTCD defines the required and allowable numbers of guide signs for the various roadway types and interchange classifications. Information is also provided about installation, location, and letter/legend criteria for these signs.
On Conventional roads, a maximum of three lines of destinations may be displayed on a primary guide sign (MUTCD Section 2D.07). On Freeways/ Expressways, a maximum of two destinations may be displayed on a primary guide sign (MUTCD Section 2E.10). A sign support having two or more signs may display a maximum of three destinations. Display the same message on all advance and exit directional signs installed in a series. This provides consistent and effective information to the roadway user, especially the unfamiliar traveler.
Department guidelines require that any freeway exit that is a left-hand rather than righthand exit must be signed with a yellow LEFT EXIT plaque on both the advance directional and the exit directional sign.

WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Signs 2-11.2
Chapter 2
Destination Selection
Display the primary destination(s) served by the upcoming exit or intersection and a second destination using the prioritized list below.
Consider: • The control city along the intersecting route. • A junction with another numbered highway. • The name of a city or town (when multiple cities are requesting to be added; choose a city with the largest population). • A tribal reservation. • A street name or roadway name. • Other major destination such as mountain passes, National Parks, or major airports.
Apply the same destination selection criteria for signs on all conventional roads, expressways, and freeways. As development occurs, it may be necessary to replace existing destinations with ones that have become more essential.
Ventures operated by private entities for profit, and to other ventures not of general interest to the traveling public are not signed on guide signs on state highways. These entities may instead qualify for Motorist Service Signs (MIS), Tourist Activity signs, or Recreation signing.
Current ventures must be signed under the new criteria when the current sign service life is over. Shopping malls that qualify for signing under RCW 47.36.270 are an exception and may be signed on primary or supplemental guide signs.

2-11.3
Control City on Destination Signing
A control city is used on guide signs at junctions with other highways (MUTCD Chapter 2D).
The designated control city for selected state routes is shown as follows:

Distance Signs 2-12.1
General
A distance sign can display up to three destinations (MUTCD Chapter 2D). Apply the same destination selection criteria for signs on all conventional roads, expressways, and freeways. • On the first line, identify the next city with services available, or the next intersected numbered route. • On the second line, if used, identify communities of general interest along the route.
Vary the named community on successive distance signs to provide maximum information to the traveler. • On the third or bottom line, display the next control city along the route or terminal destination.
Install distance signs at the following locations: • Beyond intersections and interchanges of numbered state highway routes. • Beyond city limits or urban boundaries. • In rural areas at 10- to 15-mile intervals. • At entrances to Washington State.
Where two or more of these locations occur within 10 miles, sign the most effective location.

2-12.2 2-13
Determining Mileage Displayed on Distance Signs
A.
Freeways and Expressways – Display the distance (in miles) from the sign to either the first interchange/intersection within the destination city limits, or to the city center.
Regions must work with city administration to determine the preferred city center reference location.
B.
Conventional Highways – Display the distance in miles from the sign to the destination city limits. For destinations such as Mt. Rainier National Park, display the distance to the park boundary.
Supplemental Guide Signs 2-13.1
General
Supplemental guide signs direct unfamiliar motorists to additional destinations or points of interest that are not displayed on the primary guide signs. The MUTCD allows only one supplemental guide sign to be installed for each interchange approach and it shall display a maximum of two destinations. Supplemental guide signs shall be installed only when MUTCD minimum spacing requirements can be met.
Supplemental guide signs should not be installed for a traffic generator that would require a motorist to travel on the interchanging road beyond a second state highway (i.e., I-5 to
SR 18 to SR 164).

Page 2-46
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Signs
Chapter 2
In general, destinations that generate the greatest traffic volume or have the widest scope of recognition are given highest priority. Nationally recognized traffic generators receive priority over those that have state, regional, or local recognition. Evaluate the given interchange and select the destinations that provide the most benefit to the highway user.
As development occurs, it may be necessary to replace existing destinations with ones that have become more essential. 2-13.2
Destination Selection Factors for Supplemental Guide Signs
Apply the destination selection criteria equally, whether the signs are on conventional roads, freeways, or expressways. Consider the following factors when evaluating a supplemental sign request: • On an expressway or freeway, determine if the destination meets criteria contained in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) publication Guidelines for the Selection of Supplemental Guide Signs for Traffic Generators
Adjacent to Freeways Fifth Edition. • State law mandates destination signing for State Parks and regional shopping centers when distance criteria are met. • Consider how the proposed signing will affect local roadway traffic operations. Work with the local agency to determine the route to a destination and the sign locations. In general, sign to the supplemental destination from the interchange or intersecting road that provides the most direct route to the destination. • Determine if follow-through signing is needed and work with the local agency to determine sign locations. Local agencies assume responsibility for sign installation and maintenance and must concur with any proposed signs. • Avoid signing to destinations that require complex navigation on multiple highways, unless the activity is of national significance. 2-13.3
Destination Selection Priorities
A.

Overflow Messages From Primary Guide Signs – Occasionally, essential messages cannot be included on primary guide signs due to space limitations. Instead, place these essential messages on supplemental guide signs, giving them priority over any other supplemental sign messages.
B.
Destinations Mandated by Statute 1.
State Parks – State law (RCW 47.36.290) directs the department to install guide signing on interstate highways to State Parks located within 15 miles of the highway. These destinations have first priority on supplemental guide signs on interstate highways. Additionally, WSDOT policy is to install guide signs to a State
Park within 15 miles of any state highway.
The department installs and maintains these signs and provides follow through signing on any state route that connects the state highway to the park. All State
Park signs shall have white letters, symbols, and border on a brown background.
The State Parks and Recreation Commission is responsible for any State Park signing not located on a state highway.

Signs a.
Freeway and Expressway Interchanges
Mainline – Install signs displaying the name of the STATE PARK and a directional message, such as NEXT EXIT, in advance of the interchange, located to meet guide sign spacing requirements. If the park has restricted hours or days of operation, add a supplemental plaque displaying the operating schedule (i.e., CLOSED TUESDAYS) below the STATE PARK sign.
No other supplemental plaques are used on the freeway mainline sign. Do not install mainline signing until all follow through signing is in place.
Ramp – Install signs displaying the message STATE PARK and a directional message, with a maximum of four recreational symbol plaques. Display the mileage to the park from the ramp terminal, using ¼ mile increments if the distance is less than 1 mile. b.
Conventional Roadway Intersections – Install signs displaying the name of the STATE PARK and a directional message (NEXT RIGHT/NEXT LEFT) in advance of the intersection leading most directly to the park. Install a maximum of four recreational symbol plaques below.
Install a white on brown sign with the message STATE PARK (D1-101) and a directional arrow at the intersection of a state route and roadway leading to a state park. Display the mileage to the park from the intersection. Use ¼-mile increments if the distance is less than 1 mile. c.
Recreational Symbol Plaques – A maximum of four recreational symbol plaques may be displayed under a state park directional sign, on both conventional roads and on freeway off-ramps. • Plaques are 24 inch × 24 inch with white message on a brown background. • If the park does not have camping facilities, display the text message NO
CAMPING as one of the recreational plaques. • If a park has restricted hours or days of operation, display the operating schedule (i.e., CLOSED TUESDAYS) as one of the plaques. • The park manager for each individual park will determine the additional supplemental symbols to be displayed. • If a BEACH message is to be shown, use a text message plaque instead of a symbol. • Before replacing any state park sign, contact the park manager, to determine if any plaque changes are needed. • If the symbols are seasonal, a written agreement is developed between the state park manager, the local maintenance superintendent, and region
Traffic Operations. The agreement outlines who will be responsible for changing the symbols, at what specific time periods, as well as any cost reimbursement that may be involved. • Headquarters Traffic Office maintains an inventory of the recreational symbols used at each state park. Inform Headquarters Traffic when symbol plaques are changed, added, or removed.

Additional Signs – CAMPGROUND FULL signs may be used at offramps and on conventional highways in conjunction with a State Park directional sign. It can be either a post mounted stand-alone sign or a changeable message plaque under the ramp or conventional highway sign.
CAMPGROUND FULL signs may not be displayed on a freeway mainline.
A written agreement is developed between the state park manager, the local maintenance superintendent, and region Traffic Operations. The agreement outlines who will be responsible for changing the CAMPGROUND FULL sign, and for the sign fabrication, installation, maintenance, and removal. State

Destination Selection Requirements and Installation Details for Specific
Types of Traffic Generators
Specific traffic generators (destinations) must meet the criteria listed below to warrant a message on a supplemental guide sign. Appendix 2-23 contains the criteria for freeway installations in a table format. Supplemental guide signing shall be installed in accordance with the specific details shown below. 2-14.1
Airports
Airports are eligible for signing if they are included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport
Systems and meet these criteria: • Associated with an area population of 10,000 or more. • Located within 5 miles of interchange or intersection. • Airport runway shall be paved, lighted and 2,500 feet or more in length. • Municipally or privately owned, and used for commercial enterprise with the following minimum number of regularly scheduled commercial flights per day: • 35 flights per day in major metropolitan area (greater than 50,000). • 20 flights per day in an urban area (5,000-49,999). • 15 flights per day in rural areas.
Contact the WSDOT Aviation Division to determine if a specific airport meets these criteria.
Airports that have scheduled flights can be signed with the airport name.
All other airports are signed with the airport symbol or word message.
Airports at remote locations serving a smaller population may be signed when their location is not obvious from the state highway, even if there are no commercial flights.
Existing signs to airports that do not meet these criteria may remain in place until a higher priority destination warrants a supplemental sign.

2-14.2
Amtrak/Other Passenger Rail Stations
Install Amtrak logo signing to Amtrak stations as described below. For other types of rail passenger stations such as those of a Public Transit Authority, a specific logo may be cooperatively developed with Public Transit Authority and department approval, and installed as described below.
A.
Conventional Roadways • Use Amtrak symbols or other approved logo signs in the trailblazer format with the appropriate directional arrows.

B.

Multilane Highways • If there is enough space to install an individual sign, the Amtrak symbol plaque or other approved logo may be placed on a green background panel with either of these messages: NEXT RIGHT or EXIT XXX (Appendix 2-24, part a). • If there is not enough space to install an individual sign, the Amtrak symbol plaque or approved logo sign may be installed below the advance exit or the exit directional sign, on the post closest to the traveled way (Appendix 2-24, part b). • If the sign cannot be installed as above, the Amtrak symbol plaque or approved logo sign may be installed below the supplemental guide sign, on the post closest to the traveled way (Appendix 2-24, part c). • Install Amtrak trailblazer signs or other approved logo signs along freeway ramps or at ramp terminals. All trailblazer signs must be in place before any mainline signs are installed. • The Amtrak symbol plaque or other approved logo sign may be installed as part of a multi-modal transportation logo board, along with approved symbols for other modes of transportation. 2-14.3
Business Route
BUSINESS ROUTE signs (M4-3) direct motorists to alternate routes passing through the business portion of a city or through a district of continuous business development.
BUSINESS ROUTE signing is generally installed at the request of a local agency.
Any addition or deletion of an Interstate or US highway segment as a Business Route must first be approved by AASHTO. Proposals to add or delete such routes should be sent to the department’s Transportation Data GIS & Modeling Office (TDGMO).
Designated Business Routes may be signed as follows: • Install signing on a state highway business route only if it passes adequately and logically through a business district. • BUSINESS LOOP (M1, 2, or 3) trailblazers along the route are installed and maintained by the local agency which has jurisdiction over the business route. A written agreement clarifies the jurisdiction. 2-14.4
Colleges and Universities
Supplemental signing may be considered for a State College or University, their satellite campuses, other regional public or private colleges and universities, and technical schools if they meet the guidelines below and if sign spacing requirements can be met.
Signing is installed from the state highway nearest the campus and is limited to the nearest and most direct interchange or intersection. Signing may also be installed from a freeway or expressway to a conventional state highway where the conventional highway is used primarily by local traffic. Signing is not provided from a freeway or expressway to another freeway or expressway.

Chapter 2
Supplemental signing may be installed when: • The school is accredited in Washington State. Accredited schools are listed on the
Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU) agency website at www.nwccu.org. • The main or satellite campus is located within 5 miles of a state highway. • Enrollment criteria are met. Call the Higher Education Coordinating Board at 360- 7537800 for the current enrollment figures.
Enrollment criteria (including part time and full time) based on any semester or quarter within the last school year: • 4,500 students in a major metropolitan area (50,000 or greater). • 2,500 students in an urban area (5,000-49,999). • 1,000 students in a rural area.
In metropolitan and urban areas where two or more colleges or universities share a common campus, enrollments may be combined. The enrollment for the minor school should be at least 1,000 students. Metropolitan and urban area boundaries can be determined from the state urban boundary map.
If school enrollment falls below the minimum number for one year, the school will be given written notice that the highway signing will be removed if the following fall semester or quarter enrollment does not reach the minimum number.
Two schools may not share the same sign, if they do not share a common campus. If two schools are located in the same area, but do not share a common campus, determine which school is shown on the sign by the following order of priority: • State university. • State college. • Private university or college. • Technical college or school.
University Mascot Logos – At a University’s request, a University mascot logo may be installed on guide signs under the following conditions: • It is a State University. • The university name is already displayed on the guide sign. • Mascot logos may be added only on signs for main campuses. • The university must supply the logos and pay all costs including engineering, fabrication, installation, and traffic control. • Maximum logo size is 30″ × 30″.
If there is insufficient space to display a mascot logo on the sign face, the logo will be installed directly above the upper left-hand corner of the guide sign. If the university wants the logo incorporated onto the face of the guide sign, they have the option of paying for a complete new guide sign to include the logo.
When the guide sign is due for replacement, it may be enlarged to incorporate the mascot logo onto the sign face at no cost to the university.

Natural, Historic, and Cultural Attractions
A.

General Criteria – Consider supplemental guide signing to natural, historic, and cultural attractions if the attraction meets guidelines shown below, but only where MUTCD sign spacing guidelines can be met. Signing is not provided if the attraction is readily visible from and has direct access to the state highway. Privately operated commercial attractions (i.e., Wild Waves) are signed as part of the Motorist Information Sign (MIS) program as a Tourist Activity.
Periodic reviews by region personnel confirm that signing is displayed only for attractions that meet eligibility criteria and that signs are removed or covered when the attraction is closed for the season, no longer meets criteria, or is no longer in operation. Reviews may also identify new attractions that meet eligibility criteria.
Natural, historic, and cultural attractions must meet the following general criteria to be considered for supplemental signing: • The attraction must have regional or national significance and meet destination or traffic generator guidelines. Do not sign attractions that are primarily of local interest. • The attraction must be located within 10 miles of the interchange or intersection being signed. Signing is installed only on the state highway nearest to the attraction.
Any necessary follow-through signing shall be in place prior to installing state highway signs.
Page 2-54
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Signs
Chapter 2 • The attraction must be open without appointment to the general public. • Attractions must be accessible by a two-lane, all-weather road as a minimum. • The attraction must be maintained in good repair and presented in a professional manner. • If the attraction charges an entrance fee, the activity is responsible for all costs for fabrication, installation, maintenance and replacement. A co-signed agreement with the business or organization establishes the approximate costs and payment method. Examples are Fort Vancouver Historic Site and Maryhill Museum. • If the activity is operated by a governmental agency or organization, the department will install the signs at no cost to that agency or organization. • The signs shall be white letters on a green background. This color change increases the reflective service life of the signs. All existing white on brown signs should be replaced with white on green as normal service life expires. Signing for Heritage
Markers, State Parks, National Parks, or U.S. Forest Service facilities will remain white on brown. • For attractions located more than 1 mile from the interchange or intersection, display mileage information on the ramp terminal or direction signs. • For seasonal operations, signs must be removed or covered with a CLOSED plaque during the off season. See Exhibit 2-1 for example
B.

Natural Attractions – In addition to the general criteria above, consider signing to natural attractions if they are unique or of a type not generally accessible to the public.
Examples of natural attractions are the Snoqualmie Falls, Palisades Rock Formation, the Ice Caves west of Trout Lake, Hurricane Ridge, and the Snake River Canyon.
C.
Historic Attractions – In addition to the general criteria above, historic attractions may be considered for signing if: • They are included in the National Register of Historic Places or the Washington
Heritage Register as designated and maintained by the Washington State
Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation. • The attraction includes one or more of the following features at the site: a.
An interpretive center and/or a guided tour. b.
Visible historic buildings, features, or ruins with interpretive markers.
Examples of historic attractions are the Whitman Mission, Steptoe
Battlefield, Jackson House, Fort Simcoe, and the Monticello Convention
Site. The application form (Appendix 2-24) may be used to document if the attraction meets the eligibility criteria.
Determine if the attraction is included on the National Register of Historic
Places or the Washington Heritage Register at: https://wisaard.dahp.wa.gov.

Examples of cultural attractions are the Maryhill Museum, St. Mary’s Mission, the
Forest Learning Center near Mount St. Helens, and the Goldendale Observatory. The form in Appendix 2-25 may be used as an application for cultural attractions. 2-14.8
Heritage Markers
HERITAGE MARKER signs (I5-103/104) guide motorists to historical or other interpretive markers located along state highways (see Section 7-11). They are used where there is a marker but no building or other facility. Use both the advance sign as well as the “at point” sign to give adequate guidance and time for a motorist response. HERITAGE MARKER signs are white on a brown background and replace existing HISTORIC MARKER and ROADSIDE
ATTRACTION signs. Examples of HERITAGE MARKER sites include Willy Keil’s Grave, the
Bridge of the Gods, and Earthquake Point north of Entiat.
Do not use a HERITAGE MARKER sign to direct motorists to a historical site on either the national or state registers. These sites are signed using Historical attraction criteria and signing.

2-14.9
Ports/Port Districts
Supplemental guide signing to Ports, or Port Districts may be considered if sign space is available per the MUTCD, using the following criteria: • The facility is served by two or more modes of transportation and is generating commercial traffic. • Goods move in and out of the facility.

Tribal Signing
A.
Reservation Boundary Signing – ENTERING/LEAVING and (NAME OF) RESERVATION signs may be installed at reservation boundaries where the state highway passes through a tribal reservation. The boundary limits indicated are to be the original treaty boundary limits. If the reservation has a “patch work” boundary layout, place the boundary signs to encompass the entire patch work layout rather than installing individual sets of signs for each boundary crossing location. Signs shall be white letters on a green background.
B.

Directional/Distance Signing – As sovereign nations, a tribal reservation may be considered as a primary or supplemental destination along with other local jurisdictions (a city or town). Tribal logos may be incorporated on directional signs. Any wording that refers to or implies a commercial enterprise is not allowed. Directional and distance signs shall be white letters on a green background.
Signing may be from one state highway to another if sign space is available. Ramp follow-through signing should show the mileage if the reservation is more than 1 mile away. Additional signing for the Tribal Center or Community Center may be considered at the nearest and most direct interchange or intersection, if it meets heritage, cultural, historic, or museum criteria.
Examples: (NAME OF) RESERVATION
NEXT RIGHT or “X” Miles (NAME OF) TRIBAL CENTER
NEXT RIGHT or “X” Miles
Tribal logo may be incorporated into the guide sign. The maximum logo size is 30″ x 30″. The logo shall show the shape and color both day and night.
If there is insufficient space to display a tribal logo on an existing sign face, the logo will be installed directly above the upper left-hand corner of the guide sign. If the Tribe wants the logo incorporated onto the face of the guide sign, they have the option of paying for a complete new guide sign to include the logo.
When the guide sign is due for replacement, it may be enlarged to incorporate the tribe logo onto the sign face at no cost to the Tribe.
C.
Tribal Language Signs – Tribal Governments have requested certain traffic signs display both English and their tribal language on roads and highways that traverse tribal lands. WSDOT worked with the Washington Indian Transportation Policy Advisory
Committee (WITPAC) to develop this signing program.
Information about the meanings of the words on the signs will be publicly available on the WSDOT Tribal Liaison webpage www.wsdot.wa.gov/tribal after the signs are installed.
Tribal Governments may request dual language signing on jurisdictional boundary and geographic features signs on or adjacent to tribal lands roadways under WSDOT jurisdiction. The following is the WSDOT’s guidance on the display of both the English and tribal language on traffic signs.

WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10
Page 2-59 Chapter 2
Signs
The display of both the English and tribal languages on a single sign or sign assembly may be approved by WSDOT, based on the following guidelines:
Page 2-60 1.
Requests may include any jurisdictional boundary (WA MUTCD Section 2H.04
County/City Name Marker Signs) or geographic features (WA MUTCD Section 2H.04 Lake and Stream) signs include the following signs: Reservation Boundary signs, City entrance signs, County line boundaries and bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, streams, or creeks when that body of water is crossed by the state highway by the use of a bridge or the body of water is visible to the motorist.
A letter of concurrence from the City or County is required for city entrance signs or county boundary signs. The letter of concurrence needs to specify that they are in agreement that both languages be displayed and identify the placement, above or below, of each language. 2.
Such signs shall be limited to locations on or adjacent to tribal lands.

3.
The sign message shall be tribal language as specified by the requesting Tribal
Government. 4.
Tribal languages shall not be displayed on any other sign including, but not limited to, Regulatory, Warning (including School Zone), and all other Guide (including
Destination, Mileage, Street Name, General or Specific Service (Logo Signs),
Tourist-Oriented Directional (Specific Service Signs), Scenic Byway Routes, and
Acknowledgment) signs. 5.
Tribal language signs may be installed on conventional highways, but not on freeway or expressway type highways. Freeways are high speed highways that have entrance and exit ramps. Examples include I-5, I-90, I-405, I-705, I-205, I-82,
I-182, SR 520, SR 16, SR 167, SR 512 and others. Expressways are generally high speed 4-lane divided highways like SR 8 between Olympia and Aberdeen, parts of US 101, US 97 and US 12. Three sections of Expressways that are on or next to Tribal lands: US 97 from Union Gap to Toppenish, SR 20 from Anacortes to I-5 and US 101 near Kamilche. 6.
Such signs shall be post mounted on WSDOT approved crashworthy roadside sign structures and not be overhead installations.

7.
Installation of the signs shall not interfere with the placement of any other necessary signing and shall not compromise the safety or efficiency of traffic flow. The signing shall be limited to one sign at an appropriate location in each route direction. 8.
All letters and numerals displayed on the sign for the main characters of the tribal language shall be as provided in the Standard Highway Signs and Markings reference publication. Unique characters that are necessary for the proper translation, but not provided in the FHWA Standard Alphabets, may be used.
These unique characters are to be kept to a minimum and shall be based on the characteristics of the letter forms of the Standard Alphabets, such as stroke width and arc, to the extent practicable.

Process Overview 1.
The Tribal Government will request signs through the WSDOT HQ Traffic
Operations Office.

2.
The Tribe will include the following items with the request: 3. a.
Submittal Letter b.
Documentation that illustrates action of approval by the Tribal Government to request signs. For example, letter from Tribal Chair or Tribal Council Resolution. c.
Letter of concurrence from the City or County is required for any requested city entrance signs or county boundary signs. The letter or concurrence needs to specify that they are in agreement that both languages be displayed and identify the placement, above or below, of each language. d.
List of requested signs as entered into the spreadsheet: Tribal Language Signs. xlsx. Because of the length of some tribal words, some signs could be very large unless the word or phrase is separated onto two lines. Where possible, recommend where the word or phrase can be separated onto two lines without changing the meaning. e.
If possible, submit electronically the spreadsheet referenced above to the
WSDOT Traffic Office so information can be added to the spreadsheet as described below.
The WSDOT Regional Traffic Office will provide the following information back to the Tribe: a.
Sign Panel designs (PDF)

b.
Completed spreadsheet: Tribal Language Signs.xlsx c.
Cost estimate for each sign fabrication and installation according to WSDOT
Traffic Operations Office. d.
J-agreement for cost reimbursement, sign design, location, sign maintenance and replacement. 4.
The Tribe will review the sign panel designs for accuracy. If there are errors in the sign design, the Tribe should contact the Regional Traffic Office with revisions. Once the tribal sign design is approved, the Tribe will send the WSDOT Traffic Office a completed agreement and payment. 5.
When the completed agreement and payment are received, signs will be ordered for fabrication and installation. 6.
If the sign needs to be replaced because it is damaged, the replacement cost will be the responsibility of the Tribe. 7.
The WSDOT Regional Traffic Office will send the completed spreadsheet to the
WSDOT Tribal Liaison who will make the English words, the tribal language words, and the English translation of the tribal words, and a phonetic representation of the words available on the WSDOT Tribal Liaison website.

Sign Panel Design 1.
The tribal language may be placed above the English language on a case by case basis.
Both language are upper lower case lettering. 2.
Due to the length of some tribal words and phrases it is recommended to use the highway font Series D instead of E Mod. Series D is a similar font to E Mod but has less breadth to the letters by approximately 35 percent. By using the Series D font and one inch less than the standard font height, the overall width of the signs when placing the tribal language on two lines should in most cases fit on U channel post sign structures.
If the word or phrase cannot be displayed on two lines the overall size of the sign may require a larger sign structure. This will increase the cost of the sign. 3.
The I3-101 (Body of water) and I2-501 (County boundary) sign will include the tribal language in Series D, 6-inch font and the English language in E Mod, 6-inch font.

4.
The I2-301 (City Entrance Signs) will include the tribal language in Series D, 8-inch font and the City Name with the English language in E Mod, 8-inch font.

Follow-Through Signing
Follow-through signing provides motorists (after being directed off the state highway) with confirmation to destinations. Signs are installed and maintained by the agency responsible for the local roadway and must be in place before any directional signs are installed on the state highway.
When considering a destination for a supplemental guide sign, determine whether the local agency will install follow-through signing on the local roadway and coordinate the signing plan with them. Provide MUTCD guidelines for follow- through sign sizing to local agencies.
Use 6-inch D series letters in high traffic volume or high speed areas. Use 5-inch C series letters, as a minimum, on lower volume or slower speed roadways. Include directional information or arrows as part of the legend.
Install follow-through signing in advance of decision points where route changes are required. Additional trailblazer signs may be placed at mandatory stop locations, but do not install these signs in combination with regulatory or warning signs. 2-17
General Service Signs 2-17.1
General
The MUTCD directs States to establish signing guidelines for several types of general services. Install GENERAL SERVICE signs where the services are not readily apparent to travelers and where they meet the criteria noted below.
Do not combine GENERAL SERVICE signing and MOTORIST INFORMATION (MIS LOGO) signs on the same back panel. If a specific MIS back panel is in place do not also install
GENERAL SERVICE signs for that service. (e.g., if a FOOD back panel exists then a general
MSS food sign will not be installed). A specific business can join the MIS program instead.
Periodic reviews by region personnel confirm that signing is displayed only for services and facilities that meet eligibility criteria and that signs are removed or covered when the service or facility is closed for the season or no longer in operation.

A separate word message VISITOR INFORMATION sign may be installed under the
GENERAL SERVICE sign.
When services are not readily visible from an interchange, install follow-through signs at ramp terminals, using the same legends or symbols as on the mainline signs. If the services are located more than 1 mile from the interchange or intersection, display the distance to the services on the ramp terminal or direction sign respectively.
Signs have white symbols or letters on a blue background.
GENERAL SERVICE plaques may be installed in conjunction with other guide signs: • On ground mounted signs, install the plaque on either post below the sign. • If more than two GENERAL SERVICE plaques are required, place them on a bracket below the guide sign, in a manner that does not interfere with the breakaway safety features of the sign structure. • On overhead signs, a GENERAL SERVICE plaque is installed above the guide sign.
The department uses the following criteria to determine if a general service sign is warranted. The State Traffic Engineer can approve minor deviations on a case-by-case basis.

Other Essential Guide Signs 2-18.1
Street Name and Advance Street Name Signs
STREET NAME (D3 Series) signs are useful navigational tools for the roadway user and are installed at roadway intersections. Street name signs are white letters on a green background. Upper and lower case letters are used.
Signs showing the historical street name may be used in conjunction with a current street name sign. All costs associated with the historic street name shall be the responsibility of the local agency making the request.
Page 2-70
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Signs
Chapter 2
In urban areas, STREET NAME signs are installed at the intersection. For significant cross streets, channelized intersections, and at signalized intersections, ADVANCE STREET NAME signs should also be installed. Place them 200 feet or more in advance of intersections to alert motorists to the upcoming roadway and the possibility of turns or lane changes, etc.
A directional chevron may be used on the street name sign indicating the direction of the side street.
In rural areas, where a county road intersects the state highway, a STREET NAME sign identifying the state route is installed above the state installed STOP sign. The county is responsible for the original installation, and the department maintains these signs.
Where ADVANCE INTERSECTION WARNING signs are used, (primarily in rural or suburban areas) it is WSDOT policy to install the black on yellow ROAD NAME (D3-201) sign above or below the INTERSECTION WARNING sign.
On city streets that are part of state highways, the local agency shall install and maintain street signs within the corporate limits (RCW 47.24.020). Use this table to determine appropriate letter size for street name signs:

City Center
Historically, the department has provided CITY CENTER signs at the request of local governments, to direct motorists to local government buildings (i.e., city hall, courthouse).
Currently, requests for CITY CENTER signs often come from local business communities to direct motorists to business areas within a city.
CITY CENTER signing requests should include the following information: • Description and location of all city center exits within the corporate limits. • The interchange or intersection name of the proposed sign location. • Verification of local agency agreement on the location of the city center.
When reviewing CITY CENTER signing requests, conduct a field review to determine the effectiveness and feasibility of sign locations and confirm other details of the request letter.
Include the local government, business community, and other interested groups to assure agreement on the location of the city center.
All costs for sign fabrication and installation are the responsibility of the city making the signing request.

Milepost Markers
MILEPOST MARKERS are numbered location markers installed along all state highways and used primarily for reference purposes. The Statewide Travel and Collision Data
Office establishes each milepost location, which is signed with a MILEPOST MARKER in accordance with the following criteria (adopted from rescinded department Directive
D32-20). • On two-lane roadways, install the double-faced MILEPOST MARKER (D10-101,
D10-102, and D10-103) on the right side of the roadway, in the direction of increasing milepost. • On multilane highways, install the single faced MILEPOST MARKER (D10-1, D10-2, and D10-3) for each roadway direction, on the right side of the roadway. • MILEPOST MARKERS on spur routes display the letter “S” below the mileage figure. • MILEPOST MARKERS must be installed within 50 feet of their designated location.
If that is not physically possible, do not install that MILEPOST MARKER.
When a milepost marker is relocated it must be documented in the Traffic Sign Maintenance
System (TSMS). Headquarters Traffic supplies this information to the Roadway Data Office annually so the milepost marker can be accurately relocated in the State Highway Log.
See Standard Plan G-10.10-00 and G20.10-00 for installation details.

2-18.7
Highway and Freeway Entrance
Install the HIGHWAY ENTRANCE sign (E12-101) on two-lane two-way undivided highways where interchanges are provided at intersecting crossroads. Install signs on both sides of the on-ramp, facing approaching traffic, to clearly identify the entrance to the on-ramp.
Install the FREEWAY ENTRANCE sign (E12-201) on both sides of each freeway or expressway on-ramp, facing approaching traffic, to identify the ramp entrance. 2-18.8
Other Agencies
Consider installation of supplemental guide signs to facilities of other federal, state and local agencies when space is available per the MUTCD. Sign colors are determined by the type of sign destination (recreation, emergency, or direction). • Department of Natural Resources Campgrounds – White letters on brown background. • State Patrol – White letters on blue background. • State Public Fishing Areas – White letters on brown background. • Government Fish Hatcheries Open to the Public – White letters on green background. • Department of Corrections Facilities – White letters on green background.

Miscellaneous Signing 2-19.1
Adopt-a-Highway or Adopt-a-Trail
ADOPT-A-HIGHWAY/TRAIL (AAH/AAT) signs are installed to recognize both volunteer groups and businesses that sponsor litter pick up, or other roadside, or trail enhancement activities as part of the AAH program. The program is administered through the
Headquarters Maintenance Office, with regional coordinators assigning locations to groups.
Adopted roadside sections can include one or both sides of the roadway.
AAH signs are placed at or near the beginning of an adopted section. Lateral placement of the AAH signs may be up to 50 feet from the edge of the travel lane, if right of way is available and the signs are still visible from the traveled lanes. All AAH signs mounted on the same post must be the same width.
The name displayed on the AAH recognition sign shall be the official name of the organization, individuals, or business sponsoring the section and must be pre-approved by the department.
Volunteer adoption sections are signed as follows: • Sections adopted by volunteer groups are signed using I6-901, I6-901A, I6-902,
I6-902A, I6-904, and I6-905A signs. • If the section includes both directions of travel, install signs for each. • On divided highways, AAH signs are installed on the right shoulder only.
Sponsored adoption sections are signed as follows: • Sections adopted by businesses are signed using an I6-906 sign. • On divided highways, AAH signs may be installed on either the median or the right shoulder. • The sponsor’s logo/name plaque is provided to the region for WSDOT installation on the AAH sign. The plaque will be a 0.050 inch aluminum overlay. • Size requirements are a maximum of three lines, with 20 spaces per line. • If a sponsor’s name will not fit within the sign width, the letter height will be reduced until it can.
AAH recognition signs may also be installed for special enhancement projects such as landscaping at interchanges, or other areas. In these cases, the smaller sign shall be used and the region traffic engineer shall determine sign placement on a case-by-case basis.
Spacing between AAH signs and other traffic control signs shall conform to MUTCD Section 2H.08. AAH signs are shown in Appendices 2-26 and 2-27.

Signs
The city or community group is responsible for maintaining the marker and any associated landscaping. Inadequate maintenance of either, as determined by the department, may result in marker removal.
If a highway project (such as roadway widening) will displace an ENTRANCE MARKER, the city or community group is responsible for relocating and/or removing it. Markers not relocated shall be removed by WSDOT, with removal and disposal costs billed to the city or community group.
A.
Entrance Markers on Limited Access Highways – The total marker area shall not exceed 100 square feet, and the message area shall not exceed approximately 60 square feet. At highway interchanges, the marker must be oriented so it can be read by the motorist leaving the ramp and not by the motorist on the highway mainline.
Non-Profit Service Club Plaques (i.e., Kiwanis, Lions, Rotary) may not be installed on
ENTRANCE MARKERS within limited access highways. These signs are considered to be Type (1)(c) signs and are regulated under the Scenic Vistas Act (RCW 47.42 and
WAC 468-66).
B.

1.
Interstate – ENTRANCE MARKERS installed on Interstate right of way require
FHWA approval. The State Traffic Engineer reviews the design and placement of city ENTRANCE MARKER requests on interstate roadways before recommending approval to the FHWA. If approved, the marker is placed between the interchange ramp and the right of way line, in the area of the ramp terminal with the connecting city street, and not visible to mainline traffic. 2.
Non-Interstate – The region traffic engineer approves the design and placement of the marker on non-interstate routes. If there are any deviations from the guidelines above, the design must be submitted to the State Traffic Engineer for approval. For undivided highways, the marker is placed just inside corporate limits, or at the far side of an intersection located inside corporate limits.
Entrance Markers on Non-Limited Access Highways – The total marker size shall not exceed 150 square feet, including the border and trim, and service club plaques. The service club plaque area of the sign shall not be disproportional to the marker message.
The maximum size for each service club plaque is 24″ × 24″.
Non-Profit Service Club Plaques (i.e., Kiwanis, Lions, Rotary) may be installed on a city
ENTRANCE MARKER along a state highway if the marker is located within corporate limits and is not within a limited access area. These signs are considered to be Type (1) (b) signs and are regulated by the Scenic Vistas Act (RCW 47.42 and WAC 468-66).
The region traffic engineer shall approve the design and placement of the marker.
If there are any deviations from the guidelines, the design and placement shall be submitted to the State Traffic Engineer for approval.
Install the city ENTRANCE MARKER inside the city limits, beyond the curb line or outside edge of the roadway. ENTRANCE MARKERS for unincorporated communities may be considered for placement on state highway right of way. The marker must be located beyond the clear zone if it does not meet break- away standards.

On limited access facilities, the sign is placed between the ramp and right of way line, and not visible to mainline traffic. • The sign sponsor shall be notified and instructed to replace the sign when needed. The sign shall be removed if it is not replaced in a timely manner. • When the General Permit expires without renewal, or the landscaping/vegetation is no longer maintained, the sign shall be removed.

2-19.11
Limited Access
For state highways that operate with intermittent access control, install ENTERING LIMITED
ACCESS AREA (I2-601) and LEAVING LIMITED ACCESS AREA (I2-701) signs in accordance with RCW 47.52.110. Fully controlled limited access highways do not need signs. 2-19.12
Litter Control
To Be Determined. 2-19.13
Post Offices
Post offices may be signed from state highways in unincorporated areas if the post office is not visible from the state highway and there is a demonstrated need for the sign (D1-101).
Cities or towns may sign for post offices inside incorporated limits. 2-19.14
Private Roads
WSDOT does not supply, fabricate, install, or maintain STOP signs or STREET NAME signs for private roadways that intersect with state highways. Citizens may install their own signs at such intersections, in accordance with the MUTCD, and working with the area Maintenance Superintendent. A general permit is required when a STOP sign or private ROAD NAME sign is installed on WSDOT right of way at a private road approach.
The citizen requesting the sign must secure the permit and coordinate installation details with the area Maintenance Superintendent. Maintenance for private road signs is the responsibility of the citizen installing the signs.

WSDOT Traffic Manual

Signs
Private road name signs (D3-104) shall be fabricated in accordance with the Sign Fabrication
Manual and must indicate the road is private either by a sign header or by words (“Private” or “PVT”) on the sign. White letters on a green background is the preferred color but a local jurisdiction may determine that white on blue or black on white are acceptable. 2-19.15
Refuse Station
REFUSE STATION signing may be installed under the following conditions: • The site is required to be county or city owned and open to the general public. Private refuse stations will not be signed. • The is required to must be a major refuse station, not just a drop-off location. • Signs are not installed on any freeway facility. • The refuse station must be located within ½ mile of the state highway. • Use the word “Refuse” instead of the word “Transfer” to avoid possible confusion with transportation hub centers that may also be called Transfer stations. The word “Garbage” is not used. • The REFUSE STATION sign shall be a 24 inch × 24 inch white on green plaque. • Install the plaque above or below any ground mounted guide or information sign at the intersection. If there are no signs, the plaque may be placed on its own sign post. • A city or county may install a REFUSE STATION sign on its right of way at an intersection, instead of a highway sign. The sign would be considered a Type 1 sign under the Scenic Vistas Act (WAC 468-66-050). 2-19.16
Salmon and Other Fish
WSDOT receives requests from fish related user groups to sign a stream or body of water with a specific fish related message. Signs related to preserving the fish habitat may be installed along a state highway; however, only one type of fish related sign will be allowed for a location. Where several user groups (i.e., salmon, steelhead, or trout) request signing in a location, suggest that they work together to develop a single fish related sign message and to seek support from the local jurisdiction. An overall signing plan with support documentation should be submitted to the region Traffic Office, preferably by the local jurisdiction or by an official organization or agency. • The stream crossing or body of water is required to be year round. • Multiple signs, supported, endorsed, or maintained by different user groups (i.e., salmon, steelhead, and trout) will not be allowed. • The requesting user group is responsible for the sign fabrication, installation costs, and all maintenance and replacement costs. A J account can be set up to administer the funds. Sign installation and removal will be by WSDOT personnel. • Sign size will be 18″ × 24″, 24″ × 24″, or 24″ × 36″, dependent on the fish logo and line message approved by WSDOT. • Sign colors are white letters on a blue background.

Water Crossing
A STREAM NAME or WATER CROSSING (I3-101) sign may be installed on a state roadway to identify a body of water that traverses or parallels a state highway, using these guidelines: • The body of water is required to be identified by name on a USGS map. • If the body of water traverses the highway, the water way must be bridged by a highway structure. A single culvert crossing or a seasonal stream does not qualify for a sign. • Sign color shall be white on green. • On conventional roadways, letter height is 6″ upper case and 4½″ lower case letters. • On expressways or freeways, letter height is 8″ upper case and 6″ lower case letters. 2-19.18
Watersheds
Watershed Signs may be installed per the following: • The Watershed has to be recognized by Washington Department of Ecology (Watershed Finder)
Within State Highway Right of Way – • The requesting agency or group is responsible for the sign fabrication, installation costs, and all future maintenance and replacement costs. A JX account can be set up to administer the funds. Sign installation and removal will be by WSDOT personnel. • The maximum sign size is 12 square feet. • The sign color are white legend on either blue background or green background. • The Watershed name may be combined with the water crossing (river, creek, or stream –
Colville River Watershed).
Outside of State Highway Right of Way – • Can be treated as Type 1 signs (WAC 468-66-050) and installed off the state right of way. Type 1 signs must be supported by an official agency or organization. • Permission of the land owner.

2-19.19
Water Related Signs NOT to Be Installed
The following water related signs shall not be installed on any state highway: • Conservation District Boundary Area • Drainage Basin • Drinking and Ground Water Management Area • Groundwater Protection Region or Area • Groundwater Conservation Region or Area • Surface Water Management Area • Wellhead Protection Area
These signs do not assist motorists in their driving, but can be treated as Type 1 signs (WAC 468-66-050) and installed off the state right of way. Type 1 signs must be supported by an official agency or organization.

Watchable Wildlife
The WILDLIFE VIEWING (D5-907) signs may be installed for locations that are open to the public and within 10 miles of the state highway. Install the sign on the highway exit or intersection nearest the viewing area. Use the BINOCULARS symbol sign for a trailblazer and for site identification if no other signing is posted. Signs are white on a brown background.

2-19.21
Evacuation Route
Install EVACUATION ROUTE (I25-101, I25-201) symbol signs to indicate the route that people should follow to leave an area when a tsunami, volcanic eruption, fire, or other hazard is threatening. Region Traffic Offices are to coordinate the location of Evacuation
Route signs with City, County, or Tribal Emergency Management personnel. 2-20
Variable Message Signs
Variable Message Signs (VMS) are traffic control devices designed to display diverse messages to alert roadway users about specific conditions or situations. VMS are part of
WSDOT’s Traffic Management System and are operated by each region Traffic Management
Center (TMC).
VMS are located on many highways throughout the state. Some are used exclusively to provide information about variable speed limits, lane use restrictions, active traffic management, or traction requirements. Others may provide information about: • Traffic incident information. • Traffic restrictions or emergency conditions. • Special event related traffic impact information. • Upcoming road closures or other impacts.
Operation of the Variable Message Signs is coordinated by the region’s TMC and is governed by the Variable Message Sign Policies, Guidance, Operations at: http://sharedot/ops/traffic/
TO%20Policies%20and%20Plans/Illumination,%20Traffic%20Signals,%20and%20ITS/
VMS%20Operations%20Policy%202013-02.pdf.

2-21
Highway Advisory Radio (HAR) and Traveler Information Station (TIS)
Signing
HAR and TIS systems are low power AM radio stations installed to provide the traveling public with traffic alerts or traveler information. They are sometimes used in conjunction with a Variable Message Sign (VMS). Both HAR and TIS installations must comply with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requirements and must be approved by and coordinated through the WSDOT ITS and Communications office. HAR and
TIS system messages are governed by the HAR/TIS procedures which can be found at http://sharedot/ops/traffic/TO%20Policies%20and%20Plans/Highway%20Advisory%20
Radio/HARPolicy.pdf.
HAR and TIS signs are secondary to official traffic control signs (i.e., regulatory and warning signs, guide signs) and are installed only when MUTCD and WSDOT sign spacing requirements can be met.

Road Conditions signs shall be a non-reflective black legend on a reflective yellow background. 2-21.2
Traveler Information Signs (TIS)
TIS systems give tourist and recreational information. • Install a “TRAVEL INFORMATION TUNE (XXXX) AM” at any TIS location. • The sign shall be a reflective white legend on a reflective blue background, with the exceptions of TIS signs for recreation in National Parks, National Forests, and National
Historic Reserves. These are the ONLY TIS signs that may be a white reflective legend on a brown reflective background. As well, these agencies may incorporate their official agency logo on the TIS sign. • When the preemptive message EMERGENCY INFO WHEN FLASHING is included in the TIS sign, it shall be a non-reflective black message on a reflective yellow background. Flashing beacons shall be installed to be activated by the TMC when emergency messages are being broadcast. • All TIS sign fabrication, installation, and maintenance costs are the responsibility of the requesting agency. Signs will be fabricated to WSDOT standards and may only be installed by WSDOT crews. 2-22

Delineation and Markings
General
Delineation is the pavement markings, guideposts, and raised pavement markers used on and adjacent to the roadway to define vehicular travel paths. The MUTCD, Design Manual, and Standard Plans provide delineation placement guidelines.
The Roadway Delineation Practices Handbook, published by FHWA, discusses specialized materials and delineation treatments for unique applications and situations. This handbook does not establish policies or standards but is only a reference document. 3-2
Pavement Markings
Pavement markings are classified as either longitudinal or transverse. Materials typically used for each are paint for longitudinal markings and durables for transverse markings.
Durable markings include thermoplastics, Meythl Methacrylate, tape, etc. Durable markings are generally used in locations with higher ADT, high truck traffic and/or areas with increased turning radius. Approved sources for durable materials are listed in the General
Special Provisions. A purchase contract is available for the purchase of paint. New durable materials are continually being evaluated.
A.

Intersection Channelization – The MUTCD has a provision that allows pavement markings to be extended through an intersection where design or visibility conditions make it desirable to provide control through the intersection. These markings are only installed as the result of a traffic engineering analysis that considers horizontal curvature and other visibility conditions. For statewide uniformity, the dotted line used for this extension is applied as a 2-foot stripe with a 4-foot gap between stripes.
Multilane approaches may provide exclusive or shared lanes for turning and through vehicles. At most intersections through traffic must share a lane with one direction of turning traffic. To minimize delay, through traffic should normally be combined with right-turning traffic unless opposite approach geometrics are unfavorable. An offset centerline and minor widening may help accomplish the proper lane assignments.
Stop lines can be included at signalized intersections with crosswalks but are to be included at signalized intersections without crosswalks. At nonsignalized intersections, stop lines are necessary on the stop sign control approaches when crosswalks are not included. Including the stop line at stop sign control locations having marked crosswalks is optional.

Delineation and Markings
B.
Interchange Off Ramps – At either a parallel or a tapered deceleration lane, the
MUTCD allows the application of an optional dotted extension of the main line right edge line through the ramp opening. The dotted line is a 2-foot stripe with a 4-foot gap.
For statewide uniformity, these optional dotted extensions should only be installed where the exit ramp is located on a horizontal curve, except for locations with continuous illumination, and at locations with prevalent foggy periods. They are generally not needed at ramps exiting from tangent sections. These markings are only to be installed as a result of a traffic engineering analysis.

C.
Uncontrolled Pedestrian Crossing/Supplemental Treatments for Marked Pedestrian
Crossings.
Refer to the Traffic Manual chapter.
No Passing Zone Marking – No passing zones are to be established and marked on horizontal and vertical curves in accordance with the MUTCD.
State law, in the Rules of the Road RCW 46.61.100 – RCW 46.61.165, identifies several situations with a statutory no passing zone distance such as “. . . when approaching within 100 feet of or traversing any intersection or railroad crossing . . .”or“. . . the view is obstructed upon approaching within 100 feet of any bridge, viaduct, or tunnel” However, state law does not imply a need to mark no passing zones for such situations. 3-3
Guideposts
Guideposts, discussed in the MUTCD as delineators, are light retroreflecting devices mounted at the side of the roadway to indicate roadway alignment. They are effective aids for night, wet, or other reduced visibility driving conditions and are intended to guide rather than warn motorists.
Guidepost installation and spacing requirements are included in the Standard Plans and the Design Manual. The field spacing for guideposts shall be determined from Exhibit 3-1.
Approved sources for guideposts as well as reflective materials are listed in the General
Special Provisions.

3-4
Barrier Delineation
Barrier delineation is the extension of guideposts through an area of guardrail or concrete barrier. Spacing is the same as for guideposts.
Guardrail is delineated by mounting guideposts on guardrail posts as shown in the
Standard Plans.
Concrete barrier is delineated by placing reflective devices on the face of the barrier about
6 inches down from the top. When concrete barrier is placed immediately adjacent to the traveled lane, such as in construction zones, delineator spacing should be a maximum of
40 feet on tangents and 20 feet through curves.

Raised Pavement Markers
Chapter 3
As described in the Design Manual, raised pavement markers are extensively used in western
Washington to simulate lane lines and to supplement painted pavement markings.
Maintenance of raised pavement markers is discussed in the Maintenance Manual.
A.
Right Edge Lines – The general use of raised reflective pavement markers to supplement, or in lieu of, right edge lines is strongly discouraged. At night, such markers can be easily mistaken for lane lines.
The State Traffic Engineer has approved the use of reflective markers to supplement right edge lines in these locations: • On the taper in lane reduction sections, such as from four lane to two lane. • Through sections with reduced lane width, such as narrow structures. • At the gore of exit ramps.

B.
Recessed Markers – Recessed reflective markers and recessed lane lines appear to be an effective way to supplement centerline and lane line delineation in areas requiring regular snow plowing.
The details for installation of the recessed marker are contained in the Standard Plans.
Not generally allowed, recessed markers and lines may be installed on bridges with
Bridge Preservation approval. Currently, several alternative methods are being considered for this application to minimize the impact on bridge decks.

Introduction
Washington’s Transportation Plan envisions an integrated
WSDOT Vision system safely connecting people and communities –
Washington travelers have fostering commerce and economic opportunity for all, a safe, sustainable, and operating seamlessly across boundaries, and providing integrated multimodal transportation system travel options to achieve an environmentally and financially sustainable system. Achieving a complete transportation system requires us to provide a variety of transportation options to all users. Not only will such a system serve everyone, it will function more efficiently. The benefits are significant and wide- ranging such as a cleaner environment, a stronger economy and a more mobile and healthy population.
Transportation system integration requires all partners

Highways and streets are a accommodates multiple modes of travel for the movement of community asset where access to transit facilities and people and goods including, services are found; bicycle and pedestrian connections are but not limited to, walking, complete; and access to major employment, education, rolling, bicycling, using public social service and residential destinations are a priority. transit, and driving.
The roadway system needs to feel safe for all users and it should both benefit and respond to the needs of people and communities around it.

Multimodal Planning, Design, and Operational Considerations
Background
Washington State’s population is projected to grow more than 20 percent during the next
20 years. In Spokane and Clark counties, the population is expected to grow to more than 500,000 people and Central Puget Sound is expected to add another million people in the coming decades.1 This population growth will likely be accompanied by a number of challenges including: • Addressing a greater backlog of public infrastructure maintenance needs • Serving a larger number of people who are over 65 years old • Serving an increasing percentage of the population with disabilities • Helping a growing number of people facing health and economic inequality • Responding to the needs of a more urbanized population and the transportation issues associated with suburbanized poverty • Putting greater effort into the need to address climate change as well as the challenges providing a transportation system that provides for needs of road users in an equitable manner. All of these trends challenge us find the best use of the broad array of transportation services and systems, both public and private that are available to the public. 4-3
Policy 4-3.1
United States Department of Transportation
23 CFR § 652.5 states, “the safe accommodation of pedestrians and bicyclists should be given full consideration during the development of Federal-aid highway projects, and during the construction of such projects. The special needs for the elderly and the handicapped shall be considered in all Federal-aid projects that include pedestrian facilities. Where current or anticipated pedestrian and/or bicycle traffic presents a potential conflict with motor vehicle traffic, every effort shall be made to minimize the detrimental effects on all highway users who share the facility. On highways without full control of access where a bridge deck is being replaced or rehabilitated, and where bicycles are permitted to operate at each end, the bridge shall be reconstructed so that bicycles can be safely accommodated when it can be done at a reasonable cost. Consultation with local groups of organized bicyclists is to be encouraged in the development of bicycle projects.”
It is the policy of the United States, as described in 49 U.S.C. §70101 to maintain and improve the condition and performance of the National Multimodal Freight Network to ensure that the network provides a foundation for the United States to compete in the global economy.
Chapter 53 of Title 49 of the U.S. Code establishes the authority for FTA. It incorporates the Urban Mass Transportation Act originally enacted in 1964 and states that “it is in the interest of the United States, including its economic interest, to foster the development and revitalization of public transportation systems that (1) maximize the safe, secure, and efficient mobility of individuals; (2) minimize environmental impacts; and (3) minimize transportation-related fuel consumption and reliance on foreign oil.”

WSDOT is committed to multimodal safety as identified in Washington State’s Strategic
Highway Safety Plan.
The Washington Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and Washington Traffic Safety
Commission (WTSC), along with dozens of partners, collaborated to create the
Target Zero Strategic Highway
Safety Plan (SHSP). Target Zero is a statewide, data-driven effort to reduce fatalities and serious injuries to zero by the year 2030. We will do this by developing strong leadership in organizations that directly affect highway safety, and using partnerships to develop and implement innovative, data-based solutions based on a safe systems approach. Our goal is zero deaths and serious injuries, because every life counts. For more information about the Washington

Multimodal Planning, Design, and Operational Considerations
Equity and Transportation
Transportation is essential for healthy, thriving communities. Safe, reliable, affordable transportation opens doors to economic and social opportunities for many people.
However, not all people have the same access. Equity refers to the distribution of benefits and costs or burdens across race, economic status, disability status and other characteristics and whether that distribution is fair in the context of past and current disparities. Transportation equity focuses on transportation system effects in an effort to understand where costs and burdens are unfairly distributed.
It reflects the input of an inclusive process involving the people who will be affected. This is the starting point for transportation decisions and investments that create a more just system that works for all.
WSDOT has a number of tools to support analysis of existing data to use when considering equity on transportation projects. Some programs and projects will require collection of additional data. Existing data sources include:
WSDOT Application for Local Planning and Community
Accessibility (ALPACA) provides demographic mapping tools for race/ethnicity, age, disability, and limited
English proficiency.

Screening and Mapping Tool. EJSCREEN is an environmental justice mapping and screening tool that provides EPA with a nationally consistent dataset and approach for combining environmental and demographic indicators.

Did you know?
Communities with poverty rates higher than the state average also have the highest numbers of households that lack access to a personal vehicle and are therefore more likely to rely on walking, bicycling, and transit for their transportation needs.
However, studies show a long pattern of investment inequity in lower-income neighborhoods. “Children who grow up in walkable communities fare better economically, controlling for a wide range of economic factors as well as the related characteristics of those neighborhoods.” – Kids Raised in Walkable Cities Earn More
Money As Adults, CityLab.
The cost of transportation and housing are inextricably linked and also play a role in traffic safety and health equity.

Chapter 4
Multimodal Planning
Transportation facilities should provide for reasonable safe movement of people, goods, and services by multiple transportation modes, including motorized vehicles, bicycling, walking, transit, and others. WSDOT is moving towards the Safe Systems approach to roadway safety. This is a paradigm shift, a change in the way we understand transportation for all road users and identify solutions.
When evaluating the transportation system performance, the old paradigm considered motor vehicles as the main and dominant transportation mode, giving little consideration to other modes and the effects on those movements. The new paradigm is multimodal and comprehensive. Current WSDOT policies recognizes non-auto travel demands, and a wide range of economic, social and environmental effects, including vehicle ownership costs, parking costs, health effects, and the benefits of providing independent mobility for everyone regardless of mode. Speed management is a tool for the goal of reducing the incidence and severity of crashes for people using all modes.
When planning for motor vehicle and transit modes we generally think about complete systems. We want to provide travel that does not have a high probability of a crash. Such concepts apply equally well to all modes including freight, transit, and active transportation planning, though in practice we often pay more attention to isolated elements of a network like specific intersections.
In evaluating movements for all modes consider the larger areas people are likely to use.
Look at where schools, grocery stores, and other services are located relative to where people live. Also consider active transportation access to intermodal connections. It is useful to take the perspective of travelers who don’t own motor vehicles and can’t always make use of transit, walking, or biking. The Active Transportation Plan provides methodologies for understanding network quality and connectivity and associated performance measures.
Ideally, network improvements would be considered that help increase the active transportation and/or transit mode share. Where improvements are specific to a given facility, however, it is still necessary to understand how that facility interacts with the broader network. When changes to a facility reduce utility of the broader active transportation network, consider on and off-system investments that restore network connectivity and functionality. Changes that increase roadway width, posted or operating speed, and/or motor vehicle volume increase the potential for crashes that can be serious or fatal for people using active transportation. At the planning stage, potential changes to crash exposure and mobility because of new design and future operations need to be considered.
Planning actions that help remove or mitigate barriers to active transportation should be identified. Increasing mode share for active transportation and transit is considered a form a transportation demand management and can be considered to supplement or replace congestion mitigation. Mode share increases for active transportation modes occurs when road users feel reasonably safe and secure on the transportation systems.

Multimodal Planning, Design, and Operational Considerations
There is not one single approach to optimizing to meet the needs of all road users on the highway system. Keys to multimodal planning include: • Put safety first to support elimination of fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads and to reduce the severity of the crashes that may occur (e.g., everyone should to get home safely). • Learn and understand existing and future contexts. • Being mindful of project context beyond the immediate footprint. • Collaborate with colleagues, subject matter experts, and stakeholders. • Engage communities. For example: listen to priorities, discuss constraints, educate, find forums to engage, and review the Regional Transportation Plans and other relevant plans. • Look for opportunities on all projects to improve mobility and accessibility for all modes.
For example, roadway lanes can be re-purposed to add pedestrian and bicycle facilities.
Safety does not need to be at the expense of increased mobility when all road users are factored in. • Considering performance measures beyond vehicle peak hour analysis. Designing for the peak vehicle hour can lead to overbuilding facilities. Consequences of overbuilding highways can include reduced safety performance, higher maintenance costs, and increased stormwater runoff, as well as the creation of barriers to greater active transportation use that otherwise could reduce the peak load. The Exhibit 4-1 provides examples of common metrics used versus ones that are often not used.

Multimodal Transportation Analysis Tools
Balancing the demands on the transportation system within a multimodal framework requires effort to identify affordable and effective solutions. WSDOT has various tools available to assist with this effort, which include but are not limited to:
Design Manual Chapter 320 - Traffic Analysis. Traffic Analysis is either “operational” or “planning” in nature. Traffic Analysis are generally examines areas such as corridors or larger geographic areas. Outcomes of Traffic Analysis include identification of multimodal needs in a corridor and effects of land use changes. These studies typically do not reach the level of providing intersection control and geometric design recommendations.
Intersections are defined by Intersection Control Evaluations. (ICE). ICE is a data-driven, performance-based framework used to objectively screen alternatives and identify an optimal geometric and control solution for an intersection.
ICE studies can include more than one intersection or be applied on an entire corridor as needed. ICE policy is intended to be flexible, adaptable, and provide a transparent multimodal decision making process. achieving the WSDOT mission. This is how we plan, design, build, operate and maintain the state’s transportation system. Our goal is to identify and solve problems as quickly and inexpensively as possible. This approach uses performance-based and data-driven decision making with early community involvement to guide the development and delivery of transportation investments. Practical Solutions strategies include: • Lowest lifecycle cost to preserve the system in a state of good repair • Target Zero strategies for safety • Transportation System Management and Operations (TSMO) • Mobility management;2 and • Capital project investment

Mobility management includes Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies such as programs and services that help encourage transportation alternatives, reduce reliance on the private automobile for travel, and reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and greenhouse gas emissions. A good example of mobility management strategies can be found in the San Diego’s
Mobility Management Guidebook. WSDOT Transportation Demand Management website is another resource

If highway or intersection capacity is measured only for automobiles, then mitigation required to address “deficiencies” will only add automobile capacity in the form of vehicle travel or turn lanes, which may compromise the viability and safety of pedestrian, bicycle, and transit modes.
Widening a street may not be feasible from a physical or economic standpoint, and it might not be desirable from a practical design or land use standpoint, either. Chapter 12 provides guidance to measure transportation effects across the modes.

This guide defines the focus, scale, and scope of safety analyses across the different WSDOT program areas as well as safety analysis outside the typical program areas.

Multimodal Transportation Documentation
Every project has a unique land use and transportation context. Understanding and documenting the project’s context is critical to successful application of state and WSDOT goals and defining multimodal transportation needs. Context should be viewed as both a constraint and an opportunity. WSDOT Design land use and transportation context and documentation requirements for the Basis of Design. The WSDOT
Context and Modal Accommodation Report (CMAR) is available for determining the existing and future multimodal context.
Sources of information to assist with documentation include resources listed in Section 4-3.3 and those listed below:
Definition of Context “Context refers to the environmental, economic, and social features that influence livability and travel characteristics. Context characteristics provide insight into the activities, functions, and performance that can be influenced by the roadway design. Context also informs roadway design, including the selection of design controls, such as target speed and modal priority, and other design decisions.” WSDOT • Stakeholder and/or community engagement • Local and regional plans and/or studies • Local land use plans • Local design standards • Local transit routes, plans, and/or studies • WSDOT Design Manual • WSDOT Corridor Sketches • WSDOT planning studies • Truck Freight Economic Corridor Maps • Freight and Goods Transportation Map (FGTS) • Freight Systems Plan • Functional Classification Maps • National Highway System Map • WSDOT GeoPortal Map

Active Transportation
Effective active transportation networks lead to more people walking and bicycling by creating routes that are safe, efficient, seamless, and easy to use. Years of research confirm the public health benefits of active travel modes like walking and biking. Organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National
Institutes of Health, among others, have long advocated for
Americans to increase physical activity to reduce avoidable chronic conditions associated with inactivity. Providing well-designed and managed facilities for people walking and rolling also provides important information for drivers to understand the mix of uses present in a corridor. 4-6.1
Pedestrian Facilities
Pedestrian travel is a vital transportation mode. It is used by everyone at some point in each trip and is a critical outlines WSDOT polices regarding pedestrian facilities.

Pedestrian & Bicyclist Safety all traffic fatalities in our state, and 20 percent of all traffic serious injuries, were people walking or biking. These figures continued to climb in 2018. At 109 fatalities, pedestrian deaths reached their highest number in more than 30 years. Compared to 2012–2014, the 2015–2017 figures show a 41 percent increase in fatalities for people who walk and bike, and an 11 percent increase in serious injuries.

Highway Safety Plan
When evaluating pedestrian facilities in urban core, urban, suburban, and rural town/ community population centers contexts consider the following: • Local agency road standards, criteria, and guidelines • Motor vehicle traffic volume, traffic speeds, number of travel lanes; the Level of Traffic
Stress index developed for the Active Transportation Plan incorporates these elements • Safety considerations: observed crashes, near miss data, pedestrian and bicycle volumes, safety analysis, opportunity for speed management, injury minimization policy • Land use consideration: Presence of current or future planned destinations, context, opportunity to support latent pedestrian demand, demographics indicating higher number of disabled people and/or people reliant on active transportation/transit • Multimodal connectivity: Transit usage, presence of transit stops, other modal connections, modal mix, roadway design, active transportation facilities connected to the particular segment in question • Consider demographics of the population within the walk shed of the location. Give special consideration to equity, age, disabilities, car ownership, and income. These area characteristics can affect reliance on active transportation facilities and public transportation services. • Stakeholder and community input • Other considerations: Maintenance, other factors

A.

Sidewalk Width
Sidewalk width should be sufficient to facilitate easy movement by pedestrians and may vary depending on the character of an area. At a minimum, sidewalk widths must meet the contextual needs of the pedestrian access route. Where the sidewalk is not buffered from motor vehicle traffic, the preferred total width for a curb-attached sidewalk is at least
6 feet in residential areas and at least 8 feet in commercial areas. Additional width should be provided as needed in commercial areas for frontage zones and in locations where large volumes of pedestrian traffic can be expected based on context. In locations where sidewalks are constructed so that they are immediately adjacent to roadways and building faces, the walkway should include at least 2 feet of width for shy distance from walls, railings and fixed objects while also providing the necessary width for easy travel by the expected pedestrian, including those who use wheelchairs or other mobility devices.
Curb-attached sidewalks and buffer areas should be considered on all new and reconstructed state facilities and incorporated whenever possible in population centers.
B.
Sidewalk Buffer
In general, separation between pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic is desirable. The optimal width of a buffer zone varies depending on the character of an area and the traffic conditions on the adjacent roadway. Increased buffer width can reduce traffic stress for pedestrian’s providing a sense of safety and comfort and reducing crash exposure.
Greater separation from traffic is desirable where there are higher vehicle volumes and/or higher speeds.
Where curb-attached sidewalk is provided, at least a 3 foot buffer is required. Where an at grade pedestrian facility is separated from motor vehicle traffic by a swale or ditch a buffer zone of at least 4 feet or wider is recommended. Buffers should be maximized on higher speed, higher volume roadways. A buffer zone 7 feet wide will allow for installation of curb ramps, street lights, and signs outside the pedestrian access route. The buffer should be widened to accommodate the space occupied by any objects placed there, and still provide
2 feet clear to both the roadway and the sidewalk.
On roadways without curbs, buffer widths equal to or greater than the clear zone appropriate for the roadway are desirable.
Wider buffers also provide space to manage driveway slopes, making it easier to comply with cross slope limits that facilitate the preservation of the pedestrian access route at driveway crossings and prevent the need to drop sidewalks to grade at every driveway crossing. Buffer areas are frequently used for storage of snow removed from adjacent roadways in climates where snow accumulation is common. If the buffer area is used for snow storage, the buffer width should be scaled accordingly, bearing in mind that people who rely on pedestrian access continue to do so during the winter.

Pedestrian Crossings at Uncontrolled Locations
Uncontrolled pedestrian locations occur where a sidewalk or pedestrian path intersects a roadway where no traffic control exists such as a stop sign or traffic signal. This locations can be at intersections or midblock locations.
The focus of this section is crossings without intersection control such as a traffic signals or stop signs. Many of the design considerations for uncontrolled crossings can be incorporated into locations with controls as well; controls may need to be increased based on traffic volumes and speed. injuries occurred while the person was crossing the roadway. By focusing on pedestrian crossing needs and understanding crossing patterns agencies can take advantage of a significant statewide safety need and improve quality of life and transportation access for pedestrians of all ages and abilities. Bicyclists in crosswalks are defined in state law as pedestrians; their transportation needs are also addressed through crossing improvements.

A.
Federal Law
The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways, or MUTCD defines the standards used by road managers nationwide to install and maintain traffic control devices on all public streets, highways, bikeways, and private roads open to public travel.
The MUTCD is published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) under 23 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 655, Subpart F.

B.
State Law
Legal crosswalks exist at all intersections, whether marked or not, per RCW 46.04.160.
Marked crossings at other locations are called mid-block crossings and can occur at schools, commercial areas, parks, transit stops, or other areas where pedestrians need to cross unmarked crossings.
C.
Agency Application
Designated crosswalks provide guidance for pedestrians and in conjunction with other measures help alert road users to a pedestrian crossing across a roadway. There are many factors to consider when deciding whether a marked pedestrian crossing is recommended at a specific location and what type of treatment is appropriate. Because every situation is unique, it is impossible to prescribe a “one size fits all” evaluation process that would work in every situation. The study process and criteria here are presented as guidance.
Consult the WSDOT Action Plan for Implementing Pedestrian Crossings Countermeasures at Uncontrolled Locations for additional discussion. The final decision to install pedestrian crossing infrastructure is subject to review and approval of the Region Traffic Engineer.
D.
Studies
WSDOT requires an engineering study to determine whether a crosswalk should be provided and the treatment needed. Implementation of a marked crosswalk at an uncontrolled location shall require approval from the Region Traffic Engineer or designee in
WSDOT uses engineering studies to determine where Pedestrian Signals or Pedestrian
Hybrid Beacons may be used on State Highways.
Engineering studies are recommended for updating existing marked uncontrolled crossings.
An engineering study by WSDOT is not required for systems installed by local jurisdictions.
Local agencies will need to comply with all applicable DOT permit approval processes.

Study Components
The engineering study should include: • Location description and physical data

F.
Location Description and Physical Data
The following items are not an exhaustive list but can be used as guide to begin a study. • Traffic volume, traffic speeds, number of travel lanes, destinations, transit or public transportation usage, and roadway classification. Also consider the Level of Traffic Stress index developed for the Active Transportation Plan, which incorporates as most of these elements. • Roadway geometrics and visibility • Traffic control and lighting • Pedestrian/bicyclist safety data including crash severity and frequency • Pedestrian/bicyclist volumes (noting that volumes may be low due to the lack of appropriate facilities, not lack of need or demand) • Known pedestrian/bicyclist crossing activity in dark or night time conditions • Proximity to adjacent enhanced crossings • Proximity to transit stops, other intermodal connections such as ferry landings and rail stations, trails/shared-use paths, or other pedestrian/bicyclist generators (employment centers, schools, parks, restaurants, bars, businesses, health services, etc.) • Land use context and future land use changes, growth, or development patterns • Demographics of the population within the walk shed of the location • Pedestrian/bicyclist delay or suitability of gaps • Consistency with local agency plans that include the location as a part of their pedestrian/bicycle network

Establish crossing need
After data collection is complete the next step is assessing the pedestrian/bicyclist need at the location, as well as the suitability of the location based on roadway, traffic, and adjacent land use characteristics. Pedestrian crossing needs may exists if any of the following are indicated: • Pedestrian/bicyclist crash and near miss history • Crash types and contributing factors • Known pedestrian/bicyclist crossing activity especially in dark or night time conditions • Proximity to adjacent enhanced crossings • Proximity to transit stops, trails/shared-use paths, or other pedestrian/bicyclist generators (employment centers, schools, parks, restaurants, bars, businesses, health services, etc.) • Land use context and future land use changes, growth, or development patterns • Demographics of the population within the walk shed of the location. Give special consideration in communities where there are higher numbers of people over 65, people with disabilities, and areas of lower income. • Pedestrian/bicyclist delay or suitability of gaps • Walking desire lines or biking patterns • Consistency with state or local agency plans that include the location as a part of their pedestrian/bicycle network
H.
Safety Data Discussion
Pedestrian crash data are the most commonly used statistic for evaluating safety. However, the frequency and accuracy of pedestrian and bicyclist crash data are generally low and research has found that crashes are underreported. Therefore using crash data as the sole method by which crossings are evaluated is not usually practical. Surrogates for crash data include roadway speeds, number of lanes, vehicle volumes, population density, and population demographics such as age and ethnicity. The Level of Traffic Stress developed for the Active Transportation Plan can serve as a proxy in the absence of crash data.3 FHWA guidance on determination and use of pedestrian risk factors can be found in the following

Collaboration with Stakeholders
Collaboration is a priority so improvements are consistent with state and local plans, goals, and overall network connectivity. Contact local agencies and communities affected by the project to help understand local context early to help aid in evaluating the project site.
J.

Determine pedestrian crossing needs or countermeasures
This step of the engineering study is to evaluate the crossing based on the roadway and traffic characteristics. These characteristics relate to the FHWA guidance found in Exhibit 4-2 and 4-3. Characteristics to consider include: Traffic volumes, posted speed, number of lanes (total and number that would need to be crossed consecutively without an intermediate pedestrian refuge), presence of median, motorist and pedestrian sight distance, proximity to nearby enhanced crossings, ADA compliance of existing features, illumination, and presence of on-street parking.
K.
Identify Countermeasures Options - FHWA Pedestrian Crossing
Treatment Guide4
Once the need for a pedestrian crossing is established and the location is identified, the next step is to select the crossing treatment. This section presents countermeasures FHWA suggests to consider for various roadway conditions. Exhibit 4-2 is a baseline guide for evaluating countermeasure options for roadway conditions such as vehicle volumes, speeds, and roadway configuration. Each matrix cell indicates possibilities that may be appropriate for designated pedestrian crossings. In all cases, the countermeasures, when implemented, should follow MUTCD and other relevant AASHTO, FHWA and state policies. Follow department policy and guidance if conflicts arise with use of this table. See Section 4-6.3 for supplemental RRFB guidance.
Changes made for speed management to minimize serious-injury and fatal collisions by reducing posted and operation speeds will change crossing conditions and control measures. 4
Exhibit 4-2 was adapted from FHWA Guide for Improving Pedestrian Safety at Uncontrolled Locations, 2017.

M. Using Multiple Countermeasures
Exhibit 4-2 provides baseline countermeasure considerations for various roadway conditions. Not all of the countermeasures listed in the matrix cell should necessarily be installed at a crossing. WSDOT staff should also review crossing characteristics discussed in Exhibit 4-3, the surrounding land development context, pedestrian travel patterns, and countermeasure effectiveness when considering what countermeasure(s) are best suited for the crossing. Apply practical solutions approach to determining appropriate treatments within the context of the project or program.

N.
Multi-lane and high volume roads
At multi-lane roadway crossings where vehicle daily traffic volumes are in excess of 10,000 vehicles, a marked crosswalk alone is typically not sufficient.5 Under such conditions, more crossing improvements are also needed to reduce pedestrian crash potential. Examples of more substantial treatments include a refuge islands, a pedestrian signal, and RRFB (rectangular rapid flashing beacon). Refer to the symbols used in Exhibit 4-1 for when a marked crosswalk should be paired with one or more of the other countermeasures described. Advance stop lines and “Stop Here for Pedestrian” signs shall be used in advance of all crosswalks with more than two or more through lanes in one direction. See MUTCD 3B.16 for guidance and IS-23 for additional Pedestrian Crossing Details.

Sight Distance

P.
Existing Crossings
Improving existing crossings that are not part of a new construction and alternations can be challenging for many reasons such as the natural or built environment, funding, and resource availability. The goal is to reduce the potential for, and the severity of crashes while also using the Department’s limited resources strategically. For example, Exhibit 4-2 does not suggest considering Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFB) for three lane (1 lane in each direction with a two-way left-turn lane) roadways without medians, traffic volumes over 15,000 ADT, and speeds in excess of 35 mph. If the crosswalk will remain in place a
RRFB does improve conspicuity so it still may be a practical solution until such time the roadway is reconstructed or additional funding is secured.
Q.
Increasing conspicuity of crossing
To further increase visibility of pedestrian crossings, consider integrating multiple countermeasures or enhancing existing ones. Examples include: • Doubling up signs (left and right) or adding retro-reflective strips to sign posts can enhance existing measures. • RRFB are often installed in conjunction with advance stop markings and signs. • Road diets or pavement reallocation present opportunities for adding pedestrian refuge islands and curb extensions at key crossing locations. Consider roadway geometry and the MUTCD when integrating multiple countermeasures. 5

Pedestrian and Bicycle Beacons on State Highways
Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacons
At some uncontrolled crossings, particularly those with four or more lanes, and posted speeds above 25 mph it can be difficult to achieve compliance with laws that require drivers to yield to pedestrians. One type of device proven to be successful in improving driver yielding compliance at crossings is the rectangular rapid flash beacon (RRFB). RRFBs are a pedestrian crossing sign combined with an intense and rapid flashing beacon that is only activated when a pedestrian is starts it. Unlike pedestrian signals or hybrid beacons, these devices provide immediate service to pedestrians meaning there is little or no wait times.
Studies indicate that pedestrians can become impatient when experiencing delays.6
RRFBs are considerably less expensive to install than mast-arm mounted pedestrian signals and are considered a practical crosswalk improvement solution. They can also be installed with solar-power panels to eliminate the need for a power source. RRFBs should be consistent with the WSDOT standard plan sheet library for Rectangular Rapid Flashing
Beacon (RRFB) Details & Pedestrian Crossing Details (IS-22 & IS-23). They are usually implemented at high-volume pedestrian crossings, but may also be considered for school crossings, priority bicycle route crossings or locations where bike facilities/trails cross roads at mid-block locations. RRFBs must be in accordance with FHWA’s Interim Approval (IA-21), issued on March 20, 2018. WSDOT has already resubmitted, and received approval from
FHWA, to use the RRFB.
Exhibit 4-4 below describes the conditions under which RRFBs, alternate beacons, and advance beacons should be used. Installation on roadways with a posted speed greater than
40 mph requires a crossing study with approval from the Region Traffic Engineer. At any location type marked as “Optional” or “Not required”, RRFB’s or other pedestrian beacons may be installed by the local jurisdiction, but the local jurisdiction is responsible for all costs and materials for installation, maintenance, and repairs. A crossing study by WSDOT is not required for systems installed by the local jurisdiction.

The locations of the primary and advance beacons varies with the configuration of the roadway. Beacons shall be placed as shown in the IS-23 details (available on the IS-22 web page at www.wsdot.wa.gov/Design/Standards/PlanSheet/IS-22.htm.
Where Advance Circular Beacons are installed due to crosswalk sight distance, they shall operate continuously. All other advance beacons shall be pedestrian activated with the beacons at the crossing.
If advance circular beacons are used, then use a minimum 8-inch displays for roadways with a posted speed limit of 35 MPH or less and 12-inch displays for roadways with a posted speed limit of 40 MPH or higher. Exhibit 4-5 provides guidance on where to place beacons based upon roadway lane configuration.

Roadway Bicycle Facilities
WSDOT is the steward of a multimodal transportation system and this system includes facilities for bicyclists and users of mobility assistive devices and encourages bicycle use on and interconnecting with its facilities. Bicycle facilities or improvements for bicycle transportation are included in WSDOT’s project development and highway programming processes.7 When choosing the bicycle facility keep in mind that lower stress facilities attract more users, in particular the “interested but concerned” potential users because bicycle facilities decrease exposure to moving motor vehicle traffic.
Designing for current, confident riders does less to support mode shift than designing for people of all ages and abilities. 7

Shoulder Rumble Strips
Rumble strips are milled grooves or rows of raised pavement markers placed perpendicular to the direction of travel, or a continuous sinusoidal pattern milled longitudinal to the direction of travel, intended to alert inattentive drivers to a potential lane departure. The sinusoidal pattern can be used when a low noise design is desired. Rumble strips including those placed on the shoulder are considered a proven safety countermeasure by FHWA and can reduce fatal and injury crashes on two-lane rural highways by 36 percent.11
Although rumble strips are a proven roadway safety feature they can affect other users of the roadway, particularly bicyclists. WSDOT serves all roadway users, therefore designs should consider safety purpose and assume the potential presence of active transportation users regardless of the level of usage. Additional information to determine level of bicycle usage include: • Local transportation maps. These maps may be generated at the regional level in a
Metropolitan Planning Organization or Regional Transportation Planning Organization such as bike map for Thurston Regional Planning Council in Thurston County, WA. • WSDOT Bicycle and Pedestrian Count Portal • Active Transportation Division’s State Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinator is a good resource for information on how a particular segment fits into the statewide active transportation network. • Local bicycle groups. Note: When meeting with local bicycle groups include discussion of project needs, safety data, and why rumble strips are being considered. Be open to discuss how to balance all competing and complementary uses of the transportation systems. Also, it is helpful to become familiar with what national advocacy groups are recommending to their membership. Once such National advocacy organization is
Adventure Cycling Association has a website regarding rumble strips and recognizes
WSDOT practices for being bicycle friendly. • Design accommodations for bicyclists should consider within the context, volumes, and adjacent land use: – The design, spacing and placement of rumble strips on roads with signif-icant bicycle traffic and if appropriate how other safety strategies such as wide edge lines, improved curve signing, or speed management if appro-priate for context and land use might work to address the crash potential for all users. • Adjusting rumble strip dimensions12 • Reduce width. For example consider 5 to 6 inch wide rumble strips instead of 12 and
16 inches. If used check for any documentation requirements in the Design Manual. • Reduce depth. For example consider 3/8 inch grooves instead of ½”

Multimodal Planning, Design, and Operational Considerations • Place rumble strips on edge line. The practice allows the placing the edge line pavement markings over the rumble strip. This improves nighttime marking visibility, particularly in wet conditions, by better positioning the marking optics on the back side of each rumble. This practice can also increase the longevity of the markings, particularly within the rumble, due to reduced wear from tires and added protection from plowing activity. • Re-purpose roadway pavement surface if shoulder widening is not possible. Consider narrowing lane width to increase shoulder width to be at least 4’ of usable shoulder or 5’ along barrier. • Providing gaps in periodic cycles to allow opportunities to move across the pattern without riding on the grooves. See Standard Plan M-60.20 for examples of different gap patterns. For highways that allow cyclists this should be considered customary practice. • Providing gaps before and through intersections, manholes, and other objects within the roadway. • Discontinue next to barriers and on downhill side of grades.
Other considerations include effects to future pavement preservation and most specifically bituminous surface treatments. Although it is preferred by the biking community to place rumble strips on the white edge line the rumble strip may be filled in by future bituminous surface treatment. To plan for countermeasures longevity consult with pavement management plans. If the roadway is to be resurfaced in the near future consider the following: • Incorporate into future resurfacing project; or • Delay the rumble strip installation until after roadway is resurfaced.
Consult the Standard Plans (rumble strips) or Plan Sheet Library (rumble stripes) for patterns design guidance. NCHRP Report 641 Guidance for Design and Application of Shoulder and
Centerline Rumble Strips is a good reference.

Active Transportation Design Considerations 1.
Design to reduce speeds – Speed affects severity of pedestrian crashes. As vehicle speeds increase pedestrians and bicyclists who are struck by a driver are more likely to die or serious injury. Also see the Washington State Strategic Highway Safety
Plan, Target Zero, Pedestrian & Bicycle section speed management strategies for consideration. Exhibit 4-7 illustrates the effect of speed on pedestrian survivability.

4.
Network Connectivity – A fundamental concept of transportation is network connectivity: connecting people to where they want to go. Motorists can rely on having access to a complete network. However, this is not the case for pedestrians and bicyclists. Lack of connected infrastructure creates conflict zones with drivers, and higher potential for crashes. Disconnected street networks, highway or railroad barriers, high-crash or uncomfortable intersections, and difficult midblock crossings must be addressed to improve network connectivity and reduce crash exposure.
Appropriate treatments along roadways vary widely based on context. Often times the first place to examine system gaps and opportunities are local plans and maps. 5.
Separate active transportation users from drivers – Exposure to moving motor vehicle traffic can be stressful for people walking and riding bicycles which affects both the appeal of active transportation options and actual trip safety. Comfort and exposure to crashes are closely related. Higher comfort facilities lower crash exposure by locating higher speed heavier vehicles further from lower speed and lighter active transportation. Improved connectivity and comfort for active transportation users benefits all roadway users by providing visibility and predictability, leading to better perception and reaction within the roadway environment.

Low cost countermeasures – These projects offer opportunities to improve conditions for other roadway users using low cost measures especially in urban and rural town contexts where budget constraints would otherwise prevent installation of an improvement. Considerations could include updating older pedestrian crossing signs, replacing/enlarging school zone beacons, adding painted bulb-outs at intersections, and/or narrowing wide lanes to allow wider shoulders or bike lane buffers. There also may be opportunities to partner with other organization efforts such as signal replacement program, etc. that may allow for more cost effective solutions that benefit more roadway users and WSDOT programs.

Bicycle Treatments
Green Bicycle Boxes. A green bicycle box is helpful for routes that are also used as freight routes in order for drivers to better see bicyclists by situating them ahead of drivers at intersections.
Green Bicycle Lane Extensions
Source: AASHTO
Bicycle signals can be used to improve truck and bicycle safety at intersections by separating the turning and allowing for increased conflict point management.
Allowing for independent or early movement of bikes, given their much smaller size increases visibility and allows for necessary maneuvers such as lane changing to occur without higher speed vehicles at intersections.
Protected bike lanes. Protected bike lanes are defined by their separation from the sidewalk and the roadway. Protected bike lanes that are part of a freight network, can provide higher visibility and predictability, information for all travelers. If a protected bike lane cannot be accommodated, a buffered bike lane with vertical separators is recommended.
C.
Curb Extensions

Curb Extension
Source: PedSafe curb extensions extend the curb face to the edge of the nearest driving lane. The curb extension takes the place of a parking lane or shoulder at an intersection or midblock location. They are most commonly applied at intersections where they are intended to reduce the exposure to pedestrian by reducing crossing distance, slowing right-turning vehicles, increasing the line of site between motorists and pedestrians; and providing more space for landscaping or stormwater management, among other features. Curb extensions are also seen in mid-block situations to slow vehicle speeds and reduce crossing distances at mid-block crossings. Curb extensions can affect bicyclist mobility; that design needs to take this into consideration. The description for alternative to pedestrian refuge islands in this section provides an example on how to accommodate bicycles. Also see Design Manual

Pedestrian Refuge Islands
A pedestrian refuge island is typically constructed in the middle of a street at an intersection or midblock locations. It provides a place for pedestrians to stand and wait for a gap in traffic or for drivers to stop. Whereas medians can vary in width, and composition, the minimum width of an island or median to be considered a pedestrian refuge is six feet.
Pedestrian Reguge Island (before/after)
Source: NACTO
Pedestrian refuge islands are considered a proven safety strategy by FHWA with an expected 56 percent reduction in pedestrian crashes. Washington State Strategic Highway
Safety Plan, Target Zero, recommends refuge islands at pedestrian crossings to reduce crash potential.13
This countermeasure is highly desirable for midblock pedestrian crossings on roads with four or more lanes. Some key points are that pedestrian refuge islands minimize the exposed crossing distance; reduce the conflict area; allows pedestrians time to decide to cross one direction at a time; and minimize the effects on vehicular traffic. See Design Manual Chapter
1510 for accessibility Criteria for Raised Medians and Traffic Islands. Also see MUTCD
Sections 3B.10—Approach Markings for Obstructions, 3B.18— Crosswalk Markings, and 3B.23—Curb Markings that provide information regarding use of signs and markings when raised medians or traffic islands are installed. See Standard Plan F-45.10 for dimensions and examples of median cut-through.

I.
Pedestrian Refuge Islands (Alternatives)
A median is the portion of the roadway separating the traveled lane portions of opposing directions, or turn lanes. Medians may be depressed, raised, or ﬂush with the road surface.
Medians less than six feet and not raised do not qualify as a pedestrian refuge. However, they still provide benefits by narrowing the roadway, providing additional and more visible delineation, and contributing to speed management could be considered a low cost modification.
Edge line pedestrian medians can be considered at midblock locations or intersections where turn lanes need to remain. They can also be used in combination with pedestrian refuge islands to shorten the pedestrian crossing distance. These islands differ from medians and pedestrian refuge islands in that they align with the edge of the travel lane and have a bike lane behind them. 13

Pedestrian Signals including Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons (PHBs) and
Half Signals
In some locations drivers may need to come to a complete stop to allow pedestrians to cross a roadway. A pedestrian traffic signal or PHB may be the preferred countermeasure.
These are candidate treatments for crosswalks across roads with three or more lanes that generally have traffic volumes above 9,000 vehicles. Refer to Exhibit 4-2 for other conditions where Pedestrian Signals and PHBs should be considered and MUTCD Sections 4C.05 Pedestrian Volume warrants and 4F-pedestrian hybrid beacons for their application.
Currently the FHWA does not recommend half signals (see Sections 4C.05 and 4C.06 of
MUTCD) nor placing PHB’s at intersections (see Section 4F.02 of MUTCD). Pedestrian signals and PHB’s can be used at roundabout intersection crossings and one- way approaches to intersections such as freeway exit ramps.
Currently, WSDOT prefers the use of pedestrian signals or rectangular rapid flashing beacons (RRFB) over PHB’s due to maintenance and compatibility with existing systems.
If a pedestrian traffic signal or PHB is being considered also examine the feasibility of a raised crosswalk or roundabout at the study location or adjacent intersection. Roundabouts slow driving speeds, provide refuge areas for pedestrians. For more information regarding roundabouts with pedestrians and bicyclists see FHWA Roundabouts with Pedestrians &

K.
Rapid Flash Beacon (RRFB)
RRFB’s are active (user-actuated) or passive (automated detection) amber LEDs that use an irregular flash pattern at mid-block or uncontrolled crossing locations. They significantly increase driver yielding behavior. See Section 4-6.3 for additional guidance on use of RRFB on State Highways.

Road Reallocation for All Modes (Also called Road Diets)
A road reconfiguration, also called a road diet, is a technique in transportation planning whereby the number of motor vehicle travel lanes and/or effective width of the road is reduced in order to achieve systemic improvements. FHWA considers road diets a proven safety strategy to reduce severe crashes. See Section 4-9 for more detailed discussion of roadway relocation.

M. Roundabouts
A roundabout is a type of circular intersection, but is quite unlike a neighborhood traffic circle or large rotary. Roundabouts have been proven safer and more efficient than other types of circular intersections. FHWA identified roundabouts as a Proven Safety
Countermeasure because of their ability to substantially reduce the types of crashes that result in injury or loss of life. Roundabouts are designed to improve safety for all users, including pedestrians and bicycles. They also provide significant operational benefits compared to conventional intersections. Benefits of roundabouts to walkers and bikers include:
Less conflict: Roundabouts have fewer conflict points. A single lane roundabout has 50% fewer pedestrian-vehicle conflict points than a comparable stop or signal controlled intersection. Conflicts between bicycles and vehicles are reduced as well.
Shorter, setback crossings: Pedestrians cross a shorter distance of only one direction of traffic at a time since the entering and exiting flows are separated. Drivers focus on pedestrians apart from entering, circulating and exiting maneuvers.
Lower Speeds: Traffic speed any road or intersection is important for everyone, and especially non-motorized users. Lower speeds is associated with better yielding rates, reduced vehicle stopping distance, and lower risk of serious injury or fatality. Also the speed through a roundabout is more consistent with comfortable bicycle riding speeds.
N.
Raised Crosswalks
Raised Crosswalk
Raised crosswalks function as an extension of a sidewalk and allow a pedestrian to cross the Interstate 35 off-ramp in Austin, Texas
Source: Google street without moving down to street level. The elevated crossing draws attention to the crosswalk. Drivers slow down to cross the raised pedestrian crosswalk. It offers particular benefits for pedestrians using mobility assistance devices such as wheelchairs or walkers; consider land use, transit access and destinations that indicate potential for larger numbers of these users.

Page 4-34
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Multimodal Planning, Design, and Operational Considerations
Chapter 4
FHWA suggests a raised crosswalk is typically a candidate treatment on two-lane or threelane roads with speed limits of 30 mph or less and traffic volumes below 9,000. FHWA also suggested raised crossings are generally avoided on truck routes, emergency routes, and arterial streets. NACTO on the other hand suggests speed tables may be used on collector streets and/or transit and emergency response routes with vehicle operating speeds between 25 mph and 45 mph. Coordinate with emergency services and transit agencies when considering raised crossings.
See MUTCD Section 3B.25—Speed Hump Markings for additional information about markings that can be used alongside raised crosswalks.

Tighter Curb Radii

Tighter curb radius between driver and pedestrian, shorten the
Source: PedSafe crossing distance time to reduce exposure, bring crosswalks closer to the intersection, shortening crossing distances, and reduce speeds of right-turning drivers. The appropriate radius should be determined for each corner on a case by case based on the design vehicle for each right turn movement. Some key points are that each leg of an intersection may have a different design vehicle; that WSDOT policy provides flexibility when choosing the intersection design vehicle. The purpose for this policy is to balance user needs and avoid the unnecessary expense of oversizing intersections. Considerations include frequency of the design vehicle and effects on other design users, specifically pedestrian crossing distance and times, and bicycle turning and through movements. Consider providing more protected intersection treatments and Section 4-8 of this chapter for discussing about accommodating design vehicles and compound curves for right turn lanes.
Compound right turn curves provides a path that accommodates larger design vehicles and provides a tighter curb radii.

Public Transportation
The need for public transportation in Washington continues to grow in many different ways. Washington is a diverse state with various public transportation markets such as urban and rural, commuter and off-peak, regional and local; and services, such as fixed-route, on-demand, bike/pedestrian facilities, telework, demand management tools and more. The figure below provides examples of different types of public transportation.
M 51-02.10
Definition
Public Transportation includes a broad array of transportation services and systems, public and private, that are accessible and available to the public and do not involve a single person in a motorized vehicle.
Page 4-37 Chapter 4
Multimodal Planning, Design, and Operational Considerations
Washington’s economy benefits demonstrably from public transportation’s contribution to access, mobility and capacity of the transportation system.
Delays on state highways, which are only a portion of the transportation system, cost Washington citizens and businesses over $800 million in 2014.1414 By increasing the person-carrying capacity of our roadways, public transportation supports the speed and reliability of freight movement critical to our statewide economy, and reduces crash potential by lowering the amount of vehicles on the roadway.

WSDOT right-of-way can relate to travel time and reliability of service. It may also be to provide access to key destinations, such as schools, hospitals, recreational destinations, or places of business.
Public transportation also benefits the financial well-being of individuals in Washington
State. For example, a person who lives in Seattle can save up to $11,000 a year by simply switching from driving to riding the bus.15 Transit is also important to support growth; space is currency as the transportation system strains from traffic demands. Transit will increase in importance as communities, transit agencies, local agencies, and WSDOT examine ways to maximize the efficiency of the existing transportation system. Exhibit 4-8 illustrates the space needed for different transportation modes.

A robust public transportation network can also support the development of compact, walkable, bikeable communities with lower infrastructure demands and can create hubs of activity that support local economies. 4-7.1
Traffic Operations Role in Public Transportation
WSDOT plays an important role in transit service as state routes affects the quality and safety of transit services. Transit routes often span many jurisdictions and one of our roles is to facilitate project development and coordinate with stakeholders.

Leading through Collaboration
All transportation partners in Washington state work together to provide a system of diverse and integrated public transportation options.
WSDOT plays an important role to help integrate station
People throughout the connections with the surrounding transportation network state use these options to such as highways, local roads, communities, and park make transportation choices and ride lots. A complete trip from origin to destination that enable their families, typically involves one or more connections at either end. communities, economy and environment to thrive. Public
These connections are an important aspect of transit, transportation also ensures and can make the difference between efficient and the reliability, travel time, and inefficient service. This is often referred to as first-mile sustainability of the integrated and last-mile access. Improvements to transit access could transportation system, include looking for off-system solutions such as sidewalk including WSDOT owned right connections into neighborhoods, commercial areas, public of way and facilities. facilities, regional trails, or other strategies developed in coordination with project stakeholders. Off-system solutions are supported by Practical
WSDOT also reviews those facilities directly supporting transit stops and stations such as sidewalks, pathways, and lighting around transit stops and stations. Adding appropriate improvements to projects supports local and regional transit services. Contact transit agencies as part of the project scoping and look for cooperative partnerships to improve transit services.
Section 4-7.2 provides examples of ways to improve public transportation on WSDOT, local agency, or developer projects.

Bus Travel Time and Reliability and Bus Rapid Transit Considerations
Transit agencies in Washington are implementing
Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and other bus speed and reliability treatments on WSDOT roads. Treatments such as transit signal priority (TSP), Business Access and Transit (BAT) lanes, and bus queue jumps are part of creating effective bus service, which increases the person-carrying capacity of
WSDOT facilities in a cost-effective manner meeting
WSDOT’s strategic vision. 1.
Partnership

What is Bus Rapid Transit?
BRT can best be described as a combination of facility, systems, and vehicle investments that convert conventional bus services into fixed-facility transit service, greatly increasing their efficiency and effectiveness to the end user.
Consider public transportation agencies as partners working toward common goals. While mindful of core issues such as safety and ongoing operating costs, work with transit agencies to support the WSDOT overall mission and vision. BRT projects differ from private development projects in that the former generate vehicle trips while the later reduce vehicle trips. 2.

Identify process to navigate issues as they arise to minimize effects on scope, schedule, and budget. This would be a multi-agency process and should include all involved
WSDOT offices, which may include one or more WSDOT regions, HQ Traffic, and the
Regional Transit Coordination Division (in central Puget Sound). 3.
Practical Solutions
Follow the intent of Design Manual Practical purpose and context. Work with the transit agency to define baseline needs and measures, such as transit travel time, transit reliability, transit priority, pedestrian access to stations, connectivity between transit routes, and safety. Contextual needs should include examination of existing general purpose vehicle travel, impacts to active transportation travel/safety, existing/planned land use. 4.
Performance Measures.

What are baseline needs for transit projects? • Reducing transit travel time • Increasing transit reliability • Improving transit connections • Improving transit priority • Improving pedestrian and bicycle access to stations • Enhancing system identity • Increasing travel comfort • Enhancing safety & security
Identify key performance measures that will guide guidance on defining baseline needs, performance metrics, and contextual needs.
When considering performance metrics consider transportation measures beyond vehicle based capacity analysis. Also see Section 4-5.

Traffic and Intersection Control Analysis Coordination and Quality Control
Traffic analysis and intersection control evaluations including BRT systems include complicated traffic interactions. Amplified coordination should be conducted between the department, transit agency, consultant team(s), and other affected agencies.
Coordination is necessary to communicate expectations, reduce misunderstandings, and promote efficiency and quality control. This helps reduce unexpected issues, delays, and extra costs.

6.
Example QA/QC process
The Protocol for Vissim simulation can be adapted to for corridor and intersection evaluations and Region traffic offices should require that the transit agency’s consultant to prepare a plan prior to beginning a traffic study or intersection control evaluation.
Design Considerations • Many of the active transportation design considerations mentioned in Section 4-11.4 and 4-12.2 of this section apply to Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). • BRT systems may run in a dedicated pathway separate from the general purpose lanes of traffic. As such, they are expected to run independent of other traffic.
At intersections, however, the BRT system must interact with general traffic. • BRT vehicles may need priority or pre-emption at signalized intersections. • Roundabouts have shown efficiencies, serious and fatal injury crash reductions, and travel time improvements when applied as corridor improvements. This may allow for narrower cross sections between intersections that can be re-allocated for other modes. Roundabouts may be signalized or metered to allow for transit priority.
Concerns expressed by transit agencies include roundabouts do not provide bus priority, create long walking distances, or cost more than preferred traffic signal improvements. Contact HQ Traffic Operations for design and operations modeling assistance. • Pedestrian and bicycle crossings are an important aspect of BRT designs, especially for connecting to other BRT routes, light rail, or other public transportation or bike share systems. Additional crossings may be necessary at median stops. The Traffic
Impact Analysis and ICE should include pedestrian and bicycle access design to BRT stops. Contact HQ Traffic Operations for design assistance. Bike lanes running on the same roadways also require consideration to reduce conflicts with buses and transit users. • BRT vehicles dimensions vary and their turning radii can affect intersection design and interaction with general traffic. For example, an articulated bus typically has a tighter turning radius than the 40 foot coaches. It is important for the designer to check with local transit agency to get information to use in modeling swept paths.
AutoTURN default inputs may not always represent coach turning movements. • BRT projects at the core are people moving projects. Look for opportunities to increase the number, and improve the safety and convenience, of active transportation facilities on and adjacent to BRT routes including first and last mile connections. 7.
Operations and Maintenance • Identify infrastructure elements and agency maintenance responsibilities.
Responsibilities should be included in an inter-governmental agreement.

Freight Economics they need. Virtually every business and household depend
On a per capita basis, on freight delivery for shipping and receiving goods –
Washington is the secondin many cases multiple times a day. The growth of most trade-dependent state in the nation, behind Michigan, ecommerce has increased the simplicity of purchasing with total imports and exports products and masks the details of a complicated system valued at $126.8 billion. that permits and sustains such activity. Freight - 2017 Washington State transportation and goods movement involves a complex
Freight System Plan and dynamic network of logistics and supply chains. Freight logistics relies on the multimodal transportation system in Washington. As a result this multimodal system is vital to the economy of the state and country in many ways.
It underpins the national and state economies, supports national defense, directly sustains hundreds of thousands of jobs, and delivers the daily necessities of life to residents.
As the population grows freight traffic or distribution of products will grow to and adapt as the ways to order and deliver goods and services changes. Freight traffic in Washington
State is expected to grow by about 30 percent by 2035.
How WSDOT designs highways could have an effects on freight mobility? This section will cover two concepts: 1) background on the freight network in Washington State and; 2) Examples of design considerations when dealing with freight as part of the multimodal network.

Freight Transportation System
The following is an introduction to the various freight networks in Washington State. These networks will help define modal priorities and context for the project. See Design Manual
A.
National Multimodal Freight Network (interim)
This network, when finalized, is intended to inform freight transportation planning and funding processes. NFMN maps for Washington State are available from the USDOT.
B.

National Highway System
The National Highway System (NHS) is considered the backbone of the nation’s economy, as well as being critical to its defense and mobility networks. The NHS is an important component of the eligibility criteria for the Nationally Significant Freight and Highway
Projects Program for highway or bridge projects. A total of 4,556 centerline miles are designated as NHS routes in Washington, including 3,577 miles of state highways and 979 miles of local roads. Subsets of the NHS include: • Intermodal Connectors. These highways provide access between major intermodal facilities and the other four subsystems making up the National Highway System.
There are 87 designated NHS intermodal connectors in Washington, some of which are freight-related. Port intermodal connectors are the most common type of freight intermodal connector representing 45 percent of all NHS intermodal connectors in the state. • Strategic Highway Network. The Strategic Highway Network (STRAHNET) is a designated national network that is important to national strategic defense and used for emergency mobilization and peacetime movement of military vehicles. This 63,000-mile network provides defense access, continuity, and emergency capabilities for defense purposes. This network is a component of the NHS.
C.
National Highway Freight Network with WSDOT and other partners to strategically direct federal resources and policies toward improved performance of highway portions of the U.S. freight transportation system.
Components of the NHFN include: • Primary Highway Freight Systems (PHFS) is a network of highways identified as the most critical highway portions of the U.S. freight transportation system determined by measurable and objective national data. The network consists of 41,518 centerlines miles, including 37,436 centerline miles of Interstate and 4,082 centerline miles of nonInterstate roads. 16

Chapter 4 • Non-Primary Highway Freight Systems (non-PHFS). These highways consist of the remaining portion of Interstate roads not included in the PHFS. These routes provide important continuity and access to freight transportation facilities. These portions amount to an estimated 9,843 centerline miles of Interstate, nationwide, and will fluctuate with additions and deletions to the Interstate Highway System. • Critical Rural Freight Corridors (CRFC). These are public roads not in an urbanized area which provide access and connection to the PHFS and the Interstate with other important ports, public transportation facilities, or other intermodal freight facilities.
Nationwide, there are 4,412 centerline miles designated as CRFCs. • Critical Urban Freight Corridors (CUFC). These are public roads in urbanized areas which provide access and connection to the PHFS and the Interstate with other ports, public transportation facilities, or other intermodal transportation facilities. Nationwide, there are 2,213 centerline miles designated as CUFCs.
D.
Freight and Goods Transportation System
The Freight and Goods Transportation System (FGTS) is a Washington-specific designation system, separate from the national designation. FGTS truck corridors classifies all highways, county roads, and city streets by reported annual gross truck tonnage, ranging from T-1, with the highest tonnage, to T-5, with the least tonnage. Corridor classification and maps can be found at the WSDOT FGTS website.
E.
Truck Freight Economic Corridors
The designations were built on the FGTS classification by considering resiliency and firstmile and last-mile connectivity. A truck freight economic corridor designation helps inform how freight connectors are being used by industry, and inform future planning efforts to identify the needs and opportunities for improving those connectors. The Truck Freight
Economic Corridors include the following components: • High volume truck corridors: T-1 and T-2 freight corridors (as defined in the FGTS) carrying at least 4 million tons of gross truck tonnage per year. • Alternate freight routes: routes that serve as alternatives to primary cross-state freight routes during severe weather or other disruptions to increase freight system resiliency. • First-mile or last-mile connector routes: routes that connect freight intensive land uses to high volume and alternate routes. These routes provide important freight linkage to strategic national defense facilities, significant intermodal facilities, warehouse districts, industrial land and distribution centers, and agricultural processing centers.

Types of Trucks
Trucks and buses come in a variety of sizes.
These sizes and overall dimensions are dictated by the type of transit route or goods, materials, being transported. Trucks typically range from 8.5- to 10.0-feet wide, and with permits can be even wider.
The American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) has classified the most common sized trucks on United States roadways based either on the overall length of the vehicle (buses and single unit trucks) or vehicle wheel base (tractor-trailers). The classifications include but are not limited to: • SU-30: 30.0-foot, single unit vehicles typical of most local delivery vehicles. • WB-40 and WB-50: small tractor trailers with wheelbases in the 40.0-foot and 50.0-foot range. • WB-67: 67-foot wheelbase long haul trucks, sometimes called the interstate design vehicle that has an overall length on the order of 74.0-feet.
Transit agencies operate a wide variety of city buses.
For purposes of determining the swept path contact transit agencies affected by the project to city bus dimensions and turning specifications.
Other vehicles include various emergency vehicles, and public works maintenance trucks.
The figure on this page shows the typical dimensions of the most commonly used AASHTO design vehicles.
Additional information on these and other design vehicles can be found in the AASHTO
Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.

Chapter 4
Design for” versus “Accommodate” appropriate design vehicle, many factors such as the number and type of trucks, functional classification of the highway, transit use, pedestrians and bicyclist shall be considered. See
The concept of design vehicle involves providing a path for the vehicle that is free of encroachments upon other lanes, and facilities such as sidewalks. The Design Vehicle is the largest typical vehicle that will commonly use the street. It is acceptable for the design vehicle to use all of the first lane, and part of the second lane of the receiving street. In multilane roundabouts, it is considered “designing” for large trucks for them to take both lanes to navigate the roundabout.
Providing a design that accommodates a vehicle means that some level of encroachment upon other lanes is inevitable for the vehicle to make a particular movement. The accommodated vehicle is the largest vehicle that will rarely use the street. It is expected to use mountable elements, and may enter the lane adjacent to its lane of origin. The decision to design or accommodate will be based upon the context of the highway/ intersection under consideration. A balanced design approach takes into consideration more than just the amount of room required by the design vehicle. For example: • What is the intended operating speed of the facility? • What is the context? Designing for the largest but rare vehicle may result in an overdesigned intersection that is not compatible with other modes. • How does the design affect pedestrians and bicyclists? For example, large turning radii at intersections increase the speed of drivers making the turns, and the time it takes to cross the road for pedestrians. So, designing for a large design vehicle will increase speeds and travel distances for all users, thereby increasing crash potential for all road users without proper consideration of the potential effects.

Oversize-Overweight and other unique vehicles
Planning for freight does not end with selecting a standard design vehicle. Other types of freight traffic may be affected by a highway or intersection project. For example if the highway is near a port then accommodating very long loads such as wind turbine blades may be necessary. Identifying vehicle types includes reviewing the surrounding land use, transit plans, community input. Contact the Rail, Freight, and Ports Division and Commercial Vehicle
Services to obtain information on how a unique freight could possible effect the project site.

Emerging freight delivery modes
Bicycle delivery in urban areas represents another freight delivery mode that may be a factor. Cargo bicycles and tricycles are wider than a traditional two-wheeled bicycle. In some locations a freight corridor may provide the only feasible connection for the active transportation network. 4-8.6
A.

Design Considerations
Multi-centered Corners (Compound Curves)
When trucks turn, particularly tractor-trailers, they sweep a path that can best be simulated by a series of curves. A simplified approach shown by the figure to the right would use two or three compound curves to best match the pathway of the truck. By using this approach, the full swept path of the design vehicle can be designed for and larger vehicles checked for accommodation, if appropriate, while still minimizing the amount of roadway surface.
Minimizing roadway surface also manages crossing distances, signal pole arm lengths, maintenance, improves distance vehicles travel through the intersection, and reduces project cost. These designs also allow for a tighter radius corner, which will help promote speed reduction for drivers of smaller vehicles making the turn. This figure illustrates this.

Setback for Stop Bar Placement
Signalized intersections can be striped to improve the overall geometry for turning trucks without compromising traffic engineering requirements. Stop bar location on both the street a truck is turning from, as well as the cross street approach the truck driver is turning into, can have a dramatic effect on the accommodation of truck driver turning movements.
Moving back the STOP bar can also assist pedestrian crossing movements and allow for a relatively small curb radii. 2. Setback for Stop Bar Placement

Mountable Curbs
Mountable curbs can provide a means for a large truck to more easily navigate while making a turn. These types of curbs are mostly useful for at driveways, intersections, medians, or splitter islands. Use at intersection corners; however, should only be considered on a limited basis and must be carefully designed to minimize trucks from overrunning pedestrian areas. Mountable curbs are also used at roundabouts. Standard Plans Section F has several mountable curb options including Standard Plan F-10.18 that is specific to roundabouts. 3. Mountable Curbs
D.
Left Turn Medians
Left turning vehicles are generally more controlled than right turning vehicles due to a greater number of vehicle-to-vehicle conflicts. Goods movement and livability concerns focus heavily on median nose treatments. Medians can provide pedestrian refuge, especially for large intersections. Full curb medians are most effective for pedestrian safety, but reduce the turning area for large vehicles. They also can be easily damaged if a truck’s rear wheels run over them. Mountable and painted treatments are sometimes used, but can introduce conflicts between pedestrians and trucks. Truncating the median nose prior to the crosswalk is another option, but will not provide pedestrian refuge.
E.
Bicycle Treatments
Bike boxes, bicycle signals, and protected bike lanes can be helpful for routes that are also used as freight routes. See Section 4-6.6 for further rther information. inf
Green Bicycle Boxes – A green bicycle box is helpful for routes that are also used as freight routes in order for drivers to better see bicyclists by situating them ahead of drivers at intersections.

Chapter 4 5. Roundabouts
Roundabouts
User perspectives regarding roundabouts are generally very context-sensitive. For 5.pedestrians 5. Roundabouts and bicyclists, roundabouts can be particularly effective in creating a more comfortable operating environment for all roadway users. Motorists benefit from roundabouts where delays and crash severities are substantially reduced and safety improved compared to stop-control or signal-control. Even if there are peak times when motorists are delayed at a roundabout, the peak hour delay needs to be considered with respect to the overall daily delay benefit. Truck drivers can similarly benefit from reduced delays, particularly where the cost of coming to, and accelerating from, a full stop can be eliminated; but care in design is necessary to all for a roundabout design that accommodates large vehicles.
Roundabouts can require more right-of-way than typical intersections at the immediate junction, but less right-of-way upstream due to the ability to reduce turn lane lengths or eliminate turn-lanes. Specific considerations regarding roundabouts are in Design Manual

Work Zones
Effective temporary traffic control strategies allow all road users to successfully maneuver through or around work areas while still permitting needed work to be completed efficiently and economically. Chapter 5 provides a detailed work zone discussion. The following are examples of work zone traffic management techniques that address commercial vehicles:
Road Narrowing and
Restricting Vehicle Clearance
If a construction or maintenance project is narrowing the roadway or restricting the vertical clearance, WSDOT
Commercial Vehicle Services needs to be contacted in advance.

Work Zone Queue Warning System. At 65 MPH, it may take fully loaded semi-tractor and trailers at least 7 seconds and
500 feet to stop per the Work Zone Safety Consortium.
It is critical for drivers of large truck to anticipate queued traffic and get slowed down in advance. Queue warning systems have reduced associated collisions up to 45 percent per the FHWA supported Work Zone Safety Consortium report. Examples of queue warning systems include Truck Mounted PCMS and Smart Work Zone Systems.
Portable Transverse Rumble Strips. Portable transverse rumble strips serve to increase driver alertness by providing both an audible warning and physical vibration as the vehicle’s tires cross over them.

Road Reallocation (aka Road Diets)
Wide street crossings can be major impediments
Benefits of Roadway to pedestrian access, connectivity, and increase crash reallocation potential; therefore, an effective countermeasure for
Four to three lane roadway pedestrians is a “road diet.” A roadway reallocation known conversions have documented as a road diet offers several high-value improvements at crash reductions from 19 to a low cost when applied to traditional undivided highways.
47 percent according to FHWA
The primary benefits include reduced crossing distance, space for separated travel, mobility, and access for road users and a “complete streets” environment to accommodate a variety of transportation modes. FHWA considers road diets a proven safety countermeasure due to proven effectiveness in reducing fatalities and serious injuries.
Lane diets involve reducing the width of the travel lanes and road diets involve removing one or more lanes of traffic and, in some cases, reducing the width of the travel lanes. The excess space is converted into space for pedestrians or cyclists, such as wider sidewalks, curb extensions, medians, pedestrian refuge areas, or bicycle facilities. In rural and suburban areas lane diets or narrowing can reduce intersection crash potential by reducing traffic speeds and improving conspicuity of intersections.17
Road diet benefits include a crash reduction of 19 to
47 percent of all crashes, all severities according to FHWA’s
Road Diets/Roadway Reconfiguration webpage. Road diets also result in reduced vehicle speed differential, improved mobility and access for all road users, and integration of the roadway into surrounding uses that results in an enhanced quality of life. A key feature of a road diet is that it allows reclaimed space to be allocated for other uses, such as turn lanes, bus lanes, pedestrian refuge islands, bike lanes, sidewalks, bus shelters, parking, or landscaping. Other road diet benefits include:

What about traffic volume?
FHWA advises roads with traffic volumes of 20,000 or less are good candidates for road reallocations. However,
City of Seattle has successfully implemented projects on roads greater than 20,000 vehicles per day. Reports on
City of Seattle’s road diets are available on their reports & studies website.
The key is to understand the purpose and need for intervention, understand community priorities, and communicate tradeoffs such as increased side street delays.
Often communities are willing to trade some additional peak hour congestion for safer more livable roads. • Reduced rear-end and left-turn crashes due to the dedicated left-turn lanes • Reduced right-angle crashes as side street motorists cross three versus four travel lanes • Fewer lanes for pedestrians to cross • Opportunity to install pedestrian refuge islands, bicycle lanes, on-street parking, and/or transit stops • Traffic calming and more consistent speeds • A more community-focused, “Complete Streets” environment that better accommodates the needs of all road users 17

Multimodal Planning, Design, and Operational Considerations
A road diet can be a low-cost safety solution when planned in conjunction with a simple pavement resurfacing project, and the reconfiguration can be accomplished at no additional cost. An example is provided Section 4-9.C where a roadway was simply re-striped after a chip seal application.
Road diets or lane diets are not appropriate for all roadways.
Careful analysis to help determine the feasibility needs to be done up front utilizing traffic count data, existing and future traffic volumes, type of road, and the need and purpose of the project to determine whether the street or road is suitable for a road or lane diet.
FHWA’s Road Diets/Roadway Reconfiguration webpage states a number of strategies may be considered to reconfigure the street to reduce vehicle and pedestrian crashes, while simultaneously increasing vehicle flow and reducing vehicle speeds.
A.
Design Considerations
When converting a four-lane road into a two-lane road with a two-way left turn lane, medians or pedestrian refuge areas may be placed at intersections or mid-block pedestrian crossing locations.
The practitioner should determine the types of vehicles that primarily use the street before reducing the lane widths.

Road Diet Plus
The Road Diet Plus is borne from the convergence of the standard road diet, the safety advantages of the modern roundabout, and the throughput advantages of the modern roundabout in a corridor. La Jolla Blvd in
San Diego is an example of a
Road Diet Plus. Priorities for this 23,000+ ADT corridor were livability, economic development, and traffic calming. Results included higher retail sales, lower noise, reduced traffic speeds,
90 percent drop in crashes, and spurred new development.
Source: January 10, 2018 article from Public Square.
A similar concept can be applied to state highway interchanges to reduce the need to widen structures and to provide the opportunity to reallocate space for other purposes.
A best management practice may be considered for utilizing mountable curbs on narrower lanes to accommodate larger vehicles.

Work Zone Traffic Control
General
Effective temporary traffic control strategies allow all road users to successfully maneuver through or around work areas while still permitting needed work to be completed efficiently and economically. The following goals apply to work zones: • Give safety highest priority for both highway workers and traveling public • Manage congestion to maintain mobility through and/or around work zones • Be cost effective with resources taxpayers and legislature entrust to us.
Work zone traffic control planning needs consideration early, as it greatly impacts how and what work is completed. Work zones are interdependent with design, construction, maintenance, and traffic operations; what happens to one affects the others. The better we understand these interactions, the more successful and cost effective projects will be.
There is no “cookbook” solution to all work zones; solutions require innovation, adaptation, and ingenuity. Work zone design and operation is as much art as science.
Properly mitigating work zone impacts to all road users is a critical component in the successful design, construction, maintenance, and operation of a fully functional highway system and is required by federal regulations and state policy.
Road users include, but are not limited to: • Pedestrians, including those with disabilities • Bicyclists • Motorists, including motorcyclists • Commercial Vehicle Freight operators, including oversized/overweight permitted vehicles • Transit operators and users 5-2
Federal and State Laws Applicable to Work Zones
Work zones are subject to numerous federal laws, state laws and codes, and standards that are critical to understand:

A.
Federal Laws
23 CFR Part 630 J focuses on work zone standards, policy, and processes: • The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (currently 2009 MUTCD) is the national standard for traffic control on all public roads • States shall develop policy to systematically consider and manage work zone impacts • All significant projects shall have Transportation Management Plans unless the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) grants an exception based on the State’s ability to show a specific project will not have sustained work zone impacts. • States shall perform a work zone process review at least every two years

Work Zone Principles & Considerations 1.
Guide all road users in a clear, positive, and safe manner through or around work zones utilizing sufficient signage, delineation, and channelization. Work zones should be “self-explanatory” to road users the maximum extent feasible. Abrupt, unexpected changes in roadway geometrics should be avoided. 2.
Consistent and proper installation of temporary traffic control devices to optimize road user expectancy and compliance which enhance work zone safety and improve mobility. 3.
Remove traffic control devices when they are no longer applicable, otherwise they may be soon disregarded. 4.
Avoid placing traffic control devices that inhibit movement of other road users unless accommodations are provided. • Maintain a clear temporary pedestrian accessible route of at least 48 inches in width or use 7-foot minimum mounting height when it is necessary to place traffic control signage within the limits of existing sidewalks 5.
Separate decision points; avoid having road users react to two events at the same location. • Avoid lane closure tapers adjacent to merging on-ramp traffic due to conflicting merges • Avoid lane closure or lane shift tapers within limits of horizontal curves

6.
Page 5-6
Consider positive protection devices whenever practical. Positive protection devices enhance safety for both road users and workers by using physical barriers not easily penetrated by errant vehicles, such as transportable attenuators or temporary barriers.
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control 7.
Chapter 5
Design work zones to operate in a manner consistent with the desired target speed dependent upon desired mobility, operation, and safety objectives. • Per MUTCD, drivers reduce their speeds only if they clearly perceive a need to do so • Avoid reductions greater than 10 mph below the existing speed limit unless a unique, restrictive condition is present. Work crews should also be present • Avoid “overdesigning” work zones (e.g. using a lane closure taper designed for
60 mph when a 45 mph work zone speed limit is posted) • All work zone speed limit reductions shall be approved per Secretary’s Executive
Order E 1060.02 and in compliance with Project Delivery Memo #19-01 8.
Manage adverse work zone impacts to road users overall while balancing the need to efficiently, economically, and safely complete work. • Regions may decide to implement closures with high traffic impacts occurring over shorter durations (days) versus traditional methods with lower traffic impacts occurring occur over several months or years. In particular, these aggressive closure strategies are justified when there are substantial benefits that more than offset the adverse traffic impacts including significant reduction in working days, considerable cost savings during construction, and enhanced safety benefits for both road users and workers. For such closures, Region Administrator approval should be obtained.

9.
Maintain effective public relations starting early in Design and lasting throughout
Construction phases for projects with high-impact closures. • During planning, work closely with stakeholders and local agencies to understand their concerns and needs during these closures as well as obtaining their concurrence. This will aid in avoiding surprises with unplanned, lengthy delays. • Develop traffic closure, detour, and/or alternative route schematics for the public and media use to visually explain the limits of the closure and how to navigate through and around them. • Explain the anticipated work zone congestion and delays as well as what time of day they are expected. • Consider different outreach tools (news coverage, social media, WSDOT blogs) • Encourage alternative modes of transportation (carpools and public transit) and to delay trips to early morning/late evening hours to manage work zone congestion

Work Zone Traffic Control
Work Zone Mobility, Corridor, and Network Management
The traditional practice of only permitting closure hours with minimal traffic impacts is still desirable on many roadways, but is becoming increasingly less feasible or economical due to higher traffic volumes persisting later into the evenings and beginning earlier in the mornings on congested corridors. Per Secretary Executive Order E 1001.02, traffic delays should be minimized while the safety of workers and the traveling public be the highest priority. Thus, proactive work zone congestion management strategies are necessary to effectively complete work while still maintaining mobility and maintaining safety. Work zone mobility management should be a priority beginning early in Design and continuing throughout Construction.
First and foremost, it is important to understand actual work hours are significantly less than the closure hours. In other words, for work operations such as HMA paving, a permitted 5-hour closure may only result in 2.5 working hours. If not addressed, this may result in the project duration extending into two construction seasons, also known as “wintering over”.
For the areas where reasonable duration of work shift is challenging to obtain, it may become necessary to select an extended closure duration resulting in congestion.
Therefore, it is necessary to understand the following: • When to avoid work zone congestion (Section 5-6.A) • Work zone congestion management strategies (Section 5-6.B) • Closure coordination along detours and alternative routes (Section 5-6.C) • Detour route considerations (Section 5-6.D)
For detailed guidance for various extended closure strategies see the following: • Extended Intermediate-Term Duration Closures (Section 5-7) • Long-Term Duration Closures & Reconfigurations (Section 5-8)

A.
When to Avoid Work Zone Congestion
Typical periods to avoid work zone congestion include certain times and events, such as the following: • During weekday AM/PM commutes & school hours
During weekday commutes there may be limited flexibility for alternative schedules or fewer discretionary trips, resulting in minimal traffic diversion and higher traffic impacts.
Morning and evening commute periods vary significantly in time and duration depending on its specific location and are best determined by obtaining actual traffic volumes or conduct field observations. Be sure to take into account local operations such as work shift changes at major corporations, school and daycare traffic, or other events that generate traffic surges over a short duration.
Without the availability of better data or information, then assume the following weekday commute hours in congested, urban areas: – AM Commute @ 4:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. – PM Commute @ 2:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.
Page 5-8
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5

Without the availability of better data or information, then assume the following weekday commute hours in more rural areas: – AM Commute @ 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. – PM Commute @ 2:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. • During Friday afternoons and Sundays on recreational routes
Recreational routes tend to experience much higher volumes on weekends, typically in the inbound direction Friday afternoons and the outbound direction on Sunday. Such roads include I-90 over Snoqualmie Pass, U.S. 2 over Stevens Pass, and SR109 between
Ocean Shores and Aberdeen.
Recreational periods vary significantly in time and duration depending on its specific location and are best determined by obtaining actual traffic volumes or conduct field observations. • During major regional special events
Major sporting events, concerts, fairs, etc. generate significant traffic volumes increases, typically up to two hours prior going towards the event (inbound) and up to two hours after existing the event (outbound). In contrast, all-day events tend to see increased volumes spread out over the day without the large “spikes” experienced with games or concerts. • During major statewide special events
Major special events can generate traffic across the state. Volumes on intrastate corridors such as Interstate 90 increase in one direction at the beginning of the weekend and then increase in the opposite direction at the end of the weekend. • During significant local special events
Significant local special events can generate large, but localized traffic impacts that need to be considered. Such events include runs, bike rides, or festivals.
B.
Work Zone Congestion Management Strategies
When causing work zone congestion, detailed work zone traffic analysis needs to be performed by the Region Traffic Operations to determine anticipated delays and queues (Section 5-9) when determining closures, permitted closure hours, and working with
TDGMO to determine the value of any interim liquidated damages.
The WSDOT Transportation Data, GIS & Modeling Office (TDGMO) can assistant Regions by providing work zone traffic analysis to help determine expected queuing and delays.
Only TDGMO has the authority to determine the maximum interim liquidate damage values;
Region Traffic Operations will assign the actual interim liquidated damage value for each closure based on the maximum allowable amounts determined by TDGMO (Section 5-14).
Based on the anticipated traffic impacts, additional work zone mobility, safety, and traffic demand management strategies may need to be considered: • Advanced Notification
Use Portable Changeable Message Signs (PCMSs) or Class A signs to provide notice at least one week notification in advance of closures with high traffic impacts.

WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10
Page 5-9 Chapter 5
Work Zone Traffic Control • Public Outreach
WSDOT Communications serves an invaluable role in reaching out to the general public and stakeholders. They serve as the “front-line” spokesperson for WSDOT by working with news media, utilizing social media, and responding to citizen inquires.
Using their established relationships with various stakeholders (including local interest groups), it is valuable to obtain concurrence, or at least understanding, of high-impact closures during Planning and Design before projects go to Construction.
During Construction, prior to the high-impact closures, WSDOT can collaborate with these stakeholders to help determine when high-impact closures occur to reduce adverse impacts as well as providing advanced notification. • WSDOT Traffic Management Centers (TMCs)
Utilizing their access to permanent variable message signs, Regional TMCs may provide advance notification for upcoming significant, high-impact closures and provide realtime information for major incidents and closure status. TMCs typically only provide supplemental messaging so critical messages (major incidents, silver alerts, blue alerts, etc.) can be displayed if necessary.
During Design, working with Region Traffic Operations, collaborate with the TMC to determine to what extent these permanent systems can supplement the project’s messaging methods (portable Highway Advisory Radio, PCMSs, etc.).
During Construction, working with Region Traffic Operations, provide TMCs notification of upcoming of high-impact closures preferably two weeks in advance.
On Active Traffic and Demand Management corridors (only present in the Northwest
Region at this time), lane usage symbols and speed limits can be displayed in real-time to supplement the temporary traffic control closures. • WSDOT Incident Response Team (IRT)
Because capacity is already minimized in work zones, vehicle breakdowns or collisions can have significant adverse traffic impacts if not resolved quickly. IRT minimizes response times by collaborating with WSDOT TMC, police and emergency agencies, and towing companies to relocate or remove the blocking vehicles quickly.
During significant high-impact closures, consider placing IRT and towing services (under
IRT’s direction) on standby in strategic work zone locations in the event disabled vehicles need to be quickly towed. See Section 5-16.E for details.
During Design, engage IRT to determine anticipated costs and ensure reimbursement funding is provided for this operation via internal accounting methods. Verify necessary
IRT staff is available and how they will be requested and utilized. • WSDOT Maintenance and Internal Staff Assistance
During major closures, advanced notification and closure notification signage may be necessary as far as 50 miles from the actual closure in isolated locations. An example of such a scenario would be a week-long closure of the Hood Canal Bridge where the shortest detour route is over 100 miles and 2½ hours.

Page 5-10
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5
Instead of arranging for Contractors to provide such services over such a vast area, an alternative approach is to arrange for the collaboration of several WSDOT Maintenance and/or IRT staff to perform duties in their own local areas. Ensure funding is available for reimbursement of services rendered via internal accounting methods. • WSDOT Signal Operations Assistance
During significant closures or detours, temporary adjustments to WSDOT- operated traffic signals may be necessary due to large increases in traffic along detour or alternative routes.
Engage the Region’s Signal Operations group during Design and then provide advanced notification in Construction preferably two weeks prior to the major closure. If needed, ensure funding is available for this operation for reimbursement for services rendered via internal accounting methods. • Local Agency Signal Operations Assistance
During significant closures or detours, temporary adjustments to Local Agency operated traffic signals may be necessary due to large increases in traffic along detour or alternative routes.
Engage the local agency during Design and then provide advanced notification in
Construction preferably two weeks prior to the major closure. Any agreements should be included in the Transportation Management Plan. • Motorist Use of GPS Technology
A majority of motorists use GPS for navigation purposes which may provide motorists an optional alternative route in real-time based on shortest travel time automatically (without needing extensive traffic control messaging) that effectively reduces work zone delays and queues by redistributing traffic across multiple corridors.

C.
Coordinate Closures along Detours & Alternative Routes during HighImpact Closures
It is critical to restrict concurrent lane or ramp closures on parallel, alternative routes during high-impact closures. In Design, it should be determined if such closure restrictions are necessary by working with the Region Traffic Operations. If needed, be sure to include the closure restrictions in the Contract PS&E.
During Construction, Region Traffic Operations may still allow these restricted lane or ramp closures to occur on a case-by-case basis, but may reduce allowable hours to account for the additional traffic volumes that will be diverted onto the detour or alternative route.
Example: A full closure of southbound Interstate 5 (SB I-5) is occurring overnight in
Vancouver, Washington. Thus, any concurrent lane closures along SB I-205 (parallel, alternative route) should be delayed until the work zone capacity can handle the additional traffic volumes from the SB I-5 closure. The SB I-5 to SB I-205 ramp should remain open during the SB I-5 as well as any ramps along the detour route or alternative route path.

Work Zone Traffic Control

D.
Detour Route Considerations
Detour routes using local agency roadways require detour agreements, which should be completed in Design and included in the Transportation Management Plan. Coordinate early with local agencies, especially for significant road or ramp closures. In Construction, collaboration is needed to prevent conflicting concurrent closures along the detour route.
Consider rather the detour route can accommodate commercial vehicles, particularly oversized/overweight permitted vehicles, during closures. If travel restrictions are necessary, contact WSDOT Commercial Vehicle Services in advance (Section 5-15).
Consider the detour route’s capacity. Of particular concern are signalized intersections at the beginning of the detour where only a single left-turn lane is provided operating as a protected movement (left only on green arrow).
Mitigations may include uniform police officers controlling traffic at any problematic intersections until traffic volumes are low enough to resume normal signal operation or to temporarily adjust signal timing.
Permissive-protect single left-turn lane, protected double left-turn lanes, and right turns serve greater traffic volumes and typically do not require additional mitigation.
Be cautious of all-way stop intersections along a detour route as they have capacities as low as 600 vehicles/hour (from all approaches).
Pedestrian and bicyclist detour routes should be short, in close proximity, and have accessibility features and grades comparable to the existing route to maximize their use.
Provide advanced closure signage at decision points far enough in advance to allow the opportunity to utilize alternative routes without backtracking given that these users may have expended considerable physical effort reaching the closure and may not have access to check websites or other postings regarding upcoming work.

5-7
Extended Intermediate-Term Duration Closures
Intermediate-term duration closures are defined as those lasting 3 days or less and include weekend-duration closures (Friday night to Monday morning). Extended closures permit closure hours to extend beyond those normally used in PS&E and result in work zone congestion.
When it has been identified and utilizing extended closure hours is justified, detailed work zone traffic analysis needs to be performed by the Region Traffic Operations to determine anticipated delays and queues (Section 5-9) to determine permitted extended closure hours and any associated interim liquidated damages (Section 5-14). The WSDOT Transportation
Data, GIS & Modeling Office (TDGMO) can provide Regions assistance with work zone traffic analysis and determine maximum allowable interim liquidated damages.
Diversion rates used in work zone traffic analysis are determined by Region Traffic
Operations based on considerations such as the quality and number of alternative routes available, special event occurrence, and quality of public outreach.
Page 5-12
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10

Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5
In the Contract PS&E, clearly list permitted extended closures including days and times, maximum number allowable, and restrictions on what work operations are allowed to utilize the extended closures.
When work zone queues are anticipated to exceed more than 1 mile, consider work zone safety management strategies (Section 5-17), including a work zone queue warning system, in addition to implementing work zone congestion management strategies (Section 5-6.B).
There are several extended intermediate-term duration closure strategies available, including: • Extended weeknights (Section 5-7.A) • Extended Friday night into Saturday morning (Section 5-7.B) • Extended Saturday night into Sunday morning (Section 5-7.C) • Extended weekend morning closures (Section 5-7.D) • Weekend-duration lane closures (Section 5-7.E) • Weekend-duration road closures (Section 5-7.F)
A.
Extended Weeknight Closures
After the weekday PM commute, decreasing traffic volumes allows any work zone queues to dissipate overnight. Thursday PM volumes tend to be higher later into the evening compared to other weeknights.
Traffic typically diverts around congested work zones using alternative routes, which reduces the traffic volume the work zone must serve. Diversion rates used in work zone traffic analysis are determined by Region Traffic Operations based on considerations such as the quality and number of alternative routes available, special event occurrence, and quality of public outreach.
On the other hand, traffic volumes typically increase quickly during weekday AM commute hours, which minimizes dissipation of any work zone congestion created; thus, work zone impacts to the weekday AM commute should be minimal and assume no traffic diversion.

Extended Friday Night into Saturday Morning Closures
After the Friday PM commute, decreasing traffic volumes allows any work zone queues to dissipate overnight. Friday PM volumes tend to be higher later into the evening compared to all other weeknights.
When congestion occurs, traffic may divert using alternative routes around the work zone; therefore, decreasing the volume the work zone must serve. Diversion rates used in work zone traffic analysis are determined by Region Traffic Operations based on considerations such as the quality and number of alternative routes available, special event occurrence, and quality of public outreach.
Because there is no AM commute, closures may be extended into Saturday morning several hours later than weekdays. Because of increasing volumes, the ability to dissipate queues becomes reduced later into the morning.

Friday night is typically used to accommodate Superload freight by keeping a minimum of two lanes open on T-1 and T-2 freight corridors when feasible. Superload freight over 20 feet wide is typically restricted to travel during early Saturday morning (1:00 a.m.-6:30 a.m.) or Sunday morning (1:00 a.m.-6:30 a.m.).
C.
Extended Saturday Night into Sunday Morning Closures
Decreasing Saturday PM traffic volumes allows any work zone queues to dissipate overnight. Saturday PM volumes tend to be comparable to Friday PM volumes.
When congestion occurs, traffic may divert using alternative routes around the work zone; therefore, decreasing the volume the work zone must serve. Diversion rates used in work zone traffic analysis are determined by Region Traffic Operations based on considerations such as the quality and number of alternative routes available, special event occurrence, and quality of public outreach.
Because there is no AM commute, closures may be extended into Sunday morning several hours later than weekdays and typically an hour later than Saturday morning. Because of increasing volumes, the ability to dissipate queues becomes reduced later into the morning.

Extended Weekend Morning Closures
Some work operations, such as bridge inspections or maintenance operations without noise permits, require daytime closure hours even in heavy congested urban areas but weekday daytime closures would result in unacceptable work zone congestion.
Instead, utilize extended weekend morning closures. Begin closures 1.5 hours before sunrise (times available for Seattle and Spokane) so traffic control and mobilization occur during darkness and crews begin work operations at first light. Balance the need to complete work and keep adverse traffic impacts tolerable using work zone traffic analysis (Section 5-9).
Typically, Sunday morning closures reopen an hour later than Saturday.

E.
Weekend-Duration Lane Closures
Weekend-duration lane closures, Friday evening to Monday morning commute, are practical solutions for longer work operations when extended overnight closure hours still do not yield sufficient work durations.
Weekend traffic demand tends to be less commute oriented and more discretionary than weekdays. With strong public outreach, motorists can plan ahead by avoiding an area using alternative routes, traveling early morning or later in evenings, or using public transit.
However, avoid weekend lane closures on major recreational routes due to greater communication and outreach challenges. Consider performing these closures during the offseason or weekdays (Sunday evening to noon Friday) instead.
Superload freight is not typically accommodated during weekend-duration lane closures but oversized freight should be along T-1 and T-2 freight corridors. If the roadway is narrowed or vertical clearances reduced, then WSDOT Commercial Vehicle Services should be contacted at least 7 days in advance. See Section 5-15 for details.
Perform work zone traffic analysis (Section 5-9) to assess traffic impacts and mitigation needs. It may be a good time to involve Region Management in the decision process. Region
Traffic Operations will determine anticipated diversion rates, which range from 0 percent to 50 percent during hours of congestion for weekend-duration closures. Be aware hourly traffic volumes may be up to 15 percent higher early AM hours on weekends as motorists travel earlier to avoid the worse work zone congestion.
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10

Page 5-15 Chapter 5
Work Zone Traffic Control
Interim liquidated damage values for weekend-duration closure should be included in the Contract PS&E (see Section 5-14 for details). Consider additional work zone safety management strategies (Section 5-17) when using these strategies.
Freeway Lane & Ramp Closure Weekend-Duration Strategies: • Closing up to half the existing freeway lanes
Reducing a 4-lane directional freeway to 2 open lanes needs viable alternative routes (2+ multilane principle arterials) and extensive public outreach.
Reducing a 2-lane directional freeway to 1 open lane needs viable alternative routes (principle arterial, preferably multilane) and extensive public outreach. • Farther reduce roadway to a single open lane during overnight hours, but consider the additional work zone congestion created during the day.
Typical Friday and Saturday Night Strategy on Congested Urban Freeways: Reduce roadway to a single open lane at 10:30 p.m. and reopen the following morning to two lanes when traffic volumes reach 150 percent of a single open lane’s capacity (typically
Saturday 5:30 a.m. or Sunday 6:00 a.m.) to clear any early- morning congestion created before congestion starting building during the daytime weekend-duration lane closures. • Strategically closing freeway on-ramps can effectively manage congestion along mainline.
By strategically closing on-ramps, traffic volumes served by the work zone is reduced by forcing on-ramp traffic to use detour routes or alternative routes; however, avoid closing on-ramps with major trip generators (airport or other major freeways).
Eliminating on-ramp merges maximizes the capacity through the work zone; therefore, minimizing queues and delays.
Closing on-ramps prevent queues from spreading onto other corridors via queues extending up ramps and spilling into adjacent corridor thru lanes. With the ramp closed, the traffic queue remain contained on the original corridor, but additional congestion will occur along the detour route or alternative routes.
Be cautious of closing freeway on-ramps in rural areas as detour routes may be several miles due to the large distances between interchanges.
This strategy is ineffective if the detour route or alternative route does not bypass the work zone.
Conventional Highway (Non-Freeway) Weekend-Duration Lane Closure Strategies: • Temporary two-way, two-lane configuration an existing multilane highways
Each direction is reduced to a single open lane, then one direction of traffic is shifted into either the closed two-way, left-turn lane or the closed left lane of the oncoming direction, known as contraflow.
On divided highways, each direction is reduced to a single open lane, then one direction of traffic is shifted via median crossover over into the closed left lane of the oncoming direction. • Temporary two-way, one-lane configuration on an existing highway
A single lane is maintained through the work zone with alternating traffic via flagger or temporary signal-control, which may include a pilot car operation.

Chapter 5
Weekend-Duration Road Closures
For critical work operations it may not be practical to maintain mobility necessitating the use of weekend-duration road closures. Such work operations may include fish passage culverts and modifying existing intersections into roundabouts.
For the traveling public, closing the road for a short duration may be less inconvenience than traveling through a work zone for an extended period of time. Productivity during weekend closures are significantly greater than daily or nightly closures; thus, the project duration can be reduced considerably.
The main requirement for road closures is the availability of a detour route and its ability to accommodate increased traffic volumes, truck turning movements, and pavement integrity.
Weekend traffic demand tends to be less commute oriented and more discretionary than weekdays. With strong public outreach motorists are able to plan ahead by avoiding an area by taking alternative routes, traveling earlier or later, or using public transit.
However, avoid weekend lane closures on major recreational routes due to greater communication and outreach challenges. Consider performing these closures using longterm duration closures during the off-season or weekdays (Sunday evening to noon Friday).
For roadway closures along truck freight critical corridors, WSDOT Commercial Vehicle
Services should be contacted at least 7 days in advance (see Section 5-15 for details). For
FHWA notification requirements for Interstate Highway closures, see Section 5-12.
Perform work zone traffic analysis (Section 5-9) to assess traffic impacts and mitigation needs. It may be a good time to involve Region Management in the decision process.
Interim liquidated damage values for weekend-duration closure should be included in the Contract PS&E (see Section 5-14 for details). Consider additional work zone safety management strategies (Section 5-17) when using these strategies.
Freeway Weekend-Duration Closure Strategies: • Directional freeway mainline closure utilizing a collector-distributor
Using lane closures, all traffic is forced to exit onto the collector-distributor around the work area before rejoining the mainline. This strategy provides the benefit of a “full roadway closure” in terms of productivity and safety, but maintains limited mobility through the work zone for the traveling public. • Directional freeway mainline closure utilizing a median crossover
Two-way, two-lane freeway traffic is maintained by placing all traffic on one side of the median with 11-foot lanes, 2-foot right shoulders, and 3-foot left shoulders adjacent to the temporary barrier separating opposing directions of traffic desirable; however, actual site conditions may justify narrower configurations and work zone speed limit reductions (Section 5-18).
If existing paved shoulders are within the temporary travel lanes, verify the pavement depth is sufficient, drainage features/electrical J-box covers are traffic bearing, and roadway widths across bridges are sufficient.

Work Zone Traffic Control
Often, roadside safety features on freeways are designed for one-way traffic; when temporary two-way configurations are used verify these roadside safety components are • Directional freeway mainline closure utilizing a detour
Used in conjunction with lane closures, all traffic is forced to exit at an exit-ramp. A route-specific signed detour route should be provided along with significant mitigation and outreach strategies along with advanced notification. • Complete freeway mainline closure utilizing detours
For work operations such as overhead bridge demolition across all lanes, it may be necessary to close both directions of a freeway concurrently. A route-specific signed detour route should be provided for each direction along with substantial mitigation and outreach strategies.
Conventional Highway Closure Strategy: • Roadway closure with detour
The roadway is closed to all traffic with a signed detour route in place. Local traffic access may be permitted up to the actual roadway closure to maintain access for residents and local businesses. 5-8
Long-Term Duration Closures & Reconfigurations
Long-Term duration closures are defined as those lasting 4 days or more. Weekend- duration closures are considered intermediate-term duration (see Section 5-7.E and Section 5-7.F).
Some work operations may require extended closures, even longer than weekend- durations, in order to complete needed work. Such work operations include bridge rehabilitation, major roundabout installation, fish passage culverts, and roadway widening.
These extended closures occur on commuter, freight, and/or recreational routes and should be used only after other traffic control approaches were found to be ineffective or impractical.
When it has been identified and utilizing long-term duration closures is justified, detailed work zone traffic analysis needs to be performed by the Region Traffic Operations to determine anticipated delays and queues (Section 5-9) to determine permitted extended closure hours and any associated interim liquidated damages (Section 5-14). The WSDOT
Transportation Data, GIS & Modeling Office (TDGMO) can provide Regions assistance with work zone traffic analysis and determine maximum allowable interim liquidated damages.
Diversion rates used in work zone traffic analysis are determined by Region Traffic
Operations based on considerations such as the quality and number of alternative routes available, special event occurrence, and quality of public outreach.
In the Contract PS&E, clearly list permitted long-term duration closures including days and times, maximum number allowable, and any allowable work operation restrictions.

Chapter 5
Section 5-12 provides FHWA notification requirements in advance of Interstate Highway closures or on the Federal-aid primary highway system.
When work zone queues are anticipated to exceed more than 1 mile, consider work zone safety management strategies (Section 5-17), including a work zone queue warning system, in addition to implementing work zone congestion management strategies (Section 5-6.B).
Multiple weekday-duration closures, typically Sunday night to noon on Friday, are similar to the weekend-duration strategies but serves as a practical solution for work operations requiring more than a weekend to complete or the work zone occurs along recreational routes experiencing high weekend traffic volumes, but are lower during weekdays.
Regions should expect work zone congestion to be very heavy the first day or two, but easing as the traveling public adjusts their driving habits. After a few days, locals will simply avoid the work zone while others utilize alternative routes or simply avoid travel. When possible, travelers will travel earlier in the morning or later in the evening to avoid the worst of the congestion.
For long-term duration closures, the exact traffic control strategy and closures will be determined on a case-by-case basis and is site-specific. The following are only some of the possible long-duration closure strategies: • Temporary Bypasses (Section 5-8.A) • Roadway Lane Closure & Reconfiguration (Section 5-8.B)
A.

Temporary Bypasses
A strategy utilized for some bridge reconstruction and fish passage projects is to construct a temporary highway bypass around the fish culvert during its construction, particularly in areas where a sufficient detour or alternative route is unavailable. In addition, it may be utilized on routes serving commuting traffic during the week and recreation traffic on the weekend. Depending on traffic volumes, environmental restrictions, cost, and other practical considerations the bypass could be as follows: • Two-lane, two-way temporary configuration • One-lane, two-way temporary configuration utilizing temporary signals to alternate traffic during nonworking hours with flagger-controlled traffic during working hours.
B.
Roadway Lane Closure & Reconfiguration
In locations with constrained geometrics, may require lane closures combined with reduced shoulder and lane widths that are laterally shifted onto the shoulders, work can occur on one-half of the roadway and/or bridge at a time. Typically, a two-stage configuration is utilized to complete work across the road/bridge. Such freeway reconfigurations should use a reduced continuous work zone speed limit based on the minimum shoulder and lane widths as shown in Exhibit 5-12 (Section 5-18.A).

Work Zone Traffic Control
Typically, site-specific staging plans and traffic control plans are included in the Contract
PS&E for each stage including any needed temporary illumination plans. For more complex projects or locations with tight geometrics, multiple stages and reconfigurations may be necessary.
These long-term reconfigurations should be based on permanent design standards to the extent feasible (horizontal curvature, long-duration temporary pavement markings, temporary traffic barriers with impact attenuators, illumination) while being supplemented
Manual for additional work zone design information.

Work Zone Traffic Analysis
Work zone traffic analysis compares the anticipated work zone traffic volumes with its estimated capacity. When traffic volumes exceed capacity, queues grow and congestion build. When traffic volumes are less than capacity, queues dissipate.
The unit of measurement is vehicle per hour (vph) but may also be measured as vehicles per hour per lane (vphpl) for multilane roadways.
First, determine the anticipated traffic volume through the work zone. Obtain historical traffic volumes (Section 5-9.A) and correct older data for growth (Section 5-9.B). Next, account for any expected traffic diversion, determined by Region Traffic Operations, which decreases the volume served by the work zone. Next, determine the work zone’s traffic capacity (Section 5-9.C for freeways and Section 5-9.D for conventional roadways).
With the anticipated traffic volume and work zone capacity, expected work zone queues and delays can then be calculated. For simple scenarios, see Section 5-9.E. For more complex scenarios, see Section 5-9.F.
Region Traffic Operations should perform work zone traffic analysis, but may delegate it to the Project Engineering Office. The WSDOT Transportation Data, GIS & Modeling Office (TDGMO)can assist by providing work zone traffic analysis to help determine expected queuing and delays.
Much of the same information used for work zone traffic analysis is also used by WSDOT
TDGMO to determine maximum interim liquidated damage values (Section 5-14). Based on these maximum values, Region Traffic Operations can determine actual interim liquidated damage values for each closure which are listed in the Contract PS&E. Based on these maximum values, Region Traffic Operations can determine actual interim liquidated damage values for each closure which are listed in the Contract PS&E.
A.

Obtaining Traffic Volumes
When possible, obtain current traffic volumes within the work zone limits. Be cautious of using traffic data older than a year, especially in high-growth areas.
Directional traffic volumes should be taken at several locations. On freeways, obtain mainline volumes between each interchange and volumes of each exit-ramp and on-ramp.
On conventional roadways, obtain mainline volumes between significant intersections.
Page 5-20
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5
Traffic volumes should be obtained each day of the week closures are permitted as they may change significantly from day to day. For extended intermediate-term duration closures (Section 5-7) and long-term duration closures (Section 5-8) obtain several sets of data for each day for a good average, desirably 10 for each day. Screen the data set for any significant special events or holidays that may significantly skew the traffic volume average.
It is desirable to obtain traffic volumes in 15-minute intervals for greater accuracy in determining closure hours for closures on freeways and major arterials. It may become necessary to assign closures in 15-minute intervals on heavily congested corridors instead of typical hourly intervals. When 15-minute traffic volumes are used, multiply by four to obtain an equivalent hourly volume to use the hourly intermediate-term work zone capacities provided in Section 5-9.C and Section 5-9.D.
Recreational roadways will experience significant fluctuations in traffic volumes seasonally; however, most roadways experience higher traffic volumes in summer and lower in winter.
Similarly, work zone capacities also are higher in summer and lower in winter by similar amounts usually eliminating the need for seasonal adjustments for work zone traffic analysis in most areas.
The following resources may be used to obtain existing traffic volumes on state routes and the Interstate Highway system: • WSDOT Traffic Data GeoPortal
This application allows users to obtain historic hourly and aggregate traffic volume data from WSDOT’s network of Permanent Traffic Recorders (PTRs).
For detailed information on GeoPortal application, including the map layer information and instructions for obtaining data within this system, see Traffic Data GeoPortal Help. • WSDOT Transportation Data, GIS & Modeling Office (TDGMO)
Hourly volume, classification, speed, and weight data can be obtained, when available, from the TDGMO. This includes data from both the PTR network and short-duration mechanical counts conducted throughout the state. To obtain this data, complete and submit a Traffic Data Request Form to TDGMO. • WSDOT ECM Portal “Short Duration Count” searches an internal database for various hourly traffic counts, including NWR Traffic Studies Database. • CDR Software (Northwest Region Only)
This software allows engineers to access detailed traffic data for freeways and major arterial roadways from PTRs. Historic PTR data is available in 5-minute intervals but can be automatically aggregated and summarized as needed by the software, with 15-minute or one-hour intervals being the most useful for work zone traffic analysis. • Request New Traffic Studies
New traffic studies can be performed by the TDGMO and the Northwest Region upon request.
To request new traffic studies statewide, contact TDGMO.

B.
Correcting Traffic Volumes for Growth
When traffic volumes are more than a year old, then account for annual changes in traffic volumes. The growth rate of traffic is location specific. Traffic volumes often decrease during times of economic recession.
If needed, location specific growth rate estimates can be generated by contacting TDGMO or Region Traffic Operations. Without the availability of better data or information, a conservative growth rate of 3 percent per year can be assumed.
Caution should be used when applying a constant growth rate across all hourly traffic volumes because congested corridors may experience much higher growth rates during early AM commute hours as motorists adapt to worsening congestion by beginning their commutes earlier, as early as 3:30 a.m. in a few locations.
Without the availability of better data or information, using hourly traffic volumes from one location along a corridor and using the AADTs of both location to “adjust” the hourly volumes may be acceptable; however, if the “adjusted” hourly volumes are near the work zone traffic capacities then new traffic counts should be obtained.

C.
Freeway Work Zone Traffic Capacities
The “rule of thumb” work zone capacity thresholds provided in this subsection include ranges based on the understanding that roadway conditions, roadway configurations, and work activity intensity all impact actual capacities; therefore, sound engineering judgement and Regional experience is still needed to perform proper work zone traffic analysis.
Stationary freeway lane closures are ones that occupy a location and are set up with standard traffic control devices.

Special Scenarios: • Increase directional capacity by 100 vehicles/hour when traffic barriers separate travel lanes from work areas. • When High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) and Express Toll Lane (ETL) is present, assume its lane capacity as 1000 unless it is the only lane open, even when signed as “OPEN TO ALL”. • For steep upgrades (≥ 5 percent for more than ½ mile), reduce one lane’s capacity by one-half to account for the slow trucks.
Mobile freeway lane closures are “moving lane closures” using transportable attenuators without channelization devices where work moves intermittently or continuously.

When determining permitted closure hours for ramps, it is important to understand ramp closure hours are dependent on the excess capacity available along its entire detour route, including any intersections. If the detour route is already congested, then it has no excess capacity to absorb the detouring traffic. In short, the capacity of the detour route increases as overall volumes become lower. In other words, a detour route can serve higher detour traffic volumes at 11:00 p.m. than at 7:00 p.m.. Because overall traffic volumes higher later into evenings weekends than weeknights, the thresholds vary to account for this trend.
The opposite is true during the morning because overall traffic volumes are increasing.
Because excess capacity along the detour route decreases into the morning, the detour traffic volume that can be sufficiently served also decreases later into the morning. In other words, a detour route can sufficiently serve lower detour traffic volumes at 6:00 a.m. than at 4:00 a.m.. Because weekends have no AM commute traffic, the thresholds remain higher later into the morning.
Suburban & urban corridors experience higher traffic volume levels than rural corridors; however, suburban & urban motorists are more accepting of higher congestion levels.
The thresholds account for this trend as well.
It is also important to distinguish between exit-ramp and on-ramps detour routes; particularly when temporary lane closures are in place on mainline in one or both directions of travel. Exit-ramp detours typically route on towards the next interchange and then back in the opposite direction resulting in higher traffic volumes than normal along the detour route, which should be accounted for when temporary lane closures are in place in either direction or additional work zone congestion may occur. On the other hand, on-ramps tend to use surface streets and local road detours to adjacent interchanges which lowers traffic volumes on the mainline in that section, and may help offset the additional traffic volumes generated by exit-ramp detours.
WSDOT Traffic Manual

M 51-02.10
Page 5-23 Chapter 5
Work Zone Traffic Control
It is important to verify the entire detour route can sufficiently handle the added traffic volumes detoured, not just focusing on the ramp’s volume in isolation. Additional work zone congestion strategies may be needed along the detour route (see Section 5-6.B for details).
Pay particular attention to detour routes turning left at signalized intersections with a short, single left turn lane with a protected left turn signal phase. Signal retiming or uniform police officer(s) controlling traffic at the intersection may be necessary. When traffic volumes sufficiently decrease, normal signal operation may be restored.
For guidance, ramp closure volume thresholds are available in Exhibit 5-6. Exhibit 5-7 provides ramp reopening thresholds. Note this guidance is for nightly ramp closures.

The following ramp reopening examples are based on Exhibit 5-7 guidance to assist users:
Example #1: A ramp can remain closed thru 3:30 a.m. during early weekday mornings regardless of its ramp volumes.
Example #2: A suburban/urban ramp should be reopened no later than 4:30 a.m.
Tuesday morning if its volumes exceed 450 vehicles per hour at that time; unless otherwise justified (ramp is opposite of the AM commute direction), reopen the ramp by 5:00 a.m. on weekday mornings.
Example #3: A rural ramp should be reopened no later than 5:00 a.m. Wednesday morning if its volumes exceed 250 vehicles per hour at that time; unless otherwise justified, reopen the ramp by 6:00 a.m. on weekday mornings.
Example #4: Any ramp can remain closed thru 5:00 a.m. early Saturday morning regardless of its ramp volumes; unless otherwise justified, reopen the ramp by 8:00 a.m. on Saturday mornings (excludes extended weekend morning or weekendduration closures).
Example #5: Any ramp can remain closed thru 6:00 a.m. early Sunday morning regardless of its ramp volumes; unless otherwise justified, reopen the ramp by 9:00 a.m. on Sunday mornings (excludes extended weekend morning or weekend-duration closures). • Daytime Freeway Ramp Closures
Some work operations, such as bridge inspections or maintenance operations without noise permits, require daytime closure hours even in heavy congested urban areas.
Permitted closure hours for this situation should be examined on a case-by-case basis by
Region Traffic Operations.
Consider the following: What are the ramp volumes during the closure? Does the detour add considerable delays, especially for commuter and school traffic?
If permitted, weekday daytime ramp closure hours are typically assigned between the
AM commute and PM commute (9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.).
When daytime closures during weekdays result in unacceptable work zone congestion, an alternative approach is to utilize extended Saturday morning or Sunday morning closures. See Section 5-7.D for details.

D.
Conventional Roadway Work Zone Traffic Capacities (Non-Freeway)
The “rule of thumb” work zone capacity thresholds provided in this subsection include ranges based on the understanding that roadway conditions, roadway configurations, and work activity intensity all impact actual capacities; therefore, sound engineering judgement and Regional experience is still needed to perform proper work zone traffic analysis. • Multilane Closures (Non-Freeway)
These lane closures maintain two-way traffic with at least one thru lane in each direction (no flaggers, pilot cars, temporary signals, etc.). Contraflow means two- way traffic is maintained by shifting one direction of travel into the opposing direction’s closed thru lanes or closed two-way, left-turn center lane.
Page 5-26

Traffic capacity is further reduced when closures extend through signalized intersections, particularly for contraflow configurations. When traffic is shifted at or thru signalized intersections via contraflow, the signalized intersection shall be either controlled by uniform police officer(s) within the intersection per WAC 468-95-3015 or flaggers on all approaches with an optional flagger added within the intersection.

Thru Signalized Intersections: 700-800 • Single Open Lane with Alternating Traffic
Traffic capacities are significantly affected by the distance between flaggers or temporary signals due to the lost time waiting for alternating traffic directions to take turns. Additional intersections between flaggers farther exasperate this issue.
Alternating traffic can be controlled via flaggers, AFADs, pilot cars, or temporary signals.
Different methods will yield different work zone capacities. Pilot cars increase capacity by guiding motorists through the work zone more effectively, especially for work zones exceeding 800 feet between flaggers.
When bicyclists are combined with alternating vehicular traffic, work zone capacity is significantly reduced due to their slow speeds and longer clearance intervals. Temporary signals are especially affected because the all-red clearance intervals for temporary signals typically assume bicycle speeds of 10 mph (unless a separate bicycle lane or shuttle is provided). All-red clearance time becomes excessively lengthy when distances between temporary signals exceed 1000 feet.

WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10
Page 5-27 Chapter 5
Work Zone Traffic Control
For congested work zones with alternating traffic, queues and delays can be minimized by reducing the distance between flaggers and the clearance time needed. For example, reducing the longitudinal buffer space and upgrading the protective vehicle up to a transportable attenuators (for speed 45 mph or higher) would minimize queues while still protecting the work area from errant vehicle intrusions because the flaggers are closer.

Diversion rates are determined by Region Traffic Operations. • Work zone capacity: Anticipated traffic volume a work zone can serve; see

Each calculation incremental; the×unserved vehicles from the previous hour

• Since we are determining the queue/delay at the end of the second hour, the time interval is 1 hour or 60 minutes; thus, the 60/60 factor. • A negative number means the work zone capacity exceeds the traffic demand; thus, unserved vehicles from the first hour will be dissipated.

Chapter 5
In Example #1b, the number of unserved vehicles is negative (-76). This is good news because now the work zone capacity exceeds traffic demand causing queues to dissipate.
This is why congestion is targeted in the PM overnight hours when traffic volumes are declining because any congestion created initially will dissipate overnight.
At the end of the second hour, the queue has reduced to 0.7 mile with 20 minute delays and serves as the initial values for determining the queues and delays after the third hour.

As demonstrated In Example #2A, the traffic demand far exceeds the work zone capacity and delays become substantial even after only 30 minutes of closure. A logical solution would be performing the lane closure during times when traffic volumes are lower, such as at night, but that may not be an option in some situations. Let’s say the work must be performed at the time and volumes listed above. What now?
There are two remedies to improve the situation. Minimize the distance between flaggers as much as possible and use a pilot car as shown in Example #2B on the next page.

Complex Work Zone Queues & Delays
Region Traffic Operations should perform complex work zone traffic analysis. The WSDOT
Transportation Data, GIS & Modeling Office (TDGMO) can assist by providing work zone traffic analysis to help determine expected queuing and delays.
For more complex situations, consider using one of the numerous work zone queue analysis tools available: • WSDOT’s Capacity-Queue-Delay Microsoft Excel Sheet
This WSDOT-developed tool estimates queues, delays, and user delay costs based on 15-minute intervals and includes traffic diversion rates. There is an hourly volume to 15-minute volume converter included if needed.
The Excel files are available here. Copy the Excel files onto your desktop first before modifying. For detailed explanations, contact WSDOT HQ Work Zone Engineers. • CA4PRS (Construction Analysis for Pavement Rehabilitation Strategies)
This software is an agency decision-support tool to help select the most effective and economical construction and work zone strategies in terms of schedule, traffic impacts, and agency costs. CA4PRS is especially beneficial for large roadway rehabilitation and widening projects in congested urban areas having high-traffic impacts.
CA4PRS software is free to WSDOT staff; for details, see the CalTrans CA4RPS website. • QuickZone
This software is a spreadsheet-based traffic analysis tool to estimate costs, traffic delays, and queues for urban and rural work zones, including alternating two-way traffic in a single lane.
For details, see the FHWA QuickZone website. • SYNCHRO
This software is typically used for permanent traffic signal design; however, it is useful for temporary signal design for work zones as well for developing signal timing plans. • Highway Capacity Manual, 6th Edition
This manual is used for work zone traffic analysis of long-term staged configurations (remaining in place 24/7 for weeks), not intermediate-term (≤ 3 days) closures. • FHWA Traffic Analysis Tools Program – Deployment Track
Volumes VIII, IX, and XII specifically relate to work zones and provide comprehensive information. All three volumes are available at this FHWA webpage. • FHWA Sponsored Work Zone Traffic Management Analysis Training
Illinois College of Engineering provides a free 2-day class for work zone analysis via analytical method training throughout the nation. Check the registration/class schedule webpage and contact information for future courses.

Permitted Closure Restrictions
On Design-Bid-Build construction projects, permitted closures are listed in the Contract’s
Special Provisions (Specials) and in the Request for Proposal (RFP) on Design-Build projects.
Maintenance closures are typically determined on a case-by-case basis.
When determining permitted closure hours for Contracts, consider the closures occur over months or years. At the Agency’s option, permitted closure hours can be expanded during construction on a case-by-case, trial basis; however, if work zone congestion becomes intolerable and the Agency reduces the permitted hours after bidding, it may result in claims from the Contractor. On the other hand, if permitted closure hours are too conservative, it decreases the available working hours and may result in increased construction costs for negligible work zone congestion reductions.
Because Maintenance closures occur for a day or a few days, the Agency may assign less conservative closure hours with the understanding Maintenance crews remove the closure if work zone congestion become excessive.
Closure hours are provided for all permitted closures, including but not limited to: • Shoulder closures • Lane closures • Ramp closures • Roadway or directional roadway closures • Staged construction allowable durations • Pedestrian curb, traffic island, and/or sidewalk closures • Extended lane closures for specific work operations • Continuous roadway, directional roadway, lane, and/or ramp closures

A.
Contractor Cooperation and Permitted Closure Restrictions Due to
Other Projects
Contract PS&Es should provide an Other Contracts or Other Work section of anticipated projects, both State and local agency, occurring adjacent to or within the limits of the project requiring coordination and cooperation between Contractors.
Additional restrictions on permitted closures may be specified during scheduled roadway closures, directional roadway closures, and weekend lane closures occurring on other projects. This is often used on significant alternative routes around a major closures; for example, restricting any lane closures on southbound I-205 when southbound I-5 is closed for an adjacent project in Vancouver, Washington.
Consider language requiring a minimum of 1 mile between adjacent lane closures. For example, if a double right lane closure precedes a double left lane closure then the closures need to be separated by at least 1 mile to allow advanced warning signs for the second closure to be installed but also allow motorists sufficient time to transition across lanes.
If PCMSs are used in addition to advanced warning signs, then increase the distance to
1.5 mile minimum.

Work Zone Traffic Control
B.
Holiday Restrictions for Permitted Closures
Contract PS&Es may restrict permitted closures from occurring during holidays and holiday weekends (when the holiday occurs on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or Monday). Typically, the restriction begins noon the day prior and may continue until noon the day after the holiday or holiday weekend. These holidays are listed in the WSDOT Standard Specifications
Section 1-08.5.
Canadian holiday restrictions may be needed for projects near British Columbia; each
Canadian holiday should be listed and typically include: • Good Friday (Friday before Easter) • Easter Monday (Monday following Easter) • Queen’s Birthday/Victoria Day (closest Monday to May 20) • Canada Day/Dominion Day (always July 1) • B.C. Day (first Monday in August) • Thanksgiving Day (second Monday in October) • Boxing Day (always December 26)
C.
Special Event Restrictions for Permitted Closures
Contract PS&Es may restrict permitted closures from occurring two hours prior to, during, and/or two hours following major special events. Communication with stakeholders (including local interest groups) and obtaining their concurrence or understanding is important for public relations throughout Planning, Design, and Construction.
Each special event and its restriction interval should be clearly specified, including projected attendance thresholds when applicable. Clarification whether the restriction occurs for a time interval prior to, during, and/or after the event depends on anticipated traffic impacts caused by event traffic. Directional routes going towards the event experience increased volumes prior to the event while routes going away from the event experience increased volumes after the event. During the event, traffic volume may not be impacted by games and concerts but impacted by all-day events such as State Fairs.
Region Traffic Operations use experience to determine special event restrictions, including the event’s project attendance threshold based on the project’s location, but some special events that typically restrict permitted closures include: • All Seattle Seahawk and Washington Huskie home football games • T-Mobile Park, Century Link Field, or Tacoma Dome significant events • Annual Seafair Hydroplane Race Weekend • Washington State Fairs • Watershed Music Festival at the Gorge Amphitheater • Hoopfest Weekend 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament in Spokane • Issaquah Salmon Days

Page 5-36
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5
In addition, the special event may impact traffic locally, regionally, or statewide. For example,
Issaquah Salmon Days traffic impact tends to be more local than Seattle Seahawk games which are more regional. Events such as Hoopfest Weekend 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament have statewide impacts, especially on Interstate 90 between Seattle and Spokane.
With the restrictions in place, the Region Traffic Operations can still provide case- bycase exceptions to the restrictions but are not obligated to do so; thus, giving the
Agency flexibility.
In the event the Agency allows permitted closures to occur during listed special event restrictions, it is especially important to consider the combined traffic impacts of multiple special events occurring concurrently. For example, when the Seattle Sounders and Mariners have concurrent games occurring in the afternoon, the traffic impacts are far greater than if one game occurred in the afternoon and the other in the evening.
Special Event Exception Example: There is a Construction work zone on Southbound I-5 (south of the stadium, influenced by the exiting event traffic). Mariners home game ends late Wednesday evening around 10:15pm (7:10 p.m. game) and exceeds the attendance threshold in the Specials, which restricts any lane closures until two hours after the event.
Simply prohibiting all lane closures until 12:15am often results in the Contractor not performing any lane closures that night (since they have less than 5 hours to install traffic control, perform minimal work, and typically reopen by 6am at the latest). Instead of completing the project in one season, it may become two because of the 40+ Mariner home games each season.
On a case-by-case basis, after performing work zone traffic analysis, the Region Traffic
Operations may allow the Contractor to close 3 of 5 lanes on Southbound I-5 (in the path of exiting event traffic) during normal Contract hours but then delay the fourth lane closure until 11:30 p.m. to accommodate exiting game traffic (late night events tend to clear within about an hour after the event ends) even though the fourth lane is normally closed 11:00 p.m. per Contract PS&E. This allows Construction crews to install traffic control for the triple lane closures and work while still accommodating game traffic. This essentially maintains an open lane for game traffic and the other lane for typical non-event traffic to help minimize work zone congestion. At 11:30 p.m., once the game traffic is expected to clear, the roadway is reduced to one open lane and the work area maximized.
By doing so, the Contractor still completes work (albeit a reduced quantity) while mobility through the work zone is maintained versus simply performing no work at all.
In areas with special lane restrictions (High-Occupancy Vehicle or Express Toll Lanes), consideration rather left lane closures or right lane closures are implemented can be important. Closing right (general purpose) have higher impacts as motorists need to utilize the HOV or ETL and are reluctant to do so even when those lanes are signed as open to all traffic.

Closure Notification Requirements
On Design-Bid-Build construction projects, closure notification requirements are listed in the Contract’s Special Provisions and in the Request for Proposal (RFP) on
Design-Build projects.
Typically, the advance notification requirements are as follows: • Notify the Engineer in writing 5 calendar days in advance of any shoulder, lane, ramp, and sidewalk closure • Notify the Engineer in writing 14 calendar days in advance of any roadway closure • Notify the Engineer in writing 30 calendar days in advance of any continuous lane, continuous partial roadway, or continuous roadway closure • Notify the Engineer in writing 60 calendar days in advance of any continuous lane, continuous partial roadway, or continuous Interstate Highway System roadway closure lasting 7 consecutive days or more • Provide a detailed traffic control closure schedule to Engineer for review and acceptance by noon Monday three weeks prior to implementing traffic control. • Specifications should include language that notifications do not imply approval of closures
Typically, public notification requirements are as follows: • Furnish and install information signs providing advance notification of road closures and/ or ramp closures at least five working days prior to the closure • Notify Washington Patrol; local fire, police, emergency services, and city engineering departments; Medic 1 and local transit agency (when applicable); other transit companies; and affected school districts in writing at least five working days in advance of each closure 5-12
FHWA Notification Requirements for Closures & Use Restrictions
To assure compliance with federal law (23 CFR 658.11), the Federal Highway Administration
Washington Division (WADIV) needs to receive proper notification when closing certain routes.
WSDOT is required to provide WADIV advanced notification of full closures or use restrictions on the Interstate Highway System and Federal-aid primary routes. For National
Highway System routes in Washington, click here.
Full closures: When all mainline travel lanes in one direction of travel or both directions of travel are closed to traffic due to construction activities, emergency closures, or for special events. Interstate to Interstate interchange ramp closures are included in this designation.
Detours onsite or otherwise are also included in this designation.
Use Restriction: Restriction in place that limits the vehicle type, load, or function of the facility. The most common use restriction would be closing a route to all commercial vehicles. WADIV approves use restrictions on the Interstate Highway System and Federalaid primary routes.

Work Zone Closure Coordination
Because performing several work zone closures concurrently can result in significant conflicts and adverse region-wide impacts to mobility, it is critical to coordinate closures.
Through proper coordination, conflicting closures are avoided and adverse impacts to the traveling public reduced. It is important to coordinate between different Regions for highimpact closures.
Contact Region Traffic Operations to determine how work zone closures are coordinated in each region. In the Northwest Region, the Construction Traffic & Coordination Office (CTCO) will utilize advanced coordination methods due to the large number of competing projects within a specific area.
As part of WSDOT’s Transportation System Management and Operations (TSMO), the
WSDOT Next Generation Work Zone Database is a useful tool used by Regions to manage, avoid overlapping work zone conflicts, and combine work zone closures for several work operations when feasible to minimize traffic control costs. For additional information, view the User’s Manual.

Interim Liquidated Damages
Interim liquidated damages (ILDs) are monies assessed or withheld from the Contractor for failure to reopen roadway closures, lane closures, and ramp closures by the time specified in the Contract PS&E.
On Design-Bid-Build construction projects, ILDs are listed in the Contract’s Special
Provisions and in the Request for Proposal (RFP) on Design-Build projects.
WSDOT TDGMO determines maximum ILD values based on the calculation of societal costs resulting from travel delays. To request interim liquidated damages, the Region Traffic or Project Engineering Office should complete the Interim Liquidated Damages Request
Form (Form 312-001) and submit it to the TDGMO two weeks in advance of the date the values are needed. Per the Plans Preparation Manual Section 700.01(18), the TDGMO has standardized methodology for calculating interim liquidated damage values and is the only office with the authority to compute them.
To request interim liquidated values from TDGMO will need the following form and information sent via email: • Form 312-001 Interim Liquidated Damages Request Form • Permitted closure hours, including days of week • Hourly traffic volumes used to establish permitted hours for each closure • Work zone traffic control plans for each closure • Detour plan(s) for each roadway closure or ramp closure, including hourly traffic volumes for the detour route if available • Vicinity map • Draft version of the interim liquidated damages section that will be included in the
Contract PS&E, leaving the actual value amounts empty
Region Traffic Operations will then assign the actual liquidated damage value for each closure based on the maximum allowable amounts determined by TDGMO.

Commercial Vehicle Considerations
Freight transportation systems, including bridges and highways, are critical to supporting and growing more jobs, increasing regional domestic product, and developing a larger tax base. The multimodal freight transportation system allows business in Washington to effectively compete in regional and global markets.
Washington is the second-most trade-dependent state in the nation according to U.S.
Department of Commerce International Trade Administration. Nationally, truck freight moves nearly 70 percent of all shipments according to USDOT Bureau of Transportation
Statistics and FHWA. Each semi tractor-trailer carries about $25,000 in freight (2017).
A.

Truck Freight Critical Corridors
The FGTS Truck Freight Corridor map shows freight corridors in Washington (Ranging from
T-1 to T-5, with T-1 being the most critical).
Long-term duration stationary work zones should accommodate WB-67 design vehicles (a typical semi tractor-trailer) on T-1 and T-2 corridors, which include freeways and major arterial corridors. On corridors with heavy movements of Oversized & Superload commercial freight, consider either accommodating those larger vehicles or reducing the duration their movements are restricted. Coordination and collaboration with heavy freight haulers is advised.
Of particular concern are single lane ramps or single lane roadways delineated with temporary traffic barrier and/or guardrail on both sides. A minimum travel width of 16 feet plus any adjustments for traveled way widening values on open highway curves to accommodate the difference in tracking width of the WB-67 design vehicle’s rear trailer axles that “cut” into the curve should be maintained.
See WSDOT Design Manual Chapter 720 for any temporary vertical clearance reductions, especially on the mainline of T-1 and T-2 freight routes. There have been numerous impacts from oversized loads to both permanent and temporary structures, even when advanced warning signs and over-height warning systems are in place.
If a construction or maintenance project is narrowing the roadway or restricting the vertical clearance, WSDOT Commercial Vehicle Services needs to be contacted at least 7 calendar days in advance.

Oversized Freight Considerations
Oversized loads are usually self-permitting and do not require permission from the
WSDOT Construction offices to travel through work zones; however, they are responsible for checking oversize/overweight restrictions and vertical clearance restrictions prior to transport.
Oversized freight still show up unexpectedly in work zones; therefore, it is desirable to provide a 16-foot wide travel way when possible; however, work operations often necessitate narrower widths. If a construction or maintenance project is narrowing the roadway or restricting the vertical clearance, WSDOT Commercial Vehicle Services needs to be contacted at least 7 calendar days in advance.
See Washington Commercial Vehicle Guide for details.

Superload permitting is stringent and controlled through Commercial Vehicle Services.
See Superload Requirements website and Washington Commercial Vehicle Guide for additional information.
Typically, Commercial Vehicle Services will forward Superload permits to Regions for review.
Superloads may be required to obtain permission to transport through known work zones at least 72 hours in advance. Superloads can be sensitive to transport restrictions.
Typically, Superload transport is restricted to 11:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. on weeknights and 1:00 a.m. to 6:30 a.m. early Saturday and Sunday mornings, with Superloads exceeding
20 feet in width restricted to early Saturday and Sunday mornings only. Actual restrictions may vary by Region.
Superload truck freight example;
Boeing B1 bomber 131 feet long, 29+ feet wide, and 15 feet high.

Work Zone Traffic Incident Management Strategies
For major closures, determining permitted closure hours and the accepting the actual dates are critical as the closures must be coordinated with holidays, special events, and other work zone closures. Next, the traveling public and stakeholders need to be informed.
During the actual closure, it is critical to properly manage any work zone traffic incident since the roadway’s capacity is already reduced. Sooner or later, an undesirable surprise happens including but not limited to: • Traffic control devices get knocked over by an errant vehicle • Disabled vehicle with mechanical failures blocks the only open lane through work zone • A collision involving multiple vehicles with serious injuries or a fatality is blocking lanes • An errant vehicle enters into the work area, attempting to take an “open” exit-ramp, is now stuck in newly placed concrete pavement
The plan to address such incidents typically consists of at least seven parts: • Traffic Management Center (Section 5-16.A) • Traffic Control Inspections (Section 5-16.B) • Incident Discovery (Section 5-16.C) • Public Outreach (Section 5-16.D) • Advanced Preparation for Major Closures (Section 5-16.E) • Drop Sites for Disabled Vehicles (Section 5-16.F) • Emergency Vehicle Access (Section 5-16.G)
A.
Traffic Management Center
Traffic Management Centers (TMC) serve an essential communication role in incident management. TMCs can contact WSDOT Incident Response Teams, Washington Patrol and other emergency services, and WSDOT staff. TMC can modify motorist information signage to inform the public of incidents, such as an accident.
For Regional TMC contact information, contact Region Traffic Operations.
For every work zone closure, provide the Region TMC details of the closure and its location in addition to point of contact information. Keep the TMC updated of the current closure status, including when closures are reopened. The Construction project office or the DesignBuilder will want to verify what pertinent information is needed by the Region TMC when work zone closures are in place and determine whom handles this communication.
This allows TMC to call the point of contact if there are any traffic control issues, accidents in the work zone, or some other urgent matter.

WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10
Page 5-43 Chapter 5
Work Zone Traffic Control
B.
Traffic Control Inspections
Required per WSDOT Standard Specifications Section 1-10, the traffic control supervisor (TCS) shall inspect traffic control hourly during working hours in addition to other periodic inspections during nonworking hours. The TCS shall correct, or arrange to have corrected, any deficiencies noted during these inspections.
C.
Incident Discovery
Per WSDOT Standard Specifications Section 1-10, Contractors are required to have a traffic control manager who oversees temporary traffic control operations and approving actions of the Traffic Control Supervisor.
Upon discovery of any incidents, the Contractor’s Traffic Control Manager, Traffic Control
Supervisor, WSDOT Engineer, and Region TMC should be notified.
Contacting other parties, including local agencies, is determined on a case by case basis.

D.
Public Outreach
For work zone incidents with high traffic impacts, the WSDOT Public Information Officer should be contacted so appropriate outreach with news media, social media, and blogs can distribute the information to the traveling public when needed.
In addition, the Region Traffic Management Center can modify motorist information signage to inform the public of incidents, such as an accident.
E.
Advanced Preparation for Major Closures
Well in advance of major closures, the Construction project engineering office should collaborate with WSDOT Region Traffic Operations, WSDOT Communications, WSDOT
Communications, WSDOT Regional TMCs, and WSDOT Incident Response Teams (IRTs).
WSDOT Communications serves an invaluable role in reaching out to the general public and stakeholders providing traffic-related and project information for construction or maintenance projects.
TMCs can use permanent variable message signs to provide motorists real-time information and advance notification regarding high-impact closures and major incidents. On Active
Traffic and Demand Management corridors, lane usage symbols and speed limits can be displayed in real-time to supplement temporary traffic control.
During major weekend-duration lane closures, maintaining the already reduced capacity is critical. By strategically staging IRT and at least one tow truck on site, they can expeditiously respond to any traffic incidents, particularly blocking vehicles. If necessary, IRT and
WSDOT TMC can collaborate to contact necessary police, emergency agencies, and
WSDOT management.

Chapter 5
Drop Sites for Disabled Vehicles
For work zones with narrow shoulders, disabled vehicles need to be moved off the roadway.
Often, Contractor’s nearby staging yard is used to temporarily store the disabled vehicle until it can be retrieved.
G.
Emergency Vehicle Access
It is critical to maintain emergency vehicle access through work zones when possible; sometimes, minutes matter. Examples include: • For long-term projects, when feasible provide adequate paved shoulders (8-foot widths desired) for emergency vehicles to pass queued vehicles, especially on single lane onramps that are metered, or use ramp metering preemption to clear the queue when an emergency vehicle is detected. • During rolling slowdowns, develop a contingency plan to allow critical emergency vehicles access safely through the rolling blockade and work area when transporting critical patients. For additional rolling slowdown information, see Section 5-21.
If it is not feasible to maintain access during a roadway closure or rolling slowdown, advanced written notification should be provided to affected agencies.

5-17
Work Zone Safety Management
Per Secretary’s Executive Order E 1001.02, all WSDOT employees are directed to make the safety of workers and the traveling public our highest priority during roadway design, construction, maintenance, and related activities. First, we need an understanding of work zone statistics because discussing mitigation strategies:
National work zone statistics • 84 percent of fatalities occur to the traveling public, not workers (ARTBA, 2019) • Nearly all fatal crashes occurred on freeway and arterial roadways with posted speed limits of 45 mph or higher (FHWA, 2018) • 35 percent of fatalities involved large trucks and buses (ARTBA, 2019) • 16 percent of fatalities involve pedestrians and bicyclists (ARTBA, 2019)
Washington work zone statistics • 7 fatalities occurred to the traveling public (ARTBA, 2019) • 3 fatalities involving a large truck (ARTBA, 2019) • 0 fatalities involving workers (ARTBA, 2019) • 0 fatalities involving pedestrians (ARTBA, 2010)
The primary focus for work zone safety mitigation should be to the traveling public on freeway and arterial roadways with posted speed limits of 45 mph or higher. Per FHWA, rear-end crashes are the most common type of work zone crash and are overrepresented by large trucks.
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10
Page 5-45 Chapter 5
Work Zone Traffic Control

Consider the following strategies to help mitigate work zone impacts and enhance safety: • Work zone queuing mitigation (Section 5-17.A) • Positive protection devices (Section 5-17.B) • Work zone speed limit reductions & advisory speeds (Section 5-17.C) • Washington State Patrol enforcement (Section 5-17.E) • Uniformed Police Officer work zone assistance (Section 5-17.F)
A.
Work Zone Queuing Mitigation
At 65 mph, it may take fully loaded semi-tractor and trailers at least 7 seconds and
500 feet to stop per Work Zone Safety Consortium. It is critical for large truck drivers to anticipate queued traffic and get slowed down in advance. Queue warning systems have reduced associated collisions up to 45 percent per FHWA-supported Work Zone Safety
Consortium report.
Queuing mitigation should be considered when queues extend beyond advance work zone signage on roadways with posted speed limits of 45 mph or higher and include: • Truck-Mounted PCMS
The simplest method is using a truck-mounted PCMS positioned ½ ± mile in advance of queues by moving up and down the paved shoulder in a safe manner as the queue changes. When the queue is no longer present, it is removed.
This method is appropriate for non-recurring work zone queuing extending beyond the first warning sign, or PCMS if used. For example, queuing occurs for a few hours at the beginning of the lane closure before dissipating overnight and resumes a few hours in the morning before lanes are reopened.
When used in Contracts, this truck-mounted PCMS can be included in the relevant traffic control plans as an additional PCMS in advance of lane closures that may be truck-mounted. Payment is via standard traffic control bid items already listed in the
WSDOT Standard Specifications.
Truck-mounted PCMS displays two messages for 2 second each of a work zone queue ahead. “NEXT # MILES” will be rounded up to the nearest whole mile.

WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5 • Queue Warning System
The Queue Warning System (QWS) provides mitigation that should be considered on 45+ mph roadways for daily, nightly, or weekend-duration closures with non-recurring work zone queuing up to 3 miles that dissipate based on detailed work zone traffic analysis (Section 5-9). Because of its simplicity, QWS works well when lane closure locations change on a daily or nightly basis (like for a paving project) with work zone queuing occurring for a few hours with free-flow traffic conditions otherwise.
Queue warning systems (QWS) provide automated queue warning, closure information, and lane usage instructions to motorists via two PCMSs. Displayed messages automatically change as the queue lengthens or shortens as detected by 2 traffic sensors, typically located at the last lane closure taper and after the first advanced warning sign. For a 2mile QWS, place two PCMSs at 1± mile spacing prior to the first lane closure taper; for 3-mile QWS, use 1.5± mile spacing.
QWS components may be provided by the Contractor or through an independent vendor. A QWS Technician programs and operates the system based on accepted traffic control plans and Special Provision/Request for Proposal. QWS Technician is not required to be on site when the system is in use but must be able to response to any system issues remotely. The QWS Technician may be an employee of the Vendor or someone trained and authorized by the Vendor, including Contractor or subcontractor
Traffic Control Supervisor or other personnel. The Contractor or subcontractor will install, store, and remove the QWS components.
QWS messaging needs to be included on the lane closure traffic control plan along with speed thresholds, typically 35 mph. Typical freeway lane closure plans are expected to
QWS messaging as part of the lane closure traffic control plan on Sheet 1A.
General Specification Provisions and State-wide Request for Proposal for Queue
Warning Systems is expected to be available starting in 2022. The Contract will specify when the QWS usage is required and specific system requirements.
QWS is paid using a bid item paying hourly for when the QWS operation is in use, with mobilization and demobilization incidental. Standard traffic control bid items already listed in the WSDOT Standard Specifications will pay for installation and removal of the
QWS components. • Smart Work Zone System
Smart Work Zone System (SWZS) provides mitigation that should be considered on 45+ mph roadways for longterm (4+ day), stationary closures with recurring work zone queuing exceeding 3 miles based on detailed work zone traffic analysis (Section 5-9) that should be considered. SWZS can be modified for any expected queue length. SWZS work best when the lane closure location does not move as it uses multiple components with complex programming.
Smart work zone systems (SWZS) can provide automated travel time information, queue warning, and dynamic lane merge (“zipper merge”) instructions to motorists on a series of PCMSs leading into a work zone. Displayed messages change as the queue lengthens or shortens as detected by several traffic sensors. The number of PCMSs and sensors is determined by the anticipated queue based on detailed work zone traffic analysis
WSDOT Traffic Manual

M 51-02.10
Page 5-47 Chapter 5
Work Zone Traffic Control (Section 5-9). The system’s complexity is adaptable based on the expected queue length and can be modified to meet site- specific situations and conditions.
SWZS components may be provided by the Contractor or through an independent vendor. A Technician programs and operates the system based on accepted traffic control plans and Special Provision/Request for Proposal. SWZS Technician is required to be on site when the system is in use. The QWS Technician may be an employee of the Vendor or someone trained and authorized by the Vendor, but shall be independent of the Contractor and Traffic Control Supervisor but shall collaborate and coordinate as appropriate. The Contractor or subcontractor will install, store, and remove the
SWZS components.
When used in Contracts, a Smart Work Zone System traffic control plan should be included along with speed thresholds, typically 35 mph. Typical plans are available in the
WSDOT Work Zone Traffic Control Plans for 3-mile and 6-mile SWZS.
General Specification Provisions are currently available and State-wide Request for
Proposal for Smart Work Zone Systems is expected to be available starting in 2022. The
Contract will specify when SWZS usage is required and specific system requirements.
SWZS is paid using two bid items. One bid item pays for mobilization and demobilization as lump sum; a second bid item pays hourly for when the SWZS operation is in use.
Standard traffic control bid items already listed in the WSDOT Standard Specifications will pay for installation and removal of the SWZS components.

B.
Positive Protection Devices
Positive protection devices are physical barriers not easily penetrated by errant vehicles that enhance work zone safety for both road users and workers. Such devices include temporary barrier, transportable attenuators, and protective vehicles.
Federal code 23 CFR Part 630 K, requires positive protection devices to be considered, to the extent practical, to manage work zone exposure to reduce the risk of fatalities or injuries to workers and road users. Alternative methods, such as reducing channelization device spacing at work crews, instead of using temporary barrier may be more practical.
C.
Work Zone Speed Limit Reductions & Advisory Speeds
When used to supplement sound work zone design, reduced work zone speed limits and advisory speeds are tools to improve safety; however, they are not a “silver bullet”.
According to Transportation Research Board’s NCHRP Synthesis 482 “Work Zone Speed
Management” report (download as a Guest using work email address), work zone speeds will be in greatest compliance with posted speed limits when: • Workers are present and actively working • Double fine signs are posted • Radar speed display signs are used • Police are actively enforcing the work zone speed limit
Page 5-48

WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5
In addition, NCHRP Synthesis 482 reports that speed differential is minimized when work zone speed limit reductions are 10 mph less than the existing speed limit. Speed differential, known as speed variance, is a potentially useful surrogate measure for safety.
Numerous research studies confirm motorists do not just “add 5 or 7 mph to the posted speed limit”, including this 1997 FHWA Report “Effects of Rising and Lowering Speed Limits on
Selected Roadway Sections”.
See Section 5-18 for detailed information, approval procedures, and required notifications for reduced work zone speed limits and advisory speeds. For Washington State Patrol Work
Zone Enforcement and Assistance information, see Section 5-19.
D.
Fines Double in Work Zone
Per Washington law, RCW 46.61.527, traffic fines double in all work zones without the need to post additional signage. To highlight the law, Washington State Patrol encourages the use of “NOTICE TRAFFIC FINES DOUBLE IN WORK ZONES” signs but they are not required for the double citation to be in effect.

E.
Washington State Patrol Enforcement
Using roving and coordinated speed enforcement by Washington State Patrol (WSP) is a highly effective strategy to control speeds in work zones, much more so than police vehicles sitting with their red and blue warning lights flashing in a work zone.
During roving speed enforcement, WSP typically drive through the work zone while actively enforcing traffic laws but may also perform enforcement while stationary at strategically locations. WSP troopers pull over violators and issue citations at their discretion.
During coordinated speed enforcement, a WSP trooper performs active enforcement within the work zone while informing several troopers downstream of motorists violating traffic laws. Those troopers downstream then pull over violators and issue citations at their discretion.
For comprehensive information regarding this subject, see Section 5-19.
F.
Uniform Police Officer Work Zone Assistance
Uniform Police Officer (UPO) is an all-inclusive term for any sworn police officer from local law enforcement agencies or Washington Patrol. Using UPOs is limited to traffic control assistance duties (flagging traffic at intersections or enforcing roadway closures) as shown on accepted traffic control plans.
For comprehensive information regarding this subject, see Section 5-20.

Speed Limit Reductions in Work Zones (Previously Appendix 5B)
It is WSDOT’s objective to design work zones to operate in a manner consistent with the desired target speed dependent upon mobility, operation, and safety objectives while acknowledging drivers reduce their speeds only if they clearly perceive the need to do so.
Avoid speed limit reductions of more than 10 mph below the existing speed limit unless a restrictive feature is present. Use speed limit reductions only in portion of work zones where conditions or restrictive features are present, but avoid frequent changes in the speed limit.
Secretary’s Executive Order E 1060.02 addresses the use, approval, required documentation, and required notices for work zone speed limits and advisory speeds: • Continuous regulatory work zone speed limits are in effect for 24 hours a day for the duration of a project or stage of work lasting 3 continuous days or more. • Variable regulatory work zone speed limit reduction is only in place during active work operations occurring during daily, nightly, and weekend-duration lane closures; otherwise, the existing speed limit is maintained. • Advisory speed is a recommended speed associated with a warning sign for a work zone condition in place continuously or variably.
Regulatory work zone speed limit is enforceable; signage shall be black legend on white background.
Advisory speed is not enforceable; signage is black legend on orange background.

A.
Continuous Work Zone Speed Limit and Advisory Speed
Continuous regulatory work zone speed limits (WZSL) are only considered when work zone design at the existing speed limit is not feasible or when operational or roadway conditions require a reduced speed for safe travel. Long-term temporary lane and shoulder width reductions should only occur to complete needed work operations, not for the sake of reducing vehicle speeds through the work zone. The distance and duration of reduced speed limits should be minimized the extent practical—slow down motorists only where necessary.
Exhibit 5-12 provides guidance to Region Traffic Operations for determining appropriate continuous WZSL on long-term temporary freeway reconfigurations.

WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5

The State Traffic Engineer shall approve freeway temporary lane widths less than 10.5’ and/ or freeway temporary shoulder widths less than 0.5’.
Continuous WZSLs and advisory speeds approval is per Executive Order E 1060.02. State
Traffic Engineer shall approve freeway continuous regulatory WZSLs of 45 mph or lower; the Region Administrator (Region Traffic Engineer when delegated) approves 50 mph or higher continuous freeway WZSLs.
Temporary lane and shoulder width reductions and lane closures do not trigger a use restriction in regards to FHWA notification (see Section 5-12 for details).
Traffic control plans will show the type, location, and limits of the approved speed limit reduction signing, including signing returning motorists to the existing speed limit.
Covering conflicting existing speed limit signage is required per Standard Specifications
Section 1-10.3(3)A.
Remove existing longitudinal rumble strips when within reconfigured temporary lane limits on long-term duration projects. Ensure all drainage, ITS, and other roadway structures within the existing shoulder are traffic bearing. Ensure pavement thickness is sufficient when traffic is shifted onto existing shoulders in the long-term duration reconfiguration.
Advisory speeds should only be used for unique situations and shall supplement warning signs or state the actual condition warranting the advisory.
When restrictive features in a work zone prevent the design speed from matching the work zone speed limit at a freeway median crossover, then MUTCD 6G.16 provides guidance for the restrictive feature to be designed at 10 mph less than the posted work zone speed limit.
In this case, an advisory speed equivalent to the reduced design speed at the restrictive feature’s location while the work zone speed limit is maintained.
Example: A 60 mph continuous work zone speed limit is posted along a 10-mile freeway work zone, but its median crossovers at the beginning and end can only meet a 50 mph design speed due to restrictive features. Rather than post the entire 10-mile work zone 50 mph, maintain the 60 mph work zone speed limit and use a
50 mph advisory speed plaque (W13-1P) to supplement an appropriate warning sign (W1-4 or W24-1 series), at the crossovers.

B.
Variable Work Zone Speed Limit and Advisory Speed
Variable work zone speed limit reductions are applicable to intermediate-term duration stationary work zones (lasting 3 continuous days or less, inclusive of weekend-duration closures) and may be considered as part of an overall safety strategy.
Freeway Shoulder Closures:
Reduced variable regulatory speed limits shall not be used for freeway shoulder closures.
Advisory speeds are allowable when unique conditions are present.
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10

Typical Freeway Lane Closures; No Lateral Shift onto Shoulder:
Maintaining the existing posted speed limit is allowable for intermediate-duration (≤ 3 days) lane closures, when lanes are not shifted to conflict with the existing or temporary pavement markings.
Reduced variable regulatory work zone speed limits per Exhibit 5-13 are recommended when: • Workers have no means of escape from motorized traffic (e.g., tunnels, bridge, etc.) • Workers are actively present within one-half lane width of adjacent open lane(s) not protected by barrier • High operation speeds combined with high traffic volumes are anticipated
If used, the variable regulatory work zone speed limit and advisory speeds are per

E 1060.02 in compliance with WSDOT Project Delivery Memo #19-01.
See Section 5-18.C for documentation requirements and Section 5-18.D for notification requirements.
It is understood there will be unique situations that may warrant adjustments to values listed in Exhibit 5-13 based on engineering judgement, but these adjustments are limited to 5 +/- mph to maximize consistency statewide.
When used, a Radar Speed Display Sign (RSDS) with an associated R2-1 speed limit sign should be located and relocated as needed to remain 500’ +/- of work crews when feasible. Additional RSDSs may be added prior to each work crew based on engineering judgement.

Page 5-52

Chapter 5
RSDS General Specification Provisions are currently available and includes a requirement for RSDSs to have traffic data collection capabilities and for traffic data to be collected and transmitted to the Engineer upon request. This data may be requested by State Work Zone Engineers thru Region Traffic Operations.
Typical plans are included in the WSDOT Work Zone Traffic Control Plan Library for variable regulatory work zone speed limits on two-lane and three-lane freeway configurations.
Typical Freeway Lane Closures; Single Lane Shifted onto Shoulder:
Both work zone variable regulatory speed limit and advisory speeds listed in Exhibit 5-14 are required when a single open freeway lane is temporarily shifted onto the shoulder for intermediate-duration (≤ 3 days) closures.
It is understood there will be unique situations that may warrant adjustments to values listed in Exhibit 5-14 based on engineering judgement, but these adjustments are limited to 5 +/- mph to maximize consistency statewide.
This shifted configuration is necessitated by work operations including but not limited to: • Two-lane freeway with the work area extending up to the lane line adjacent to traffic for work including HMA pavement, concrete pavement, and/or expansion joint rehabilitation. • Three-lane freeway with the work area including both lanes and extending up to the lane line adjacent to traffic for work including HMA pavement, concrete pavement, and/or expansion joint rehabilitation.

Work Zone Traffic Control
Washington Patrol Work Zone Enforcement and Assistance
It can be cost effective using Washington State Patrol (WSP) to supplement effective work zone strategies and traffic control devices by providing additional enforcement emphasis or performing specific traffic control assistance duties.
This General Special Provision (GSP) now allows Regions to define specific WSP activities and the number of hours provided by WSDOT at no cost to the Contractor on projects, but allows Contractors to request additional hours for those specific WSP activities at a 50/50 shared cost with WSDOT. This GSP should be included, even if zero hours are provided by WSDOT.
Roving Enforcement:
Using WSDOT-provided WSP roving speed enforcement a few times a week in active work zones when workers are present is an effective method to emphasize work zone speed limit reductions. During roving enforcement, WSP typically drive through the work zone while actively enforcing traffic laws but may also perform enforcement while stationary at strategically locations. The troopers pull over violators and issue citations at their discretion.
Coordinated Enforcement:
An alternative approach uses coordinated enforcement between multiple WSP troopers.
A WSP trooper performs active enforcement within the work zone while informing several troopers downstream of motorists violating traffic laws. Those troopers downstream then pull over violators and issue citations at their discretion.
Photo Speed Enforcement:
Per RCW 46.63.170, automated work zone speed photo enforcement is currently prohibited as the state law restricts nearly all automated speed enforcement use outside of school work zones.
Double Fines in Work Zones:
Per RCW 46.61.527, traffic fines are doubled in work zones or reckless endangerment gross misdemeanors issued for the most serious violations that likely endangers people or property. The double fine citation does not require “FINES DOUBLE” and “NOTICE
FINES DOUBLE IN WORK ZONES” signs; however, their presence is encouraged by WSP.
Routine enforcement by WSP in WSDOT work zones is always welcome and needs no special agreement.
When practical, a Public Information campaign to increase driver awareness of work zone safety issues will farther increase the effectiveness of WSP enforcement. Include notice via a PCMS in advance of an active enforcement area with a message similar to either of the following:

Procedure for Incorporating Use of WSP Enforcement and Assistance
Using WSP should be determined at the Design phase of the project and included in the
Transportation Management Plan.
Regional Maintenance divisions may establish a standing Task Assignment agreement to allow quick response by WSP if needed.
WSDOT-WSP GC 5080 Agreement is a legal document allowing WSDOT to reimburse WSP for costs associated with assigning troopers for work zone enforcement or assistance. The
Task Assignment, WSDOT Form 130-020, is completed for each project to assign specific work zone activities to WSP and connects WSDOT reimbursement to a specific work order.
Task Assignment Steps:
The Task Assignment should be completed, approved, and processed prior to the advertisement of a project to establish a WSP reimbursement work order. • Region assigns a Task Management Manager for each project • Task Assignment Manager develops a preliminary cost estimate using $125 per hour per
WSP trooper including vehicle (increased from $75 in Agreement GC 5080 signed in
2007 to more accurately reflect current WSP costs). The minimum WSP shift is 2 hours. • Task Assignment Manager requests the Agreement Number for each Task Assignment from Headquarters Traffic Office fiscal manager via email. Include the project name, route number, Contract or Work Order number (if known), and the preliminary cost estimate amount. • Once the task number is assigned, the Task Assignment Manager completes WSDOT
Form 130-020 and obtains approval typically from the Region Construction Project
Engineer, WSP Agency Budget, and Fiscal manager. Two original copies are required, one for WSP and one for WSDOT. • Task Assignment Manager submits WSDOT’s original signed WSDOT Form 130- 020 to
WSDOT Headquarters Budget Office. Copies are sent to Region Program Management,
Construction Project Engineering Office administrating the project, Region Accounting office, and the Region Traffic Operations. • The Region Accounting Office reimburses WSP per the Task Assignment Agreement.

Procedure for Requesting Use of WSP Enforcement and Assistance
Requests for WSP officers may occur after the Task Assignment Agreement is approved.
WSP currently has 8 districts (see Field Operations Bureau section) each with an Overtime
Coordinator in which requests for WSP officers are made (troopers are not guaranteed and are subject to availability). See the WSP Contact Us: District Office webpage for district contact information.
WSP requests should be made at least two weeks in advance for major weekend- duration closures needing multiple troopers; make other requests at least one week in advance.
WSP responds to emergencies and incidents in work zones without the need of an
Agreement, just like on roadways outside of work zones.

C.
Procedure for Using WSP Enforcement and Assistance During
Construction
An updated General Special Provision now allows Regions to define specific WSP activities and the number of hours provided by WSDOT at no cost to the Contractor on projects, but allows Contractors to request additional hours of those specific WSP activities at a 50/50 shared cost with WSDOT. A Task Assignment is still needed.
The WSP District Captain or their designee should be invited to pre-construction meetings, where specified WSP activities and hours of use should be discussed. Contact information for the WSDOT field engineer, Contractor Traffic Control Management, and the Traffic
Control Supervisor should be provided to WSP.
During construction, it is optional for the on-site WSP trooper to attend the Contractor’s
Pre-Activity Safety meeting, or similar. The WSDOT field engineer or project inspector is to provide direction to WSP, but in collaboration with the
Contractor’s traffic control management personnel. For each work shift when WSP is used, the WSDOT field engineer (or inspector) and WSP trooper shall complete WSDOT Form 421-045. Keep a copy of this form on file at the Construction Project Engineering Office.
Contact Region Traffic Operations and see if they desire copies.
Usage of WSP is typically limited to enforcement duties and other supplemental uses not required as part of accepted Contract PS&E traffic control plans.
Typical WSP Usage Examples: • Speed Enforcement Emphasis—Roving or coordinated enforcement • Within or adjacent to rolling blockade when implementing freeway rolling slowdowns • Full or directional closures of freeways; particularly in locations at high risk for errant motorist intrusion • Controlling traffic at signalized intersections (only when shown on accepted traffic control plans)

M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5
WSP Usage Not Recommended:
The following tasks are not recommended as efficient use of WSP assistance and shall only be considered for short term use but not as an ongoing strategy • General or routine use, especially with no significant traffic impacts expected • Passive use (WSP vehicle parked near or inside work zone with blue or yellow lights flashing). WSP presence is not a substitute for proper traffic control • During installation and removal of traffic control devices. WSP vehicles are not buffer vehicles • Shoulder closures • Lane closure(s) on roadways with posted speed limits of 40 mph or less • Lane closure(s) with alternating traffic on a two-lane highway • A ramp closure without other traffic control devices 5-20
Uniform Police Officer Usage in Work Zones
Uniform Police Officer (UPO) is an all-inclusive term for any sworn police officer from local law enforcement agencies or Washington Patrol.
A new General Special Provision requiring Contractors to provide UPOs as shown on accepted Contract PS&E traffic control plans and be reimbursed by the Agency via a hourly bid item.
During construction, it is desired for the UPO to attend the Contractor’s Pre-Activity Safety meeting, or similar. The Contractor will provide direction to UPO, not the Agency. The UPO is not required to complete WSDOT Form 421-045.
For use of local agency law enforcement personal, the Contractor develops a project specific agreement with each police agency for use and payment.
Typical Uniform Police Officer Usage (Shown on Accepted Traffic Control Plans): • Controlling either signalized intersections or unsignalized intersections • Full or directional closures of roadways; particularly in locations at high risk for errant motorist intrusion • Enforcing short-term road closures via traffic holds (Section 5-22)
Uniform Police Officer Usage Not Recommended:
The following tasks are not recommended as efficient use of local police officer assistance and shall only be considered for short term use but not as an ongoing strategy • Speed Enforcement Emphasis (use WSP instead in WSDOT jurisdiction; see
Section 5-19) • General or routine use, especially with no significant traffic impacts expected • Passive use (police vehicle parked near or inside work zone with blue or yellow lights flashing). Police presence is not a substitute for proper traffic control

Rolling Slowdowns
A rolling slowdown is a traffic control strategy that uses a rolling blockade of vehicles, each equipped with amber warning lights, traveling at slow speeds to create a gap in traffic to enable completion of work activities requiring exclusive access across or over the directional roadway that would otherwise present significant risks to motorists.
It is critical no traffic gets between the rolling blockade and work area. Within the limits of the rolling slowdown, traffic is held at most on-ramps, while freeway-to-freeway on-ramps should be closed with standard traffic control devices. Exit-ramps may remain open.
Rolling slowdowns may commence with additional temporary traffic control already set up (such as lane closures). Rolling slowdowns are most commonly used directionally on freeways due to their limited access. For other roadways, traffic holds may be more appropriate and are discussed in Section 5-22.
Accepted traffic control plans are required that detail the expected rolling slowdown duration, clear time at the work area, limits and target speed of the rolling slowdown, mainline rolling blockade details, chase vehicle details, temporary on-ramp closure details, portable changeable message signs used to warn traffic of the slowdown, and any additional requirements based on Guidance (Section 5-21.A) and Considerations (Section 5-21.B).
Work activities that typically necessitate a freeway rolling slowdown include but are not limited to the following: • Utility line installation or removal over a freeway • Removing an existing sign structure spanning over the freeway • Reconfiguration of all freeway lanes that narrow and laterally shift all lanes in one work shift (Rolling slowdown is used to install a chicane to laterally shift a single open lane of traffic from the far left lane over to the far right lane, or vice versa) when reopening lanes to switch traffic control is not feasible • During installation of traffic induction loops for permanent traffic recorders (see
Standard Plan J-50.12-02 and J-50.15-01) using a lead-in across all freeway lanes to a stub-out in the shoulder which requires a chicane when reopening lanes is not feasible • Emergency roadway or bridge repairs having short work durations (≤ 10 minutes)

Page 5-60
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Work Zone Traffic Control
Chapter 5 • Based on WSDOT’s determination, there is justification for using a rolling slowdown to mobilize large equipment, (cranes, drilling rigs, etc.) across the freeway versus demobilizing and mobilizing the equipment would lead to considerable delays and increased costs • Based on WSDOT’s determination, there is justification for using a rolling slowdown to provide construction vehicle ingress/egress movements between the work area onto mainline traffic in locations that would have minimal adverse traffic impacts and delays
Concurrent freeway rolling slowdowns in multiple directions is allowable when work operations occurring over all lanes in multiple directions.
A directional freeway closure is recommended in lieu of freeway rolling slowdowns during the following work operations occurring over all lanes in one direction: • Setting new bridge girders • Demolishing overhead bridge spans • Removing overhead structural falsework • Installing a new sign structure
WSDOT Region Traffic Operations may require directional freeway closures in lieu of freeway rolling slowdowns at its discretion.
A.
Guidance
The following guidance applies when implementing rolling slowdowns: • Avoid rolling slowdown durations exceeding 15 minutes • Target rolling slowdown speeds 40 mph less than the posted speed limit when feasible • Detours around the limits of the rolling slowdown are not necessary • Traffic should not be stopped during rolling slowdowns, except as a last resort due to a unique circumstance or in an emergency situation. • Use one blockade vehicle (transportable attenuator preferred) in each blocked lane • Consider using at least one Washington Patrol (WSP) vehicle with each directional rolling blockade on freeways; WSP may serve as a rolling blockade vehicle • Hold on-ramp traffic until the rolling blockade passes using construction or police vehicles placed prior to the paved gore in each on-ramp lane. Avoid holding traffic on freeway-to-freeway on-ramps, which should be closed with standard traffic control devices and may include signed detour routes. • A chase vehicle should follow the slowest vehicle ahead of each directional rolling blockade up to the work area to ensure the roadway is clear. • For concurrent rolling slowdowns in two or more directions, position a Traffic Control
Coordinator with a WSP Coordinator near the work area to coordinate the rolling slowdown, respond to any incidents, and to coordinate needed emergency response.

M 51-02.10
Page 5-61 Chapter 5
Work Zone Traffic Control • Inform Washington Patrol, local fire, police, emergency service agencies, and transit agencies (if applicable) at least 72-hours in advance of non-emergency rolling slowdowns. • For significant freeway rolling slowdowns occurring within Transportation Management
Areas (Seattle, Tacoma, Spokane, and Kennewick-Pasco urban areas): – Limit permitted rolling slowdowns to hours of lowest volumes; 11:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m. during weeknights and 11:59pm to 6:00 a.m. on weekends – Require as part of the traffic control plan acceptance, a meeting with all necessary stakeholders to define responsibilities and ensure activities required for successfully executing a rolling slowdown will be followed • Consider using a PCMS message similar to the example below for displaying advanced notification to the public:

Considerations
Consider the following when implementing rolling slowdowns: • As part of the rolling slowdown traffic control plan, consider specifying the development of an emergency contingency plan to handle traffic should unforeseen circumstances occur, including but not limited to: – An Emergency Medical Services vehicle transporting a critical care or specialty care patient needs urgent accommodation past the rolling slowdown – Work activity exceeds the planned available clear time – An errant vehicle gets around the rolling blockade or on-ramp traffic hold and is heading towards the work area • Have traffic queue formations and their dispersals monitored by traffic control personnel during and after each rolling slowdown with plan of action to respond to problems that develop because of the traffic queue • Requiring all traffic queues clear prior to commencing any subsequent rolling slowdowns

Rolling Slowdown Example #3
Situation: Freeway rolling slowdown needed for to transport a crane across all lanes of westbound I-82 over into the median at Milepost 38.16. Crews need 7 minutes of clear time at the work area. The work zone speed limit is 55 mph starting at MP 38.73 with the existing speed limit 70 mph (trucks 60 mph) maintained east of MP 38.73.
Determine: Duration of rolling slowdown needed in minutes and where it begins.
Known Variables:
TCLEAR = 7 minutes
VRS = 70 – 40 = 30 mph
Note: Rolling slowdown target speed is 40 mph less than the 70 mph posted speed limit.
VTRAFFIC = 55 mph
Note: Traffic speed is conservatively based on the lower 55 mph work zone speed limit for simplicity since there are no major upgrades (≥ 5 percent) in this area; typically the 60 mph truck speed limit would otherwise be used.

Answer: The rolling slowdown target speed is 11 mph, duration of 13 minutes, and begins at Milepost 2.67 (immediately following the I-5/I-90 interchange) on Eastbound I-90. 2nd Determine: What on-ramps need to be temporarily held or closed within the limits of the rolling slowdown until the mainline rolling blockade passes
As determined in above, the rolling slowdown limits is between MP2.58 to MP5.58 on
Eastbound I-90. Using SRview 3 WSDOT, WSDOT GeoPortal, and/or Google Maps (or similar), determine what on-ramps are located within the rolling slowdown limits.
Answer: On-ramps at the following locations that need to be held/closed: • Hold Southbound Rainer Ave → Eastbound I-90 (MP 3.34) • Hold Northbound Rainer Ave → Eastbound I-90 (MP 3.79)
Note: Since the I-5 ramps to EB I-90 are at the rolling slowdown limits, the rolling slowdown blockade can concurrently begin along the freeway-to-freeway on-ramps from NB I-5 and
SB I-5 and to join the EB I-90 blockade; however, freeway-to-freeway on-ramps traffic should not be stopped or held. If freeway- to-freeway ramps need to be stopped or held, they should be closed using standard traffic control devices.

Traffic Holds
A traffic hold is a traffic control strategy using flaggers and/or uniformed police officers (UPOs) to stop traffic in all directions to enable completion of work activities requiring exclusive access across or over the roadway that would otherwise present significant risks to motorists. UPOs include Washington Patrol and any local police agency.
Traffic holds shall not be used on freeway mainlines.
Traffic holds may be used on non-freeways roadways where rolling slowdowns (Section 5-21) are not feasible in lieu of a roadway closure. When used, it is preferred to reduce each approach down to a single open lane using standard traffic control devices and advanced warning signage. It is optional to place a UPO vehicle with emergency lights activated on either side of the work area after the flaggers to help block the roadway.
Traffic holds also may be used on roadways where traffic alternates in a single lane via flagger-control, particularly in areas where there are no alternative routes and work is being completed in a narrow area requiring traffic to be held in all directions.
When holding traffic at or near signalized intersections, the traffic signal must be turned off or set to all-way red flashing mode per WAC 468-95-3015. Per WAC 468-95-302, only UPOs should flag at the center of the intersection except in an emergency; however, flaggers may control each intersection leg.
A.
Traffic Hold Guidance
Consider the following guidance when implementing traffic holds: • Limit traffic hold durations to 10 minutes when feasible • If traffic hold durations are 15+ minutes on major arterial roadways, provide advance notice to the public at least 72 hours prior to and during traffic holds:

Work Zone Traffic Control
WSDOT Approval, Acceptance, & Review Protocol for Local Agencies
When within WSDOT jurisdiction, the work zone traffic control plans shall be consistent with WSDOT standard work zone practices and policy in addition to applicable state and federal laws. These requirements may exceed those set forth in the Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices (MUTCD). Each WSDOT Region Traffic Operations will determine standard work zone practices within their Region.
WSDOT has authorization to accept work zone traffic control plans only within the boundaries of WSDOT Right of Way, including all Interstate Highways and WSDOT Limited
Access (RCW 47.52).
There are conditions requiring WSDOT approval, acceptance, or review even when within local agency jurisdiction including: • Review traffic control plans involving a full highway closure (RCW 47.48.010) • Review traffic control plans that may impact state highway, freeway, or the Interstate
Highway System • Accept traffic control plans affecting a WSDOT owned or operated traffic signal along a State Route (RCW 47.24.020, Section 13). • Approve temporary regulatory work zone speed limit reduction along a State Route (Secretary’s Executive Order E 1060.02) • Approve the installation of all traffic signals, both permanent and temporary, along a State Route (RCW 47.24.020, Section 13)
Local agencies may request WSDOT to review traffic control plans outside of WSDOT jurisdiction, but acceptance is still the local agency’s responsibility.
The Memorandum of Understanding of “City Streets As Part of State Highways” provides an agreement between Cities and WSDOT for responsibilities in regards to the construction, operation, and maintenance for city streets that also function as state highways. By understanding responsibilities, it is then known who develops the associated traffic control plans.
Washington City and Town Profiles webpage provides current city population information.
The following information is needed to determine the appropriate traffic control plan (TCP) acceptances or reviews by WSDOT and local agencies: • WSDOT TCP Acceptance & Review Stamp Protocol (Section 5-23.A) • Right-of-Way & WSDOT Limited Access Information (Section 5-23.B) • Local Agency Boundary Information (Section 5-23.C) • State Highway Traffic Signals within Local Agencies (Section 5-23.D)

Traffic Regulations
General
Traffic regulations are intended to provide for driving behavior and actions that will lead to roadways that are the least likely to result in fatal and serious crashes. They create operating efficiencies on state highways, county roads, or city streets by placing enforceable operating restrictions on the use of the public roadway. A traffic regulation is either established in state law RCW 46.61, Rules of the Road, or is changed in law, based on data from an engineering and traffic investigation of road, land use and traffic (vehicle, freight, transit, pedestrian and bicyclist) conditions at the proposed location. Modifications to certain regulations require approvals at the State Traffic Engineer, Regional Traffic Engineer or
Regional Administrator level. The guidelines in this chapter explain specific regulations and identify the information needed to establish or modify a traffic regulation.
The Rules of the Road (RCW 46.61) regulate basic traffic movements on public roads including: • maximum speeds • turning movement restrictions • lane use • assignment of right of way • vehicle restrictions stop control • parking
A traffic regulation other than the Rules of the Road may be implemented only after an official action by the appropriate jurisdictional authority. For state highways, a proposed traffic regulation (or modification) is approved by either the Regional Traffic Engineer,
Regional Administrator, or the State Traffic Engineer, depending on the delegation of authority, and is administered as a “Calendar Agenda”.
Where city streets are part of managed access state highways, a city or town may regulate parking, stop control, and turn prohibitions by establishing an ordinance or resolution. Under
RCW 47.24.020(11), if a city or town wants tow regulate the above regulations on a state highway, the department must approve any regulation that is not identical to state law before it becomes effective (RCW 46.61.415).
A.

Regional Traffic Regulations Approved by Regional Administrator • Traffic signal installation permits on state highway system. • Reduced speed limits in construction or maintenance zones. • Regulatory speeds in rest areas, weigh stations, and ferry terminals. • Stop control on state highways. • Turn prohibitions and restrictions. • Pedestrian prohibitions on partial or modified access control highways. • Roadside parking restrictions (except for angle parking). • Tow-away zones along freeways. • Prohibitions on fishing or jumping from bridges. • Emergency or construction closures and weight restrictions. • Midblock pedestrian crossings

Headquarters Traffic Regulations Approved by State Traffic Engineer • Regulatory speeds (outside construction and maintenance work zones). • 20 mph school speed zones established under WAC 468-95-330. • Bicycle prohibitions on limited access highways. • Truck restrictions (including trucks hauling hazardous material). • HOV lane designations. • Hard shoulder running. • Angle parking on state and federal-aid highways. • Parking restrictions for park and ride lots and other parking facilities. • Regulation of sales within state parking facilities. • Permanent weight restrictions.
Permanent traffic regulation records are maintained in the office of the designated approving authority.
Traffic regulations or modifications are coordinated and administered by the Regional
Traffic Engineer and submitted to either the Regional Administrator or the State Traffic
Engineer as a Calendar Agenda (Figure 6-1 or Figure 6-2), for approval. The regulation’s approval or denial is recorded, which provides the necessary official documentation of the regulatory action. Regulations related to speed limit changes that are approved by the State Traffic Engineer are placed in a statewide Speed Zone Inventory database.

6-2
Documentation
Additionally, as outlined in this chapter, retain a summary of the engineering and traffic investigation and other data to support and document the regulation. Follow Chapter 11 records management for retention in the Traffic Manual. Inventories of traffic regulations are maintained in the office of the designated approving authority. Informational copies of completed Calendar Agenda action items are exchanged between the State Traffic Engineer and region Traffic offices. Copies are also provided to the Washington State Patrol (WSP), appropriate local agency and the Transportation Data, GIS and Modeling office (TDGMO). 6-3
Regional Traffic Regulations
Some types of traffic regulations address specific local traffic and geometric characteristics, without statewide implications. The Regional Administrators or Regional Traffic Engineers are delegated the authority to approve those regulations, which include the following: 1.

When considering a signal, complete a warrant analysis for the proposed location in submit a Calendar Agenda request (Figure 6-1) with the documentation below to the
Regional Administrator for approval.
Your submittal should include: • A vicinity map showing SR/MP location of the proposed signal • Detailed sketch showing traffic volumes, lane distribution, and other data relative to the request. Photos of the location and surrounding area, if possible. of the Design Manual. • If the proposed signal location is at a Collision Analysis Location (CAL), Collision
Analysis Corridor (CAC), or is listed in the latest priority array, collision data for the last three years should be included with the signal warrant analysis (part of
Warrant 7) • A statement detailing local agency funding and maintenance responsibilities, if applicable. • All city, county, fire district, and citizen requests, along with copies of other pertinent documents and correspondence. • The history of previously tried corrective countermeasures. • Other supporting data such as proximity to schools, shopping centers, pedestrian traffic, etc. • Signal Application Checklist (Figure 6-3).
Once approved, a Statewide Signal Permit Inventory number is obtained from
Headquarters and noted in part “F” on the permit form (Forms Management Form 242-014). Send a copy of the completed permit to Headquarters for final documentation. At a minimum, the complete signal warrant analysis should be included with the submittal to Headquarters for documentation purposes.

Reduced Regulatory Speed – Construction/Maintenance Zones – The Regional
Administrator may reduce speed limits in construction or maintenance work zones, following the guidelines given in Secretary’s Executive Order E 1060 and Traffic
Manual Appendix 5B. In some instances, speed limit reductions must be approved by the State Traffic Engineer.
C.
Regulatory Speeds in Rest Areas, Weigh Stations, and Ferry Terminals – The department is authorized (RCW 46.61.405) to set speed limits on any part of the highway system and at ferry terminals. Rest areas and weigh stations are included in items were delegated to the Regional Administrator. RCW 47.38.020 provides more details on the limitations on use of rest areas. Rest Areas are limited to a maximum stay of eight hours in a 24-hour period for vehicles and commercial vehicles may park up to an hour beyond their federally mandated rest periods. RCW 47.38.010 specifies the rules governing use and control of rest areas, historic sites, viewpoints, etc.—Penalties
Identify appropriate speed limits at these locations through an engineering and traffic investigation that considers: • Existing speed characteristics • Pedestrian traffic patterns • Geometric elements • Congestion • Operational conflicts
Field observation during periods of heavy use may be necessary to determine these characteristics.
The Rules of the Road (RCW 46.61.415) state that speed limits on local roadways cannot be posted at lower than 20 mph. Lower or higher speeds may be determined based on the engineering and traffic investigation.
Submit regulatory speed limit requests for these locations as a Calendar Agenda item to the Regional Administrator. Include data collected from the engineering and traffic investigation to support the request.
Regional Administrator Calendar Agenda items shall include: • A vicinity map and detailed strip map showing SR/MP location of the rest area, ferry terminal or weigh station. • A description of the operational conditions, such as heavy pedestrian usage, which identify the need for a speed reduction. Include speed studies if they are available. • A study of the last three years’ crash history. • Include proposed mitigation to reduce speeds. • Copies of WSP concurrences.

Stop Control on State Highways – All state highways are considered arterials and entering traffic must stop when signs are posted (RCW 46.61.195). Most intersections of a state highway and a county road or city street are controlled by a stop sign posted on the local roadway. However, stop control can be installed on the state highway approaches if it will improve the intersection operation and if the traffic volume on the local roadway is equal to or higher than the state highway volume. The specific provisions regarding stop control are: • The department is responsible for STOP or YIELD signs on county road approaches to state highways and on city street approaches in cities and towns under 27,500 population (RCW 47.24.020 (13)(17). Population threshold increases in 2023. • The department can designate a county road or city street as an arterial having preference over the state highway if it will improve traffic conditions. (RCW 46.61.195) • An incorporated city or town may pass an ordinance designating a city street as an arterial having preference over a state highway, if approved, in writing by the department. The city or town is then responsible for the STOP or YIELD signs.
RCW 46.61.195 does not specify a population threshold; therefore, any city or town may exercise this authority.) • Vehicles entering arterials from all other public or private roadways must stop before entering, when STOP signs are posted on the approach.
Respond to requests for state highway stop control by conducting an engineering and traffic investigation to determine if it is warranted at the subject location. Consider an all-way STOP if approach volumes are approximately equal or if a collision analysis shows collisions which are correctable by all-way stops (i.e., angle collisions). See
MUTCD, Section 2B.05 Stop Sign and All Way Stop plaque.
Document the investigation and submit the proposed regulation to the Regional
Administrator as a Calendar Agenda item. Include: • A vicinity map and detailed strip map showing SR/MP location of the intersection, together with the total traffic volumes and approach distributions. • A description of the operational conditions (such as sight distances) which identify the need for stop control, including any history of previously tried corrective measures. • A study of the last three years’ crash history, including whether the location is a
Collision Analysis Location (CAL), Collision Analysis Corridor (CAC), or is listed in the latest priority array. • A city or town ordinance is required for city streets which are part of state highways. • Copies of city, county, and/or citizen requests along with other pertinent documents and correspondence. • Copies of WSP and/or local police agency concurrences.

Turn prohibitions that are established in the Rules of the Road or are clearly defined by design elements in the MUTCD, Section 2B.19 do not need a traffic regulation.
All other turn prohibitions require a traffic regulation.
Conduct an engineering and traffic investigation of the subject location; document the investigation and submit the proposed regulation to the Regional Administrator as a Calendar Agenda item. Include: • A vicinity map and intersection sketch showing the SR/MP location together with the total traffic volumes, approach lane distributions and turning volumes. • Descriptions of operational conditions which identify the need for the regulation, such as pedestrian movements, large truck turning radii, or lack of adequate gaps. • The alternate routing intended to accommodate the turn-restricted traffic.
Convenient and strategic alternate routing is necessary to minimize the likelihood that a driver will ignore the prohibition. • A study of the last three years’ collision history, including whether the location is a Collision Analysis Location (CAL), Collision Analysis Corridor (CAC), or is listed in the latest priority array. • Copies of city, county, and/or citizen requests along with other pertinent documents and correspondence. • A city or town ordinance is required for city streets which are part of state highways. • Copies of WSP and/or local police agency concurrences, if applicable. • Photos or video, if available.

F.
Pedestrian Prohibitions on Full, Partial or Modified Access Control Highways –
Pedestrians are prohibited on highways that have been established and constructed as fully controlled limited access facilities WAC 468-58-050; WAC 468-58-010. This prohibition does not apply to pedestrian overcrossings, under-crossings and other facilities provided specifically for the use of such traffic.
On partial and modified access control highways the department is authorized to prohibit non-motorized traffic (e.g., pedestrians, bicycles) (RCW 46.61.160). Therefore, on highways with partial or modified access control, a specific traffic regulation is required to prohibit pedestrian traffic. A prohibition is only considered when an engineering and traffic investigation determines that pedestrians have an alternate route. It is not WSDOT policy to close pedestrian access when no feasible alternate route exists.
Prohibitions are appropriate along partial and modified access controlled highways in areas having the appearance of full access control, in areas where parallel pedestrian routes are available, and other areas where pedestrians on the shoulder proximity to the travel lanes does not provide sufficient width for walking or where speeds, volume and roadway complexity in combination preclude pedestrian use.

Chapter 6
Document the investigation and submit the proposed regulation to the Regional
Administrator as a Calendar Agenda item. Include: • A vicinity map of the area showing proposed prohibition limits and alternate pedestrian routes. Includes SR and MP. • Traffic volumes, shoulder width and posted speed limit. • Crash history for the past three years including any pedestrian involvements. • Summary statement detailing need for prohibition. Local agency coordination may be necessary, if so, include a summary of the coordination documentation. • Copies of WSP concurrences. • Photos or video, if available.
G.

Roadside Parking Restrictions – Parking or standing shall be permitted, except where parking has been limited by date and time and such limitations and restrictions have been approved by city ordinance or county resolution and the Regional Administrator (RCW 46.61.570(2). The Rules of the Road, (RCW 46.61.560 through 46.61.590) provide specific parking restrictions that are effective at all times along public roadways. When the region considers additional parking restrictions, conduct an engineering and traffic investigation to determine the need.
Administrator as a Calendar Agenda item. Include: • A detailed strip map of the area showing SR/MP, intersecting streets, and driveways, and other on-street or off-street parking alternatives. • Photos or video if available. • The type of restriction requested (i.e., time of day, mid-block to corner). • An analysis of operational conditions, such as narrow shoulders or limited sight distances that identify the need for the regulation. • Copies of a city or town ordinance, as required for city streets which are part of state highways. • Correspondence or comments regarding adjacent property and business owners’ parking. • Copies of WSP and/or local police agency concurrences.
H.
No Parking and No Parking Tow‑Away Zones along Freeways – WSDOT has the authority to restrict parking and place official traffic control devices prohibiting, limiting and restricting the stopping, standing or parking RCW 46.61.575. “No Parking” restrictions are appropriate at locations where operationally parked vehicles may block sight distance or pose a hazard.
On a limited access facility, it shall be unlawful for any person stop or park a vehicle within the right of way, including the shoulders, except at locations where signing specifically allows such stopping and parking RCW 47.52.120.
A “No Parking/Tow Away Zone” along a freeway may be established where there is an operational problem or collision history associated with vehicles parked on the shoulder. The WSP typically identifies these suggested locations.
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10
Page 6-7 Chapter 6
Traffic Regulations

When “Tow Away Zones” are required in addition to the “No Parking”, officers have the ability to promptly remove an unattended vehicle from a roadway shoulder if it constitutes an obstruction or jeopardizes public safety (RCW 46.55.113(2)(b)). The “no parking/tow-away zone” traffic regulation and related signing provide additional information for the motorist and an effective enforcement tool for the WSP.
Submit the proposed regulation to the Regional Administrator as a Calendar Agenda item. Include: • A detailed strip map of the area showing SR/MP, direction of traffic, roadway approaches and interchanges. • An analysis of operational conditions, roadway speed limit, including crashes associated with vehicles parked on the shoulder, narrow shoulders, or limited sight distances. • Parking restrictions in Rest Areas are approved by the State Traffic Engineer. • Copies of WSP and/or local police agency request and concurrence.
I.
Prohibitions of Fishing or Jumping from Bridges – Prohibitions of fishing or jumping from bridges are intended to alleviate injuries from distraction, jumping and person actions that might create unexpected conditions. An engineering and traffic investigation is conducted to determine the need for the prohibition.
Document the investigation and submit the proposed regulation to the Regional
Administrator as a Calendar Agenda item. Include: • A vicinity map showing the SR/MP of the bridge and the bridge number from the
Bridge List M 23-09. • A brief description of the conditions requiring the prohibition. • Copies of public or local agency correspondence. • Copies of WSP and/or local police agency concurrences.
There are a number of ‘fishing from bridges’ prohibitions that were adopted by the former Highway Commission, prior to traffic regulation authority being transferred to the department. The prohibitions remain effective unless rescinded by the
Regional Administrator.
J.

Highway Restrictions or Closures – Emergency, Temporary, Construction, or Weight
Related – The Regional Administrator approves emergency, temporary, construction, or weight related restrictions or closures. These place specific limitations on the use of a state highway. Examples are:
Emergency Closures or Restrictions: Emergency closures or restrictions may be implemented immediately, without prior notice or posting, in accordance with the procedures in Chapter 1 of the Maintenance Manual M 51-01. The Maintenance
Manual provides signing guidelines for emergency and non-emergency closures and restrictions.
Temporary or Construction Restrictions or Closures: RCW 47.48.010 gives the department the authority to close highways or segments of highways to all vehicles or any class of vehicles where such continued use will damage the roadway or be dangerous to traffic.
Page 6-8
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Traffic Regulations
Chapter 6
Investigate and document: • Document the conditions that require the restriction or regulation. • Detour accessibility options and emergency response contingency plan. • Internal WSDOT division correspondence, if any. • Copies of public or local agency correspondence. • Copies of WSP and local police agency concurrences.
Submit the proposed regulation to the Regional Administrator as a Calendar Agenda item. Include: • A vicinity map of area including SR/MP. • A discussion of roadway condition or situation that requires the restriction or closure. • Detour map, if available. • Copies of WSP, emergency response and local police agency concurrence. • Prior to restricting or closing a roadway segment, notice of the action must be given (per RCW 47.48.020) by:
Publishing a notice describing the restriction or closure in at least one newspaper issue of general circulation in the county, city, or town where the highway is located.
Posting a notice describing the restriction or closure in a conspicuous place at the ends of the highway or highway section.
It is important to remember state highway closures, unless it is under emergency conditions, require a three-day publication and posting a notice of closure, before the highway may be closed.
If the closure will be in effect for less than 12 hours (such as for many Special Events) it is not necessary to post a notice in a newspaper. Advance closure notices must still be posted on the highway. The Special Event Letter of Agreement is sufficient documentation of an event related restriction or closure.
Weight Restrictions: In accordance with WAC 468-38-080, temporary weight restrictions may be immediately imposed on highways in response to emergency road conditions, such as potential damage from freeze/thaw action.
The State Traffic Engineer approves permanent weight restrictions on bridge structures where posting is necessary due to deterioration of the structure. The Bridge and
Structures office typically initiates the restriction.
Oversize Load Restrictions: Notices of any roadway restriction or closure must be distributed to the Commercial Vehicle Services Office and signs must be installed by region maintenance that identify the milepost limits and the duration of the restriction.
The Commercial Vehicle Services Office issues the oversize load permits and should be made aware of any restrictions or closures along state highways. Some restriction may require pilot cars to accompany these loads (WAC 468-38).

Midblock Pedestrian Crossings on State Highways – The Regional Administrator may delegate the authority to the Region Traffic Engineer to approve midblock pedestrian crossing installations.
Chapter 4 Multi-Modal Design includes design guidance. Conditions that might increase the value of a midblock crossing includes the following: • High pedestrian crossing present. • Long block spacing. • Opportunity to channel multiple pedestrian crossings to a single location. • Visible crossing for pedestrians and motorists. • Local agency support. • Pedestrian traffic generator within vicinity of crossing. (e.g. transit stop, shopping, and high-density housing).
A traffic engineering study shall be submitted to the Region Traffic Engineer for approval by the project manager. If approved by the Regional Traffic Engineer, they shall forward the proposed crossing request to the Regional Administrator as a
Calendar Action agenda item. Request should include: • A vicinity map of the area showing proposed crossing along with pedestrian generators. • Traffic volumes. • Crash history for the past three years including any pedestrian involvements. • Summary statement detailing need for crossing. 6-4
Headquarters Traffic Regulations
Some types of traffic regulations address conditions that have statewide implications.
To assure uniformity, these are approved by the State Traffic Engineer, and include the following:
A.

Regulating Speed Limits
Speed limits are set to be the speed that is least likely to result in traffic fatalities and serious injuries and achieve compliance by the majority of drivers. In some cases, this will involve setting iterative speed limits over time until physical and psychological conditions can be changed to influence driver speed.
Speed limits frame expectations for drivers and other roadway users. Properly set speed limits should result in predictable, consistent, and reasonable vehicle speeds that consider the mobility, safety, accessibility and convenience for all users, including drivers, transit operations, pedestrians, and bicyclists.
Roadway context (current and planned future), changing development, transit, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities and activity, are all significant factors that need to be considered in addition to the traditional engineering study. There may be instances where the study may include a more in-depth review of speed limits in population centers for roads through and adjacent to residential and business districts.
Page 6-10
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Traffic Regulations
Chapter 6
The objective of speed zoning is to achieve operating speeds that minimize fatal and serious injuries for all road users and provide statewide consistency.
Review and Approval of New Speed Zones:
The Secretary of Transportation has delegated approving authority to the State Traffic
Engineer to authorize the establishment of speed limits. Region Traffic Operations divisions are responsible for performing the engineering/traffic analysis, context and multimodal user investigation needed to determine the most desirable operating speeds and implementing changes necessary.
Region Traffic offices may receive requests to reduce or increase speed limits from local agencies, tribal governments, citizen groups, developers, and law enforcement agencies. However, before the investigation begins, it is important to discuss the possible outcome of the review to ensure the requestor understands how WSDOT evaluates and sets speed limits. This is a good time to determine milepost limits of the speed zone request. It is also important to consider other roadway, user, and context changes in addition to speed zoning to address the underlying reason for the request.
Speed zoning is often not as effective as other speed management solutions but is often looked to as the easiest and cheapest solution by requestors. 1.

Engineering and Traffic Investigation: RCW 46.61.410 and RCW 46.61.405 authorize the secretary to Transportation to increase or decrease the speed limit based on an engineering and traffic investigation. The Region Traffic offices shall conduct an engineering and traffic investigation when determining the appropriate speed limit. WAC 468-95-045 modifies the MUTCD 2B.13 and provides guidance related to what is included in an engineering study. Weather, road surface conditions, or congestion may impact a proper investigation.
The following are factors that are considered: a)
Roadway Characteristics and Roadway Users – Consider roadway characteristics of the proposed segment, adjacent transitional speed zones, existing traffic control devices, roadway facilities and condition, and traffic generating activity (for all user types) within and adjacent to the proposed speed zone. Key roadway factors to consider: • Roadway alignment may dictate operational speed due to curvature of the roadway. A time travel speed review may be useful in making the determination. • Roadway facilities for all user types, including vehicle travel lanes/ widths, on-street parking, transit facilities, pedestrian and bicycle facilities, sidewalks. • Operational devices for all user types including signalized intersections, controlled/uncontrolled pedestrian/bicycle crossings, speed feedback signs, special signing, etc. • Route continuity should be reviewed. Verify the proposed segment has similar characteristics as adjacent or near-by speed zones. Where applicable, review and potentially revise adjacent speed zones.
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10
Page 6-11 Chapter 6
Traffic Regulations • Future changes in, or plans for, roadside development, private and public access points within the segment may influence driver behavior. • Pedestrian and bicycle activity and accessibility, existing and projected; school zone, transit, rail, parks, and urban development may influence driver behavior. Research nearby pedestrian and bicycle traffic generators. Multimodal paths, sidewalks, or trails may influence driver behavior. Please consider path location, path width, and demand of active transportation users. A multimodal LOS performance measurement may be useful in urban/suburban developed environments when required information is available. b)
Speed Studies – Speed studies are used to evaluate how the drivers are currently operating along the roadway. Speed studies should be conducted during non-peak hours, away from intersections, signalized locations, noninclement weather, and outside of curves. When possible, a minimum of
100 free-flowing vehicles should be sampled. Roadways less than 1000
ADT, 30 free-flowing vehicles should be sampled. Depending on length of proposed speed zone segment, several locations may be used to conduct speed studies.
Most drivers will select a speed at which they believe is safe and reasonable based upon their perception of the roadway. In consideration of the actual speeds on a particular roadway, WSDOT considers two speed measures and they are: • 85th percentile speed: the 85th percentile is the speed at or below
85 percent of vehicles travel under free-flowing conditions • 10 mph pace: the 10-mph pace is the range of speed at which the majority of cars are traveling on a particular stretch of road
WSDOT places an emphasis on the pace speed over the 85th percentile speed when considering speed limit changes.
Where operating speeds are high, other speed management techniques may be necessary.

c)
Crash History – Crashes resulting in fatalities and serious injuries are the most important crash types to consider. Analyze crashes to determine potential causes or patterns. Evaluate if a reduced speed limit would change the number or the severity of crashes. The following information should be considered: • Review the most recent three years of crash history. • If there are areas of concentrated crashes and the operating speed is consistent with the posted speed, verify a speed change is the preferred solution. The preferred solution may be independent of a speed limit change, or addition to.
Page 6-12
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Traffic Regulations
Chapter 6
Consider if other solutions besides speed limit changes are feasible to address crash history. Crashes involving tailgating, illegal passing, or other aggressive behaviors may be associated with speed differentials and may also be considered.
Communication and a field review with local law enforcement and the
Washington State Patrol is beneficial.
Crash history may be used to determine system-wide changes to prevent crashes proactively in similar locations. d)

Traffic Conditions: The type and number of users along the roadway (includes passenger vehicles, trucks, busses, pedestrians, bicycles) all have an influence on driver speed selection. Drivers also adjust their speed for temporary conditions unrelated to volumes of all user types. These conditions may be point or segment occurrences (such as access points), and influence driver speeds for varying durations and distances. The recurrence of these conditions should be considered in determining the regulatory speed for the segment, particularly for segments that present difficulties in measuring free-flow speeds. The use of temporary advisory speeds may also be a suitable treatment. These influences may include: • Roadside development. Increased levels of roadside development and access may lead to the potential for more traffic conflicts because of ingress and egress, turning movements, transit use, bicycle, and pedestrian activity. • Locations where seasonal and other peak events occur that may impact traffic. • Highways with limited locations for law enforcement to set up enforcement or pull a motorist over. • Locations with increased pedestrian or bicycle presence. • Increase or decrease in AM/PM Peak Travel Times. • Increase or decrease in ADT’s. • Venues that generate increased traffic, both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Also, ferry, rail and transit terminals may influence traffic. • Truck volumes.
Preliminary Review and Consideration: Where speed zone changes are justified, submit a preliminary speed zone request to the Headquarters Traffic
Office for preliminary approval. Include the following: • Proposed SR and Milepost, existing speed limit and proposed speed limit. • Include a summary as it relates to your engineering investigation and include: – Speed studies, crash history, recent or future construction projects. – Communication outreach. – Multimodal considerations. – Other contributing information supporting the change in speed limit.

Traffic Regulations • Proposed traffic calming mitigation, for example: – Driver feedback signing, no pass striping, geometric changes. – Other traffic calming or speed management measures.
There are several benefits in conducting preliminary discussions with the Headquarters Traffic office. The Headquarters Regulations Specialist can assist regions with package preparation and provide guidance and recommendations on speed mitigation. 2.
Full Package Submittal Calendar Agenda Action: Regional Traffic offices will submit a full package speed zone request to the State Traffic Engineer as a
Calendar Agenda Action item (Figure 6-2). The submittal shall include: a)

Cover Memo from Regional Traffic Engineer or Regional Administrator, to the State Traffic Engineer: • Summarize the traffic investigation to include reasons for the change and who initiated the request. Include decisions from preliminary
Headquarters review. • Include pedestrian, bicycle, transit and community interest and benefits, if applicable. • Include state route, existing begin and end speed zone mileposts, and posted speed limit and proposed begin and end mileposts and proposed speed limit. • If the zone is located within the city/town limits or vicinity, include city/ town name. • Include previously tried corrective speed reducing measures and results.
When applicable, include the roadway characteristics, geometrics, condition, grade, and sight distance, etc. b)
Vicinity Map Showing • State route, mileposts, city limit boundary (if applicable), speed study milepost locations and results; including 10 MPH Pace and 85th percentile speeds. • Show existing speed zone boundary, adjacent speed zones, and proposed speed zone. • Identify roadway, context and user characteristics that are used for justification. For example, include trail crossings. • The map should be readable and may include satellite imagery. c)
Crash History • Include three (3) years of the most current crash history. Include only the crash summary.
Page 6-14

Chapter 6 d)
Local Agency Concurrence • A copy of the local agency ordinance or resolution is required for changes to speed limits within incorporated cities or towns. • Highways that are fully controlled limited access do not require a city ordinance, however, it is important to include documentation of local agency communication and understanding. • The Washington State Patrol concurrence at the Lieutenant level or higher. • Speed Limit Request Checklist (Figure 6-4).

e)
Other Documentation • An environmental review of the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) if the proposed speed limit is being raised to above 55 MPH. • If applicable, a narrative on how tribal considerations is addressed, see environmental review process.
When the engineering and traffic investigation does not support a speed limit revision; implement other potential corrective measures, such as traffic calming/ speed management revisions, warning signs, and public information campaigns.
Observe and document the results of these measures before submitting a speed zone proposal. • The State Traffic Regulations Specialist maintains a statewide speed limit inventory. 3.
Speed Limits for Schools and Playgrounds – State law includes two parts to address reduced 20 mph speed zones for schools or playgrounds. A Calendar
Agenda Action is not required to approve school speed zones when following the criteria in RCW 46.61.440 as noted below. If the proposed school speed zone segment extends beyond the 300 feet, a Calendar Agenda Action approval by the
State Traffic Engineer is required.
PART 1: RCW 46.61.440(1) establishes a 20 mph speed zone at a marked school or playground crosswalk when the marked crosswalk is posted with standard school speed limit or playground speed limit signing.
PART 2: RCW 46.61.440(2) allows a county or incorporated city or town to establish a 20 mph speed zone on a roadway bordering a marked school or playground. The speed zone may only include area consistent with active school or playground use.
Part 1 establishes a 20 mph speed zone at a marked school or playground crosswalk, when the crosswalk is posted with standard school or playground signs.
School or playground crosswalk speed zones are addressed in WAC 468-95330 and WAC 468-95-340 and discussed in Chapter 2 – Signing. School speed zone signing is shown in Chapter 2. School Speed Limit assembly shall consist of a top plaque SCHOOL legend, a Speed Limit sign, and a bottom plaque may indicate; specific time periods of the day and/or days of the week, or the term
When Flashing, is used to notify motorist when the school speed limit is in effect.

WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10
Page 6-15 Chapter 6
Traffic Regulations
To increase visibility, these signs may be supplemented with a flashing beacon or flags to increase compliance with the speed zone may be considered.
The 20 mph speed zone shall extend a full 300 feet in either direction from the marked school or playground crosswalk unless there is less than 300 feet to the terminus of the roadway. School or playground speed zones established under this law do not require a traffic regulation.
There may be locations where the 20 mph speed zone may extend more than
300 feet from the crosswalk, however, the distance beyond 300 feet requires a traffic regulation based on an engineering and traffic investigation. This regulation is approved by the State Traffic Engineer.
For city streets that are also state highways, the department must approve the city ordinance that extends the school or playground speed limit (RCW 47.24.020(11) and RCW 46.61.415(5)).
Where school crosswalks serve an elementary school, the engineering and traffic investigation should consider the school’s Walk Route Plan. The Superintendent of Public Instruction limits the number of school crossings and allows only one entrance-exit from each block to and from the school.
Part 2 allows a county or incorporated city or town to establish a 20 mph speed zone adjacent to and extending up to 300 feet beyond the border of a school or playground property. The zone may only include the area consistent with active school or playground use (WAC 468-95-330). A marked crosswalk is not necessary to establish a 20 mph speed zone under RCW 46.61.440(2).
300 feet from the border of a school or playground property, however, the distance beyond 300 feet requires a traffic regulation based on an engineering and traffic investigation. This regulation is approved by the State Traffic Engineer.
For city streets that are also state highways, the department must approve the city ordinance that extends the school or playground speed limit (RCW 47.24.020(11) and RCW 46.61.415(5)). 4.

Speed Limits on State Highways Within Tribal Reservation Boundaries –
Beginning in 2009, state law (RCW 46.61.480) affirms that tribal authorities may determine the speed limit on the portions of non-limited access state highways that pass within tribal reservation boundaries. The speed limit must be based on an engineering and traffic investigation and is not effective until approved by
WSDOT, and appropriate signing is posted.
Submit a Calendar Agenda Action request to the State Traffic Engineer for approval. 5.
Page 6-16
Speed Limits on Ocean Beaches – Ocean beaches are under the jurisdiction of the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission (RCW 79A.05.610).
The Commission has set the maximum speed limit on beaches at 25 mph (WAC 352-37-130).
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Traffic Regulations
Chapter 6

6.
Minimum Speed Limit – Although RCW 46.61.425(2) authorizes the department to post a minimum speed limit on a highway segment, the Rules of the Road do not mandate a statutory minimum speed limit for state highways. RCW 46.61.415 states in part that minimum speed limits on local roadways may not be set lower than 20 mph. Further, RCW 46.61.440 sets 20 mph as the speed limit at marked school or playground crosswalks. For consistency with these statutes, it is suggested that 20 mph be the lowest speed limit that the department will consider. 7.
20 MPH Speed Limits within a City or Town – When approached by a town or city, and the land use context indicates significant interaction of people walking, biking, and using motorized vehicles, a regulatory 20 MPH speed limit should be considered using the following guidance: • The State Highway functional classification shall be a nonarterial highway.
These highways typically provide both land access and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods, commercial and industrial areas and differ from the arterial system. • The proposed speed zone is within incorporated city/town limits and is supported by the city/town. An ordinance is required for all non-limited access highways. • The existing posted speed limit is 25 MPH. • The roadway should have common characteristics to effectively constrain speed. • The Washington State Patrol and local agency law enforcement are in support of the reduction. • Reference the Guidance for Setting Speed Limit 20 MPHs (2019), outside of school zones.
Once a determination has been made, submit your Calendar Agenda Action item to the State Traffic Engineer for approval. In your cover memorandum, include information regarding the above criteria used in your determination.
In addition to towns and cities, a lower speed limit may be considered in unique situations such as weigh stations, ferry terminals or rest areas. 8.
Vehicle Specific Speed Limits, Trucks – The maximum speed limit for trucks is
60 mph (RCW 46.61.410). The department may set lower maximum limits by vehicle class if determined necessary for safety reasons (RCW 46.61.405(2)).
Trucks are defined as vehicles over 10,000 pounds gross weight and all vehicles in combination (except auto stages). RCW 46.04.130 defines a combination of vehicles as every combination of motor vehicle and motor vehicle, motor vehicle and trailer, or motor vehicle and semi-trailer.

Traffic Regulations 9.
Environmental Review Process – SEPA requires an environmental review of any proposal to raise the speed limit on a highway to above 55 mph. Contact the
Regional Environmental Manager’s Office for information on the environmental review process and to determine if the proposed speed limit change area falls within an air quality maintenance area (non-attainment area) for carbon monoxide or ozone. A completed review must accompany the traffic regulation request package. For further information, consult the Environmental Manual M 31-11.
Either of two review procedures will be required: a)
If none of the proposed change area is located within an air quality maintenance area, the reviewer completes the Non- project Environmental
Checklist and the Determination of Non-Significance. Include a copy in the traffic regulation package and provide copies to the Headquarters
Environmental Services Office. It is not necessary to provide a copy to any other jurisdiction, nor does SEPA require a comment period. b)
If any part of the proposed change area is located within an air quality maintenance area, the local Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) must model impacts from the proposed speed limit increase. If the modeling shows that the carbon monoxide and ozone allowances are not exceeded, follow the same procedures outlined for areas outside air quality maintenance areas. If the modeling shows that the carbon monoxide and ozone allowances will be exceeded, the impacts must be mitigated before the speed limit may be increased.

Washington State Laws in Setting Speed Limits:
Maximum speed limits for state highways, county roads, and city streets are mandated in the Rules of the Road (RCW 46.61.400). Statutory speed limits are: a)
Twenty-five miles per hour on city and town streets; b)
Fifty miles per hour on county roads; c)
Sixty miles per hour on state highways
The department may raise or lower state highway speed limits based on an engineering and traffic investigation (RCW 46.61.405 and 46.61.410).
WAC 468-95-045 modifies the MUTCD section 2B.13 to give guidance that the 85th percentile speed is a consideration along with other factors in setting speed limits.
These factors include: • Road characteristics, shoulder condition, grade, alignment, and sight distance. • The pace speeds. • Roadside development and environment. • Parking practices and pedestrian activity. • Reported crash experience for at least a 12-month period (WSDOT looks at three years); and • Other factors, such as route development or comprehensive plans

Chapter 6
RCW 47.24.020 establishes jurisdictional control with respect to state highways that are also considered city streets. Cities have the authority to regulate speed limits, however, speed limits not identical to state law must be approved the Secretary of Transportation.
RCW 46.61.415 Local authorities may establish or alter speed limits in their respective jurisdictions based on an engineering and traffic investigation. Speed limit increases are limited to sixty miles per hour and decreases are limited to twenty miles per hour.
Cities and towns within their jurisdiction may establish a maximum speed limit of twenty miles per hour on a nonarterial highway, or part of a nonarterial highway, that is within a residence district or business district.
A city or town may establish a twenty mile per hour speed limit without an engineering and traffic investigation if the city or town has developed procedures regarding establishing a maximum speed limit under RCW 46.61.415(3). Any speed limit established under this subsection may be canceled within one year of its establishment, and the previous speed limit reestablished, and may be done without an engineering and traffic investigation. Twenty mile per hour posted speed limits on state highways will likely be posted on collector routes in small rural towns.
Changes to the speed limit on state highways within an incorporated city or town must be approved the Washington State Department of Transportation.
B.
Other Regulations 1.
Bicycle Restrictions – Bicycle restrictions may be implemented at specific locations due to speed differentials between bicyclists and other traffic, extremely high traffic volumes, roadway geometrics, or other safety considerations. Where bicycle restrictions are necessary, alternate routing suitable for bicycles must be available.

2.
Restrictions on Limited Access Highways to Bicycles, RCW 46.61.160 –
The department of transportation may by order, and local authorities may by ordinance or resolution, with respect to any limited access highway under their respective jurisdictions prohibit the use of bicycles.
When considering an area for bicycle restriction or prohibition, conduct an engineering and traffic investigation and involve the regional active transportation bicycle coordinator, the bicycling community, and local agencies. Their input assures that bicycling interests are considered and that bicycle commute corridors remain intact.
Prior to submitting your calendar action, conduct a preliminary review of your submittal with the Active Transportation Divisions State Bicycle and Pedestrian
Coordinator. Document the investigation and submit the proposed regulation to the State Traffic Engineer as a calendar agenda item. Include: • A vicinity map and strip map showing SR/MP of the area. • Location and descriptions of available alternate routes. • Copies of documents, correspondence, citizen requests, and Active
Transportation Division review comments.

Less than 4 feet when ADT between 20,000 and 60,000 or 8 feet when ADT exceeds 60,000 ADT.
Double On/Off Ramps
Consider forced exit and return.

Interchange Spacing
Less than 2 miles with ramp volume greater than 10,000 ADT, use forced exit and return.
Tunnels/Bridges
Consider restriction when alternate routes are available.
The State Traffic Engineer will coordinate with the department’s State Bicycle and Pedestrian Coordinator to arrange for a review of the proposed restriction.
Once approved, Headquarters Traffic will notify the Active Transportation Division and they will update the statewide map on highways closed to bicycles (State
Highways Closed to Bicycles). 3.
Truck Restrictions – Truck restrictions may be imposed by statutory mandate (RCW or WAC), or by approval by the State Traffic Engineer through a Calendar
Agenda item. Truck restrictions are either as lane restrictions or route restrictions and designations.
Left‑Lane Restrictions – As mandated by RCW 46.61.100(3) and WAC 468510-020, no vehicle towing a trailer or no vehicle or vehicle combination over 10,000 lbs. may use the left lane of limited access highways having three or more general purpose lanes in one direction.
Lane restrictions for trucks may also be imposed on other highway sections through a State Traffic Engineer Calendar Action. Although rare, these restrictions may be necessary to improve traffic flow on facilities having two general purpose lanes in one direction.
Truck route restrictions and designations – These restrictions are normally implemented together to establish a preferred truck route through a corridor.
Route restrictions and designations may be initiated by a local agency for city streets that are also state highways.

An engineering and traffic investigation is conducted to determine the need for the restriction and route designation.
Document the investigation and submit the proposed regulation to the State
Traffic Engineer as a calendar agenda item. Include: • A vicinity map and strip map showing SR/MP of the area defining restricted route and truck route. • Description of operational characteristics which identify the need for the restriction. • Copies of speed studies, volume studies including vehicle classification, and a three-year crash history. • Copies of documents or correspondence from citizen groups. • A copy of the local agency ordinance if the restriction is for a city street that is also a state highway. • Copies of WSP and/or Washington Trucking Association concurrences.
Refer questions concerning WAC 468-510-020 to the State Traffic Regulations

WSDOT Traffic Manual
HOV Lane Designation – High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) RCW 46.61.165 lanes are exclusive traffic lanes limited to carrying public transportation vehicles, private motor vehicles with the number of occupants specified on posted signs, motorcycles, and emergency vehicles RCW 47.52.025 (WAC 468-510-010). The
Revised Codes of Washington give WSDOT the right to designate any lane or ramp for HOV if it will increase the efficient utilization of the highway or will aid in the conservation of energy resources. The goal of the system is to maximize the people-carrying capacity of the freeway system, by providing incentives to use buses, vanpools, and carpools. In addition to provide capacity for future travel growth and reduce transportation-related pollution and dependency on fossil fuels.
M 51-02.10
Page 6-21 Chapter 6
Traffic Regulations
Designated HOV lanes are established through a regulation approved by the State
Traffic Engineer. Conduct an engineering and traffic investigation, document the condition, and submit the following information as a Calendar Agenda item: • A vicinity map and strip identifying the SR and milepost limits and showing the locations of ramps within the proposed section. • The proposed minimum number of occupants per vehicle, and engineering documentation to support that minimum. • Projected lane occupancy rates for both the HOV lane and the adjacent general-purpose lanes. • Proposed hours of HOV operation. • Copies of design data. • For proposed shoulder HOV lanes, include the pavement depth information that the shoulder has adequate structural strength to support the HOV lane traffic. • On highways where bicycles are allowed on the shoulder, a narrative on how bicycle traffic will be accommodated if the shoulder HOV lane is approved. 6.
Angle Parking on State Highways
Statutory Requirements – Angle parking may be requested by a city or a town, for a city street that is also a state highway (RCW 46.61.575(3)). Local authorities, by ordinance or resolution, may permit angle parking on such a street, if the department has determined that the roadway is of sufficient width to permit angle parking without interfering with the free movement of traffic.
Conduct an engineering and traffic investigation of the location. If angle parking is determined appropriate, submit a Calendar Agenda item to the State Traffic
Engineer with the following supporting documentation: • Vicinity and strip map showing the SR/MP of the proposed parking regulation. • Narrative describing the need for angle parking, including speed limit and traffic volumes. • Crash data for the past three years. • Copy of the city or town ordinance establishing angle parking. • Parking plan layouts. • A demonstration (using a passenger vehicle for design purposes) that the parking maneuver can be accomplished without interfering with the free movement of traffic. Use turning movements to demonstrate ability. • Review and document bicycle lanes in the vicinity.
Where it is necessary to initiate removing angle parking, it is important to partner with local agencies (for city streets that are also state highways) and/or the business community to establish a mutually acceptable time frame. In many locations, angle parking may be the only parking available to business patrons. In these cases, a comprehensive approach to providing other parking must be part of any effort to remove angle parking. Refer to the procedures for Rescinding Traffic
Regulations below.

Chapter 6 7.
Park and Ride Lots and Rest Area Parking Restrictions
Park and Ride Lots: Within the department’s park and ride facilities, parking is limited to a maximum of 48 hours, when posted with signs (R8-1201). The State
Traffic Engineer established this restriction through an official Calendar Agenda action on January 8, 1982. (RCW 46.61.577) Local agency police can enforce parking regulations in WSDOT Park and Ride lots if the city or town has adopted an ordinance similar to the department’s 48 hour parking maximum.
Work closely with regional transit agencies, Public Transportation and Regional
Planning offices when considering changes to Park and Ride facilities. Included is a link to WSDOT’s Park and Ride locations statewide; Park and Ride.
If modifications are necessary to the 48-hour ruling, submit a Calendar Agenda item to the State Traffic Engineer with the following supporting documentation: • Vicinity map showing SR/MP of Park and Ride Location. • Narrative describing the need for the parking restriction. • Local Agency ordinance if located outside the boundary of a limited access highway. • Documentation related to communication with Regional Planning Division,
Public Transportation, local transit agency, law enforcement, regional maintenance, and local agency.

8.
Rest Area Parking: Rest Area parking is permitted by law RCW 47.38.020.
Rest Area parking is limited to eight hours within a twenty-four-hour period.
No person shall camp maintain a camp, tent, or other sleeping accommodation in a Rest Area within the limits of the right-of-way of interstate highways or other state highways or in other areas of state or interstate highways as designated in RCW 47.12.250.
The department may designate zones within a Rest Area with shorter parking time limits for the purposes of maximum efficiency and safety.
Commercial Vehicles can park up to an hour beyond the federally mandated rest period. In most cases this is eleven hours.
The department shall post the appropriate signage consistent with RCW 46.55.070(1) at all Rest Areas regarding the parking time limits in this section.
If modifications are necessary outside of what is authorized, submit as a
Calendar Agenda item to the State Traffic Engineer with the following supporting information: • Vicinity and strip map showing the SR/MP of the proposed parking regulation. • Narrative describing the need for parking restriction. • WSP concurrence. • Parking plan layouts.

Other Parking restrictions; Ferry Terminals, and Chain-Up Areas, conduct an engineering and traffic investigation of the location and document the condition.
Submit the proposed restriction as a Calendar Agenda item to the Regional
Administrator together with copies of all correspondence associated with the request. 10. Regulation of Sales within State Parking Facilities – The use of state parking facilities for sales of vehicles or other merchandise is not allowed and the supporting enforcement statutes are as follows: • RCW 46.55.070 specifies the posting requirements for public parking facilities. • RCW 46.55.010(14) defines an unauthorized vehicle and the required period of time prior to impoundment for posted public parking facilities. • RCW 46.55.080 authorizes that police officers may direct the impoundment of unauthorized vehicles. • RCW 47.32.120 makes it unlawful to “merchandise” in a manner that requires the use of any portion of state highway right of way. • RCW 46.55.240(1)(a) provides a city, town, or county the authority to adopt the provisions of RCW 46.55 by ordinance or resolution. • WAC 308-330-436 of the Model Traffic Ordinance (MTO) may be used by local agencies who have adopted the MTO, for park and ride lots located within their jurisdiction. 11. Permanent Weight Restrictions – Permanent weight restrictions may be imposed if the structure is deemed insufficient to support the maximum legal load. An example, a bridge restriction could be due to the deterioration of the structure over time or they were built to an old standard or code. Bridge and Structures division will normally initiate bridge weight restrictions.
Investigate and document the need for the restriction and submit a Calendar
Agenda Action request to the State Traffic Engineer. Include: • A strip map to include SR and MP. • A narrative describing the road or bridge condition leading to the restriction. • The appropriate maximum weight limit for a restricted section of roadway, as determined by the department’s Materials Laboratory. • A determination of the appropriate bridge weight limit as set by the Bridge and
Structures office. • Citizen or local agency correspondence. • Alternate routing, if available. • Detour plan, if necessary. • A copy of WSP concurrence.
Weight restrictions are signed with the appropriate R12 series signs illustrated in the Sign Fabrication Manual M 55-05.

Other Traffic Restrictions
Compression Brake Prohibition – The department does not regulate compression brake use; compression brake regulations are enacted by local agencies and may be signed on state highways as described in the Chapter 2. 6-6
Rescinding Existing Traffic Regulations
Occasionally changes to the highway or roadside environment create the need to rescind a traffic regulation. The Regional Administrator or State Traffic Engineer accomplishes this through a Calendar Action Agenda item. Removing the signs or posted notices of the regulation does not rescind the regulation.
A.
Regional Traffic Regulations – Use the following guidance when rescinding regional traffic regulations: 1.

When removing a traffic signal, complete Section E, Report of Change, on the regional copy of the Traffic Signal Permit. Part of Section E provides documentation for the date of removal, together with the engineer’s name, title, and reporting date. A copy of that permit is then sent to the Headquarters Traffic
Regulations Specialist for retention in the signal permit file. 2.
Reduced regulatory speeds in construction or maintenance areas may be implemented under certain conditions specified within Secretary’s Executive
Order E 1060 and Traffic Manual Appendix 5.B. The guidance states that when the warranting conditions no longer exist, the reduced regulatory speed limit is no longer justified. Generally, this is at the end of the project and is noted in the
Work Zone Speed Reduction Request. The permanent speed limit signs are then reinstalled, uncovered, or turned toward traffic.
The Regional Administrator, using the regional Calendar Agenda process, has the authority to rescind the following regulations if they are no longer necessary: • Stop Control on state highways. • Turn prohibitions. • Pedestrian prohibitions on partial or modified access controlled highways. • Roadside parking restrictions (except for angle parking, and restrictions for park and ride lots and other parking facilities). • Tow-away zones. • Prohibitions of fishing or jumping from bridges. • Weight or closure restrictions.
Conduct an engineering and traffic investigation and document the condition requiring the rescinding of the regulation. Removing the regulatory signs does not rescind the traffic regulation, but renders it unenforceable under
RCW 46.61.050(2).
WSDOT Traffic Manual

B.
Headquarters Traffic Regulations – The State Traffic Engineer, using the Calendar
Agenda Action process, rescinds the following regulations if they are no longer needed: • Bicycle prohibitions. • Truck restrictions. • HOV lane designations. • Angle parking on state highways. • Parking or sales restrictions for park and ride lots and other parking facilities.
Permanent regulatory speed limits may only be amended with a proposed speed zone revision submitted through a Calendar Agenda Action item.
Provide documentation to support rescinding the traffic regulation to the State Traffic
Engineer’s office. As with the regional traffic regulations noted above, removing signs does not rescind the traffic regulation, but renders it unenforceable under
RCW 46.61.050(2). 6-7

Specialized Highway Uses
Introduction
State highways function as multi-modal travel routes for multiple transportation purposes and serve commuters, commercial vehicles, bicyclists, pedestrians, transit, recreational and other traffic. In addition, there may be both short-term and long-term specialized uses of the roadways. Short-term special uses of the highways include parades, running or bicycle events, filming, and festivals. Long-term special uses such as designated shoulder- driving segments for slower vehicles, or school bus stops or pedestrian crossings on limited access highways, can also be authorized on specific roadway sections. Requests are also received for permanent specialized highway uses such as transit vehicle stops and placement of interpretive signing. This chapter provides guidelines to assist in responding to special highway use requests.
A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU #C010355GSC) between the Washington State
Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and Washington State Patrol (WSP) governs the operation of special events (parades, running or bicycle events, filming, and festivals) on state highways. The MOU establishes guidelines and defines responsibilities for event operations. It also includes examples of event administration documents (Figure 7-4).
Special events on the state highway system are administered through the regional Traffic
Office for events taking place in a single region, or through the State Traffic Engineer’s office for multi-region events. A Letter of Agreement or a Letter of Acknowledgement between
WSDOT and the special event permittee defines the operation. There is no fee to event permittees for special event administration and coordination.
Continuing or long-term specialized uses are also addressed in the Traffic office, and may include coordination with other WSDOT offices or agencies. The State Traffic Engineer’s office is available as a resource for questions about events or other specialized highway uses not specifically addressed in this chapter.

7-2
Bicycling, Running, Walking, Parade, Festival, and Bicycle Racing
Special Events
WSDOT receives numerous requests for short-term use of state highways or right of way for recreational or other public events. The Regional or State Traffic Engineer’s office will respond to event permittees within ten working days of receiving a request to begin the review and coordination process. Special events are generally not held on fully controlled limited access highways. Occasional exceptions may be considered where no alternate route is available and roadway conditions allow for participant and other roadway users’ safety.
In reviewing an event request, WSDOT will: • Establish on-going communication with event permittees to address route determination, traffic control, logistical issues, and other concerns. • Conduct a traffic engineering analysis to determine the impact of the proposed event, as needed.
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10
Page 7-1 Chapter 7
Specialized Highway Uses • Consult with regional Construction and Maintenance offices to identify any operational conflicts along the proposed route. • Contact WSP to coordinate the event per the WSDOT/WSP Memorandum of
Understanding, “Special Events on State Highways”. • Review special event traffic control plans. • Discuss alternative routes, if needed. • Submit separate billings to Event Permittee for services related but not limited to labor costs, equipment related costs, and indirect costs for services such as; traffic control, maintenance operations, work zone safety or other highway operations activities.
Additionally, WSDOT may: • Provide use of Changeable Message Signing and Highway Advisory Radio (HAR) systems where available and appropriate. • Suggest event specific signing to provide information for all highway users.
A.

Administration Guidelines – Use of state highways or highway right of way for bicycle, running, walking, parades, festivals, or other special events is administered through either a Letter of Agreement or Letter of Acknowledgement between WSDOT and the event permittee. Events that will not impact highway operations, where all participants will follow all Rules of the Road (Chapter 46.61 RCW) at all times, and where no traffic control is needed are not required to contact WSDOT. However, because those events may also benefit from WSDOT services, contact with the event permittee is encouraged to ensure coordination with WSDOT projects, WSP, and other special events occurring in the immediate vicinity.
Planning a Special Event on state highways, event permittee may use WSDOT website for an online or pdf application. Our application process is located online at www.wsdot.wa.gov/contact/events/special-events. Based on the specific event situation as described below; issue a Letter of Agreement or a Letter of
Acknowledgement, or if circumstances warrant, a Letter of Denial. These documents are signed by the regional or headquarters signing authority. The Letter of Agreement is signed by the event permittee and regional or headquarters signing authority. If an event is denied, WSDOT will work with the event permittee to seek solutions to the issues causing the denial. Event permittee may appeal a denial through the process outline in this chapter. 1.
Letter of Acknowledgement – A letter of Acknowledgement is issued when event participants will follow the Rules of the Road at all times and when no specific traffic control is needed and the event will not negatively impact traffic. The
Letter of Acknowledgement may (Figure 7-5) address specific event conditions such as: • Operational restrictions on specific highway sections due to conflicts with construction or maintenance operations. • The use of small crashworthy signs for guiding event participants. • Other highway conditions or restrictions.
Page 7-2
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Specialized Highway Uses
Chapter 7
Examples of when a Letter of Acknowledgement is appropriate:

2. a.
A group of 100 people will participate in a running event using portions of a state highway. The runners will conform to the Rules of the Road at all times.
No impacts to traffic. b.
A bicycle ride of 500 people uses a filtered start over several hours so bicycle riders are spread out along the roadways. Riders will cross the highway intersections in a legal manner and follow all other Rules of the Road. c.
A vehicle convoy of 10 to 15 vehicles accompanying “Santa Claus” to a local charity event uses portions of the state highway, following the Rules of the
Road at all times.
Letter of Agreement – A Letter of Agreement (Figure 7-6) is issued when
WSDOT’s review and analysis determines that the event participants are not able to follow the Rules of the Road, that there will be an impact on traffic operations, or that special traffic control is required. Additional information and terms may be attached as Exhibits to the Agreement.
A Letter of Agreement is developed when the event will: • Require special traffic control (flaggers, escort vehicles, and/or law enforcement) to support the safe passage of event participants and the traveling public. • Occur outside the roadway but within the right of way, and involve the use of highway facilities for non-transportation purpose. • Close a portion of the highway to the public. • Use services or personnel provided by WSDOT, WSP, or other law enforcement. • Placement directional signing for the traveling public on WSDOT right of way.
Examples of when a Letter of Agreement is appropriate:

WSDOT Traffic Manual a.
A running or bicycle event uses local police control at a state highway intersection to allow participants to cross the highway while on-coming traffic stops. b.
A large running event requests the use of portions of an approved limited access highway. c.
A parade closes the highway to traffic and a detour is required. d.
Temporary directional signs to a community festival are placed on the state highway right of way.
M 51-02.10
Page 7-3 Chapter 7
Specialized Highway Uses
The following guidelines are considered and addressed when developing a Letter of Agreement: a.
Event permittees should be encouraged to use county roads or city streets where possible.

b.
Where a state highway will be closed for an event, a suitable detour route must be available and the Region Traffic Engineer or their designee must review a detour traffic control plan. Road closures require a minimum threeday advance notice to the public (RCW 47.48.020). Longer notice is desirable for large impact events. c.
Events requiring a Letter of Agreement must have a commercial general liability insurance policy that names WSDOT as an “additional insured”.
Referenced in Exhibit A – Figure 7-7. Minimum policy requirements for an event are for $1 million per occurrence and with a $2 million in the aggregate. If vehicles are used as part of the event operation, a minimum $1 million per occurrence commercial automobile liability insurance coverage must be added to the policy. Proof of insurance and indemnification of
WSDOT is required prior to issuing the Letter of Agreement. d.
The event permittee or sponsors will pay for all extraordinary costs for labor and materials provided by WSDOT, WSP, or local agency law enforcement. e.
WSDOT may determine that pre-event notices of the event are needed in specific locations or situations. This is a courtesy to local communities and can reduce traffic congestion on event day. If used, the event permittee will post the notices seven to ten days before the event. f.
Requests for state highway use within an incorporated city or town should have the city or town’s concurrence. g.
At least 72 hours (preferably seven days) in advance of the event, the event permittee shall notify all local fire, ambulance, transit, law enforcement departments, and other service-oriented activities that may be impacted by the event. • There may be occasions when a pre-event meeting with all of the above is necessary. This will ensure open communication is available and the event organizer is in direct communication with law enforcement and emergency personnel. h. 3.
Page 7-4

Department regulations and state law limit bicycling events and prohibit running or walking events on fully controlled limited access highways.
Post Event Review – WSDOT staff may conduct a follow-up evaluation to assess event operation. Discussion with the event permittee, law enforcement, WSDOT
Area Maintenance and other affected groups can help identify any operational or public safety concerns and identify needed improvements. Document these issues so they can be addressed the next time the event occurs.
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Specialized Highway Uses

Chapter 7
Appeal Process – WSDOT has an appeal process for cases when a request for a special event on a state highway is denied. The letter of appeal should be submitted to the
State Traffic Engineer within 30 days of the event denial, and a minimum of 14 days before the scheduled event.
WSDOT and Event Permittee Coordination – When WSDOT receives a request from an event organizer for an event taking place in a single region, either from the online application or an email with an attached pdf, the regional Traffic office administers the special event. The State Traffic Engineer’s office will administer special events taking place across multiple regions.
WSDOT’s review identifies the proposed event’s impact on traffic operations and focuses on traffic control or operational solutions to mitigate those impacts.
Communication between WSDOT, event permittee, and WSP is essential to develop effective event operations and to schedule agreed upon services.
WSDOT staff determines if construction, maintenance or other operations will conflict with the event; or if there are atypical roadway conditions such as a construction detour or another scheduled special event. Conflicts can often be avoided through schedule or route adjustments. Include information about significant activities and conditions that may affect the event in the Letter of Acknowledgement or Letter of
Agreement. Contact the ferry system when an event includes use of state ferries.
WSDOT may provide advance public notice about events that may impact traffic operations as a courtesy to the affected communities. Advance notice can influence regular highway users to choose other routes on event day, thus reducing event impacts. Including any requirements for giving such notice in the Letter of Agreement.
Notice can include: • Placement of pre-event signs along the affected route. • Press release by the organizer and WSDOT. • Other public information efforts commensurate with the event scale.
Work with the region or headquarters public information office (PIO) to publicize large events and their associated congestion or delays.
Copies of completed Acknowledgement and Agreement letters are shared with the following: • Regions and state Traffic Engineer’s offices • WSP • Affected construction or maintenance offices are also notified.
Sharing this information helps assure statewide uniformity in WSDOT special event administration.

Bicycle Racing – Timed event bicycle races are sometimes held on state highways under purview of WAC 468-400 (Bicycle Racing) and Washington Bicycle Racing
Guidelines (www.wsdot.wa.gov/publications/manuals/fulltext/M3050/BRG.pdf).
Refer to these guidelines for Bicycle Race event operation and administration. The
WAC and racing guidelines were developed through a cooperative effort between
WSDOT, the bicycle racing community, WSP, and the Washington Traffic Safety
Commission. A letter of Agreement is developed between WSDOT and the event permittee and liability insurance indemnifying the department is required.
There are several common types of bicycle races: Time Trial, Criterium, Road Race,
Stage Races, Cyclocross, Mountain Bike (MTB), Duathlon, Triathlon, or Multi-sport
Event, and Relay/Cross Country. Each type of bicycle race has the potential to utilize a state highway, and each type has specific traffic control needs. Details are covered in the Bicycle Racing Guidelines.

7-3
Filming on State Highways
Filming of commercials or movies on state highways is administered using the Letter of
Agreement in conjunction with Exhibit A for Insurance, Figure 7-7 and Exhibit C for Filming
Event Agreement, Figure 7-9. The Letter of Agreement authorizes the filming and defines the terms and conditions applicable to the particular operation. It should be completed ten days prior to filming, if possible.
When WSDOT receives a request for filming, conduct a traffic engineering investigation that considers traffic impacts and safety. The regional Traffic office administers filming events taking place in a single region or through the State Traffic Engineer’s office for multi-region filming events.
Filming may not be scheduled on highways with high traffic volumes or during peak traffic flow periods. Generally, Interstate and other freeway mainline closures are not permitted.
Road or lane closures on other state highways may be considered.
Traffic control and enforcement shall be provided by the WSP in cooperation with local police agencies where appropriate. The filming company must pay all costs for labor, equipment, and supplies incurred by the department and the WSP within 30 days from event permittee’s receipt of billing.
The filming company must obtain a commercial general liability insurance policy that names WSDOT as an ‘additional insured’. Minimum policy requirements are $1 million per occurrence with $2 million in the aggregate coverage per filming event. Commercial automobile insurance coverage must be $1 million per occurrence if vehicles are supporting and/or to be used in the filming event. Proof of insurance and indemnification of WSDOT must be provided prior to the filming event.
WSDOT and the WSP may develop additional guidelines and operational procedures for individual filming operations on state highways. These are included in the Letter of
Agreement and Exhibit C – Filming Event Agreement.

Other Special Events
WSDOT receives requests for many types of special events on state highways or right of way. Car or tractor caravans, wagon trains, transcontinental running events, and stagecoach tours have all been conducted on state highways. Each of these is administered through a
Letter of Agreement or Letter of Acknowledgement, as determined by a traffic engineering analysis and depending on the specific event conditions. Contact the State Traffic Engineer’s office for discussion of any questions or concerns about special events. 7-5
Traffic Control for Special Events
When a special event includes a highway closure, detour, flagging operation, or other traffic control, a traffic control plan is developed and submitted by the event permittee to WSDOT.
Consideration is given to the type of highway, traffic speed, traffic volumes, geometrics at the traffic control site, and duration and type of event operation.
When event permittees need help in plan development, WSDOT may either offer that assistance or advise the organizers of reference materials contained in both the Manual of
Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) and WSDOT’s Work Zone Traffic Control Guideline
For Maintenance Operations M 54-44. WSDOT must review all event traffic control plans.
Consider traffic control or other special operations with these event circumstances or roadway conditions: • Where events with mass starts begin on state routes, or where, because of course design, large numbers of participants enter the state route together. • When the number of participants may cause delay of five or more vehicles, impacting traffic operations. • When narrow shoulders cause vehicles to move into the opposing traffic lane to pass event participants. • Where there are significant sight distance restrictions such as numerous no passing zones. • Other safety or operational considerations.
Traffic control must meet MUTCD and WSDOT standards. Traffic control operations shall be conducted by law enforcement officers or certified flaggers. They shall comply with the submitted traffic control plans reviewed by WSDOT. Typical traffic control plans are located in the MUTCD or WSDOT Work Zone Traffic Control Guidelines for Maintenance Operations
M 54-44. For example, TCP 20 may be used to address the intermittent stopping of highway traffic to allow event participants to safely enter or cross a highway or intersection.
The following guidelines are for developing a traffic control plan for intersection flagging operations:
A.

All flagging operations shall be conducted by a uniformed law enforcement officer or a flagger controlling each intersection leg.
B.
If flagging at a signalized intersection, the signal shall be shut down or placed in flash mode. Flagger directions at signalized intersections shall not be in conflict with signal displays. During hours of darkness, flagging stations shall be illuminated.
C.
For flagging operations on highways with a posted speed of 40 mph or less, three

Specialized Highway Uses advance signs on each approach are generally used. The “ROAD WORK AHEAD” sign should be replaced by an event specific message such as “RUNNING EVENT AHEAD”, “BIKES ON ROAD”, OR “BICYCLE CROSSING”. The second and third signs should be “PREPARE TO STOP” and the “FLAGGER” symbol respectively. 7-6
D.

On high-speed highways, where the posted speed is 45 mph or more, a four sign sequence is generally used. The additional sign may be either a repeated “EVENT
AHEAD” or a specific sign noting the traffic condition.
E.
Sign spacing shall conform to WSDOT requirements, based on highway type and speeds.
Special Event Signing Guidelines
Special event related signs may be allowed on the state right of way through the Letter of
Agreement or Letter of Acknowledgement. The purpose of special event signs is to help manage event related traffic or to alert roadway users of potential traffic impacts. Sign types include: • Directional signing to the event. • Route designation signing for participants. • Pre-event signing to give advance notice to roadway users. • Detour signing
Announcement of the event on a banner may be allowed in some circumstances (WAC 468-95-148) (see Section 7-8).
A.
Directional Signing for Large-Scale Events – Temporary directional signing may be installed for large-scale spectator activities such as county fairs, conventions, and major sporting events that do not qualify as destinations on permanent supplemental guide signs. This requires a written agreement between the WSDOT region and the event sponsor.
The department may design, fabricate, install, maintain, and remove temporary directional guide signs using the following criteria:

Page 7-8 1.
The region determines that the event will generate sufficient traffic to create operational challenges along a state highway. 2.
The sign is requested by the sponsoring agency with enough lead-time for design, fabrication, and installation (a minimum of three months). 3.
Signing is from the nearest state highway only. 4.
Signs are sized for the specific highway type. 5.
Signs shall be white letters on a green background and the design shall provide a clear, simple message.

Chapter 7

6.
Installation and removal shall be by WSDOT or an approved contractor and meet
MUTCD and WSDOT requirements. 7.
Any needed follow-through signing on local roadways must be installed prior to sign installation on the state highway.
Day of Event Directional Signs – Directional signs may be installed on the day(s) of the event to direct traffic from the nearest state highway to the event or event parking.
Signing will be located only at points where traffic must turn from the state highway or make another route decision. Follow-through signing on city and county roads must also be installed. No commercial advertising is allowed. 1.
Signs are allowed through a Letter of Agreement. 2.
Signs must be of lightweight crashworthy materials such as corrugated plastic.
Lightweight ‘sandwich board’ signs no larger than 4-feet by 4-feet may be allowed. 3.
Sign type, size, and location will be determined and noted in the Letter of Agreement.

4.
Signs may be in place only for the duration of the special event. 5.
Signing shall not interfere with or obstruct the view of any traffic control devices or the sight distance to or from an intersection or road access. 6.
Portable Changeable Message Sign (PCMS) and other portable signs shall be placed off the shoulder if practicable, or on the far right of the shoulder, to maintain bicycle and pedestrian traffic. Examples of sign messages: • Fair Next Two Exits • Heavy Traffic Ahead • Expect Delays
C. 7.
The regions may determine additional guidelines for day of event directional signing to address traffic safety and operational concerns. 8.
Signs installed on the right of way, which are not described in the Letter of
Agreement, may be immediately removed by WSDOT.
Route Designation Signing for Event Participants – Small signs may be used to direct event participants along the event route or to event points such as rest or food stops. 1.
Signs are allowed through the Letter of Acknowledgement or Agreement, which addresses sign size and type.

2.
Signs must be of lightweight crashworthy materials such as corrugated plastic.
Lightweight ‘sandwich board’ signs no larger than 4-feet by 4-feet may be allowed. 3.
Signs may be in place only for the duration of the special event. 4.
Messages should consist of “Name of Event” or other simple message and a directional arrow. No commercial advertising is allowed. Sign and Pavement
Markings example link.

Specialized Highway Uses

D.
Pre-event Signing – Advance notice signing is sometimes installed to advise regular highway users of an upcoming event that will affect normal traffic operations. It is a courtesy to any communities or highway users affected by a special event to alert them about potential traffic impacts and delays. • Pre-event signs, if required, are addressed in the Letter of Agreement. • Sign size, material, message, and locations are noted in the Letter of Agreement.
Sign color shall be black letters on an orange background. • Sign message is limited to name and date of event and a traffic control message such as “Use Alternate Route” or “Expect Delays” or more specific directional information as applicable. No commercial advertising is allowed. • Signs and supports must be of crashworthy materials. Types include roll-up signs on approved portable bases and signs mounted on approved posts. Allowance is made for crashworthy sign materials such as corrugated plastic. • Portable Changeable Message Signs (PCMS) sign messages such as “Special Event
Ahead”, “Expect Delays”, “Bicycles on Road” and “Flaggers Ahead”. • Post mounted signs shall be installed per MUTCD installation standards. Signs shall not be installed on existing regulatory or warning sign posts. Signs may be installed on existing guide or informational sign posts. • Pre-event signing shall be installed between seven and ten days before the event and removed within three days after the event.
Additionally, when a roadway is to be closed for an event, pre-event “Road to be Closed” signs must be posted a minimum of three days in advance (RCW 47.48.020). The sign will give the date(s) and time(s) of closure. 7-7
Special Event Pavement Markings
WSDOT allows placement of temporary directional pavement markings (commonly called “Dan henrys” in the bicycle community) to indicate the special event route. These markings give direction to event participants and are located at points where a route decision must be made.
Page 7-10
A.
All pavement markings must use non-permanent, chalk based or “fade-away” paint.
Permanent marking paint is prohibited.

B.
Markings should be placed only just before, at, and just after directional decisionmaking points.
C.
Route confirmation markings are permitted at major intersections.
D.
For bicycle events, markings are placed to the right of the edge line where riders have a good rideable shoulder. Otherwise, they are located in the ordinary line of riding.
E.
For running events, pavement markings are placed on the shoulder facing traffic.
F.
The markings should be visible to event participants but placed so they are unobtrusive to others. A guideline is to make these marks no larger than 12 × 18 inches.

G.
Markings must be placed away from traffic control pavement markings and existing construction or survey pavement markings.

Chapter 7
Banners
WSDOT receives requests from public agencies, civic organizations, the event sponsors, to install banners for a variety of informational purposes on state highway right of way.
Most installation requests are for horizontal suspension over the roadway, using span wire, and are the focus of this section. The occasional requests for vertically mounted banners, such as on luminaire poles, are processed case-by-case.
Some installations may require wind load analysis prior to approval (see Section 7-8.D).
A.

Statutory and Regulatory Overview – The term “banners” means the signs, banners, and decorations described in state law (RCW 47.36.030) and the Washington
Administrative Code (WAC 468-95-148). WAC 468-95-148 establishes approval criteria (see Section 7-8.C) that allow the department to permit banners visible to state highways. RCW 47.42.020(10) exempts banners from the Highway Advertising Control regulations, if the banners do not display commercial advertising.
On city streets that are also part of the state highway system under RCW 47.24, the cities are responsible for approving banner installations that are more than 20 feet above the roadway surface. WSDOT allows banners 20 feet above the roadway surface (WAC 468-95-148). • Thus, requests for banners on city streets that are also part of the state highway system are referred to the city for approval. • On state highways in unincorporated areas, the department has the authority to regulate banners. • WSDOT maintains authority on limited access roadways, in both incorporated and unincorporated areas. Banners may not be visible from limited access highways.
B.
Permit Administration in Unincorporated Areas – Banners permits are administered through the region Traffic Office, using a Banner Placement Permit (Figure 7-1) issued by the regional signing authority. This permit may be modified to accommodate request for vertically installed banners.
The region Maintenance Office having jurisdiction over the proposed banner location receives a copy of the completed permit, for their information when processing overheight vehicle permits.
The region Traffic Office also coordinates any required wind load review or analysis with the headquarters Bridge and Structures Office.
For a banner attached to utility company-owned poles, the sponsor must provide the region with a copy of the utility company’s permitting correspondence. This practice assures WSDOT that the utility company’s wind load and banner attachment considerations have been addressed.
Temporary poles may be installed in department right of way outside the clear zone, after the sponsor secures a department-issued General Permit. This practice assures WSDOT that the installation won’t interfere with department operations or underground utilities, and that traffic control considerations are addressed. A Banner
Placement Permit is also required.

WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10
Page 7-11 Chapter 7
Specialized Highway Uses
As a matter of practice, WSDOT does not allow horizontally suspended banners to be attached to WSDOT-owned traffic signal poles or luminaire poles. Adding banners to signal poles may interfere with or obstruct the view of traffic control devices, in conflict with RCW 47.36.030 and WAC 468-95-148. Regarding luminaire poles, it’s likely that significant debris on the roadway would result from a knock-down. Banners should not be attached to crossing structures because a disconnection could cause a banner to fall onto the roadway.
Some cities have installed permanent banner poles on city-owned property outside the clear zone.
C.
D.
Approval Criteria – WSDOT may approve banner installations in unincorporated areas that promote a community sponsored event in accordance with the following criteria: 1.
Banner messages are limited to name, date, and event sponsor. Commercial advertising is not allowed (RCW 47.42.020 and WAC 468-95-148).

2.
At least 20 feet of vertical clearance must be maintained from the roadway surface to the bottom of the banner (RCW 47.36.030 and WAC 468-95-148). 3.
Banners are not permitted to be visible from Interstate highways, or any other state highways having a posted speed limit of 50 mph or greater (WAC 468-95-148). 4.
Banners shall not interfere with or obstruct the view of any traffic control device, or impair the operation of transportation management systems or illumination (RCW 46.36.030 and WAC 468-95-148). 5.
For temporary events, banners may be installed not more than 30 days before the event and shall be removed not more than three days after the event (WAC 468-95-148). The duration of informational banners is determined case by case. 6.
WSDOT will not permit a sign, banner, or decoration to be mounted over any multi-lane (four or more lanes) highway. Vertical mounting on luminaire posts is permitted, provided such installations meet wind load requirements specified by
WSDOT (WAC 468-95-148). 7.
WSDOT does not allow banners to be illuminated in any manner. (RCW 47.36.180).
Wind Load Analysis for Banners Placed on Vertical Poles – Standard size banner installations do not require a wind load analysis. Standard banner sizes range from two to four feet vertically by 20 to 24 feet horizontally, with three feet by 20 feet about average. Banner manufacturing incorporates wind slits or wind ports to minimize wind stress.
For larger banners consult with the Headquarters Traffic office to determine if the proposed installation warrants a wind load analysis. The Bridge and Structures Office will need 120-150 days for the wind load review if an analysis is necessary and may charge the event sponsor.
As an alternative, the event sponsor may submit wind load calculations, performed and stamped by an engineer licensed in Washington State, to verify the compatibility of the installation.

Transit Vehicle Stop Zones
Region Traffic offices receive and review requests from transit agencies for approval of transit stops on state highways. The “Transit Vehicle Stop Zone Guidelines” Guidelines are currently under review and will be available shortly. The guidelines provide a standardized process for managing requests for transit stops outside incorporated areas. WSDOT has a commitment to making transit stop locations more viable and user friendly as well as safe.
The guidelines consider the operational needs of the department and transit authorities incorporating transit vehicle stops into the project design process.
When Transit Agencies request a transit vehicle stop zone outside of any incorporated city or town, the public transit agency shall be responsible for conducting a field review to evaluate accessibility to the proposed location. When the requested location is within the roadway, the transit agency shall have a policy for in-lane stops that addresses safety and operational issues. (WAC 468-46-010).
Transit agencies will complete the Transit Stop Application, and submit it to the Region
Development Services office or Region Planning, once submitted, the application will be forwarded to the regional Traffic Office, where they will conduct a field review and verify sight distance. It is required by law, once WSDOT receives the application from the public transit authority, WSDOT shall assess the sight distance for the proposed stopped (WAC 468-46-040). The investigation may include shoulder width, accessibility, roadway crossing opportunities, lighting, and possible room for shelters, see Figure 7-11. The Americans with
Disabilities Act guarantees access to public facilities (i.e., transit) for all persons; therefore, the review process must consider the needs of all transit users at each stage of transit use, including both before and after using the transit service.
Once the review has been completed, the stop location is either approved or denied. The region Development Services or Planning Division will administer the permit, Transit Stop
Permit. If a location is denied, a letter stating the reasons is issued by the region.
The Rules of the Road provide general restrictions and privileges concerning transit vehicle stops:
A.

RCW 46.61.560 provides that, outside of incorporated cities or towns, no one can stop, park, or leave a vehicle upon the roadway. An exception is granted for public transit vehicles stopped to receive or discharge passengers at a marked transit stop approved by the department or the county on their respective facilities.
It further allows public transit vehicle drivers to momentarily stop to receive or discharge passengers at unmarked stop zones under the following circumstances: • Stop in a safe and practicable position. • Activate four-way flashing lights. • Stop only where there is an unobstructed view, for an adequate distance to not create a hazard for other drivers.
The statute anticipates transit stops on the roadway within incorporated cities or towns where stops are frequent and operating speeds are typically lower. (Note that
RCW 46.04.500 excludes the shoulder from the definition of the roadway).
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10

Specialized Highway Uses
B.
RCW 46.61.570 specifies several locations where it is illegal to stand or park a vehicle, except temporarily to load or unload property or passengers, and authorizes other limitations or restrictions by city ordinance, county resolution, or department order (traffic regulation).

C.
RCW 46.61.575 authorizes WSDOT to place traffic control devices that prohibit, limit, or restrict, stopping, standing, or parking. This authority is granted for locations where
WSDOT has determined by regulation that stopping, standing, or parking will endanger highway users or interfere with the free movement of traffic.
D.
WAC 468-46-010 upon receipt of a transit stop request from a public transit authority, requesting approval of a transit vehicle stop zone outside of any incorporated city or town, the WSDOT shall assess the sight distance at the proposed location.
E.
WAC 468.46.040 WSDOT shall install, at its own expense, transit vehicle stop ahead symbol signing (W14-1011), for each approved transit vehicle stop zone where the transit vehicle is not visible for a distance of 500 feet. Signing shall be consistent with the MUTCD.
School Bus Stops on Highways
School bus stops must be located where there is a minimum of 500 feet sight distance to the bus stop, to provide adequate visibility. If feasible, locate stops off the state highway.
The state regulations noted below further govern locations. School District bus stop requirements are found in WAC 392-145-011.
A.

Limited Access Highways – WAC 468-58-030 and RCW 47.52 regulate school bus stops along limited access highways and prescribe the department’s related duties: 1.
School bus stops are not allowed along fully controlled limited access highways.
Exceptions may be authorized at interchanges where WSDOT has provided a location and along the mainline where there is a separated facility. 2.
WSDOT must approve school bus stops located along partial and modified control limited access highways in rural areas. 3.
WSDOT approval is not required along modified control limited access highways in urban areas. 4.
All approved school bus stops shall be signed in accordance with the MUTCD. 5.
The State Traffic Engineer will maintain an inventory of approved stops.
See Section 7-13 for information about pedestrians crossing limited access highways.
B.
WAC 392-145, Additional Rules for School Bus Drivers – The Superintendent of
Public Instruction Office (OSPI) adopted WAC rules that regulate school bus stopping.
Consider these rules when reviewing school bus stops on limited access highways: 1.

Page 7-14
Buses are not allowed to stop on a curve or a hill where visibility is less than
500 feet. Any existing bus stop locations that have less than the minimum 500 foot visibility must be moved to a compliant site to provide safety to the bus riders and roadway users. If no other stop location is possible, it shall be signed with a “SCHOOL BUS STOP AHEAD” sign (S3-1).
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Specialized Highway Uses 7-11
Chapter 7 2.
No school bus may pull over to the left-hand side of the road to load or unload children. 3.
School children are not allowed to cross any roadway having three or more marked traffic lanes, or any highway divided into separate roadways, as described in RCW 46.61.150.
C.
Coordination with School Districts and Approval Process – WSDOT works cooperatively with the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) to implement a school bus stop approval and inventory process based on the WAC rules.
The region works with the individual school districts to assure that school bus stops on limited access facilities meet those requirements. Figure 7-2 provides a sample
Proposed School Bus Stop Worksheet that the regions and the school districts may use cooperatively to assess and approve potential bus stops on partial or modified access controlled routes. The worksheet also provides the basic information the State
Traffic Engineer’s office needs to maintain the required bus stop inventory. Figure 7-3 illustrates the school bus stop approval and inventory process.

D.
School Bus Stop Inventory – WAC 468-58-030 instructs WSDOT to maintain a list of school bus stops on limited access highways. The regions shall maintain the list of limited access school bus stop inventory. The information is provided to the State
Traffic Engineer. This inventory may be collected at the beginning of each school year, relocations of stops and when new stops are established.
Interpretive Signs/Markers
Agreement GM 869 (Figure 7-12) between WSDOT and the Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission provides the procedures and guidelines for developing and maintaining interpretive signs and markers placed along the state highway. These markers depict the state’s natural and manmade history and are often located at designated pullouts of rest areas. The agreement documents the department’s responsibilities in locating and providing access to these markers. Use this process when new roadways, viewpoints or rest areas are being constructed or where a construction project includes an interpretive marker location. Contact the regional Accounting Services Office for agreement information. 7-12 “Memorial” Highways and Bridges
Per RCW 47.01.420, the Transportation Commission may, by resolution, name a highway or bridge to commemorate a person or group that has contributed significantly to Washington’s nation’s well-being. (Facility Naming Policy). Typically, the Commission receives a Joint
Memorial from the Washington State Legislature.
The Regional Administrator may also nominate a person or group to be honored through the naming process. Supporting information is supplied to the Office of the Secretary who reviews the request and forwards it to the Transportation Commission. The support information may include one of the following: • Letters of support from state and federal legislators representing area of the facility; • Resolutions passed by local, publicly elected bodies in the area of the facility; • Supportive action by or letters from local organizations such as local chambers of commerce or service clubs.
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10

Page 7-15 Chapter 7
Specialized Highway Uses
Another type of memorial designation is the “Blue Star” Memorial Highway. It was first initiated after World War II to memorialize veterans, and now honors all members of the armed services. “Blue Star” Memorial Highways are a project of the National Garden Clubs and request often originate from a local club. The Regional Administrator must present requests for designation to the Transportation Commission. Markers are not installed until the designation is received.
Marker plaques are 41 × 45 inches. The sign mounting and base size, style, and location are determined on an individual basis and approved by the region.
Plaques or signs memorializing highways or bridges are typically installed in rest areas, scenic overlooks, recreational areas, or other appropriate locations with a parking area, and where the installations are not visible to mainline traffic. Where there is no appropriate site off the main roadway, the MUTCD provides that one memorial sign per direction may be installed along the mainline, provided it does not affect safety or efficiency of traffic flow.
The Governor or the legislature approves request to dedicate a facility to a cause, rather than a person. 7-13
Pedestrian Crossing Limited Access Highways
WAC 468-58-030 contains provisions concerning the approval of pedestrian crossings of limited access highways. These provisions:
A.
Prohibit at-grade pedestrian crossings of fully controlled limited access highways.

B.
Permit crossing of multi-lane partially controlled or modified control limited access highways only where grade crossings are provided.
C.
Permit crossing of two lane, partially or modified control limited access highways at mailbox locations.
D.
Permit crossing of two lane, partially or modified control limited access highways at points designated for school children to cross as follows: • On two lane highways, at the school bus, when the bus is stopped in the traveled lane to load or unload students and its sign and signal lights are displayed as required by RCW 46.61.370. • On two lane highways, at least 100 feet from a school bus loading zone which is adjacent to the traveled lane and was established by school district, who determined that stopping in the traveled lane is hazardous.

Shoulder Driving for Slow Vehicles
Regional Administrators may designate sections of a two lane state highway to be a “shoulder-driving area” to allow slow-moving vehicles to drive onto improved shoulders so faster vehicles can pass (RCW 46.61.428).
For specific highway characteristics of shoulder driving, refer to Design Manual 7-15
A.
When designing a shoulder for shoulder driving, locate where stopping and decision sight distance is desirable and outside of sharp horizontal curves. A minimum length of
600 feet of paved shoulder must be available.
B.
The structural strength of the paved shoulder must be adequate to support traffic.
Contact the region Materials Lab for an evaluation of the structural capacity of the shoulders.
C.

When barriers or other roadside objects are present, the minimum width shall be
12 feet. The shoulder width depends on the vehicles that will be using the shoulder.
Where trucks will be the primary vehicle using the shoulder, use a 12-foot width; when passenger cars are the primary vehicle, a 10-foot width may be used.
D.
When the route has been identified as a local, state, or regional significant bike route, shoulder driving for slow vehicles is undesirable.
E.
Signing for shoulder driving is required. Install guideposts when shoulder driving is to be permitted at night. Signing requirements for designated shoulder driving zones are shown in the Chapter 2.

Highway Advertising Control
General
The department is directed by state law to regulate advertising signs that are visible to
Interstate, Primary, and Scenic state highway systems. The Headquarters Traffic Operations
Office is responsible for administering the program and often works with Region Traffic and
Maintenance staff in reporting and verification of advertising signs. Advertising messages may be displayed by one of several methods: • Billboards and other highway advertising signs may display business logos and advertising print along selected areas of state highways, outside state-owned right of ways. See Highway Advertising Control M 22-95. • Advertising venues exist at a number of rest areas along Interstate highways, and at several Ferry Division locations. • Motorist Information Signs display logos for specific types of motorist services on regulated signs within the right of way. See the program website for more information.

Federal and state laws regulate signs located on private property or on public right of ways other than state highway right of ways, which are visible to certain state highways. Many of the laws and regulations are written to express what may be done rather than what may not be done. Thus, signs installed contrary to what the law allows are illegal. The department uniformly applies the regulatory provisions to support traffic engineering principles, for procedural efficiency, and to treat the business community equitably.
A.
United States Code, Title 23, Section 131 – Federal laws provide direction to the states through the Federal Highway Administration and the Code of Federal
Regulations regarding highway advertising along Interstate and National Highway
System (NHS) non-Interstate highways, and at safety rest areas. The states are required to comply with these federal laws and regulations or become subject to a
10 percent reduction in federal aid highway funds.
B.
RCW 47.42 – State law, which may be referred to as either the Highway Advertising
Control Act, or the Scenic Vistas Act of 1971 or the Act, authorizes and directs the department to regulate highway advertising signs visible to Interstate, non-Interstate
NHS, and Scenic highways in accordance with federal and state regulations.
The purpose of the Act is to enhance roadside scenic beauty while assuring that information of specific interest to travelers is presented safely, reasonably, and effectively. RCW 47.42 does not regulate advertising sign installations adjacent to other state highways, county roads, or city streets.

C.
WAC 468-66 and M 22-95 – The department’s manual, Highway Advertising Control
M 22-95, contains the RCW and WAC rules, regulations, and figures that can be used to help interpret specific laws and regulations, maps to identify the various classes of the state highway system, and graphic appendices that illustrate some of the more complex regulatory language.

D.
Classification of Signs and Specific Provisions – WAC 468-66-050 describes the eight advertising sign classifications authorized by the Highway Advertising Control Act, and places specific restrictions on each sign type. The information in this section helps traffic operations staff address matters pertaining to these eight sign types.
Type 1 – Directional or other official signs or notices divided into three categories:
Type 1a – Directional Signs – Publicly or privately owned places may contain directional information about publicly or privately owned places that feature: • natural phenomena • historical, cultural, scientific, educational, or religious sites • areas of scenic beauty • outdoor recreation areas
Type 1b – Official Signs – Official signs shall be erected and maintained by public officers or public agencies, such as a county, city, or county commissioners, for the purpose of carrying out an official duty or responsibility. Official signs shall be located within the governing jurisdiction of the public officer or public agency.
Type 1c – Service Activity Signs – These signs contain only a group name, the location and meeting schedule. These organizations must be nonprofit, such as service clubs or religious organizations. The WAC duplicates a federal regulation that limits the maximum size of Type 1c signs to eight square feet.
Type 2 – For Sale or For Lease Signs – “FOR SALE” or “FOR LEASE” signs shall only advertise the sale or lease of the parcel or real property upon which the sign is located. The property owner or owner’s agent name and phone number shall not be displayed more conspicuously than the message “FOR SALE” or “FOR LEASE.”
WAC 468-66-050(2) allows only the name of the property owner or owner’s agent, and their respective phone number as well as the for sale or lease message.
Type 3 – On-Premise Signs – These signs are divided into four categories and also regulate electronic signs visible to the state highway system:
Type 3a – This on-premise sign advertises the activity conducted, or products available, on the property where the sign is located.
Type 3b – This is a business complex on-premise sign that displays the name of a shopping center, mall, or business combination.
Type 3c – This future site on-premise sign is allowed on properties where a planned business will be operating within a year. Signs will typically display the message “future site of” or similar wording.
Type 3d – This temporary political campaign sign expresses a property owner’s endorsement of a political candidate or ballot issue.
Electronic Signs – Electronic signs may be used only to advertise activities conducted, or goods and services available, on the property on which the signs are located (Type 3 signs); or, to present public service information as defined in WAC 468-66-010(20).

Page 8-2
WSDOT Traffic Manual
M 51-02.10 Highway Advertising Control
Chapter 8
Type 4 Off-Premise signs – The business or activity advertised on a Type 4 sign shall be within 12 air miles of the sign.
Type 5 Off–premise signs – The off-premise advertising message displayed on the sign must be of specific interest to the traveling public, as described in WAC 46866-050(5)(b). There is no geographic proximity limitation, such as the 12 air mile limit imposed on Type 4 signs.
Type 6 “Landmark” Signs – These are advertising signs of historic or artistic significance that were lawfully in place prior to October 22, 1965. Currently, there are no permitted Type 6 signs visible to state highways.
Type 7 Public Service Signs Located On School Bus Shelters – Currently, there are no permitted Type 7 signs visible to state highways.
Type 8 Temporary, Seasonal Agricultural Signs – These signs give directional information to specific agricultural activities, and are regulated through a permit process administered by the region. Specific requirements are found in
WAC 468-66-050(8).
Signs Subject to Authorizing Permits – State law and the WAC exempt Type 1, 2, and
3 signs from the permit requirements; therefore, permits are required for sign Types 4 through 8. The vast majority of permits issued are for Type 4 and Type 5 signs. Only a small number of Type 8 sign permits have been issued throughout the state. To date the department has not issued any permits for Type 6 and Type 7 signs; however, the
WAC includes these as signs that must be placed under permit.
A department issued permit does not preempt the permit holder’s responsibility to comply with local agency rules, regulations, and ordinances pertaining to signs and sign structures (RCW 47.42.070). Accordingly, a department issued permit only grants a permit holder the right to erect a sign if it is also authorized under local law.
Inventories – The Headquarters Traffic Office maintains an electronic database inventory of all Type 4, 5, and 8 sign permits. Access to the database is available to region users upon request. The inventory is revised when the Headquarters Traffic
Office receives notification from a permit holder or when changes are discovered during field review. The inventory is updated when: • New permits are issued. • Existing permits are rescinded or revoked. • Sign or property owners have changed. • Signs are modified from their original size. • The sign or property owner removes signs.

Traffic Planning, Safety, Operations, and Design
Overview 9-1.1
General
The Traffic Office can be involved in planning studies, safety analysis, project design, and operations. This chapter contains information that can be helpful when working in the above project phases.
The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) is used as a resource for projects that include traffic items. 9-1.2
Transportation Systems Management and Operations (TSMO)
While the activities that the Traffic Office can be involved with may seem to happen in isolation from other distinct efforts, the decisions made at any one stage affects project lifecycles and all elements of the multimodal transportation system from cradle to grave.
Viewing these types of efforts and how they influence WSDOT’s ability to deliver, maintain, and operate the transportation system as a whole is foundational to the definition of
TSMO as applied in Washington. TSMO covers a broad range of categories and associated strategies that encompass a better balance approach to transportation engineering, planning, and operational activities with a look toward the future and keeping both the maintainability and sustainability in mind. For more detailed information, visit TSMOWA.org.

9-1.3
Maintenance
Whether reviewing an existing facility or constructing a new project it is important to consider impacts to maintenance. Working with the maintenance division allows the traffic office to implement projects such as Low Cost Enhancements (LCEs) more readily. 9-1.4
Active Transportation
In each area of Planning, Safety, Design, and Operations multimodal and active transportation should be considered. Active Transportation has resources for the safety and mobility of pedestrian and bicycle traffic as well as safe routes to school. Also see Chapter 4. 9-2
Planning
Guidelines and criteria for corridor planning studies can be found here, the Transportation
Corridor Planning Studies Guidelines and Criteria. The Traffic Office can be involved in planning studies, especially with traffic and safety analysis. The Safety Guidance for Corridor
Planning Studies documentation provides more information for safety. Traffic analysis is addressed in Chapter 12.

Safety 9-3.1
General
The Washington State DOT requires safety analysis for all projects, the analysis is scalable depending on the scope and type of project. The Safety Analysis Guide (SAG) goes into more detail on safety analyses for each project type. 9-3.2
I2 Program
Every biennium the HQ Traffic Office develops lists for potential safety projects based on a statewide network screening, these are the Crash Analysis Location/Crash Analysis
Corridor/Intersection Analysis Location (CAL/CAC/IAL) lists. The locations on the lists require region input and sometimes analysis to determine if there are viable cost effective safety countermeasures. If the region determines that a countermeasure can be applied, more detailed analysis will be completed to develop a Crash Analysis Report (CAR), which will then be presented to the I2 Panel for endorsement.
The HQ Traffic Office is responsible for the Highway Safety Issues Group (HSIG) and I2
Panel meetings which occur quarterly to discuss safety projects and practices.
HSIG involves other divisions and all regions to communicate current efforts in safety methodology, programs, and funding. The I2 Panel involves the region traffic engineers as well as other experts to discuss and endorse safety projects based on a statewide priority, from the CAL/CAC/IAL lists.

9-3.3
Human Factors
When performing safety, or operational, analyses it is important to also keep in mind how the roadway users will interact with or perceive their environment and how human factors have influenced the safety performance. Currently there is no WSDOT specific manual or guidelines on human factors, however NCHRP and FHWA have research and documentation on the subject. Chapter 2 of the HSM (2010) and NCHRP Report 600, (Human Factors
Guidelines for Road Systems, 2nd Edition, 2015) are valuable resources that can be used to perform human factors task analysis and specific human factors considerations during design. 9-3.4
Target Zero
Washington State has committed to the Target Zero plan, in an effort to reduce fatal and serious injury crashes to zero. The Washington Traffic Safety Commission (WTSC) prepares a Target Zero report every three years detailing trends in crashes statewide at the state and local agency levels. This report helps guide where to spend resources, such as prominent crash types

Chapter 9

Design 9-4.1
General
Whether reviewing design plans or developing a Low Cost Enhancement (LCE) the Design
Manual and Standard Plans are important resources to have. When reviewing design plans it is important to evaluate not only how the facility will operate, but how maintenance will be performed as well. Consult the area and signal maintenance crews as needed.
In general projects originating from the Traffic Office will be LCEs. These projects must be documented per Traffic Office procedures. Design Bid Build (DBB) contracts must be documented per the Design Manual. 9-4.2
QBOD
The QBOD is a version of the Basis of Design specifically for Q projects. The Policy and template can be found here. 9-4.3
Signals, Illumination, and ITS
Guidance and information on electrical design and implementation can be found here. 9-5
Operations 9-5.1

The traffic office is responsible for project reviews as well as operational policies and implementation of various elements of statewide traffic control, ITS deployments, LCEs, etc. on state facilities, employing TSMO principles with a focus on safety and mobility. 9-5.2
Traffic Systems and other Statewide Electrical Systems
Traffic Electrical Systems manages standards and policies for all highway lighting, traffic signal, intelligent transportation system (ITS; includes Commercial Vehicle Program field equipment), and associated power distribution systems. This includes the entire life cycle of this equipment, from initial selection, through planning, design, construction, and maintenance, to replacement and/or removal. The HQ Traffic Office is developing a manual specific to lighting, traffic signal, and ITS regarding the design, construction, material, and maintenance standards of these systems. For training and current resources consult headquarters and the Traffic Design – Signals, Illumination and ITS website.

Traffic Planning, Safety, Operations, and Design 9-5.3
Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and Corridor Operations
ITS and Corridor Operations focuses on the coordination and utilization of technology to manage a corridor, maximizing safety and efficiency. Activities include optimizing traffic signals, operating ramp meters and active traffic management systems, integrated corridor management, and using traffic cameras, traffic data collection systems, road/ weather information systems, and variable message signs to provide up to date information to travelers. Included in this effort is the operation of six year-round traffic management centers across the state and one winter operations center at Snoqualmie Pass, supported by software, web application IT development, and maintenance staff.
Each Regions’ Traffic Management Center (TMC) has its own standard operating procedures/ guidelines and system standards and is subject to specific regional ITS architectures, systems engineering, and concept of operations documents. However, overarching agency policies exist for certain systems, activities, and functions for the sake of consistency and resiliency (in the event of statewide emergencies and continuity of operations, for instance). Some internal applications and TSMO-related tools, policies and procedures are located under Tools & Services on the intranet site.
Similarly, capabilities and systems vary among each Region regarding legacy traffic signal equipment and software. Standardization of equipment, specifications, and operational practices are underway including the increasing use of automated traffic signal performance measures (ATSPMs), multimodal detection and operations, signal preemption and priority treatment.
For training and current resources consult the HQ Traffic Office.

Field Assessment (FA)
Overview
In September of 2014 the Field Assessment program was created to replace the identification of WSDOT’s safety efforts, previously implemented as spot safety investments associated with pavement preservation and in alignment with FHWA’s stewardship agreement at the time. Field assessments are a programmatic approach to review all state highways to identify safety improvement opportunities, evaluate potential benefits and risks, and develop lower cost spot safety enhancements that can be incorporated into a paving project.
By systematically reviewing all highways using a consistent statewide approach, Region
Field Assessment engineers are able to identify potential fatal and serious crash reduction opportunities, address emerging crash trends, and recommend incremental solutions.
The Field Assessment program is comprised of two Field Assessment engineers in each region and a headquarters program manager.

M 51-02.10 Traffic Planning, Safety, Operations, and Design
B.
Chapter 9
Methodology
Annually, each region Field Assessment team reviews 270 miles of state highways. Field assessment evaluations may include: identification of striping and signing needs, rumble strips, channelization, curve mitigation, lane use, and pedestrian and bicycle operations.
Community and local law enforcement outreach are key elements of the program. As part of the analysis, the Field Assessment program conducts a traffic engineering review and crash analysis for the location or corridor being surveyed.
Several miles of these assessments are conducted in advance of paving projects (2-3 years) in an attempt to incorporate solutions into the paving projects to minimize traffic impacts. Once solutions have been identified and prioritized, Region Traffic and Program
Management work together to coordinate identified solutions to be included into P1 Pavers.
This makes for an efficient use of traffic control and contractor construction.
C.

Benefits
By analyzing highway segments for potential crash reduction, selecting appropriate countermeasures, and then prioritizing them, we are in alignment with WSDOT’s Sustainable
Highway Safety Program.
These reviews provide a consistent statewide approach in crash risk reduction for the P1
Paving program. 9-5.5
Transit/Public Transportation
Transit and public transportation can have a large impact on operations and should be a consideration for traffic reviews and projects. The Public Transportation Division has further information on sustainable transportation, park and rides, and other transit related topics.
The Public Transportation Division can help find ways to reduce transportation demand and to improve access for people. 9-5.6
Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA)
When new developments occur the traffic office may need to perform analyses for traffic and potentially safety impacts from the increased volumes. Safety impacts will need to be addressed especially if the impacted facility has been identified on the CAL/CAC/IAL lists.
The Developer Services Manual has information relating to TIAs. Specific details on TIAs can be found in the Design Manual Chapter 320.

Intersection Control Evaluation
Introduction
Intersection Control Evaluations (ICE) are data-driven, performance-based framework used to objectively screen alternatives and identify an optimal geometric and control solution for an intersection. ICE studies can include more than one intersection including corridors as needed. ICE policy is intended to be flexible, adaptable, and provide a transparent multimodal decision making process.
Intersection Control Evaluations and their purpose have evolved since “intersection control” choices have shown to be so critical to reducing crashes and increasing efficiency of our transportation system. This process also extends to multi-modal aspects being considered as our transportation system has become more focused on the people carrying capacity of a facility, not solely the vehicle capacity.
Intersection Control Type in 2018 version) is a final recorded decision by the Region Traffic
Engineer with concurrence from the State Traffic Design Engineer on those projects and their intersection control choice(s) selected. Projects that require ICE documentation are usually alterations of existing intersections or new intersections being proposed on the system within a project.
A signed and approved ICE document is the requirement. It is scalable and flexible in content to achieve a selection supported by data. It should be noted that in previous design and guidance documents, ICE has also been called ICA (Intersection Control Analysis) and
ICT (Intersection Control Type).

Traffic Engineering Records Management
Overview
This chapter describes the guidelines for managing traffic engineering records. A records management system must comply with state and Washington State Department of
Transportation (WSDOT) record-keeping rules, and provide for record storage in easily accessible locations. Both paper records and electronic records are equally subject to public record laws and the retention rules provided by these guidelines.

11-2
WSDOT’s Record Management Guidelines
A.
Originals and Copies – The office that creates the original document is responsible for the maintenance, retention, and destruction of the document, except: • When an original document is sent to another office/division/region within
WSDOT, the office receiving that original assumes the responsibility for the maintenance, retention, and destruction of the document. • When an original document is sent outside WSDOT, the copy made for the WSDOT sender’s file becomes the original and must be maintained accordingly. • When the content of a copy is changed, the resultant copy becomes a new original and must be maintained accordingly. However, a copy that has not been changed is not subject to a retention schedule.
B.
Two Types of Retention Schedules 1.
The Washington Secretary of State’s general records retention schedule covers records that represent the operations of all state agencies. 2.
The WSDOT unique retention schedule covers records created specifically for WSDOT. This schedule is managed by the department’s Records and
Information Services Office.
Public records may not be destroyed until they have been retained for the minimum time period identified in the retention schedule (see Section 11-4).

C.
Paper Record Destruction – Shred paper records having confidential and/or sensitive information. The Records Destruction Log (WSDOT Form 720-025) must be completed and signed by the Records and Information Services Office prior to destruction.
Paper records not having confidential and/or sensitive information may be recycled.

Inventory Record of Site-Specific Traffic Control Device Installations
Some areas have site-specific traffic control device installations to address traffic operational issues. These installations typically exceed the MUTCD, Design Manual, or
Standard Plans minimums, and are intended to be maintained, as installed, until construction projects or other factors eliminate the need for the treatments.
The regional Traffic Offices should maintain an inventory record of these locations to assure that future maintenance activities retain the pattern of the treatments applied. To help assure the desired maintenance level, store the inventory in a server accessible by both regional traffic and maintenance staff and alert maintenance staff when the site- specific treatments are installed.

Multimodal Traffic Impact Analysis
Guidelines
Introduction
This chapter is intended to address state of the art issues associated with WSDOT multimodal traffic analysis. It is not intended to address the specifics of demand fore casting; mesoscopic, analytical/deterministic, stochastic microsimulation; or safety performance analyses. For those items, see the latest versions of the Highway Capacity
Manual, WSDOT: Vissim Protocol, Synchro and SimTraffic Protocol, Sidra Brochure, Traffic
Analysis Guidebook, and Highway Safety Manual (HSM).
Traffic analysis results are developed to produce information for decision makers; they are not intended as a stand-alone tool for making decisions. Consideration of empirical data, similar traffic situations, studies, local knowledge, and seasoned traffic engineering and planning experience can also add to a pool of traffic information that is provided to decision makers. • Follow this link to access the Traffic Manual MTIAG
