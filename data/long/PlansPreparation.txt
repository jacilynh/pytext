Introduction

Right of Way Plans are the official state documents used as the basis to acquire real estate and other property rights. All deeds or other instruments conveying land or interest in land to the state that are to be accepted at the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT)
Headquarters (HQ) must conform to the approved Right of Way Plan. The plans are referred to in legal instruments and are permanently filed for public record at the WSDOT Headquarters in
Olympia.
It is the responsibility of the region to assemble data and prepare plans for the acquisition of rights of way (R/W), including easements, and any substantiating documentation necessary for completion of the plans. Verification of ownership of existing R/W is also required.
To assemble the data, the region requests Assessor’s maps, county road maps, previous state highway base maps and last conveyances for use during early plan preparation. As soon as the parcels from which additional right of way will be acquired are identified, Title Reports with
Assessor’s land areas are requested for use in completing the Right of Way Plans.
Early plan preparation includes the following: • The Region Real Estate Services Manager is consulted to determine the degree of property interests to be acquired, such as fee title, easements, and temporary construction easements. • The Region Right of Way Manager is consulted to determine whether existing plans are adequate for revisions or a new Right of Way Plan should be prepared. • The Region Utilities Engineer is consulted to determine the extent of utility interests to be addressed.
Complete Right of Way Plans consist of a Vicinity Map and Right of Way Plan sheets. Right of
Way Plans are to be prepared in English units only. 100.02
Vicinity Map and Total Parcel Details

The Vicinity Map supplies general information depicting the project in relation to surrounding communities, public and private road networks, traffic movement patterns, and other local
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 1-1 Right of Way Plans
Division 1 features. A total parcel detail and parcel number are included for any ownership too large to be shown on individual plan sheets (see Example 1-1).
A heavy line is used to indicate the new highway. Lighter lines in varying weights show interchanges, connecting road systems, bodies of water, and so on. Limited access, the existing right of way, and/or the proposed right of way are not shown. Detail and drafting requirements are set forth in the WSDOT Electronic Engineering Data Standards (EEDS) Manual (see
Deliverables Sections 4, 7, 8, and Symbology 4). 100.03
Plan Sheets
New base maps shall be prepared in their correct geographically coordinate location. It is recommended the design team use information from the Record of Survey or other reliable source to locate the base map in its Geographic Location. This will allow measurements within the sheet to be correct and for future use within WSDOT’s GIS program.
The sheets are to be single sheet per file. This allows the sheets to be signed and edited without affecting other sheets. It also allows multiple users to work within the project at the same time.
All submittals shall be placed in the appropriate ProjectWise folder structure per the WSDOT
EEDS Deliverables 8.08(2). A link to the proposed revision shall be placed on the Cover Sheet for each submittal.

100.03(1)
Alignment
Right of way is legally described from the R/W centerline. Show existing and proposed R/W centerlines as a continuous solid line the entire length of the project with existing and proposed alignment data. Show additional non-controlling centerlines using a dashed line without alignment data.
It is preferable that the main line R/W centerline not have a letter designation (such as LR Line) unless there is more than one main line centerline. Therefore, the Highway Engineer’s Station (HES) will no longer have a letter designation.
A proposed centerline stationing must have ties, by station and/or bearing equations, to existing
R/W centerline stationing at the beginning and end of the new plan.
It is recommended that all proposed plans should replace existing spiral curves on the proposed
R/W centerline with a simple circular curve in conformance with current design standards.
When proposed R/W is to be acquired, the proposed R/W alignment will conform to the new simple curve. If additional R/W is not to be acquired, the existing R/W alignment will retain the original spiral curve. The proposed plan will reference the superseded spiral alignment (see
Examples 1-9a and 1-9b). Prior to plan preparation, consultation with the HQ Right of Way Plans
Section is advised.

Control Features
Plan sheets must show government subdivision corners, platted subdivisions, donation land claims, state and national park/forest boundaries, and Indian reservations. Show stations where government subdivision lines intersect our highway centerline. Add a cross-reference note to the Monumentation Map or Record of Survey prepared for the project. 100.03(3)
Right of Way Details (a) Right of way lines are continuous. These lines are shown crossing city streets, county roads, rivers, and railroads, and they must match adjoining projects. Where a first-time improvement is planned, the existing county road or city street rights of way are enclosed by a right of way line or turnback line and are identified for later conveyance to the appropriate agency.
Data must be supplied to describe the right of way for its entire length from a centerline or, if necessary, from a metes and bounds description. Any existing right of way line retained as an ultimate right of way line for the new project is tied to and described from the proposed centerline or by a metes and bounds description. Ties to a previous centerline are not acceptable (see Example 1-2). When the existing right of way line is to be retained as an ultimate right of way line and is offset from an existing spiral alignment, consideration should be given to buying, selling, or exchanging small pieces of land with the adjacent owner to eliminate this offset spiral right of way line.
Right of way widths and centerline stations are shown at the beginning and end of each sheet, except if in a taper, and at all points of change in width of the right of way. No point shall be double-described (that is, by a metes and bounds description and a station and offset) or by stations and offsets from two centerlines. All dimensions and areas must be shown on the final Right of Way Plan. (b) A turnback line is shown as that line between right of way needed for highway purposes and right of way that will be relinquished to others (see Example 1-2). Areas for relinquishment are areas the state acquires for the improvement or construction of roads that will not remain a part of the highway system. The plan must show the areas being relinquished in sufficient detail and accuracy to allow a legal description to be written for the conveyance instrument (for example, stations and offsets or metes and bounds). (c) An easement is a permanent or long-term right to enter upon the property of another for a defined purpose. Easements involve perpetual or temporary rights, which are noncancelable by the property owner during the term of the easement. For example, an easement is used when the state is to construct a facility that does not require ownership of fee title (such as slope or drainage), and the acquisition of an easement right will save the department substantial funds in acquisition costs.

Page 1-3

Right of Way Plans
Division 1
The type of easement is defined on the Right of Way Plan (such as drainage easement, slope easement, or temporary construction easement) and is described by stations and offsets or by metes and bounds. Each type of easement and the area for each specific type is included in the ownership block under the Easement column opposite the appropriate parcel number (see Example 1-2).
Third-party easements, such as utility or ingress/egress easements, that cross a parcel for the benefit of others will be shown on the plan.
State highways crossing state and federal lands, are generally acquired as an easement.
To define the highway margins and to have a consistent right of way line, these areas are shown as if fee title is acquired. Other areas where this may be encountered may include railroad, large land owners and utility rights of way crossings. (d) A permit is a temporary right to enter upon the property of another for a defined purpose. These rights are issued for a limited time period—usually expiring upon completion of construction. Permits do not encumber the owner’s property, are nontransferable, and are cancelable by the grantor. Construction permits are not shown on the Right of Way Plans. (e) An airspace corridor is a three-dimensional corridor of a specific width and length between two elevations. Airspace corridors are acquired in fee, and all rights of ownership apply to them. An airspace corridor is usually used where the highway is on a structure or in a tunnel. The property lying under or above the corridor may be used for other purposes as long as there is no detrimental effect on the highway facility. When the highway is on a structure, the only property acquired in fee would be the area needed to support the footings of the structure. (f) Many Right of Way Plans contain an extreme amount of detail and will assign a point number to a specific location. A line table is used to identify the station, offset, and sometimes the elevation of each point. A separate table should be used for each feature such as R/W acquisition, easements, and air space corridors with a unique number assigned to each point.
Plans utilizing multiple tables should place all tables on a separate plan sheet. This will allow for future table revisions without interfering with plan sheet line work. Each table should include a description of the specific feature and each feature should be shown in a separate table (see Examples 1-16a –1-16e). (g) Surplus property is property that was acquired as operating right of way but is no longer needed as such. A plan revision mapping the surplus property area is necessary prior to disposal.
Property that was acquired for uses other than operating highway right of way and is no longer needed is also labeled as surplus property on the Right of Way Plan prior to
Page 1-4
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Division 1
Right of Way Plans disposal. Some examples of surplus property would be unneeded pit sites, quarry sites and maintenance sites.
Right of Way Plans are not revised to show surplus properties until both the region and
Headquarters have completed their Surplus Property Review. If federal funds were used for the acquisition of right of way or construction of the facility, Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) approval is required before a plan revision can be approved.
Disposal of uneconomic remainders does not need a plan revision. (h) Property required for rest areas, historical markers, park & ride lots, truck weighing stations, wetlands mitigation areas, storm water treatment areas, landscape areas, and plan sheets. If these facilities are situated beyond the reasonable limits of the plan, the sites are shown on a Sundry Site Plan (see Section 100.05). Material and stockpile sites are not shown on Right of Way Plans unless they are adjacent to the right of way and are fully describable thereon. Otherwise, they are shown on the Right of Way Plan with a note cross referencing the Sundry Site Plan where they are described. (i) An Inventory Control Number (ICN) may be added to the plan to identify long-term leases or easements (typically 20 years or longer) and surplus property. Refer to the
Surplus Property Review package to determine whether a plan revision is necessary. If an ICN will be added to the plan, the plan revision will normally identify the parcel or easement limits, the IC number, and the area.
Most ICN plan revisions will be prepared by the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. HQ
Right of Way Plans Section will coordinate the plan revision with the HQ and region
Property Management sections.

100.03(4)
Access Control
Limited access hachures define control of access between a highway facility and all other abutting property (see Example 1-3). On the title block of the plan sheet, the HQ Access and
Hearings Office specifies the type of control: full, partial, or modified. If a transition is made from one type to another, the title block on the affected plan sheet includes both types and the plan sheet is labeled at the transition station. Specific considerations are: • If the route has been designated for limited access control by the Secretary of
Transportation, access control must conform to the Design Manual Chapter 530) unless advance approval for a design analysis is obtained. • On federal-aid routes, changes in access features from those that have been approved by
FHWA require concurrence from FHWA prior to WSDOT approval under Certification
Acceptance procedures authorized by FHWA. • Limited access hachures are not shown when crossing railroad operating property, grade intersections, crossroads, or interchanges (see Example 1-3).
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 1-5 Right of Way Plans
Division 1

• At separation structures where there is no access to the highway lanes, the hachures are continuous, and traffic movement is permitted over or under the structures by note (see
Section 100.12). • In areas of partial or modified access control, approaches are allowed, but the hachures are never omitted. Each approach is defined in the access approach schedule (see Example 1-6). • Existing Limited Access Plans must be reviewed (deeds examined) for previously deeded access approaches. • The limits of access control hachures are shown on all crossroads, frontage roads, and so on.
Non-highway use of right of way (such as parking, storage, or buildings) requires an airspace lease (see the Right of Way Manual). When requested by HQ Real Estate Services, the plan sheets will clearly delineate the limits and character of the multiple-use area.
On new plans, the access control hachures may, in very limited instances, be moved to a precisely dimensioned invisible line, with the area labeled for the specific use and a turnback line and relinquishment notes provided if necessary. This is known as “Floating Hachures.”
On existing plans where access rights have been acquired, or on new plans where circumstances dictate retention of departmental control of the multiple-use area, the access hachures are carried on the right of way line and the other usage is shown by an access note.
Access notes concerning routine maintenance of utilities within the highway right of way are added to the plan following approval of the pertinent franchise or permit.
Modifying existing approved Limited Access hachures on an approved plan will require either
FHWA approval or approval from the HQ Access & Hearings Manager. Contact the HQ Access and Hearings Office to determine the appropriate process. 100.03(5)
Access Approach Schedule
The access approach schedule and the access control notes supply all the information necessary for the granting of private approaches, and should reflect the language intended.
The access approach schedule furnishes, in tabular form: 1. The name of the owner, utility, or agency. 2. The station or station limits left or right of centerline. 3. The type of approach, and any access notes added.
Duplication of 1 above can be avoided by adding columns 2 and 3 to the ownership block, thereby showing all data pertinent to one ownership on one line (see Example 1-6).
Approaches that are granted shall be shown in the access approach schedule only on the sheet on which the approach appears.

Right of Way Plans
Parcel number is on the sheet where the parcel first appears. 100.03(6)
Railroad Easement Details
A longitudinal easement is acquired from a railroad company when adjacent highway requirements overlap railroad property. The easement line is labeled and drawn the same weight as the right of way line. At beginning and end of the easement, show the highway station with equivalent railroad station. Offset distances to the easement line are taken perpendicular to each centerline. Under certain conditions, it may be necessary to describe the easement using railroad stationing by a metes and bounds description.
The crossing by a highway over, under, or at the grade of railroad property is by a crossing easement. The highway station with an equivalent railroad station is shown at each corner of the crossing easement and at the intersection of the railroad centerline and the R/W centerline.
Access hachures are not to be carried across the railroad tracks, but are usually shown along the highway-railroad right of way or easement lines. The easement is labeled as a crossing easement. Separate areas for each type of easement are shown in the ownership block (see
Example 1-2). 100.03(7)
Drawing Standards

Right of Way Plans are to be prepared in CAD with US survey foot units only, in conformance with the WSDOT Electronic Engineering Data Standards (EEDS) Manual (M 3028). Right of Way
Plan revision requests will be submitted to WSDOT HQ Right of Way Plans Office to be reviewed, verified and commented prior to approval. Any corrections to be made will be noted and sent back to the Requestor starting as Correction Notice No. 1. Right of Way Plan revisions will be stored in ProjectWise. CAD levels, colors, line weights, symbols, base and sheet deliverables are to conform to the standards shown in the EEDS Manual. Right of Way Plans are prepared using ground dimensions.
The right of way Vicinity Map and plan sheets should include the following information, as applicable: • Plans are to be oriented with the Highway Engineers’ stations, increasing from left to right on the main line and ramps. It is desirable for mileposts to run in the same direction as stationing. Beginning stations on ramps should start at 10+00. When existing surveys conflict with this procedure, the R/W line should be re-stationed as stated above if new plans are drawn. • All centerlines that are used to describe right of way should have bearings and stationing.
Note: Do not use station or bearing equations within a proposed Right of Way Plan alignment. However, station and/or bearing equations can be used at the beginning and/or end of a new Right of Way Plan. Centerline mileposts are treated in the same manner. Mile
Post equations are shown only at the beginning and end of new alignment plans. • Mileposts at the beginning and end of the plan. The total length of the plan is shown only on the first sheet of the Vicinity Map.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 1-7 Right of Way Plans
Division 1 • Centerline stationing and destination arrows are shown at the beginning and end of each sheet. The destination arrow shall refer to the nearest town, city, highway junction, or other major feature. Do not start or end a new plan set at the centerline of intersecting roads. • On plan sheets use 5 Station numbers, such as 10+00 and 15+00. On the Vicinity Map, use
10 Station numbers, such as 10+00 and 20+00. Place the numbers parallel to and above the centerline. • Beginning and end of plan cross-references to current contiguous plans are placed close to the beginning or end of plan note. • New plans superseding an existing plan, each plan sheet will have a note stating the stationing, sheet number, name, and approval date of the plan being superseded by the new plan (see Example 1-2). • Names of all interchanges, highways, city streets, county roads, railroads, and bodies of water. • Highway structures shown in their correct location, drawn to scale, and identified as overcrossing or undercrossing in relation to the main line traffic movement. (Is the highway crossing over a structure or running under a structure?) • Traffic movement pattern indicated by arrows on centerline, with the appropriate numeral added for multiple lanes. • Townships, Ranges, government subdivisions, and platted subdivisions right reading with map and a north arrow for orientation purposes. • Section and quarter-section numbers right-reading with north. Quarter-Quarter labeling is aligned with the bottom of the sheet. • Corporate limit and county boundaries indicated with the name of the city placed on the city side of the corporate limit line (see Example 1-1). • Parcel identification numbers and total ownership boundaries (see Section 100.04) of parcels too large to be shown on a plan sheet are shown on the vicinity map. An
Ownership block is not placed on the Vicinity Map. In the ownership block, show the name of the vested owner and the name of any contract purchaser in parentheses behind the vested owner. • Parcel identification number should be placed as nearly as practical in numerical order above the highway first and then below the highway (assuming the highway is running in an east – west direction). This allows users to find a parcel number on the sheet quickly. • When using the centerline as a match line, always use the smaller number above the larger number (see Example 1-1).

Page 1-8 Division 1
Right of Way Plans • Ownership or property dots are shown around the total parcel or contiguous parcels having the same owner. This helps identify potential assessment, access and condemnation issues.
These dots may be revised, as needed, when that particular parcel is affected by a revision. • Major utility transmission rights of way and tower numbers (if applicable). Other utility distribution lines should not be shown unless replacement right of way is being purchased. • Turnback lines labeled and areas identified for conveyance (relinquishment, certification, or transfer) to the appropriate agencies are identified. • Mitigation Areas (i.e. Stormwater Treatment, Wetlands Mitigation or other mitigation facilities) are not part of the operating right of way and considered non-highway use areas.
The right of way line will encompass these areas to include them within the operating R/W if they are within the city limits and may or may not be included if they are within county limits. • Scale: Vicinity Map, 1 inch to 500 feet; Plan Sheets, 1 inch to 50 feet, unless special approval for a deviation is obtained from the HQ Right of Way Plans Manager. • All public land identified by the agency name (for example, Snoqualmie National Forest) and a parcel number—except that WSDOT land is identified as WSDOT only. • Grade intersection stations for all county roads. City street intersections are not labeled.
Label includes centerline station equation and whether the intersection is left, right or both. A county road label designation is also included if improvement activities are being administered. (See Example 1-3) • Basis of Bearings note should be included on all new Right of Way Plan sheets. Information included in the Basis of Bearings description shall include the monuments defining each end of the base line bearing (for example, the north line of the northwest quarter of
Section 1). The coordinate value of each end of the line may also be provided but must include the reference system Datum (i.e. -83/2011 adj, and north or south zone). The monuments used to control the Basis of Bearings line shall be shown on the plan, either on the specific plan sheet or the Vicinity Map. • A cross-reference note to the corresponding Monumentation Map or Record of Survey is included on all new Right of Way Plans. • On complex Right of Way Plans, a sheet layout diagram should be shown on the Vicinity
Map (see Example 1-1). • The Limit of Plan identifies the termination of a controlling center line of an intersecting state highway (see Examples 1-1 and 1-9A). Limit of Plan stations are limited to intersecting state highways. Limit of Plan stations are not used on county or city roads being improved by WSDOT.
Owner Verification Note is added to all plan sheets, except vicinity map.
When appropriate, add Access Approach Schedule and access notes.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Division 1
It is not necessary for the project limits of a new Right of Way Plan to match the project limits of the corresponding PS&E plan. A new Right of Way Plan should be extended whenever possible so that an entire Right of Way Plan sheet can be superseded. Do not leave short segments of an existing Right of Way Plan while superseding the remainder. It is advisable to contact the HQ
Right of Way Plans Section prior to developing a new plan to determine the final extent of the new Right of Way Plan.
Notes, dimensions, subdivision information, and similar data are added after the right of way limits for each sheet are established, to avoid relocation of this data at later stages of plan development. Drawings are not to be extended beyond the border of the sheet.
Existing monuments that are used to tie the R/W centerline shall be identified on the
Monumentation Map or Record of Survey.
It is recommended that the R/W line not be coincident to a private property line. If the R/W Line or easement line does follow a private property line, it should be stationed to the nearest foot plus or minus (see Example 1-3). It is possible to have a situation where the station is held more exact and the offset is given the plus or minus dimension.
Topographic information should be kept to a minimum, but should be sufficiently complete to indicate the affects of the proposed right of way on new parcels. No symbols for vegetation are used except for the outline of orchards or similar features directly related to the production of income from a particular property. All improvements, including wells, septic tanks, and drain fields on new parcels 100 feet or less from the proposed right of way line, are labeled and dimensioned to the nearest foot from R/W centerline if known. Distances to buildings should be dimensioned to the nearest part of the building (normally the roof overhang). Distances shall be placed outside the R/W; distances to fences, sidewalks, and so on are not shown. Match Lines are shown at a specific station perpendicular to the centerline.
Location information for aquatic features such as rivers or river banks, lakes, and other water boundaries should be shown to the nearest foot only.
There shall be no overlap of right of way between plan sheets or adjoining plans.
When coincident lines are encountered, the following order of procedure is used: 1. Right of Way Centerline (Baseline) and Right of Way line 2. Construction Centerline 3. Turnback, easement or Surplus line 4. Township or Range line 5. Section Line 6. Corporate Limit Line

Additional Important Details
Review these reminders and commonly overlooked details to help expedite your R/W processing. (a) Follow conventions provided in the WSDOT Electronic Engineering Data Standards (EEDS). All computerized drafting will meet WSDOT standards per this manual. (b) Split Plans: Submit the R/W plan revision with the corresponding revision to the access plan. If the plan showing access title is different, then the redline needs to be submitted under a separate transmittal letter. (c) If a revision affects the vicinity map (and/or total parcel detail), then it also needs to be revised. (d) Show the Total parcel detail. (e) Submit complete Title reports. (f) Show subdivision plat name on R/W plan if it is referred to in the title report. Submit copy of plat. (g) Upgrade the topography, such as buildings, parking areas, driveways. (h) Provide complete R/W description by station and offset or by metes and bounds. (i) Do not double describe the R/W. (j) Label grade intersections for county roads. (k) Show turnback lines and relinquishment information. (l) DNR Property: Supply all the required information to develop the land plat. (m) Do not describe R/W from the construction centerline and do not show the construction centerline on the R/W plans, unless needed to show traffic movements. (n) Describe areas: Choose either acres or square feet to describe area for each parcel. (o) Do not use the same parcel number from a parcel that has been closed or a parcel number that has been deleted (and noted “NOT USED”) from the same plan title. (p) Redline plan: use the latest approved R/W Plan. (q) Railroad easements: provide ties to railroad stationing and offsets (Longitudinal and crossing easements). (r) Understanding of construction permits vs. easements. (s) Purpose of revision on the transmittal letter. It should be an explanation as to why the revision is requested or needed, not just a reiteration of the changes themselves. (t) Spell check all transmittals. (u) Stating the proposed project advertisement date in the transmittal letter, can help expedite the processing of plan revisions.

Transmittal Requirements
After the plans have been reviewed by the Region Right of Way Plans Office, a transmittal package shall be generated and stored in ProjectWise per WSDOT Electronic Engineering Data
Standards Manual Deliverables Section 8.08(2). The following are to be included in the transmittal: (a) A letter listing all items transmitted, including the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) title. (b) Current work order information. (c) A numbered Title Report for each parcel. (d) Copies of calculations completed to determine the right of way centerline, parcel limits, parcel areas, and any other pertinent data (i.e.- ALG file, clearance reports, etc.). (e) One copy of each subdivision plat referred to in Title Reports. (f) One copy of each plan sheet (adjoining or underlying plans) requiring revision or superseding as a result of the new plan. Proposed revisions are to be shown in color (red will be added to the plan sheet, green will be deleted or crossed out, blue will provide notes or instructions for clarification) and submitted in accordance with
Section 100.09 (see Example 1-8). (g) If the project has been established as a limited access facility, the region shall make certain that the entire hearing procedure was carried to completion (see Design Manual
Chapter 210) and shall include supporting documentation in the transmittal (i.e. letters of approval from FHWA or the region ASDE.) Check with the HQ Access and Hearings
Office for the required process. (h) If a plan shows railroad facilities, federal lands, safety rest areas, park & ride lots, or sundry sites, acknowledgment of compliance with the following requirements is to be furnished: 1. Applicable portions of the Utilities Manual. 2. Sundry Site Plan. 3. Safety rest areas: A copy of the approval by the HQ Hydraulics Section (see Design 4. Highways Over National Forest Lands, Memorandum of Understanding, M 22 50

100.03(10)
Headquarters Processing
The HQ Right of Way Plans Section will make a final review of the plan, coordinate the review with other offices as required, and provide a PDF copy of each sheet. After review of the changes by Headquarters, and with region concurrence, the responsible Professional Engineer will stamp and digitally sign each sheet in a PDF file format. The region has the option to have a
Professional Land Surveyor also stamp and digitally sign them. This stamp will be placed above
Page 1-12
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 1
Right of Way Plans the title block. The electronic file(s) will then be transmitted to the HQ Right of Way Plans
Section where they will be approved and adopted for the applicable phase authority.
Following approval, the plan(s) will be placed into the approved electronic content management system for access by the regions, HQ Real Estate Services, and other plan users.
For revisions to original plans, see Section 100.11.
ProjectWise is the file management software used to maintain current and date related versions of specific revised sheets.

100.03(11)
Superseded Plans
When all or a portion of an existing Right of Way Plan is superseded by a new plan, the superseded plan must be revised to identify the portion of the plan that has been superseded. It is the region’s responsibility to submit a plan revision identifying the superseded plan or portion thereof. A superseding plan revision may be submitted at the same time as the new plan.
However, the superseded plan revision will not be processed and approved until the superseding plan has been approved. 100.04
Right of Way Acquisition Details
Whenever possible, the total boundary of each parcel affected by the highway improvements is included on the plan sheets. Parcels that cannot be shown entirely on the plan sheet are included on the Vicinity Map. The total parcel detail must be clearly shown in relation to the highway facility. Sufficient data must be supplied to ensure each area of acquisition required for the project can be legally described.
The Project Development Office, working with Real Estate Services, can obtain total area for parcels shown on the Right of Way Plan from the County Assessor’s Office. The title companies are also requested to include areas from Assessor's records in the Title Reports, and these areas are entered in the “Total Area” boxes on the Right of Way Plans.
A greater degree of precision is required to plot the boundaries of parcels where land values are high (such as urban areas and development tracts). Where land values are high and/or ownerships consist of lots, blocks, or small tracts, the areas are shown to the nearest square foot. Larger areas are generally defined by a Public Lands Survey and may be specified in acres.
Right of way acquisitions are calculated to the nearest square foot or hundredth of an acre, except in the case of federal or Indian lands. These lands are calculated to the nearest thousandth of an acre, which is a federal requirement. Copies of computer sheets of calculations initiated by the region are provided, with the plans, to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section to expedite the review process. (100.03(8)(d)). 100.04(1)

The following ownership information is submitted by the region to the HQ Right of Way Plans
Section in Olympia.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 1-13 Right of Way Plans
Division 1 (a) A Title Report (less than five years old) is required for each parcel from which WSDOT is acquiring property, easements, and/or access rights. These reports are also examined for easements or permits granted to owners of property that does not abut the highway but is affected by the new highway facility. (b) Property parcel identification numbers are assigned consecutively for every parcel involved from the beginning to the end of the project. Each number consists of six digits, of which the first shall be the region prefix: 1 - 00000 = Northwest Region 2 - 00000 = North Central Region 3 - 00000 = Olympic Region 4 - 00000 = Southwest Region 5 - 00000 = South Central Region 6 - 00000 = Eastern Region
The region assigns the parcel number for use within its jurisdiction and it is used on all
Right of Way Plans, preliminary commitments, deeds, easements, or other substantiating data.
The assigned number will identify the property for all future departmental use; however, a division of or additional acquisition from an existing parcel must be assigned a new six-digit parcel number. Letter suffixes to an existing number are prohibited.
When new acquisitions occur on a plan that has had a previous acquisition, the existing parcel number is arrowed into the previous acquisition. The new parcel number is placed within the new parcel. The ownership block will retain the previous parcel number information, including the areas. When a parcel previously had a partial acquisition, and an additional acquisition is proposed on the same plan, the previous parcel number is placed within the previous area associated with that acquisition. If the area is too small, a leader line is drawn from the previous parcel number into the area that was acquired. A new parcel number is placed within the parcel indicating additional acquisitions are to take place.
If a parcel is acquired in total, followed by a new plan, a new WSDOT cartouche is placed within the parcel (see Example 1-13).
The number is used as shown in Example 1-2. (c) The areas of total ownership, right of way required for highway use; property remaining right and left of the right of way centerline; easements; and permits are shown in a tabular listing on each plan sheet. In most cases, the total area is obtained from the
County Assessor’s Office.
When an individual ownership extends to more than one plan sheet, area tabulations will be placed on the first plan sheet that shows that parcel. In the case of Limited
Access Approaches, the Access Approach Schedule will appear on the sheet the approach is located on, by station.

Sundry Site Plans
The original intent of the Sundry Site Plan was to provide a source of material for highway construction projects. Today, most projects use contractor-furnished sites, so pit sites are no
Page 1-14
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 1
Right of Way Plans longer shown on Sundry Site Plans. Current use includes functions such as ferry terminals, wetlands mitigation sites, park & ride lots, and storm water retention or other reclamation sites.
A Sundry Site Plan is used to map property that cannot be shown on a Right of Way Plan. Sundry
Site Plans are to be prepared in English units only. Preferably, sites used by WSDOT are acquired in fee. Some sites may be acquired with an easement or lease.
Pit sites (PS), quarry sites (QS), stockpile sites (SP), and waste sites (WS) are identified by a system that uses two letters, followed by the county letter designation (shown on the following list) and the site number. For example, quarry site number 25 in Thurston County is shown as
QS-J-25. Sites such as ferry terminals, wetlands mitigation areas, park & ride lots, and so on, are identified by name rather than a letter designation and site number; for example, Edmonds
Ferry Terminal, Snoqualmie Wetlands Mitigation Area, and Marvin Road Park & Ride Lot.
The following list shows the county letter designations:

Site Selection
Site selection should be based at least in part on the following criteria: (a) Site investigation by the Region Materials Engineer and the Region Landscape Architect. (b) Permanency. (c) Size and space (sufficient to accommodate all current and/or future operations). (d) Cost. (e) Aesthetic values.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 1-15 Right of Way Plans
Division 1 (f) Single ownership, if possible. (g) Unimproved low-valued land. Purchase of improved or valuable land should be avoided unless acquisition of the site is cost-effective (the savings in haul compensate for the cost of the site). (h) Consideration of all other available sources, including private, commercial, and other
WSDOT sites. (i) Presence of wetlands, aquifers, farmlands, flood plains, historical or archaeological sites, or other environmentally sensitive lands. 100.05(2)
Plan Submittal
Before beginning work on a Sundry Site Plan the Region R/W Plans Office should meet with
Region Real Estate Services and the project office to determine the anticipated use of the site and whether it will be a total or partial acquisition. This information can be used to determine the elements to be located within the site and whether a Record of Survey will be required.
Specific information to be included and submitted with a Sundry Site Plan is as follows: (a) Site number or name. (b) Title Reports and parcel identification numbers. (c) Area calculations: • Total • Right of Way Acquisition • Remainder (d) If a survey was completed for this site, provide a cross-reference note to the Record of
Survey. (Highly recommended to determine legal description discrepancies, if any, or encroachments) (e) Except for Sundry Site Plans referenced to a Record of Survey, described by aliquot parts, or defined by platted lot and block, all alignments and parcels shown on the plan will be tied to a minimum of two General Land Office corners or State Plane Coordinate control points. (f) Access information if site does not abut a public road system (g) Location of buildings and other structures, fences, wells, septic systems, and any other features necessary for appraisal purposes. (h) All easements shown on parcels acquired for the purpose of structure construction. (i) Scale drawing with dimensions of sundry site on a 22-inch x 34-inch reproducible sheet (see Examples 1-10, 1-11, and 1-12). (j) Vicinity Map.

Sundry Site Plans That Reference a Record of Survey
Many Sundry Site Plans now include setting property corners of the acquisition area. However, the final acquisition often differs from the original plan once negotiations are complete. In order to avoid resetting property corners, the following procedure has been established. (a) The Sundry Site Plan is prepared and approved based on the anticipated needs of the project. (b) Once negotiations are complete and the property has been acquired, the property corners are set. (c) The Record of Survey is filed and an Auditor’s File Number (AFN) is assigned to the survey. (d) The Sundry Site Plan is then revised, adding the Record of Survey AFN to the plan. 100.05(4)
Headquarters Processing
The HQ Right of Way Plans Section will make a final review of the plan, coordinate the review with other offices as required, and send back to the region a link to a Project Wise folder of each sheet. After review of the changes by Headquarters, and with region concurrence, the responsible Professional Engineer will digitally stamp and sign each sheet in a PDF file format.
The region has the option to have a Professional Land Surveyor also stamp and sign the sheets(s). This stamp will be placed above the title block. Once the sheets are signed, the HQ
Right of Way Plans Section will be notified and the sheets will be approved and adopted.
Following approval, the plan(s) will be placed into the approved electronic content management system for access by the regions, HQ Real Estate Services, and other plan users.
For revisions to original plans, see Section 100.11.
ProjectWise is the file management software used to maintain current and date related versions of specific revised sheets.
Right of Way projects will be managed in ProjectWise per the WSDOT EEDS Manual Division 8.
The current standard structure will be verified or provided by HQ Right of Way Plans Section upon revision submittal request. Existing project structures will be migrated to the current standard structure including associated data and previous revision submittals. This structure will include the following: •

Project folder name including beginning Mile Post and abbreviated plan set name. For
Example: 274.12GrahamRdtoCraigVic •
Project properties/attributes including plan information and plan sheet title. • \HQ_RW_CurrentCad. Current base and sheet files representing the R/W project. This folder is to be maintained and revised by HQ Right of Way Plans and HQ Real Estate
Services only. Regions may reference the files for proposed revisions and then include the resulting CAD files with the submittal package.

Deliverables 8.08(2) and populated by the region submitting a proposed revision. • \MicroStation_63Levels. This optional folder contains the original legacy standard CAD files for information only. • \PDF-Original Scans. This folder contains the last scanned hardcopy sheets (as they originally existed prior to any revisions). This folder is read only and may not be revised.
Parcel Acquisition Plans
A Parcel Acquisition Plan (PAP) is the official state document used as the basis for advanced acquisition of real estate and other property rights. It is not used to acquire property rights without prior approval of the Headquarters Real Estate Services Office and the Headquarters
R/W Plans Manager. A PAP generally includes a single parcel, although multiple parcels can be shown if appropriate. It is preferred that a PAP be used to acquire a total parcel from a willing seller. However, because they are considered an official plan, partial acquisitions can be made from these plans with an approved NEPA, except for acquisition of access rights.
A PAP is almost always used to acquire property before the completion of the Right of Way Plan.
Therefore, it is not included in the limited access hearing process. For this reason, a PAP is not used to acquire access control rights. In addition, project design is usually not complete. The risk of the region acquiring more or less real estate than needed may require additional follow up with the property owner.
A PAP is prepared to the same standards as a Right of Way Plan. The plan is certified by a professional engineer and is approved and adopted by the Headquarters R/W Plans Manager. If the highway centerline has not been established, and station/offsets cannot be used to prepare a legal description, then enough data must be shown to prepare a metes and bounds description. The description must be tied to an established boundary corner and/or General
Land Office corner, so that the property can be independently defined and located. Line work and deed calls from the description help to eliminate confusion. All parcels acquired on a PAP will be shown as WSDOT ownership on the Approved Right Of Way Plan.
The use of a PAP puts the region at risk. For this reason, use of a PAP should only be undertaken after careful consideration of all factors. The Real Estate Services and Right of Way Plans offices must be consulted before preparing a PAP. A PAP may not be used for condemnation purposes.
A PAP must be superseded by the final Right of Way Plan. The Region is responsible for submitting these superseding revision requests.
See Example 1-15.

Exhibit Maps 100.07(1)
Early Total Acquisitions
An Exhibit Map is an unofficial plan used for advanced acquisition of property. It is only used for total acquisition from willing sellers. An Exhibit Map is not to be used for a partial acquisition.
These maps should be considered exhibits to assist the property owner during the negotiation and acquisition process. The plan must identify the property so that the existing legal description can be used. A new legal description will not be prepared from an Exhibit Map.
Although EEDS drafting standards should be used to prepare an Exhibit Map, minor variations may be allowed. Consultation with the HQ Right of Way Plans Section is advised. An Exhibit Map may or may not show a proposed right of way, but in no instance should limited access hachures be shown.
Use of an Exhibit Map puts the region at risk. Recommendations found in Section 100.06, Parcel
Acquisition Plans, are also appropriate for Exhibit Maps.
Exhibit Maps are not certified or adopted. Therefore, they are not superseded by the final Right of Way Plan.
See Example 1-7.

100.07(2)
Temporary Construction Easements
A variation of the Exhibit Map may be used to acquire a Temporary Construction Easement (TCE) or other purposes with prior approval by the HQ Right of Way Plans Manager. Its use is determined by the region Real Estate and Right of Way Office. If an existing Right of Way plan exists, the temporary right will be shown on the approved plan. If an approved plan does not exist, then this Exhibit Map may be utilized. The user must be aware of the associated risks involved with utilizing this section. If any of the below situations apply, an approved Right of
Way Plan shall be prepared. •
A permanent property right is to be acquired. All permanent property rights are shown on an approved Right of Way plan. •
Stationing is not to be used to define the temporary right. The temporary right area should be described by non station and offset methods. •
If a complex description is needed. •
An uncooperative owner requires the acquisition to be acquired by condemnation methods.
Temporary Construction Easements are not shown on future right of way plans. Tracking of these documents is a region responsibility. A typical TCE may last for several years depending on the type of construction and use needed by WSDOT. Another circumstance may be encountered where a TCE may be needed for just a few days. These very temporary easements do not need to be added to the approved R/W Plan. These TCE’s may be acquired on an Exhibit Map. Exhibit

Maps are not recorded with the county but used as a tool to help the property owner understand the area needed for construction purposes only. 100.07(3)
Drawing Standards
Exhibit Maps are to be prepared with English Units only on the CAD System in conformance with the adopted standards. Exhibit Maps are archived on standard 11-inch by 17-inch paper sheets and in electronic form within ProjectWise (a file management software). The Exhibit Map should include the following information, as applicable. •
Show a tie to a Government Land Office corner. •
Display the seal of a Professional Engineer preparing the Exhibit Map. •
Define the easement area with station and offset. •
Complies with R/W Plan CAD Standards. •
Provides a Legal Description (Section, Township, Range)

•
Name and address of Parcel owner as found on the title report.
Parcel Number
Total Parcel Area and area of TCE
TCE identified by outline and dimensions
Provide Assessor’s Tax Parcel Number.

Design Office address and phone number.

•
File name and location of where drawing is archived or maintained.
A copy of the MicroStation file is to be placed in ProjectWise for RES tracking purposes.
A link will be sent to RES along with the submittal package for RES processing. 100.07(4)
Region Processing
The Temporary Construction Easement Exhibit Maps will not be sent to HQ Right of Way plans for processing or approval. They will be sent to the Region Real Estate Office for approval.
Although these Exhibit Maps are not recorded with the easement document, they will be maintained by the HQ Real Estate Office and accessible with the electronic document database.
See region Real Estate Services Office for an example.

Right of Way Plans
Access Report Plan
The Access Report Plan (see Example 1-4) shows the effects of the proposed highway on the street and road system by delineating the points of public access (see the Design Manual
Chapter 530). The following items are the minimum details to be shown on the plan: •
Highway facilities with standard access control delineated. •
Public road network. •
Proposed frontage roads and county road or city street connections (individual private approaches need not be included, but the report should describe general provisions for access to private properties). •
Location and identity of subdivisions. •
Corporate limits and boundaries.

•
Rivers, streams, and major landmarks.
Pedestrian and bicycle trails or paths.
Beginning and end of plan.
Legend and scale bar.
Publicly owned utilities.
Title block.
Areas for relinquishment to county, city, or transfer to others, with Turnback Lines indicated, and labeled as such.
Structures, labeled as overcrossings or undercrossing.
Local names for interchanges shown on plan.

•
Points of public access.
Appropriate traffic movement notes on plan sheets.
Plan length on first page of Vicinity Map shown as: Total Length of Plan = __ Mile(s)
Directional arrows on all roadways and ramps.
Number of lanes indicated on all roadways.
Matching of stationing and all details, especially on all plan sheets, will be carefully checked to ensure the relationship to adjacent plans.
To prevent confusion concerning the degree of access control intended for each area of a plan, the station where transition is made from one type of control to another is clearly labeled. This applies to any such transition upon the highway proper or where such highway connects or intersects with another limited access facility, be it a state, county, or city roadway. This does not apply at intersections where the transition occurs between access-controlled facilities and
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 1-21

Right of Way Plans
Division 1 facilities with no access control. Modified access control adjacent to interchanges or intersections must be identified on the plan.
The title block on the plan sheet shall designate full, partial, or modified access control.
Whenever a transition occurs on a sheet, the title block shall indicate all degrees of access appearing on the sheet. 100.09
Access Hearing Plan
The region prepares an Access Hearing Plan (see Example 1 5) to be used as an exhibit at the public hearing and forwards it to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section for review. The Access
Hearing Plan shall contain the following data in addition to that required for the Access Report
Plan: 100.10 •
Topographical features such as buildings, fences, and private driveways. •
Ownerships, including parcel numbers, names, and areas (for details on assignment of property parcel identification numbers, see Section 100.04(1)(b)). Areas shown on the hearing plan shall include the total area, acquisition area, and remainder.

•
Access Approach Schedule showing all private approaches within the limits of access control.
Access control notes in conformance with Section 100.12; right of way dimensions need to be shown.
Special Right of Way Plans
Special maps and plans required for negotiation with various agencies and organizations are usually prepared by the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. When such plans are the responsibility of the region, they are transmitted to the HQ Right of Way Plans Section with the Right of
Way Plans. 100.10(1)
Court Exhibit Maps
Condemnations or taking of rights by judicial action may be accomplished through both state and federal courts. The mapping preparation varies depending upon which court is involved. (a) State Court
The actual acquisition instrument is generally the pertinent portion of the Right of Way
Plan. For court exhibits, aerial photography supplemented to depict property lines or other data is preferable. Experience has shown that juries more readily relate to this type of exhibit. If photography is not available or if specific site conditions are such that this cannot be accomplished, a special court exhibit should be prepared.
If required, the special court exhibit map is to be prepared from information shown on the Right of Way Plan. This information may be supplemented by information from the

Page 1-22
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 1
Right of Way Plans right of way agent’s condemnation report, the Title Report, county records, legal descriptions, and/or information obtained from personal examination of the property.
Where supplemental information indicates a difference in dimensions or area from that indicated on the Right of Way Plan, a Right of Way Plan revision should be prepared concurrent with the court exhibit map. This material will be sent to HQ Real Estate
Services, where it will be prepared as part of the exhibit and presented to the Attorney
General’s Office.
The court exhibit map is to be prepared under the supervision of the engineer who will present the map in court.
The map should include the following: •
Ties from proposed R/W centerline to existing corners. •
All buildings and improvements.

•
Accurate position of buildings and improvements that lie 100 feet or less from the proposed right of way.
Distance from improvements to proposed R/W centerline.
Location of pipelines and other construction, as requested.
Five-foot contours, drawn in brown pencil.
Bearing on ownership lines where distances are shown.
Types and points of access for limited access highways.
If possible, show the entire area to be acquired from a single ownership on a single sheet. Only the portions of an ownership covered by the Title Reports need be shown if those areas alone will be affected by condemnation and severance for right of way.
Include the limits of other adjoining parcels of the same ownership if their value may also be affected. More than one parcel involving one or more ownerships may be shown if there is no break in continuity between them and if the scale will be large enough to clearly show the features of each. Do not show fencing that is to be removed or is proposed, and do not color the map.
A Vicinity Map is required, preferably on the exhibit map sheet, showing the entire contiguous ownership of the land being condemned and pertinent topographic features.
Submit the tracing to HQ Real Estate Services with a print on which the total ownership is outlined in red, with a letter giving acreage computation for the total ownership, right of way area, and severed portions. HQ Real Estate Services will assemble all the necessary information and present the package to the Attorney General’s Office. (b) Federal Court
Maps prepared for the acquisition instrument must be consistent with federal regulations at the time of acquisition. A section of the Right of Way Plan must include
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Page 1-23 Right of Way Plans
Division 1 metes and bounds description data, and a supplemental photo exhibit map is desirable.
The specific details shall be coordinated through HQ Real Estate Services at the time of preparation. 100.10(2) Right of Way Over Lands Controlled by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs
For rights of way over lands controlled by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the region prepares the appropriate Right of Way Plans. The Engineer’s Affidavit is signed by the Professional
Engineer who signed the Right of Way Plan. The Engineer’s Affidavit and Certification are signed by the Project Development Engineer or equivalent. Reproducibles and prints, as required, are sent by the Region Right of Way Plans Office to the Region Real Estate Services Office for further action, in accordance with the prescribed policies of WSDOT and the BIA. A copy of the
Engineer’s Affidavit and the Certification are sent, with the acquisition file, to HQ Real Estate
Services. 100.10(3)

Washington State Ferries Facility Site Maps
Sundry Site Plans or other plans involving property for the Washington State Ferries are prepared by the HQ Right of Way Plans Section. 100.10(5)
Hardship Acquisition Maps
Region requests for hardship case consideration are submitted to the HQ Right of Way Plans
Section, accompanied by one set of half-size reproducible consisting of the following: •
Before Right of Way Plans are approved: a Vicinity Map and preliminary plans showing hardship parcels to be acquired (ownership and area of take indicated). If preliminary plans are not available, the exhibit map may be substituted. Refer to Section 100.07 for additional information (see Example 1-7). •
After Right of Way Plans have been approved, a Vicinity Map and Right of Way Plan showing hardship parcels to be acquired (ownership and area of take indicated) with a reference to the approved R/W plan.
For partial take parcels, metes and bounds descriptions of the partial takes or dimensions of take and remainder must be included in the plans.

Right of Way Plans
Revisions to Approved Right of Way Plans
A minimum of 30 days prior to the start of the R/W phase of a project, the project team shall submit a request to the WSDOT HQ Right of Way Plans office for preparation of the R/W plans to be used for the project. Upon that request, the WSDOT HQ Right of Way Plans office will review and update the R/W plans as follows: 1. Convert the existing MicroStation 63 level environment into the current expanded level environment. 2. Move the base plan and the sheets into a close approximate geographic location. 3. Create single sheet per files, allowing multiple users and future GIS use. 4. Update the plan sheets to include all revisions associated with each sheet. 5. The deliverable will be stored in ProjectWise, and a link to the site will be sent to the design team requesting the service.
This process will assure that the current plan is being used and updated prior to starting project revisions. This will reduce the processing time in HQ Right of Way Plans Section and provide for more accurate scheduling.
Since this process is to be completed prior to the R/W phase of a project, all charges associated with the above-described work will be absorbed by the HQ Right of Way Plans office.
Using the converted and updated R/W plans, the Region Right of Way Plans Office submits a proposed revision package and stores it in ProjectWise per Electronic Engineering Standards
Manual (M 3028) Deliverables 8.08(2). CAD or PDF files showing the proposed revision must not be modified except as noted.
Plan revisions must be submitted and stored in ProjectWise per EEDS Deliverables 8.08(2)
For projects that include a large number of new parcels, Title Reports may be included in the transmittal package.
When revising plans that have both English units and metric units, the proposed revisions from the region shall show only English units.
Extensive changes to the existing Right of Way Plan may require submittal of a new plan in lieu of a revision.
New Right of Way Plans should be developed when the existing plans are obsolete, inaccurate, or difficult to read.
New Right of Way Plans should be considered when any of the following conditions exists: •

The scale of the existing plan is smaller than 1"=100'.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 1-25 Right of Way Plans
Division 1 •
The existing plan shows unreliable data (for example, assumed bearings, distances, or other important information). •
The proposed revision would require major changes to the current plan (for example, new alignment, the addition of many new parcels, or the addition of access control). •
The current plan shows “Right of Way as acquired, alignment as constructed” in the revision block. •
The existing plan was originally a county or city plan. •
Stations do not increase from left to right. •
The plan is on an old datum (for example, 1927).

When revising “Split Plans” (separate Right of Way and Limited Access Plans), the region must submit appropriate colored revisions for both plans.
Total parcel details were not shown on many of the older Right of Way Plans. When an existing
Right of Way Plan is being revised to show new parcels, include a total parcel detail. Total parcel details are very important when condemnation of the parcel is a probability. A total parcel detail is not necessary if the total parcel is especially large, such as a national forest.
Whenever a parcel has been dealt with and the transaction has been finalized, and additional right of way and/or other property rights are required, a new parcel number is assigned to the parcel involved. The old number is shown inside the area of original take. Property dots are adjusted to show the current boundary, and new areas are shown in the ownership block.
An approved Right of Way Limited Access Plan cannot be revised until completion of the appeal period following mailing of the Findings and Order. All revisions that the region develops during this time shall be held and submitted as a single package after the appeal period.
For plans that include a Wetlands Mitigation Site, the Army Corps of Engineers note, with the permit number, should be included in the plan revision. 100.11(1)
Transmittal Requirements
The following shall be placed in the appropriate ProjectWise folder and submit a revision transmittal and stored in the appropriate folder structure locations per EEDS Deliverables 8.08(2): (a) Completed Schedule of Right of Way Plan Revisions (transmittal letter). All revisions require a justification for the revision. It is very important to explain why the revision is needed. The purpose of the plan revision should be explained in detail on the transmittal letter. Reiterating what is shown on the redlined plans is not a sufficient explanation. The PS&E title should be included. (b) Marked electronic files with engineering and right of way information that includes areas revised if right of way negotiations are not complete. The actual area of the original acquisition and the area for supplemental acquisition, based on ownership at
Page 1-26
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Division 1
Right of Way Plans the time of the second acquisition, are included if negotiations are complete. Redlines will include parcel numbers, names, areas, and remainders. (c) Title Reports for all new parcels. Supplemental Title Reports are acceptable if the original transaction has been recently completed. A new parcel number will be needed for these parcels. (d) Copies of calculations completed to determine new parcel limits, parcel areas, and other pertinent calculations. (i.e. alg file) (e) Subdivision plats and/or other pertinent data. (f) Coincident with (a) above, when original right of way negotiations are incomplete or a revision affects condemnation proceedings, the Region Real Estate Services Manager is advised to take appropriate action pending final revision approval. (g) E-mail notification of submittals are acceptable provided the transmittal letter package is complete in ProjectWise. (h) When appropriate for Limited Access Issues, letters of approval from FHWA or the
Region ASDE is required. 100.11(2)
Headquarters Processing
The HQ Right of Way Plans Section will conduct a final review of the plan revisions and coordinate the review with other offices and the FHWA, as required.
The Region will revise the current existing and approved R/W plan(s) submitted for revision subsequent to HQ R/W Plans office review, verification and comment prior to approval by the
HQ Right of Way Plans Manager.
Following approval, the plan(s) will be placed into the electronic document management system for access by the regions, HQ Real Estate Services, and other plan users. 100.12
Access Control Notes 100.12(1)
Instructions

Standard access control notes cover all necessary descriptions to be shown in the plans for the granting of approaches. An access approach note plus necessary supplementary notes will be used to identify all like approaches listed.
The access approach schedule on the Right of Way Plan shall list the specific details for each approach. Under the Centerline of Approach Station column, enter the exact station or the stations between whose limits the approach will be granted, the side of centerline (right, left, or both), and any supplementary information required. Under the Type column, indicate the letter and/or applicable supplementary note numbers.
The supplementary notes are used in conjunction with the access approach notes to which they apply. Each supplementary note shall always be listed by the number assigned to it. In this
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 1-27 Right of Way Plans
Division 1 manner, an access approach note letter with a supplementary note number will always indicate the same type of approach throughout all Right of Way Plans.
Type A through Type F approaches are defined in WAC 468 58 080, and are listed in the Access

Archiving R/W Plans 100.13(1)
Existing Plans

The official copy of all Right of Way (R/W) plans are stored electronically in file management software called ”ELECTRONIC CONTENT MANAGEMENT”. The software package utilizes a database management tool and search engine of all R/W, Sundry Site Plans, Exhibit and Parcel
Acquisition Plans prepared for acquiring property rights. All acquisition plan sheets have been scanned (as a TIFF image) or printed to a PDF image.
All revised R/W plan sheets are updated into the database on a weekly basis. This allows the most current existing and approved R/W plan sheet to be available at any given time. 100.13(2)
Superseded R/W Plans
As road alignments are modified through improvement programs, the existing R/W plan may be superseded by a new drawing. The superseded plan is still considered a valid plan as it provides the history that is sometimes needed when questions arise as to how specific roadway sections were acquired. These plans are kept on file, in electronic document management, under the
Superseded section.
These plans may not be available to all individuals. If you need access to the superseded plans,
Contact the State Survey Manager for approval.

Plan History
R/W plans evolve when roadways are improved, easements added or deleted, alignments changed within the established footprint, additional improvements proposed, etc. These minor revisions can sometimes be lost if the plan is revised multiple times. A new process has emerged allowing WSDOT HQ R/W Plans office to capture a plan sheet at any given time if it has been software package called ProjectWise.
This product acts like a file cabinet storing information as the plan currently exists plus what is to be revised. As time goes on, this plan information may become instrumental in a court case or discussions with property owners over center line alignments, Right of Way widths, highway access schedules, and other property rights related to a specific timeframe.
These intermediate plan sheets will be able to answer many of these questions before the area becomes cluttered with after the fact revisions. These intermediate plan sheets may be looked up using the SR number/calendar folder/ year sheet was revised/ date sheet was revised/sheet name. A historical record of what was added or removed from each sheet is recorded for anyone with access to ProjectWise.
To find a specific plan sheet that may be archived see below: 100.14

Digital Signatures 100.14(1)
New Plan Sheets
WSDOT has transitioned from signing new R/W Plans, (all types) from using the traditional method of pen and ink with a hand signature of all the approvers, replacing it with digital signatures of all approvers. This allows the transferring of multiple copies by email very quickly without taking time to print multiple sheet copies and then mailing them to expectant recipients.
This process is administered by the Digital Signature administrator and the R/W Plans Office. All new and revised R/W Plans requiring an approval signature(s), will be developed and saved in a
PDF format. A link to the ProjectWise folder with the PDF file will be sent by email to the signer(s) where the signer(s) will place their digital signature, following the process set up by the
R/W Plans Office, and then emailed back to the R/W Plans Office. The State R/W Plans Manager will place their digital signature providing the seal of approval of the new set of plans. The plans
Page 1-32
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 1
Right of Way Plans

are now ready to be officially approved and adopted by WSDOT for acquisition and disposal of property rights.
A digitally signed plan sheet may not be revised without invalidating the signatures. The usual sign that the plan has been modified is a red “X” across the title block.
A R/W plan sheet which has been digitally signed and in need of being revised is copied, within
ProjectWise, to its new location. This action will remove all digital signatures. The process is to have the State R/W Plans Manager resign the approval of the plan sheet. The other signers, will have a note placed by their seals stating that they digitally signed this sheet on a specific date.

Legal Descriptions

200.01
The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) prepares a variety of survey records as required by state law. Many of the survey records support the locations of state highways, sundry sites, ferry terminals, railroads, airports, and other WSDOT assets.
The documents include Records of Surveys, Monumentation Maps, State Land
Plats, Department of Natural Resources (DNR) monument removal permits, and legal descriptions. Note: Land Corner Records, as required by RCW 58.09.040, are excluded from this section at this time.
The following sections provide details for the preparation of survey records. 200.02
Record of Survey
A Record of Survey (ROS) is the foundation document for state highway right of way alignment and related boundaries. A Record of Survey may also be prepared when locating the boundaries of other state-owned properties for public and state use. These documents will be used as a basis for existing and proposed right of way centerline alignments and other agency capital improvement projects. The Record of Survey maps may be referred to in legal instruments and are permanently recorded at the county auditor's office in the county in which the survey exists.
Copies should also be retained at the WSDOT Headquarters (HQ) and DNR in Olympia.
A Record of Survey is not required on all projects. Many safety and surface treatment projects neither revise highway alignments nor require boundary determinations. The Project Manager must consult with the region Cadastral Engineer or region surveyor to determine the impact, if any, to survey monuments within and adjacent to the work zone. WSDOT has a responsibility to protect and preserve existing survey monumentation (RCW 58.09.130). Refer to Exhibit 2-1 to help determine when a survey document is to be prepared.
The Record of Survey is intended to be a “stand-alone” document. To obtain this “stand-alone” status, follow the guidelines below.

DEFINITIONS
Type 1 Monumentation Map: Survey for alignment location and determination. Ties to cadastral points and all other determining factors shown.
Type 2 Monumentation Map: Location of monument by State Plane Coordinates only.
Record of Survey: Survey for alignment location and boundary determination. Ties to cadastral points and all other determining factors shown. 200.02(1) References

If it has been determined that a survey is necessary, it is the responsibility of the region to assemble data and prepare a Record of Survey for locating and defining the centerline alignment in its mathematical position within the Public Land Survey System. The Record of Survey is prepared to the specifications of RCW 58.09, WAC 332-130, and specific WSDOT and county codes or guidelines.

Division 2
Survey Records 200.02(3) English Units Only
Records of Survey are to be prepared in English U.S. Survey feet only. 200.02(4) Alignment
The R/W centerline, from which the right of way is to be legally described, is shown as a continuous solid line for the full length of the project, with its alignment data shown. If the R/W centerline is being retraced and the alignment data varies from plan data, both original and retraced alignment data is shown. This will provide a more complete understanding of the differences between the plan and retraced centerline. In those instances where the existing and proposed centerline alignments may be graphically shown, the existing alignment will be shown with a different line type than the proposed centerline (solid line).
In those instances where stationing does not run in the same direction as mileposts, or other right of way oddities are noted that do not conform to the current Right of Way Plan standards and a new Right of Way Plan is to be prepared, additional sheets will be added showing the revised alignment and any changes. The additional sheets will reverse the direction of stationing to have both the stationing and mileposts running congruently and provide a basis to bring the
Right of Way Plans into conformance, per Division 1 of the Plans Preparation Manual (see
Exhibits 2-2a and 2-2b).
The existing stationing shall be tied to the new centerline stationing by station and/or bearing equations. The new Right of Way stationing shall be tied to all section and quarter-section lines where such corners have been found. A computed tie from an existing Record of Survey showing the breakdown of the sections is acceptable. A reference to the survey used shall be noted on the new Record of Survey.
R/W width data should not be shown on the Record of Survey. Caution is advised as right of way limits have dynamic characteristics, whereas the right of way centerline is a more stable entity.
For projects proposing to acquire additional rights of way, it is suggested to show the centerline only.

200.02(5) Control Features
Where such features exist, the Record of Survey shall show, but is not limited to: GPS network points, government subdivision corners, platted subdivisions, donation land claims, national park or forest boundaries, Indian reservations, farm units, and property corners. Show a minimum of two bearing and distance ties from the new R/W centerline, with stations noted to an existing and recorded monument of a government subdivision corner, particularly the monuments from which the title reports originate. 200.02(6) Survey Report
A Survey Report is a summary of all the main elements that were used to generate the Record of
Survey or other survey documents. The purpose of the Survey Report is to provide documentation of the controlling elements of decisions made throughout the project. A
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 2-3 Survey Records
Division 2 separate file folder should be kept with the project folder summarizing those elements. This
Survey Report will become the basis of the Narrative, which may be placed on the Record of
Survey or Monumentation Map.
A Survey Report is not required as part of the preparation of a Record of Survey. However, it is highly recommended that such a report be prepared in the event a question ever arises regarding the survey, so that an answer may be determined by the surveyor (or another if the surveyor is not available).
A copy of the Survey Report shall be archived in the Survey/_SurveyDoc folder of the Standard
CAE Project folder structure. This will ensure all survey documentation regarding alignment decisions, datums, control monuments, secondary control monuments, and other relevant information is available to current and future users of the plans.
Documentation should include, but not be limited to: • Horizontal and vertical datums identified. • Horizontal and vertical control points identified. • Control network points identified with a sketch. • Sketches and/or photos of control points. • State Plane Coordinates (SPC) to Project Datum worksheets. • List of Records of Survey/Land Corner Records, RR maps, and other reference material. • List of WSDOT Right of Way Plans. • List of deeds and other property rights documents. • Sketches and/or photos of alignment monuments. • Monuments identified as potential disturbance to project. • Summary of all General Land Office (GLO) monuments held or rejected, with supporting evidence. • Sketches of conflicting information supporting decisions. • Summaries of key determinations critical to resolution of alignments. • Basis of Bearings monuments identified. • Basis of Stationing identified.

200.02(7)
Narrative
The Narrative is an optional explanation added to the Record of Survey. The purpose of the
Narrative is to provide additional explanation of how final determinations were made, which may be difficult to show graphically. Circumstances may dictate whether a Narrative is to be written, but it is recommended that one be prepared for all surveys.

Survey Records 200.02(8) Record of Survey Details (a) Record of Survey Map Requirements
A Record of Survey may be signed only by a Professional Land Surveyor. One of the main purposes of a Record of Survey is to define ownership boundaries or baselines from which real property boundaries are defined. According to the definitions given in RCW 18.43.020, this task falls under the practice of land surveying.
The Washington Administrative Code requires that all Records of Survey meet a minimum standard (see WAC 332-130-050 for a complete list of requirements). This standard not only defines the size of the sheet and minimum text heights, it also includes information regarding professional certification and archiving data. All Records of Survey are to be recorded with the county auditor’s office. Certain counties may have delegated this action to another office, such as the county surveyor’s office, so check with each county to find out where this document is to be recorded. There is a recording fee that accompanies the document. This fee varies from county to county.
A checklist has been prepared (see Exhibit 2-3) to help preparers ensure they include the minimum requirements for recording this document. It is not an all-inclusive list, as additional notes and information may be added to help with the interpretation and understanding of the survey and its purpose. (b) Record of Survey Map Requirements (WSDOT Recommendations)
Records of Survey prepared for WSDOT have multiple purposes and are used by a variety of departments and offices. It is not uncommon for a Record of Survey to be a very pertinent document several years after its completion. To coordinate the variety of uses and potential time span involved, a few standards have been introduced to define the purpose of the survey, with additional data to provide for a consistent interpretation of the document.
Some of the additional requirements are to help archive and allow easy retrieval of the document. Others are to help with a consistent interpretation after time has elapsed and allow the user to follow or understand differences discovered while performing the survey. This will be especially helpful if the surveyor or the surveyor’s records are not available to answer or resolve questions.

200.02(9) Coordinates: Maps Showing Control Network Scheme Required (RCW 58.09.070) (a) If a Record of Survey displays Washington State Plane Coordinates (SPCs), it must have a control network schematic identifying the network used to control the survey. (b) Use a control network scheme diagram to show how the SPCs were determined from the known base points (see Exhibit 2-4). A statement such as “the WSRN network was used” is acceptable if it includes the base stations and calibration points used. Base stations vary in reliability, so a statement regarding which base stations were used is necessary for repeatability.

Monumentation Map 200.03(1) Introduction
The purpose of a Monumentation Map is to show the right of way baseline with ties to General
Land Office (GLO) corners for future retracements of said baseline.
A Monumentation Map is intended to be a survey document that focuses on the alignment monuments that have been set during or after construction and their relationship to the project control points, GLO corners, property corners, road intersection points, and so on.
A Monumentation Map may be certified by either a Professional Land Surveyor or a Professional
Engineer (RCW 58.09). Although state law allows a Professional Engineer to certify certain survey documents, the Professional Engineer’s authority is limited by practice and staying within the limits of the project. Although the Monumentation Map is typically filed with the county engineer’s office, the filing requirements of this document vary from county to county. It is best to contact the county engineer’s office, surveyor’s office, or auditor’s office to determine filing requirements and fees for that specific county.

200.03(2) Type 1 Monumentation Map
A Type 1 Monumentation Map includes a full and complete analysis of the R/W alignment control baseline, including, but not limited to, the baseline’s relationship to pertinent deeds and cadastral ties to the Public Land Survey System.
The Monumentation Map is intended to be a “stand-alone” document. To obtain this “stand­ alone” status, follow the guidelines below. 200.03(3) Type 2 Monumentation Map
The primary purpose of a Type 2 Monumentation Map is to identify existing monumentation and to coordinate said monumentation with the State Plane Coordinate System (NAD 83/91) or current datum. A copy of the Type 2 Monumentation Map can be used as part of the application to destroy or remove a survey monument.
The Type 2 Monumentation Map is intended to serve as a monument inventory tool. A Type 2
Monumentation Map shall clearly state on the face of the document that no analysis was performed. All geodetic coordinates shall be derived by survey methods, and all plan data will be taken from existing and approved Right of Way Plans.
Page 2-8
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 2
Survey Records
If monumentation is found to be on a construction alignment and is related to cadastral ties, it must be clearly noted on the face of the Type 2 Monumentation Map that said monumentation may not have a direct correlation to the Right of Way baseline.
For future use and benefit, it would be advantageous for the construction contract number to be identified on the Type 2 Monumentation Map plan showing the monuments identified on the plan sheets.
The Monumentation Map is intended to be a “stand-alone” document. To obtain this “stand­ alone” status, follow the guidelines below. Refer to Exhibit 2-3 for a checklist of mapping elements to be included on the Monumentation Map.
Use Exhibit 2-1 as a guide to determine which type of Monumentation Map is needed for your project.

If it has been determined that a monumentation map is necessary, it is the responsibility of the region to assemble data and prepare a Monumentation Map for locating and defining the centerline alignment or geodetic monument location in its mathematical position within the Public
Land Survey System. 200.03(6) English Units Only
Monumentation Maps are to be prepared in English units only. 200.03(7) Alignment
For a Type 1 Monumentation Map, the R/W centerline, from which the right of way is to be legally described, is shown as a continuous solid line for the full length of the project, with its alignment data shown. The retracement alignment will be shown on the Type 1 Monumentation
Map. If the R/W centerline is being retraced and the alignment data varies from plan data, both original and retraced alignment data is shown. If a new Right of Way Plan is to be prepared, additional sheets will be added to the Monumentation Map showing corrections to stationing and other plan anomalies discovered, to conform to Division 1 of the Plans Preparation Manual (see Exhibits 2-2a and 2-2b).

Division 2
The existing stationing must be tied to the new centerline stationing by station and/or bearing equations.
R/W width data will not be shown on the Type 1 Monumentation Map.
For all Monumentation Maps, the R/W centerline is shown as a continuous solid line for the full length of the project. A rotation note or Bearing Equation should be included on the
Monumentation Map to provide an angular adjustment from the approved R/W plans to the
State Plane Coordinate data used to prepare the Monumentation Map.
No alignment analysis or adjustments are performed on the centerline. Right of way width data will not be shown on the Type 2 Monumentation Map. 200.03(8) Control Features
Where such features exists, the Monumentation Map shall show, but not be limited to: government subdivision corners, platted subdivisions, donation land claims, national park or forest boundaries, Indian reservations, farm units, and property corners. A Type 1
Monumentation Map centerline retracement alignment will show at least two bearing and distance ties from the new R/W centerline, with stations noted, to an existing and recorded monument or government subdivision corner, particularly the monuments from which the title reports originate.
A Type 2 Monumentation Map will make a reference to the existing Right of Way Plan for ties to the GLO corners.

200.03(9) Survey Report
A Survey Report is a summary of all the main elements that were used to generate the
Monumentation Map or other survey documents. The purpose of the Survey Report is to provide documentation of the controlling elements of decisions throughout the project. A separate file folder should be kept with the project folder summarizing those elements. This
Survey Report will become the basis of the Narrative, which may be placed on the
Monumentation Map.
A Survey Report is not required as part of the preparation of a Monumentation Map. However, it is highly recommended that such a report be prepared in the event a question ever arises regarding the survey, so that an answer may be determined by the surveyor (or another if the surveyor is not available).
A copy of the Survey Report shall be archived in the Survey/_SurveyDoc folder of the Standard
CAE_Project folder structure. This will ensure all survey documentation regarding alignment decisions, datums, control monuments, secondary control monuments, and other relevant information is available to current and future users of the plans.
Documentation should include, but not be limited to: • Horizontal and vertical datums identified.
Page 2-10

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 2
Survey Records • Horizontal and vertical control points identified. • Control network points identified with a sketch. • Sketches and/or photos of control points. • State Plane Coordinates to Project Datum worksheets. • List of Records of Survey/Land Corner Records, RR maps, and other reference material. • List of WSDOT Right of Way Plans. • List of deeds and other property rights documents. • Sketches and/or photos of alignment monuments. • Monuments identified as potential disturbances to the project. • Summary of all GLO monuments held or rejected, with supporting evidence. • Sketches of conflicting information that supports decisions. • Summaries of key determinations critical to resolution of alignments. • Basis of Bearings monuments identified. • Basis of Stationing identified. 200.03(10)
Narrative for Both Type 1 and Type 2 Monumentation Maps
The Narrative is an optional explanation added to the Monumentation Map. The purpose of the
Narrative is to provide a medium in which the surveyor is able to provide additional explanation regarding how final determinations were made, which may be difficult to show graphically.
Circumstances may dictate whether a Narrative is to be written, but it is recommended that one be prepared for all Monumentation Maps. 200.03(11)
Monumentation Map Details
RCW 58.09 and RCW 18.43 allow survey maps and documents to be certified by a Professional
Land Surveyor or a Professional Engineer.
The Monumentation Map’s main focus is the right of way centerline alignment. Right of way limits may vary during negotiations and revisions, but the right of way centerline alignment does not fluctuate as often as the corridor’s right of way limits.
Mapping of a Type 1 or Type 2 Monumentation Map will be very similar to a Record of Survey.
The Type 2 Monumentation Map will typically show the monuments found and a State Plane
Coordinate for that point. (a) Map Requirements
The county recording official's information block may vary within each county. Confirm all county filing or recording information before submitting documents for filing. A fee may or may not be required. Check with the county engineer’s office or the county auditor’s office to determine whether a filing or recording fee must accompany the Monumentation Map.

Record (LCR) is being referenced indicating the monument found. If a GLO monument is found that is not noted on a previous ROS, then a Land Corner Record shall also be prepared. 200.03(13)
Coordinates: Control Network Scheme Required (RCW 58.09.070)

(a) If a Monumentation Map displays Washington State Plane Coordinates (SPCs), it must have a control network schematic identifying the network used to control the survey. (b) Use a control network scheme diagram to show how the SPCs were determined from the known base points (see Exhibit 2-4). A statement such as “the WSRN network was used” is acceptable if it includes the base stations and calibration points used. Base stations vary in reliability, so a statement regarding which base stations were used is necessary for repeatability. (c) Datum defined: RCW 58.20.120 states that the Washington Coordinate System of 1983 is the designated coordinate system in Washington. • WAC 332-130-060 and WAC 332-130-070 define the use of the datum tag and epoch date to be reported. • As adjustments by NGS to the North American Datum (NAD) of 1983 continue to refine the geoid model, it is important to note which datum is being used. In order to prevent datum crossovers or mixing of datums, the adjustment year must be indicated on the

State Land Plats 200.04(1) General
Land Plats are required when a highway facility crosses state-owned property under the jurisdiction of DNR or when WSDOT must obtain materials from such land. Land Plats are requested by HQ Real Estate Services. They are prepared by the HQ Survey Support Section and processed through HQ Real Estate Services, and they conform to the final Right of Way Plan.
All survey data required to prepare the Land Plat will be provided by the regions: datum, horizontal and vertical control monuments, references, electronic data file, and DGN base map files. Additional survey information may be necessary due to the type of plat required.
Additional information regarding water rights is usually needed to determine shorelands and bedlands.
Stations and offset dimensions are required for both right of way lines and the centerline where they enter and leave each section under DNR’s jurisdiction. The total area, right of way acquisition, and remainder for each 40-acre tract, as well as Basis of Bearings and any coordinate system used, are also required. Ties to all subdivision corners are required, whether they are calculated or found. The plat must conform to the GLO plats and/or any other recorded surveys. Copies of any recorded surveys or plats can be obtained from the DNR Public Land
Survey Office in Olympia.
The Land Plat is intended to be a “stand-alone” document. To obtain this “stand-alone” status, follow the guidelines below.

Permit to Remove or Destroy
The Application to Remove or Destroy a Survey Monument is an official state permit required by
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to remove a survey monument. Guidance in preparing this document is provided by DNR. Any survey monument that is inaccessible (including survey monuments that are covered for a short period of time) is considered destroyed. The permits are permanently filed at DNR in Olympia. A completion report indicating that the survey monument has been replaced or permanently removed is also required.
The Permit to Remove a Survey or Monument is intended to be a “stand-alone” document. To obtain this “stand-alone” status, follow the guidelines below. 200.05(1) References

It is the responsibility of the region to assemble data and prepare an Application to Remove or
Destroy a Survey Monument. A Survey Map, Record of Survey, or a Type 1 or Type 2
Monumentation Map may be prepared as an exhibit indicating the location, type, and record of each survey monument. Headquarters Survey Support will provide assistance when requested by the region. Permits to remove or destroy a survey monument are not required to be approved by Headquarters. 200.05(3) English Units Only
Application sketches and drawings are to be prepared in English U.S. Survey feet only. 200.05(4) Alignment
If a survey map is prepared as an exhibit to the application, the right of way centerline and alignment data shall be shown. Station and offsets to all survey monuments shown on the face of the survey map should also be shown. A bearing and distance tie may be shown when appropriate. 200.05(5) Control Features
The Application to Remove or Destroy a Survey Monument shall show, but not be limited to:
GPS network points, government subdivision corners, platted subdivisions, donation land claims, national park or forest boundaries, Indian reservations, farm units, and property corners. All control features may be detailed on a Record of Survey or on either a Type 1 or Type 2
Monumentation Map.
Another option, a separate diagram for each monument showing the station and offset to the right of way alignment, description of the monument, and reference monuments with distance and angle ties to reference monuments, may be provided. All reference monuments should be outside the established work zone to prevent accidental disturbance of these reference points.
A State Plane Coordinate may be counted as one of the reference points.
The number of reference monuments required perpetuating a monument will depend on the purpose of the monument. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has varied requirements depending on the corner monument’s purpose (for guidelines, see the BLM manual, sections 4­
93 to 4-113). DNR follows these requirements for all General Land Office corners. The number of reference monuments set for all other monuments will be determined by the project environment during and after construction, the length of time the monument will be removed, and other factors determined by the surveyor.
Geodetic monuments are maintained by the HQ GeoMetrix Office, which shall: • Be notified when the work zone has been determined.
Page 2-18

Survey Records • Be notified of all geodetic monuments within the proposed work zone for appropriate action • Make the decision to destroy or reset these monuments. 200.05(6) Coordinates: Control Scheme Required (RCW 58.09.070) (a) The application form requests that a State Plane Coordinate (SPC) on all associated monuments be noted on the form. A statement of how the SPCs were derived shall also be on the form. (b) Datum defined: RCW 58.20.120 states that the Washington Coordinate System of 1983 is the designated coordinate system in Washington. • WAC 332-130-060 and WAC 332-130-070 define the use of the datum tag and epoch date to be reported. • As adjustments by NGS to the North American Datum of 1983 model continue to refine the geoid model, it is important to note which datum is actually being used. In order to prevent datum crossovers or mixing of datums, the adjustment year must be shown on the Permit to Remove or Destroy a Monument. (c) If project datum coordinates were used to produce the Permit to Remove or Destroy a Monument, provide a table or worksheet showing the calculations converting SPCs to project data and store in the Survey Report file. 200.05(7) Recording Coordinates
When reference has been made to State Plane Coordinates, the scale, elevation, and combined factors shall be stated for the survey lines used in computing ground distances and areas. 200.05(8) Drawing Standards
All Permits to Remove or Destroy a Survey Monument shall be accompanied by a Record of
Survey, Monumentation Map, and Construction Alignment sheet, with all monuments identified or individual sketches provided of each monument. Space is provided on the form space is limited as should be reserved for single monument removal applications.
Drafting standards shall meet the requirements of 200.2(11). All individual sketches will be neat and concise, and will clearly note all monuments and reference dimensions. Sketches do not have to be drawn to scale. 200.05(9) Metric Equivalent

This Division of the Plans Preparation Manual provides guidance and instructions for preparing contract plans for WSDOT projects. The contents of this Division can be applied to the majority of the projects designers will encounter. It is understood that no two projects are the same and that it is not possible to provide information for every circumstance that may be encountered.
There will be those projects, or portions of projects, that do not fit the standard applications. In those cases, recognize the need to adjust the standards to best depict the work to be accomplished.
This Division shows representative information and examples to use as a basis to make decisions on what is to be included in the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E), and how it is to be shown in the plans. The main objective is to assemble a thorough package that contains the precise information required by a contractor to submit a responsive bid and for WSDOT to get an acceptable finished product. Providing too much information can, at times, cause as many problems as not providing enough. Contract Plans need to be biddable, buildable and maintainable. Contract Plans include only that information necessary for the contractor to properly bid and construct (biddable and buildable) a project. Information intended for WSDOT inspectors should not be included, as contract plans are for the contractor, not the engineer. In addition, where appropriate, consolidate and reduce plan sheets. Projects requiring contractor surveying will require more detail and information than a project being surveyed by WSDOT.

400.01(1)
Contract Plans and Provisions
The Plans, Specifications, and Estimates are some of the documents required for the advertisement of a project.
The Contract Plans and Contract Provisions must set forth the work in a clear and concise manner to avoid misinterpretation.
The Contract Plans are to conform to the geometric design as documented in the Design
Approval (DA), the Project Development Approval (PDA) package, and the Design
Documentation Package (DDP). (See the Design Manual Chapter 300 for more information.)
All plan details and Contract Provisions are to be specific to the project being developed. It is acceptable to use details and provisions from previous contracts. They should be examined closely and modified as required to ensure they are specific to the current project.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-1

Contract Plans
Division 4
Deviations from Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) policies and standard practices require approval by the appropriate approving authority, in accordance with the Design Manual, well in advance of advertisement of the project, during project development.
Coordinate design schedules early with all specialty groups involved with the project. Involve the
Headquarters (HQ) Bridge and Structures Office when structures are involved to ensure the project will be completed in a timely manner. Real Estate Services and Environmental are also critical to meeting project ad dates. Understanding specialty groups schedules, to incorporate into your project schedule is of vital importance.
Avoid duplication within the Contract Plans and Provisions. Information that is contained in the
Contract Plans does not belong in the Provisions. Information that is contained in the Provisions does not belong in the Contract Plans.
Reduce the volume of the plans by using logical combinations of plan series to best display the information. Displaying unnecessary or duplicative information may cause confusion during bidding, resulting in higher bid prices. A series of plan sheets with minimal information, makes it difficult to coordinate different items of work. This could also lead to increased prices by bidders estimating the project. Complete and accurate information on the correct series of plan sheets is what creates biddable and buildable contract plan sets.
Standards are not developed to stifle design, but to provide consistency across the state. We strive for consistent use of state standards, regardless of where the project is located. We also recognize that unique situations may require varying from the standards. When standard materials are called for, the contractors and the suppliers know what is needed and what to expect for testing and approvals. When the same work is specified and represented in the plans the same way, the contractors develop an understanding of our expectations. Using standard items and construction methods is almost always more economical. Proprietary items should be avoided unless there is proper justification.
Review guidance and checklists
Use the Plans Preparation checklist to organize and ensure items required for the project are included.
For reviewing items needed for your completed project, use the Plans, Specifications and
Estimates checklist. This checklist contains the type of information that will be examined during the Stewardship Process Review, conducted by Headquarters and the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) at the end of the project.
Contact your Region Plans office for a region specific checklist.

Office at the time of their delivery. If for some reason the scope of the project has changed so dramatically that the official project title must be changed, the title change must be negotiated with and agreed to by the Region Program Management Office and the Region Plans Office. v) Provide justification and obtain approval from the HQ Construction Office or current delegated authority in each region for use of nonstandard time for project completion specifications. w) Provide justification and obtain early endorsement, then approval from the HQ
Construction Office Assistant State Construction Engineer for using project-specific specifications that alter the Standard Specifications or revise, delete, replace or supplement any General Special Provisions (GSPs) or any Region General Special
Provisions beyond the fill-ins. x) Coordinate early with the Region Traffic Office on the preparation of all signal, illumination, ITS, and other design elements needed to be incorporated in the PS&E preparation. y) Ensure the Contract Plans/Contract Provisions are stamped in accordance with WSDOT
Executive Order E 1010, Certification of Documents by Licensed Professionals, and
Appendix 2, Applying Professional Stamps. z) Check the current Design Documentation Checklist and Project File Checklist for additional reports or requirements that apply to the project.

400.02(2)
Alterations to Plans and Project Specifications
Alterations to plans or specifications should be performed and sealed by the person who originally sealed them. They may be performed and sealed by a different licensed professional acting within their area of expertise if necessary. Licensed professionals who sealed the original documents shall be notified of changes to their work that are considered practice of engineering and shall be given an opportunity to review and comment, if possible. Licensed professional engineers who are no longer WSDOT employees or who are not available through a consultant services agreement need not be notified of changes to their work.
Changes regarding quantities, payment estimates, time lines, etc., are typically not considered technical changes or practice of engineering and therefore would not require sealing by a licensed professional. Changes not considered technical changes or practice of engineering should still be reviewed by the original designer/submitter of that item of work and should not be changed by the Project Manager without the specific permission of the original designer/submitter. 400.03
Headquarters Assistance/Review
Various offices of expertise are available for assistance if requested by the region. For examples of transmittal memos to Headquarters or region support offices, contact your Region Plans
Office for assistance.

Drafting Requirements 400.04(1)
General
How the plan information is displayed on the plan sheets impacts the usefulness of the plans. To get the best possible bid and the best possible finished product, the plans must present the information clearly and concisely. Everyone who examines the plans should be able to determine what work is required and arrive at a single interpretation of the information.
To ensure a clear and singular interpretation: • Avoid overcrowding of plan sheets by displaying only information relevant to the plan series. • Draw the plans with appropriate drafting standards as specified in this manual and the
Electronic Engineering Data Standards Manual.
Determine what information is required for the contractor to bid and construct the project and for WSDOT to administer the project. The requirements of other readers such as FHWA and various Headquarter offices also need to be considered. Many of the requirements in this manual, such as “Begin Federal Aid” and “End Federal Aid” Number and Section Lines shown on the Vicinity Map, may not be required to construct or administer the project but have value to other users of the Contract Plans.
Determine what information does not add value, creates clutter on the plans and confusion for the reader. Following are some examples of information that should not be included in plan sheets and some ways to help eliminate excess plan sheets: • Alignment and R/W Plans where no changes in alignment and R/W are planned or where the alignment and R/W staking is being conducted and maintained by WSDOT. • Quantity Tabulations for all items of work or where only a few items of work are listed.

Page 4-8
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans • Right of way lines that have no ties add no value. If right of way needs to be shown, it should have ties showing where it is. • Future alignments that have nothing to do with construction of the project can clutter a plan sheet making it hard to find the needed information. • Showing existing pavement markings/edge of existing roadway on Paving Plans or
Pavement Marking Plans. • Showing items slated for removal on a Site Preparation Plan and not anywhere else in the plans. • Repeating plan sheets just to keep the same number of sheets in each series. Use break lines to eliminate sheets of nonchanging information. If there is no drainage code on a
Drainage Plan sheet, the sheet shouldn’t be included in the series. Also, for Paving Plans and Pavement Marking Plans, if nothing changes between intersections or interchanges, use break lines to eliminate sheets. • Whenever possible, avoid the practice of cross-hachuring, patterning, or shading of large areas to represent areas to be paved, planed, or anything else. The roadway sections should adequately show the areas to be planed and paved. The use of large areas of crosshachuring could hide or detract information being displayed on the sheet. • Profile sheets showing overlay, grinding and inlay, or paving exception areas of the project add no value. Show only the portions of the project that have a change in the vertical alignment of the roadway under construction. In the same way repeating information already shown on roadway sections on paving plans without showing dimensions adds no value to the contract.
If it does not provide needed information or add value to the plans—REMOVE IT!
The following section provides general rules for showing dimensions and data on contract plans. 400.04(1)(a)
Displaying Dimensions and Data
Our engineering applications produce roadway designs to high levels of precision. This is beneficial in design; however, these levels of precision are often unnecessary in construction.
This section provides general information for displaying dimensions and data on contract plans.
Generally, show a dimension, station, offset, etc. only to a level of precision being sought and avoid adding decimals or extra trailing zeros when it is not necessary. This represents a more achievable, constructible level of precision to the contractor.
Understanding that there will be exceptions, apply the following basic rules for displaying dimensions and data on plans.
Roadway Sections •

Horizontal elements, lane and shoulder widths – show in feet. If a horizontal dimension is to the nearest foot, then display the dimension as a whole number.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-9 Contract Plans

Examples: an 11-foot lane is shown as 11’ not 11.0’. If the lane width is 11.6’, then show as such; do not round it to 12’. •
Station limits – round to the nearest foot when practicable. If the roadway section goes to the bridge seat, use the bridge seat station. •
Materials depths – generally shown to hundredth of foot, as in: 0.25’
Plans •
Stations and offsets – show to the nearest foot; omit trailing decimal zeroes where practicable. As an example: if a Right of Way (R/W) offset is at Station L 14+00.00 with an offset of 60.00’ show as L 14+00 at 60’. •
Horizontal control points on plans, including begin and end of project, centerlines, R/W centerline, baselines, and intersections – show in feet to 2 decimal places.

•
Display alignment bearings, and delta angles for curve data in degrees, minutes, and seconds, rounded to the nearest second.
Profiles
Vertical alignment control points, (BVC, PVI, EVC) stations and elevations in feet to 2 decimal places.
Profile Grades display in percent to as few decimal places as possible. Very long grades may need to be to 4 decimal places for the math to work.
Drainage profiles proposed flow lines– display stations and elevations in feet to 2 decimal places.
Manhole tops and grate stations and elevations – display in feet to 1 or 2 decimal places.
Ditch elevations – display in feet to 1 decimal place (to nearest 0.05 when controlled by percent of grade). 400.04(2)
Plan Sheets
Early in the design process, determine the different series of plan sheets that will be required and the information that will need to be displayed on each series.
Using the appropriate levels of the computer-aided drafting and design (CAD) system allows the flexibility to provide additional series of plans easily and quickly if it turns out that more information is required than was originally anticipated. For this reason, it is important that all
CAD work use the prescribed level scheme. (a) Most of the drawings created by CAD users in a design office are 11-inch by 17-inch plan sheets for PS&E. References will pertain to that size unless otherwise noted. In general, the plotting scale for 11-inch by 17-inch plan sheets is 1 inch equals 100 feet (1"=100'), except as indicated below. Set the plotting scale in MicroStation under the WSDOT pull down menu.

Contract Plans
There may be occasions when the scale of a plan sheet needs to be increased to as much as 1"=40' for an 11-inch by 17-inch plan sheet. When this is done, examine the sheet to be sure that required information is easily read. It may be necessary to resize some text or symbols to make them legible. (b) Print plan sheets to PDF unless otherwise directed. (c) Draw Vicinity Maps at a scale appropriate to the size of the project and the detail required to show the appropriate information, as discussed in 400.06(4). (d) Sheets requiring a larger scale to display a great deal of information in a small area should be drawn to an appropriate scale to allow all information to be easily read and understood. (e) Draw strip maps at a scale appropriate to display the information clearly. (f) Use cross-hachuring only for small, isolated areas of work such as pavement repair areas or butt joint planing locations that may get lost if not displayed in this manner. On occasion, with concurrence of the Region Plans Office, color may be used for clarity. Gray-area shading is reserved exclusively for use in an addendum to highlight changes to a plan sheet. (See Appendix 5 for Addendum Preparation.) (g) All screened (half-toned) portions of plan sheets must be dark enough to adequately reproduce in the typical deliverable PDF format. (h) Follow the drafting standards for line weight, lettering height, and symbols for Contract contained in the Electronic Engineering Data Standards Manual. It is important to conform to these standards for consistency and for reproduction. (i) Under most circumstances, place lettering and dimensioning so they may be read from either the bottom of the sheet or the right side of the sheet. Do not place text across roadway centerlines or right of way lines. Text is to be clear of all lines and should normally be placed outside the drawing itself. Draw leader lines so they do not cross one another or text. The two exceptions to the bottom and right reading text are: 1. All Section Corner and Township line numbers are to have their tops to the north, and
Range Line numbers are to have their tops to the west, regardless of the orientation of north to the sheet. 2. All information identifying a centerline, such as line designation, stationing, tick marks, and bearings, are to be placed on top of the line and read left to right, with both the top of the line and left to right being based on the direction of the stationing. (j) When lines are coincidental, use the following order of precedence for placing them on the sheet: 1. Construction Centerline 2. Right of Way Centerline 3. Range/Township Line 4. Section Line 5. Corporate Limit Line 6. County Line
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-11 Contract Plans
Division 4 (k) When Corporate Limit lines coincide with other lines, label the Corporate Limits in an effort to clarify that the line is also the corporate limits. (l) Provide a north arrow and a scale bar on each plan view sheet. The north arrow will normally be oriented towards either the top or right side of the sheet. (m) On all plan view sheets and profile sheets that physically show the Begin Project and End
Project headings, identify these points as follows:
STATE-FUNDED PROJECTS:
Begin Project

End Project
SR XX, MP XX.XX
STA XX+XX.XX
FEDERALLY -FUNDED PROJECTS:
Begin F.A. No.
End F.A. No.
SR XX MP XX.XX (n) If the “Begin and/or End Federal Aid” are different than the “Begin and/or End Project,” display this information similar to the above on a separate leader line drawn to the appropriate location. Use “Begin Construction” and “End Construction” when work is being done on crossroads adjacent to the main line work or at ramp termini. (o) Provide a legend on all plan view sheets (such as site preparation, drainage, paving, and others) showing features applicable to that series. (p) The legend is to contain all items that are shown on any of the individual plan sheets in that series. For example, if your Drainage Plan series consists of 15 plan sheets, and throughout these 15 plan sheets there are 12 items to be identified in the legend, all 15 of the drainage plan sheets in this series will have a legend that will have all 12 items listed and identified. (q) If a sheet in the series is too crowded to include a legend, add a note to the sheet to tell the reader on which sheet the legend may be found. The preferred method is to refer the reader to the legend on the preceding sheet. (r) WSDOT Contract Plans show the slope of a line in several forms, such as ratio, percentage, and decimal. When a slope is shown in ratio form in WSDOT plans, it is shown as run over rise, which is opposite of mathematical standards in which a slope is always given as rise over run in ratio and fraction form. In WSDOT plans, a 4:1 slope means that the slope has a 4-foot horizontal run and a 1-foot vertical rise. Some WSDOT manuals further clarify the meaning of a 4:1 slope by adding a post text, such as 4H:1V, to further clarify that there are four units horizontal (run) and one unit vertical (rise). Do not use this method on WSDOT
Contract Plans.

Drafting standards for building facilities and associated site improvements are determined by the Facilities Administrator. 400.05
Plan Sheet Sizes and Layout Format 400.05(1)
General Requirements (a) Provide the Advertisement set of plans on 11-inch by 17-inch sheets. See the Electronic
Engineering Data Standards (EEDS) Manual Deliverables 7. (b) If the Contract Plans have more than 225 sheets or Contract Provisions have more than 225 pages, they will need to be separated into volumes, with no volume having more than 225 sheets or pages. • The break for volumes is to be made at a logical point in the package, which may not be at 225 sheets or pages. • If a project has 275 plan sheets, and the last 80 are bridge sheets, the logical break would be between the civil sheets and the bridge sheets. • If multiple volumes are required for the Contract Provisions, the logical break would be at the end of a main section. For example, break between HOT MIX ASPHALT
PAVEMENT and the following main section, CULVERTS. • Do not place the break in the middle of a section. (c) Stamping: WSDOT plans and specifications are to be stamped with a seal, signature, and the date signed; the expiration date of the license is optional. WSDOT has established a statewide process for applying professional stamps to plan sets that allows full electronic delivery. Use Appendix 2, Applying Professional Stamps, to follow the WSDOT method and instructions to apply digital professional stamps to contract plans. This also applies to consultants developing projects for WSDOT. Licensees are directed to WSDOT Executive

Assembling Plans
The following outline is the sequence to follow when assembling plans for a construction project. It is a list of possible plan sheets and is not intended to represent a project. 400.06(1)(a) 1. Index. 2. Certification Sheet(s). 3. Vicinity Map. 4. Summary of Quantities. 5. Borrow, pit, quarry, stockpile, waste sites, and reclamation plans. 6. Roadway sections: main roadway, ramps, frontage roads, detours, others. 7. Grading sections, if applicable. 8. Stage construction plans, if applicable. 9. Alignment or Alignment/Right of Way. 10. Quantity Tabulation sheets (Q-tabs). These sheets will be placed immediately prior to the plan sheets showing the work being tabulated, such as site preparation items, temporary erosion and sediment control (TESC) items, guardrail items, and traffic items. 11. Site Preparation. Existing topography and removal and demolition work may be shown on
Alignment Plans; however, if extensive details are required and the plan sheet becomes too crowded, it should be on a separate series.

Division 4 12. Existing Utilities. This is an extension of the Site Preparation Plan and is only required if the existing utilities are so extensive that they cannot be clearly shown on the Site Preparation
Plan. 13. Roadway profiles—normally only required when grade is being revised. 14. Environmental Compliance Plans (ECP) – required for various disciplines that meet regulatory triggers. 15. TESC Plans—may not be required if work is minor and can be combined with Drainage Plans or other plan sheets. Refer to Division 7 for information on when a TESC Plan is required. 16. TESC details. 17. Drainage structure notes—will precede plan series showing drainage features. 18. Drainage Plans—may not be required if work is minor and can be combined with another series of plans. 19. Drainage profiles—will follow plan series showing drainage features. 20. Drainage details. 21. Stream Plans. 22. Stream Profiles. 23. Stream Details. 24. Utility Structure Note sheets—only required if there is work to be done by the contractor on existing utilities. 25. Utility Plans—only required if there is work to be done by the contractor on existing utilities. 26. Utility details—only required if there is work to be done by the contractor on existing utilities. 27. Irrigation Structure Note sheets. 28. Irrigation Plans. 29. Irrigation details. 30. Landscape, wetland, rest areas, roadside restoration, and viewpoints. 31. Interchange contours. 32. Paving Plans are required for overlay projects when paving breaks, paving dimensions, intersection paving, taper lengths, dimensions of taper widths, and so on, can’t be shown adequately on the roadway sections. In this case, the Roadway Sections, Paving Plans, and
Paving Detail sheets are to be prepared in conjunction with each other to show all paving work. 33. Paving details. 34. Curb ramp plans. 35. Minor structures such as retaining walls. 36. Illumination Plans—may be shown on Paving Plans if illumination is minor and Paving Plan will not be too crowded.

Division 4
Contract Plans 37. Illumination details—will follow plan series showing illumination layout. 38. Traffic Signal Plans. 39. Traffic signal details. 40. Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Plans. 41. ITS details. 42. Sign Specification sheets—will precede the plan series showing the signing. 43. Signing Plans—may be shown on Paving Plans if signing is minor and Paving Plans will not be too crowded. 44. Signing details—will follow plan series showing signing. 45. Bridges and other structures. 46. Building plans and details. 47. Traffic Control Plans. 48. Detour routes and detour signing. If the detour is simple and straightforward, this information may be shown on the Vicinity Map, if the additional information does not detract from the Vicinity Map. 400.06(2)
Plan Sheets
Determine the actual plan sheets required to best depict the project. Verify the order of plan sheets to determine what is or isn’t required. A basic P1 paver will normally not require as many sheets as a project that has safety, mobility and paving work. When two or more projects are merged into one project, the plan sheet sequence will be followed. Even with logical combinations of plan sheet series, maintain the following basic order of sheets: • Item information: Quantity Tabulation/Structure Note/Sign Specification. • Plan series: The series showing the items of work described on the Quantity
Tabulation/Structure Note/Sign Specification sheets. • Details: For work associated with items shown on the plan sheets. 400.06(3)
Index
See Contract Plan Examples 4-1 and 4-2.
An index is required for all projects with 30 or more plan sheets. For projects with more than one volume of plan sheets provide a complete project index in each volume.
List the plan sheet titles exactly as they appear on the plan sheets. Avoid sheet titles such as “Miscellaneous Details.” If a sheet contains guardrail and drainage details, use “Guardrail and
Drainage Details” as the sheet title and in the index.
On small projects, and as scale permits, the index can be placed on the Vicinity Map plan sheet.
However, DO NOT reduce your Vicinity Map size to allow you to combine the index and Vicinity
Map as one plan sheet.

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-17 Contract Plans
Division 4
Regardless of the size of the project, it is recommended that Plan Reference Nos. be used on all projects in lieu of plan sheet numbers during the design phase.
Plan sheet numbers are not critical during the design phase of the project. Until the design team leader or region plans reviewer has all the plan sheets for all the separate series (such as paving, drainage, and signing) to be included in the project, the total number of plan sheets to be included in the contract is unknown.
There are several advantages to using Plan Reference Nos. to identify plan sheets for individual series during the design phase: • You do not have to know the total number of plan sheets included in the contract. • Once Plan Reference Nos. have been assigned to individual plan sheets included in a series, these numbers should not have to be changed. This makes referencing details on other plan sheets easy to do and should help eliminate the habit of forgetting to do this. Once the statement “FOR DETAIL, SEE SHEET D12” is placed on the plan sheet, this reference will almost always be correct unless plan sheet D12 is deleted from the contract. • Plan sheets can be inserted or deleted within the series with slight modifications to reference number. For example, a plan sheet that needed to be inserted between D6 and
D7, sheets D7 through the end of the series would need to be renumbered. The use of D6A should be only used in an addendum. (See Appendix 5 for additional information.) 400.06(3a) Certification Sheet
See Contract Plan Example 4-2a.
Insert a sheet after the index titled CERTIFICATION SHEET. Label the first sheet CT1. If there are too many signatures to fit on CT1, then insert sheet CT2, and so on. There is a cell in
MicroStation for the Certification Sheet found using the Place WSDOT Items menu.

400.06(4)
Vicinity Map
See Contract Plan Examples 4-2, 4-3, 4-4, 4-5, and 4-6.
Every project will have a Vicinity Map plan sheet that shows and has labeled all construction centerlines, detours, and haul routes.
Projects may be broken into Sections (see Contract Plan Examples 4-4 and 4-5) when it is required or necessary to split the project into different areas.
This is the logical way of showing the work to be performed, listing quantities, and so on, when all the work involved is not conveniently located in one continuous area with no exceptions or gaps.
If the entire project is on one State Route (SR), but has breaks in the areas where work is to be performed between the Begin Project and End Project, label these breaks “exceptions” or “exception areas.” If there are numerous exceptions or exception areas, an alternate method of showing these exceptions is to label them as “Sections” for the areas where work is to be performed.
Page 4-18
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans

If the project is on multiple SRs, where the work is spread out, it is highly recommended that the work be broken into Sections. When multiple SRs are used in a title, the use smallest SR number followed by et al. to shorten the title.
AN IMPORTANT REMINDER
If the project is broken into Sections, make sure all references to a Section are exactly the same throughout all plan sheet series (Summary of Quantities, Roadway Sections, Quantity Tabulation sheets, Structure Note sheets, Profile sheets, and so on) in the plan set for that Section. Show all exception work areas and gaps identically in all locations and references throughout the
Contract Plans and Provisions.
Show the following on the Vicinity Map when applicable: (a) Project limits, referenced to State Route Mileposts (SRMP) based on the State Highway Log. (b) Stationing at the Begin Project and End Project on the main line and the Begin Construction and End Construction for secondary crossroads. (c) The Begin Project and End Project are defined as follows: • For projects with one applicable State Route, the beginning and ending of any permanent work on the main line highway is assigned as Begin Project and End Project. (d) If the project includes multiple SRs, there is still only one Begin Project and End Project location. Projects with multiple SRs may have a Begin Project on one SR but an End Project on a different SR. Assign Begin Project to the beginning of permanent work at the most westerly or southerly portion of the project, and the End Project to the most easterly or northerly portion, determined by the general direction of the project activities. (e) Begin Construction and End Construction are defined as follows: • The limits of permanent work, such as signing, guardrail, striping, drainage, landscaping, and so on, to be performed on city, county, or state roadways not on the project main line, included in the contract. (f) The Begin and End of Federal Funding with referenced by Federal-Aid Number, milepost, and stationing. The federal funding limits will most often be the same as the project limits, but will cover all work. (g) All equations and exceptions on the Vicinity Map. If the scale of the Vicinity Map is such that equations can be shown with headers and leader lines to the approximate point where the equation is located (by stationing), this is the preferred method to identify the equation. If there is insufficient room on the Vicinity Map itself (because of scale) to clearly identify the equation and exception areas, they may be shown in tabular form (data box) on the Vicinity
Map plan sheet. (h) The distance in miles from the beginning of project (Begin Project) to the nearest city or town and in the opposite direction from the other end of the project (End Project) to the nearest city or town. Do not use “local” descriptions such as “10 miles to EZ Corners.” If the nearest city or town is shown on the WSDOT highway map, it should be familiar enough to
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-19 Contract Plans
Division 4 be used for this purpose. Use the destination arrow with a mile value. The city or town is to be one that is shown on the State highway map. (i) The overall layout of the main line, ramps, frontage roads, county roads and city streets if they are important to the project. Do not show county roads and city streets just to “fill up” the sheet. As with all plan series, delete anything that does not add value to the plan sheet or that provides detail or information that the contractor does not need. DO NOT LABEL
LOCAL BUSINESSES ON THE VICINITY MAP. (j) Scale bar. Select a scale large enough to easily identify all construction lines and appropriate local and private streets or roadways. In addition to including the scale bar, the scale of the plan sheet, detail, and so on, will also be shown in text underneath the scale bar. (k) Material sites, waste sites, stockpile sites, and haul routes will be shown. Do not reduce the scale of the Vicinity Map so that these sites can be shown to scale. If they are too far removed from the project to be shown at the scale appropriate for the Vicinity Map, they can be shown in a separate box in a corner of the Vicinity Map sheet at a smaller scale.
Show the haul route from the site to the highway, and the distance in miles from the site to the nearest point on the project will be shown or noted. (l) Named features such as railroads, waterways, and streams, as well as overcrossing and underpassing roadways. Include railroads running parallel to the project and adjacent to the right of way. If the railroad crosses through the project, state whether or not the intersection with the rail line is at grade. (m) Wetland and wetland mitigation sites are to be shown on the Vicinity Map. Enlarge sections of the Vicinity Map, if needed, to make wetland and wetland mitigation sites visible. (n) Identify each bridge found within the Project Limits on Vicinity Map as follows: • For existing bridges, identify the bridge by bridge number and the type of bridge work.
Examples of the most common types of work are: WIDENING, BRIDGE REMOVAL,
BRIDGE WIDENING, RAIL RETROFIT, MILL/FILL, CONCRETE OVERLAY, HMA OVERLAY,
BST (Bituminous Surface Treatment), NEW APPROACH SLAB, SEISMIC RETROFIT,
BRIDGE REPAIR, UTILITY ATTACHMENT, and SIGN BRACKET. • When there is no contract work on an existing bridge and the contract work does not affect a bridge, or the work is beyond the end of the bridge (such as guardrail transitions attached to the bridge barrier), then identify the bridge number and include “NOT INCLUDED IN PROJECT” as the type of work. • For new bridges, a bridge number is not available at the time of PS&E preparation.
Show the project stationing at the beginning of the bridge, and include “NEW BRIDGE” as the type of work. (o) Cadastral (Township, Range, and Section) information: •

Page 4-20
Identify Township and Range Lines if they fall within the limits shown on the Vicinity
Map.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans •
If Township and Range Lines do not fall within the limits shown on the Vicinity Map, show the Township and Range information at the top center of plan. •
Section Lines with associated Section Corners, with Section Numbers. On small projects, or larger scale Vicinity Maps, this may require the use of break lines to bring the corners within the limits shown. If the corners are found, show the ties to centerline. If there are no Section Corners within the limits shown, a quarter or sixteenth Section Line can be shown and the cadastral information (Township, Range, and Section) given to indicate location. (p) Primary control points are displayed in their coordinate location and labeled with the designation ID only (see Example 4-3). 400.06(5)
Summary of Quantities
See Contract Plan Examples 4-7, 4-8, and 4-9.
The Summary of Quantities sheet provides a complete tabulation of all bid items and pay quantities that have been determined to be required for the project. Enter bid items and quantities into the project estimate via EBASE. The Summary of Quantities Plan sheet is generated from the estimate database by requesting a Summary of Quantities report. Utilization of the program BidTabs Pro provides access to current bid prices for use on the estimate.
Divide the Summary of Quantities into groups and columns within the groups. 400.06(5)(a) Groups
A separate group is required whenever there is a change in: • Program item number (PIN). • Program or subprogram (I2, P1, P2, and so on). • Funding: any change in funding participants, their individual participation rates, or their source of funding. Funding participants may be the FHWA, a state agency or other public agencies, a county, a city, or private organizations. • Control section.
A separate state-funded group (one per project) is required for third-party damages. The bid item “Reimbursement for Third Party Damage” is included in this group; it will be a minimum of $5.00 (see the EBASE User’s Guide.) 400.06(5)(b)

Columns
Each group is required to have at least one column associated with it.
Additional columns within a group are required for the following: 1. Each bridge and structural retaining wall—those covered in Section 6-11 of the Standard
Specifications— to identify the quantities of work at each wall or bridge during construction activities. 2. Each state-furnished pit site (mandatory or not).
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-21 Contract Plans
Division 4
Exceptions allowed for item 1 above: For projects with a single wall, a single bridge, or both, the wall and bridge quantities may be entered into a single column or combined with another column. For projects with multiple walls, if the materials quantities required for each wall are clearly tabulated in the plans, these wall quantities may be entered into a single column or combined with another column in the Summary of Quantities.
In addition, when paving across multiple bridges, the paving quantities need not be separated out for each bridge and may be included in main line paving quantities in the Summary of
Quantities.
Use additional columns within groups to show quantity breakouts for individual construction lines. For example, by using separate columns for the main line, a frontage road, and each ramp, it is much easier to track and make quantity revisions during design, and much easier to track quantities for overruns or underruns during construction, than it is if all the quantities are combined in a single column. 400.06(5)(c) Quantities
The quantities for the following types of items will typically appear only in the Summary of
Quantities: • Lump sum items: LS will appear on the Summary of Quantities for these items; the approximate quantity for lump sum items will appear in the Special Provisions. • Force account items. • Water. • Aeration items. • Structure items, such as bridges and structural retaining walls—although separate Quantity
Tabulation sheets are desirable for structural retaining walls when there is more than one wall in a project. • Borrow materials—unless the conditions noted in Division 7 apply. • Surfacing materials. • Paving materials. • Sign covering. • Sequential arrow sign. • Contractor piloted traffic control. • Traffic control labor. • Construction Signs Class A. • Traffic Control Supervisor. • Traffic control vehicle. • Spill Prevention Plan. • ESC Lead.

Standard Item Table

The Standard Item Table provides key information in the far right column (Item Use Message).
Listed in this column is a statement that specifies what, if anything, needs to be done if this bid item is used in the project. Some of the statements that are listed in this column are as follows:
STANDARD ITEM •
Indicates bid item is a standard item and is covered in the Standard Specifications.
Standard Specification 7-01.5 “Payment” shows standard items can also include fill-ins. •
The “Standard Item Table” will note “Standard Item” in the far right column “item use”. •
Decide whether information concerning this bid item, as addressed in the Standard
Specifications, is sufficient or whether a “project-specific provision” is required.
REQUIRES SPECIAL PROV.
If one of the following is needed: •

Revise the appropriate section or sections in the Standard Specifications other than a fill-in. •
Supplement the appropriate section or sections in the Standard Specifications other than a fill-in. •
Write a “stand-alone” project-specific specification when the Standard Specifications does not contain: Description, Materials, Construction Requirements, Measurement and/or Payment for an item of work. •
The “Standard Item Table” will note “Requires Special Prov.” in the far right column “item use”.
STD. ITEM, GSP REQUIRED •
Bid item is a standard item, covered in the Standard Specifications. •
The General Special Provision (GSP) needs to be included in the contract Special
Provisions when the “Standard Item Table” notes “GSP Item” in the far right column “item use”. Ensure each GSP is applicable meaning “project-specific” to the contract.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Contract Plans
Division 4
GSP ITEM •
A GSP exists for the specific contract type and must be included in the contract Special
Provisions. Ensure GSP is applicable or “project-specific” to the contract such as “Use in all projects” or “Use in all Federal Aid Projects.”
REQ. SPECIAL & HQ APPROVAL •
When the “Standard Item Table” notes “Req. Special & HQ Approval” in the far right column “item use,” a project-specific provision must be written, and HQ Construction
Office approval must be given prior to including this project-specific provision in the
Special Provisions in the contract.
HEADQUARTERS USE ONLY •

Bid item will be included in contracts only when directed by the HQ Construction Office.
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION •
When the “Standard Item Table” notes “Technical Specification” in the far right column “item use” the bid item requires a technical project specific provision to be written. HQ
Construction Office must approve. •
Architects generally write this type of Special Provision. These bid items are typically used only for architectural-type work (such as building facilities construction at ferry terminals and rest areas).
SUPERSTRUCTURE ITEM • • right column “item use” are to be used only to provide lump sum breakout data for bid item 4300 “Superstructure – XXXXXX.”
DO NOT use the 9000 series bid items as stand-alone bid items in your contract estimate. 400.06(5)(e) Quantities
Do not duplicate a quantity within the body of the plans. The item totals shown in the Summary of Quantities are to be the sum of the quantities shown for the item throughout the plans.
Quantities are typically listed in the Quantity Tabulation, Structure Note, and Profile Plan sheets.
When quantities for an item appear in places other than where the contractor expects to find them, or when quantities for an item appear in two or more places throughout the plans, include a cross-referencing statement, such as “FOR ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES – SEE SHEETS Qnn and Wnn.”
Quantities for work items such as pigmented sealer, whose cost is included in the cost of the associated concrete, are shown in the plans for the sole purpose of aiding the contractor in the bidding process and are to be accompanied by the note, “Informational Only.”

Page 4-24
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans
When calculating quantities for surfacing and paving materials to ensure reasonable accuracy, the Design Manual contains units and conversion factors for estimating surfacing and paving quantities.
Quantities listed in the Summary of Quantities are intended to be representative of the work to be performed. Each time a quantity is placed on a Quantity Tabulation sheet, a Profile sheet, or another location in the plans round it according to the following section according to the unit bid price. Show the total of the rounded quantities on the Summary of Quantities. 400.06(5)(f)
Rounding of Quantities
Apply the following general rules to the rounding of quantities: 1. Items having an estimated unit price of $9.99 or less: show to the highest multiple of 10; for example, 3,640 (not 3,637) units of haul at $0.50, and 560 (not 554) tons of ballast at $1.25. 2. Items with an estimated unit price of $10.00 to $99.99: show to the nearest full digit; for example, 61 (not 60.5) cubic yards of concrete at $43.00. 3. Items with an estimated unit price of $100.00 or more: show to one decimal place; for example, 18.3 (not 18.25) acres of clearing at $1500.00. 4. Exceptions to numbers 1, 2, and 3 above: • Round earthwork items, roadway excavation, embankment compaction, and borrow excavations to the nearest multiple of 10 units, regardless of price. Round roadway excavation and embankment compaction for each entry on the Profile sheets. Round borrow quantities to the nearest 10 units and place on the Summary of Quantities. On a new construction project with extremely large earthwork quantities, the quantities could even be rounded to the nearest 50 units at each entry on the Profile sheets. • Round HMA and crushed surfacing items to the nearest 10 units. • Round pipe items to the nearest foot for each pipe run entered on the Structure Note sheets, regardless of price. 400.06(5)(g)
Unit Bid Prices
Good sources to use for determining the estimated unit bid prices for quantities are Bid Tabs
Pro and Unit Bid Analysis. See the following:  wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/engineering-applications/unit-bidanalysis  wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/engineering-applications/technicalsupport-guidance

Contract Reclamation Plans
See Contract Plan Example 4-10.
A Contract Reclamation Plan will clearly set forth all reclamation work to be accomplished in the contract.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-25 Contract Plans
Division 4
A Contract Reclamation Plan is required for every WSDOT contract that contains a WSDOT furnished-material source. The Contract Reclamation Plan will be based on the Ultimate
Reclamation Plan (ultimate REC plan). A reproducible (reverse-reading Mylar) of the approved ultimate REC plan can be obtained from the Region Materials Laboratory. This plan will be modified to create a Contract Reclamation Plan, which will be included in the Contract Plans.
By RCW 78.44, the approved ultimate REC plan must be followed or WSDOT is subject to fines for each incident. If the contract work requires deviation from the ultimate REC plan, a modification to the ultimate REC plan has to be submitted for Department of Natural Resources (DNR) approval prior to beginning work at the site.
In some cases, Contract Reclamation Plans need to be developed during Contract Plan preparation for sites that do not have ultimate REC plans. Materials sources located on federal land or sites smaller than 3 acres in area usually do not have ultimate REC plans. 400.06(6)(a)

Contract Reclamation Plan Elements 1. Update the existing contour lines shown on the approved Ultimate Reclamation Plan when to show the topography as it exists immediately prior to the contract. Only the contours in the portion of the site affected by your project need be shown, not for the entire site. 2. Note the contractor’s designated work area. 3. Indicate the available raw material, or, when appropriate, add a note on the plan stating that sufficient raw material is available for the project. 4. A block detailing materials to be produced and reclamation items needed under this contract. 5. The interim and reclaimed slopes are to be no steeper than the slopes on the ultimate REC plan. 6. Note specific directions for excavation; for example, “Excavation shall progress to full depth from the existing face of excavation toward the southeast.” 7. Only notes on the ultimate REC plan that are applicable to work being performed under the contract are to be included on the Contract Reclamation Plan. 8. Other notes and information necessary to the specific contract will be added. It is the intent that the Contract Reclamation Plan stand alone for the work (reclamation) to be accomplished under the contract. 400.06(6)(b)
Contract Materials
Verify with the Region Materials Laboratory that the quantity of available material is accurate and that it is possible to produce all the materials listed within WSDOT specifications. If the contractor will be required to perform some special or extra work to manufacture material that meets the specifications, include the special or extra work requirements in the Special
Provisions.
Page 4-26
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans
Tabulate quantities for stripping, clearing, and grubbing, and all other items of work to be performed within a site on the plan. For a nonmandatory site, the items of work are to be site-specific (“Clearing and Grubbing – Site QS-A-495”). For a mandatory site, the work will fall under the general contract work item (“Clearing and Grubbing”), but will be shown in a separate column.
Identification numbers for stockpile and waste sites are assigned by the Region Materials
Laboratory. Although a Contract Reclamation Plan is not required for stockpile or waste sites, the plans are to indicate any restrictions on the use of such sites.
Show Access to the sites. If an access road is to be built, rebuilt, or widened, indicate the width of right of way, and clearly identify all work to be performed by the contractor on the access roads as a part of the contract. How the contractor will be paid for the access road work will be outlined in the Contract Provisions.
Agreements are required with the owners of all roads that make up the haul route. These agreements will indicate WSDOT’s and the contractor’s responsibilities for returning the roadway to the “before hauling” condition.

400.06(7)
Roadway Sections
See Contract Plan Examples 4-11, 4-12, 4-13, 4-14, 4-15, and 4-16.
Roadway sections are to provide complete geometric information on the roadway cross section from the subgrade up and general information left and right of centerline. The information on the roadway sections will tie directly to the Paving Plans and the profiles if these series of plans are included in the project.
On federal-aid projects, show future paving and surfacing depths required to bring the roadway to the ultimate design cross section, in order to qualify for future participation by the
FHWA.
Roadway sections are required for every combination of surfacing and paving depths used on the main line, ramps, detours, frontage roads, road approaches, city streets, and so on.
Consider the use of tables with a section example in order to reduce the number of unnecessary plan sheets.
Roadway sections are to represent conditions from the subgrade up for the entire length of the construction line(s) (such as main line, ramps, detours, frontage roads, road approaches, and city streets) included in the project. Start at the beginning station on an alignment and identify all stationing to the end of line without gaps/overlaps.
When drawing roadway sections, use proportional scaling to indicate lane widths and depths of materials to be placed. A 12-foot lane should be drawn so that it appears slightly larger than a 10-foot shoulder. A 0.15-foot lift of hot mix asphalt (HMA) should be drawn so that it appears approximately one quarter the thickness of a 0.60-foot lift of gravel base course.

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-27 Contract Plans
Division 4
For constructability, the following dimensioning guidance is typically considered adequate. •
Horizontal elements, lane, and shoulder widths – show in feet. If a horizontal dimension is to the nearest foot, then show the dimension as a whole number. Example: show an 11-foot lane as 11’ not 11.0’. Show an 11.6’ lane as 11.6’ (do not round it to 12’.) •
Station limits – round to the nearest foot when practicable. But, if the roadway section goes to the bridge seat, use the bridge seat station. •
Materials depths – generally shown to hundredth of foot, as in: 0.25’
Draw roadway sections to reflect how the work is expected to be performed in the field. If HMA is to be placed in multiple lifts, draw the roadway section to reflect this fact by showing the number of lifts with the required depths of each lift. Show each lift with an edge line that would indicate where each lift would end left and right of centerline. DO NOT simply draw each lift of
HMA to extend out into the shoulder unless this is exactly how the HMA is to be placed.
Variable dimensions (for example, Varies 2' to 10') may be used to represent differences in shoulder or lane widths, or transition areas, only if there is a Paving Plan that clearly shows, by stationing, the actual widths desired. If the project is a pavement overlay project and no Paving
Plan is going to be provided, the use of variable horizontal dimensions is discouraged unless construction notes or a table is used to describe, by stationing, where the variable paving widths or transitions begin and end.
A generic roadway section for bridges must be provided to avoid having gaps in stationing. If the bridge is being overlaid, additional detail will be required; be sure the roadway section matches any bridge information in the plans. When a project has a structure on the main line or a secondary line that is not included in the project, a paving exception should be noted on the
Roadway Section sheet.
Show bridge approach slabs, if required, as a separate roadway section.
Station equations, paving exceptions, and project exceptions are to be shown in proximity to the roadway section to which they apply. 400.06(7)(a)

Roadway Section Items
Show the following on roadway sections as applicable: 1. Horizontal dimensions of the roadways. 2. Project-specific design details and required features such as curbs, sidewalks, or riprap. 3. The depths of surfacing and paving. 4. Station-to-station limits for each line represented by the roadway section. 5. The position of the profile grade, the pivot point for super transition, and the construction centerline. 6. The depth from profile grade to the roadway surface being constructed if the project does not include ultimate design surfacing. Label this depth as “Future.”
Page 4-28
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans 7. The type, width, and thickness of the existing surface if the characteristics of the existing surface will affect construction. 8. A general note indicating that all surfacing and paving depths are compacted depths. 9. A slope table if embankment and excavation heights vary enough to require different slope rates. Show sideslopes for embankment sections and foreslopes and backslopes for excavation areas. 10. A section showing shoulder widening for guardrail. If shoulder widening for guardrail is isolated to one or two roadway sections, it can be shown as part of the particular section. If shoulder widening for guardrail applies to several roadway sections, a separate shoulderwidening section can be drawn and referenced from the applicable roadway sections. 11. A section showing the shoulder design on the outside of a curve (super elevation section) if the project involves constructing subgrade on the outside of curves (a standard CAD detail that need only be shown once). 12. A surfacing legend on each sheet indicating the type of surfacing material, with the exact item name as found on the Summary of Quantities. For HMA, it is necessary to indicate the class of material used, but not the performance grade (PG), when only one grade is used for the entire project. However, if there are two or more performance grades used on the project, they must all be detailed on the roadway sections. Assign each type of material an identifying number enclosed by a hexagon symbol. 13. Construction notes numbered consecutively. Only show the applicable construction notes on a particular sheet. Once you have created a construction note 1, it will always be the same for that series. Continue the sequencing of construction notes consecutively as you add them. DO NOT resequence from one plan sheet to the next. For example: • Sheet R1 may have construction notes 1, 2, 3, and 4. • Sheet R2 may have construction notes 1, 3, and 5. (Notes 1 and 3 on sheet R2 would be identical to notes 1 and 3 on sheet R1, and note 5 on R2 is a new note, consecutively numbered). 14. If the total paving depth for a class of HMA exceeds the nominal compacted depth specified in the Standard Specifications, one of the following methods of indicating the paving requirements will be used: • Draw multiple lifts on the roadway section indicating the desired minimum compacted depth of each lift. • Provide a construction note for the roadway section specifying the number of lifts required and that the maximum allowable compacted depth for any lift shall be in accordance with Section 5-04 of the Standard Specifications for Road, Bridge, and
Municipal Construction.

Division 4
Paving Depths

The plans supersede the Standard Specifications. If the roadway sections do not indicate the maximum paving depths, the contractor could use thicker paving lifts than allowed in the
Standard Specifications. Using one of the two methods above ensures the maximum lift thickness will not exceed the requirements of Standard Specification Section 5-04.3(7). If the total paving depth is less than the maximum nominal compacted depths shown in the Standard
Specifications, the use of the two methods above is optional.
Lifts need to comply with minimum lift thicknesses in addition to maximum lift thicknesses.
Minimum lift thickness for each class of HMA are found in Section 8.2.3 of the WSDOT
Pavement Policy available here:  https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/construction-materials/pavement-designmanagement

Grading Sections

See Contract Plan Example 4-17.
These plan sheets show items such as: types of embankment; use of waste in slope flattening; drainage layers; composite sections; relief ditch details; slope tables; unsuitable stripping depth tables; controlled blasting slopes; wetland sections; horizontal drain details; surcharge details; large unsuitable foundation excavation and backfill areas; and soil stabilization details. Most projects will not require grading sections. 400.06(9)
Alignment Plan or Alignment/Right of Way Plan
See Contract Plan Examples 4-18 and 4-19.
The alignment and right of way (R/W) information will appear on the same series of plan sheets for most projects.
To reduce the number of plans sheets, include Right of Way Plans only when they are necessary for contractors to perform their work.
If R/W information is not required (such as for a paving project), the alignment information could be shown on another plan series, such as the Site Preparation Plan series or the Paving
Plan series, as long as the additional information does not cause overcrowding of the plan sheet.
Site preparation information may appear with the Alignment Plans, but only if there is minimal existing topography and minimal site preparation work to be shown. If there is considerable topography or a great deal of site preparation work to be shown, the information is to be placed on a separate plan series.
Note: If Roadway Profile sheets are included in the project, make sure the station limits on each
Profile Plan sheet match exactly the station limits of the Alignment Plan sheets. The alignment and profile may be shown on the same plan sheet. For general information on Roadway Profile sheets, see Section 400.06(12). 400.06(9)(a) Alignment/Right of Way Plan Series
The following information will normally appear on the Alignment/Right of Way Plan series: 1. Construction centerlines for all roadways being constructed. 2. All stationing, bearings, and curve data associated with each construction centerline. For new construction, ramp stationing will always run in the same direction as the main line stationing. 3. Right of way centerline—not always required (see discussion below). 4. Right of way lines. All WSDOT R/W Boundary Lines (proposed and existing), without exception, will always be solid lines on the Contract Plans. 5. Ties of all right of way breaks to either the right of way or construction centerlines—show both station and offset distance. 6. Construction permits with private citizens, and all easements, identified by type and use.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Page 4-31 Contract Plans
Division 4 7. Ties of all construction permits and all easements to either the right of way or construction centerline—show both station and offset distance. 8. Township and Range Lines that cross centerline, with appropriate descriptive information (such as bearing and distance to found corners), including centerline stationing at intersection point. 9. Limited access hachures when appropriate. Hachures need to be drawn to the correct stationing, but the stationing of the ends or breaks in limited access does not have to be identified on the construction plans. 10. Found Section Corners and monuments, with station and offset ties to construction centerline. 11. Station and offset ties to railroads and railroad rights of way that intersect the project or are affected by the project. 12. Corporate limit and county lines with station identification where they cross the construction centerline. 13. Names of rivers, streams, bays, and inlets, their direction of flow and meander lines, and the ordinary high tide or high-water lines of navigable waterways and any required environmental information for right of way plans. See 400.06(18) for additional requirements. 14. On all projects that include grading, show the slope catch lines. It may be desirable to show slope catch lines on the Drainage Plan; however, if this is done, the right of way line must also be shown on the Drainage Plan. 15. The outline of sand drainage blankets, unsuitable foundation excavation, and toxic waste excavation areas. 16. Show all found property corners along WSDOT R/W lines with a note stating “Per RCW 58.09.130, any monument or corner disturbed by the Contractor’s operation shall be replaced at no cost to the Contracting Agency.” 17. Primary Control Point – Primary control points are displayed in their coordinate location and labeled with the designation ID only. The primary control point table and basis of bearing content will be on the first sheet or the first sheet that can accommodate both without obscuring pertinent sheet information (see Example 4-19). 18. Show all wells (including decommissioned wells) on the alignment plans. Include the unique well identification tag and the well location in assigned project coordinates. See Section 700.01(8)(a) Decommissioning of Wells. 19. Add boring locations (symbol). 400.06(9)(b)
Right of Way Centerline
When the right of way centerline is coincidental with the construction centerline, provide an equation at the Begin Project and End Project to show the relationship between the official right
Page 4-32 Division 4
Contract Plans of way stationing and the construction centerline stationing. Provide an equation showing the relationship between the construction centerline and the right of way centerline at the location of Right of Way Plan equations. All right of way offsets and associated stationing will then be referenced to the construction centerline.
When the right of way centerline is not coincidental with the construction centerline, the same procedure described in the previous paragraph may be used. Show the offset distance between the right of way and construction centerlines at the Begin Project and End Project. In addition to the equations at the Begin Project and End Project, show equations at all points where the right of way and construction centerlines cross and at the location of Right of Way Plan equations. 400.06(9)(c)
Right of Way Stationing/Alignment
The official Right of Way Plans may be included in the Contract Plans under the following circumstances: • The official right of way stationing runs the opposite direction of the construction stationing. • The right of way alignment is substantially different than the construction alignment and is not easily tied. For example, the right of way alignment has numerous curves that do not exist in the construction centerline and the right of way would have to be described using metes and bounds as opposed to offsets from the construction centerline.
In either of the two circumstances above, contact the HQ Right of Way Plans Section and request that it prepare the existing Right of Way Plans to be included in the Contract Plans.
Provide the HQ Right of Way Plans Section with the equation relating the Begin Project and End
Project construction centerline to the existing R/W stationing. If this option is used, the HQ Right of Way Plans Section needs to be notified early in the design process so that the work can be added to its schedule, to ensure the plans can be prepared within the PS&E schedule. 400.06(9)(d)

Roadway Alignment/Right of Way Plan
Township and Range information does not have to be shown on the Alignment Plans unless one or both of the following cases occurs: • The Township or Range Lines cross the centerline, in which case show the line with the station of the centerline intersection identified. • Right of way boundary lines are shown WITH dimensions from the roadway alignment.
Section Lines only have to be shown on the Alignment Plans if the Section Corners are found, requiring that the ties to centerline be shown.
Show the following information for all horizontal alignments: 1. Line identification, using alpha designation and stationing (M 5+50). 2. Station ticks shown on the top side of the alignment line—top as related to the direction of the stationing. 3. Tangent bearings.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-33 Contract Plans
Division 4 4. Point of intersection (PI), point of curvature (P.C.), point of tangency (P.T.), point on tangent (POT), point on curve (POC), point of compound curve (PCC), point of reverse curve (PRC) and point on semi tangent (POST) for all horizontal alignments where applicable. 5. Angle points (A.P.) in horizontal alignments. 6. Curve data box showing: •
Station of the point of intersection (P.I.) of bearings for each curve. •
Delta for each curve: deflection angle between intersecting bearings. •
Radius of each curve.

•
Tangent length for each: distance from P.C. and P.T. to the P.I.
Length of curve for each curve: distance from P.C. to P.T. along the horizontal curve.
Full super rate for each horizontal curve. 400.06(9)(e)
Construction Stationing
Show construction stationing increasing from the beginning of the project to the end, from south to north on odd-numbered highways, and from west to east on even-numbered highways.
All ramp stationing for new construction is to increase in the same direction as the main line stationing.
Ramp stationing should begin at station 10+00 to avoid negative stationing due to alignment changes.
Show offset equations as follows: • The secondary line (ramp, crossroad, or right of way centerline) designation and station is listed first. • The main line (construction centerline) designation and station, perpendicular distance, and left or right is listed next. The direction (left or right) is referenced from main line looking ahead on line. 400.06(9)(f)
Linear Equations

Linear equations should not be an issue if construction stationing is established for the project instead of using right of way stationing. If linear equations are present, make sure that they are gap equations and not overlap equations. Overlap equations cause confusion because of the duplication of stationing caused by the overlap. To convert an overlap equation to a gap equation, a 1 can be added in front of the Ahead station (5+00 would become 15+00), or the first digit of the Ahead station can be increased by 1 (110+00 would become 210+00).
Page 4-34
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans
Examples: 1. Overlap equation 10+00 BK = 5+00 AHD adding 1 in front of the Ahead station would become
Gap equation 10+00 BK = 15+00 AHD 2. Overlap equation 150+00 BK = 110+00 AHD add 1 to the first digit of the Ahead station would become
Gap equation 150+00 BK = 210+00 AHD
When showing the equation in the plans, the BACK station goes on the back-side of the equation line and the AHEAD station goes on the ahead-side of the equation line. 400.06(10)
Quantity Tabulation Plan Sheets
See Contract Plan Examples 4-20 and 4-38.
Quantity Tabulation Plan sheets are used to tabulate the locations, quantities, and notes pertaining to specific bid items. Quantity Tabulation Plan sheets may not be required on projects where the information is shown elsewhere in the contract. 400.06(10)(a) Quantity Tabulation Plan Sheet Items
The following types of items will normally appear on Quantity Tabulation sheets: 1. Removal items—except items paid by lump sum. 2. Asphalt concrete curb and asphalt concrete gutter. 3. Timber and lumber—except bridge items. 4. Cement concrete approach. 5. Cement concrete curbs, and curb and gutter. 6. Guardrail items, including anchors, terminals, and transition items. 7. Concrete barrier items. 8. Impact attenuators. 9. Guideposts. 10. Raised pavement markers, paint lines, and pavement marking items. 11. Conduit pipe—except bridge, illumination, and traffic signal system items. 12. Wildlife reflectors. 13. Steel reinforcing bars and wire mesh—except bridge structural retaining walls and drainage items. 14. Monument cases and covers. 15. Cement concrete sidewalk. 16. Asphalt concrete sidewalk.

Division 4 17. Concrete slope protection. 18. Fencing items, including gates and end, corner, and pull posts. 19. Adjustment items. 20. Delineation lights. 21. Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Devices. 400.06(10)(b) Quantity Tabulation Plan Sheet Preparation
Prepare Quantity Tabulation Plans on 11-inch by 17-inch sheets. The Quantity Tabulation spreadsheet program is available through the Region Plans Offices or the HQ Project
Development Unit. For additional information and instructions for the Quantity Tabulation spreadsheet, see the Appendices.
Standard sheets have been prepared with the heading “Quantity Tabulation.” A descriptive addition (see types of items above) may be added after the plan sheet heading “QUANTITY
TABULATION – XXXXXXX XXXXXX” to indicate what type of work is included on this plan sheet.
Place Quantity Tabulation Plan sheets immediately preceding the plan sheets that contain the tabulated items. This will intersperse them throughout the plans.
For projects involving only a few items, the quantities may be placed in data boxes on appropriate plan sheets or on Profile sheets, eliminating the need for Quantity Tabulation Plan sheets. Data boxes should be laid out in the same manner as the Quantity Tabulation sheets.
Provide blank columns between listed bid items, and blank rows in station listing (about every fifth entry and a space or two between each reference sheet listed). This procedure allows for the addition of bid items and stationing with ease, even during the addendum phase. 400.06(10)(c)
Bid Items

Place Bid items from left to right in the same order in which they appear in the Summary of
Quantities Estimate.
Identify bid items on the Quantity Tabulation Plan sheets exactly as they appear in the Standard
Specifications (spelling, punctuation, spacing, and so on) and in the same order as they appear on the Summary of Quantities.
If there are more bid items to be tabulated than will fit across the top of the sheet, with the appropriate blank spaces, additional Quantity Tabulation Plan sheets will be required. The station listing will be identical for the continued sheets. Likewise, if there are more station listings than will fit on a single sheet, with the required blank spaces, additional Quantity
Tabulation Plan sheets will be required. The bid items across the top will be identical for the continued sheets.
Each time an item is used in a different location provide a separate quantity entry. Related items, however, may be included in a single entry if the station limits are the same. For example, a single entry could include the type of guardrail, required anchors, and transition types.
Page 4-36
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans

Round each quantity entered on the Quantity Tabulation Plan sheet appropriately at the time of entry. Do not add up the unrounded quantities and round the total to carry forward to the
Estimate/Summary of Quantities. (See the information on rounding in 400.06(5), Summary of
Quantities.)
The bid item totals on the Quantity Tabulation sheets must be consistent with the bid item totals entered in the Summary of Quantities Estimate. 400.06(10)(e)
Plan Reference No.
The Code column contains the Quantity Tabulation code number, which is made up of the Plan
Reference No. and the number identifying the individual construction feature on the sheet (for example, P1-1, P1-2, … P1-6, P2-1, P2-2, … P2-26). List the numbers in ascending order of plan sheets.
Bid items, identified by station(s) and quantity or quantities, on individual Quantity Tabulation
Plan sheets are tied directly to the plan sheet series they are related to by the number immediately following the Plan Reference No. mentioned above. The related series sheet is to have its own consecutive series of numbers identifying construction features (octagonal enclosed numbers beginning with number 1) in the top left corner of the sheet and progressing across and down the sheet. Draw a light, arrowless line from the octagon to the construction feature. When a construction feature is continued on more than one sheet, divide the octagon on the continued sheet with a horizontal line. Insert the Plan Reference No. on which the construction feature first appears in the upper half and show the first sheet individual identifying number in the lower half. If this is done, a larger-scale octagon may be used. The octagonal symbol is not used for any other purposes.
For items such as pavement markings that are continuous for the entire project, list the station limits and leave the code column blank. 400.06(10)(f) General Notes
The General Notes will include information required to complete the data for a particular construction feature, such as: • Guidepost type and color. • Guardrail placement case, terminal connection, alternate anchor type, and connection type when connecting transition to stiffer barrier like bridge rail. • Acceptable impact attenuators for each location. • References to applicable Special Provisions identify the Special Provision by the exact name. • References to applicable details in the Contract Plans. Identify the exact plan sheet (using the Plan Reference No.) where the detail is located. • Reference to applicable Standard Plan(s). Provide the Standard Plan number, which is located in the bottom right corner of the page. • Type of curbing to be used.

If the quantities for an item appear on other plan sheets in addition to the Quantity Tabulation
Plan sheets, provide cross-references to the sheets where the additional quantities can be found. 400.06(11)
Site Preparation
See Contract Plan Example 4-21.
The Site Preparation Plan series is where all existing topography within your project limits is to be shown, as well as all the project removal and demolition work.
If there is very little topography to be shown and very little removal and demolition work to be performed, this information can be shown on the Alignment/Right of Way Plan series as long as it does not compromise the information required on the Alignment/Right of Way Plans.
Show construction centerlines on the Site Preparation Plans; however, lanes, shoulders, and other features being constructed are not to be shown.
Identify removal and demolition of existing features, paid as separate items, using the General
Notes in the Quantity Tabulation sheets.
Identify items included in the lump sum price for “Removal of Structures and Obstructions,” with notes located directly on the appropriate plan sheet. For example, removal of wire fence should be identified with a note such as “wire fence to be removed.” Items of work (such as removal of guideposts) included in the lump sum price for “Removal of Structures and
Obstructions” that cover the entire project do not have to be identified on the plan. Items of work being paid as "Removal of Structures and Obstructions" will not appear on Quantity
Tabulation sheets.
If large, complete areas of pavement, sidewalk, or curbs and gutters are being removed, it is best not to use cross-hachuring to identify these areas. Large areas of cross-hachuring detract from the plans and often hide important information. It will suffice to show the limits of the removal and identify the area with a General Note on the Quantity Tabulation sheet, or note on the plan sheet “begin pavement removal/end pavement removal.” If there are a number of small, isolated areas of pavement removal, cross-hachuring may be used to identify these areas.

Roadway Profiles
See Contract Plan Example 4-22.
Roadway profiles are required only when there is a change in the vertical alignment of the roadway under construction. If only a section of the vertical alignment is changed, a profile is required only for that section.
The station-to-station limits shown on each Profile sheet match exactly the station-to-station limits shown on the corresponding Alignment sheet. 400.06(12)(a)
Profile Sheets
Show the following required information on Profile sheets:
Page 4-38
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans

1. Roadway section limits with arrows. These are always to be the topmost entry on the Profile sheets. 2. Super elevation diagrams. These should be shown on a separate sheet if they cause crowding of other required information. 3. The finished profile grade line as specified in the EEDS Manual. 4. The datum symbol and information on all sheets. North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 88 is the desirable vertical datum. However, National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) 29 is acceptable in certain situations. If there is a need to use NGVD 29 datum on a project, contact the HQ Right of Way Plans Section, Land Survey Support, for concurrence for use. 5. All vertical control, including benchmarks that exist in the area of the alignment profiled on the sheet—both temporary and permanent. Include all pertinent information associated with vertical control points such as location, offset, stationing, elevation, and so on. 6. Beginning station and elevation (BVC) and ending station and elevation (EVC) of each vertical curve. 7. Elevations and stations through each vertical curve on even stations, or to avoid cluttering at even station intervals not greater than 200 feet. 8. Station and elevation of the point of intersection of the gradients (VPI). 9. Gradients between vertical curves—shown as a percentage, carried out to a sufficient number of places (generally three) so that the calculation from the elevation at one VPI on the given gradient will give the elevation at the next VPI. 10. Length of each vertical curve. 11. Elevation and station at each break—angle point; AP—in gradient with elevation shown to
0.01 foot. 12. Existing ground shown as a dashed line. 13. Areas of work or quantities, with arrows, between the station-to-station limits of the work, or at 10 station (1,000') totals if the work extends beyond 10 station totals, or at other logical breaks such as bridges or group breaks. If these logical breaks are slightly more or less than 1,000 feet apart, it would be appropriate to have a 1,300-foot total or a 700-foot total. 14. Quantities, including but not limited to roadway excavation; controlled blasting; vertical sand drains; unsuitable foundation excavation; toxic waste excavation; embankment compaction; special backfill; clearing and grubbing; seeding; compost; topsoil; and fertilizing and mulching. 15. The use of the term “embankment” by itself is permitted only when Method A compaction is specified. In this instance, it must be noted that embankment quantities are shown for informational purposes only. 16. Details showing sideslopes for unsuitable foundation excavation and toxic waste excavation (or detailed on separate sheets.) The bottom of unsuitable foundation excavation and toxic
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Division 4 waste excavation should be shown as a squiggly line to indicate that the actual bottom elevation of the excavation is unknown.
Give some thought to the layout of the Profile sheets prior to placing information, because the layout is to be the same on each Profile sheet in the series. Place all quantity arrows in the same position on each sheet to allow quantities to be located easily.
If there is only minor grading on the project, and Profile sheets are not used, show 10 station totals, or similar quantity breakdowns, on a Quantity Tabulation sheet. 400.06(13)
Structure Notes
See Contract Plan Examples 4-23 and 4-28.
All of the information shown on the Structure Note sheet and the Drainage Plans and Profiles will meet the requirements contained in the Hydraulics Manual and the Standard Plans for
Road, Bridge, and Municipal Construction (Standard Plans). (a) Structure Note sheets are used to tabulate locations, bid items, quantities, and notes pertaining to drainage items, utilities, water lines, and so on. (b) Prepare Structure Notes as 11-inch by 17-inch sheets. The Structure Note spreadsheet is available through Region Plans Offices or the HQ Project Development Unit. For additional information and instructions for this microcomputer spreadsheet, see the Appendices. (c) Standard sheets have been prepared with the heading “Structure Notes.” Insert a descriptive addition such as “Utilities” or “Irrigation” after the heading “STRUCTURE NOTES – XXXXXXX XXXXXX” to indicate what type of work is included on the plan sheet. Place
Structure Note sheets immediately preceding the plan sheets that contain the features being tabulated. (d) For those projects involving only a few drainage bid items at a few locations, the information normally provided on Structure Note sheets may be provided on the appropriate plan sheets, in either a tabular form in data boxes, or placed in a convenient location on the sheet, with a leader line used to connect the information with the corresponding drainage feature. (e) Provide blank columns between listed bid items, and blank rows in station listing—about every fifth entry and a space or two between each reference sheet listed. This allows for the addition of bid items and stationing with ease, even during the addendum phase. (f) Place bid items from left to right in the same order in which they appear in the Summary of
Quantities Estimate.
Identify bid items on the Structure Note Plan sheets exactly (spelling, punctuation, and spacing) as they appear in the WSDOT Standard Item Table. (g) If there are more bid items to be tabulated than will fit across the top of the sheet, with the appropriate blank spaces, additional tabulation sheets will be required. The station listing will be identical for the continued sheets. Likewise, if there are more station listings than

Page 4-40
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans will fit on a single sheet, with the required blank spaces, additional tabulation sheets will be required. The bid items across the top will be identical for the continued sheets. (h) Each time an item is used in a different location, provide a separate quantity entry. Related items, however, may be included in a single entry if the station limits are the same. For example, a single entry could include a catch basin, pipe, structure excavation, and riprap. (i) Round each quantity entered on the Structure Note Plan sheet at the first point of entry.
Do not add up the unrounded quantities and then round the total to carry forward to the
Summary of Quantities Estimate. (See appropriate rounding information in 400.06(5).) (j) The Code column is to contain the structure code number, which is made up of the Plan
Reference No. and the number identifying the drainage features on the sheet (for example,
D1-1, D1-2, … D1-6, D2-1, D2-2, … D2-26). List the numbers in ascending order of plan sheets. (k) Indicate the construction centerline stationing on the Structure Note sheet for cross culverts, and indicate station and offset for each end of longitudinal pipe installations. If a sanitary or storm sewer line stationing is used, use its stationing on the Structure Note sheet, and the plan sheets will indicate the appropriate ties to the construction centerline. (l) The bid item for storm sewer pipe will be “Schedule ___Storm Sewer Pipe ___ In. Diam.” A table indicating the acceptable pipe alternates is included in Section 7-04 of the Standard
Specifications. There will be times when not all of the pipes shown as acceptable alternates in the table will be acceptable because of conditions on a specific project. When there are pipes not acceptable for a specific project, include a General Note on the Structure Note sheet identifying the unacceptable pipe type. The Hydraulics Manual contains a complete discussion on storm sewer pipes and is to be used for guidance. (m) When WSDOT does sanitary sewer pipe work, it is usually to extend or replace a system affected by the highway work. The utility or local agency will normally specify the type of pipe, or specify that the pipe extension or replacement be in kind. The system owner’s request for pipe type is to be placed in the P&SE portion of the Project File to serve as backup justification. The bid item will be the pipe type requested by the owner, and the
General Note on the Structure Note Plan sheet will read either “no acceptable alternates” or “replace in kind,” whichever is appropriate. (n) The General Notes will include information required to complete the data for a particular drainage feature, such as: • Acceptable or unacceptable pipe alternates for drain, underdrain, and culvert pipes. • Unacceptable alternates for culvert and storm sewer pipes bid on a schedule basis. • The appropriate treatment for pipes, except when the treatment is described by the bid item name. • The corrugation dimension for corrugated steel pipe when a size other than the standard size corrugation is required.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Page 4-41 Contract Plans
Division 4 • Specific vertical elongation where elliptical-shaped steel or aluminum pipes are required, whether the elliptical pipe is specified in the bid item or as an alternate. • Procedures or instructions necessary to complete construction of the drainage feature. • Required features, such as beveled end sections, safety bars, and other improvements. • References to applicable details in the Contract Plans. Identify the exact plan sheet using the Plan Reference No. where the detail is located. • References to applicable Standard Plans, with the full Standard Plan number. • References to applicable Special Provisions. Identify the Special Provision by the exact name.
The bid item totals on the Structure Note sheets must be consistent with the bid item totals entered in the Summary of Quantities Estimate. (o) If the quantities for an item appear on other plan sheets in addition to the Structure Note sheets, provide cross-references to the sheets where the additional quantities can be found. 400.06(14)
Drainage Plan
See Contract Plan Examples 4-24 and 4-27.
Each plan sheet will have its own consecutive series of numbers identifying drainage features.
The numbers (beginning with number 1 enclosed in circles) will begin in the top left corner of the sheet and progress across and down the sheet. Draw a light, arrowless line from the circle to the drainage feature or features. These numbers relate directly back to the Structure Note plan sheets.
When a drainage feature is continued on more than one sheet, divide the circle with a horizontal line. The plan sheet reference number on which the drainage feature first appears will be inserted in the upper half and the individual identifying number will be inserted in the lower half. A larger-scale circle may be used if this is done. The circle symbol is reserved for the purpose of identifying drainage features and is not to be used for any other purpose.
If a sanitary or storm sewer line stationing is used, indicate the appropriate ties to the construction centerline.
Each cross pipe will have a separate code number, which will include any attached drainage structure and any riprap, quarry spalls, or other end treatment being constructed in conjunction with the pipe.
Each run of pipe in a closed sewer system will have a separate code number, which will include the pipe and the drainage structure on the inlet end of the run of pipe.
If multiple pipes are to be placed in the same trench, they may be combined under a single structure code.
Indicate the skew angle for all skewed cross pipes, unless both ends are controlled by station and offset and the stations and offsets appear on the Structure Note sheet.

A roadway ditch that is shown as part of a roadway section does not need to be shown on the
Drainage Plans. This roadway ditch is included in the earthwork for Roadway Excavation Incl.
Haul; do not assign a Structure Note number.
When a ditch is constructed based on a drainage profile in the Drainage Plans, then this ditch needs an assigned Structure Note number and the excavation is included in the bid item Ditch
Excavation. This excludes ditches that are part of the roadway. 400.06(15)
Drainage Profiles
See Contract Plan Examples 4-25 and 4-26.
The established scale controls the drainage profiles vertically. There is usually no horizontal scale for the drainage profiles, but it is recommended that distances represented be drawn proportionately. Draw each profile in proportion horizontally for the length of the profile (the space representing 10 feet will appear the same for the length of the profile, and it will appear to be approximately two times a space, representing 5 feet).
The profiles can be made visually easier to follow by using an elongated triangle to represent manholes and an elongated rectangle to represent other drainage structures (such as catch basins or inlets). The distance shown between drainage structures is not the length of pipe but the horizontal distance from center of structure to center of structure. If it happens to appear to be the same as the length of pipe shown in the Structure Note Plan sheet, it is merely coincidental.
Draw pipe diameters with proportionate scale, so a 12-inch-diameter pipe will be drawn half the size of a 24-inch-diameter pipe.
Draw drainage profiles as a straight line representation of the path the water will take as it flows through the system, without regard for the actual plan view direction the pipes are running. You do not have to break the profile because a system that had been running parallel to the centerline has turned ninety degrees at a catch basin and crossed the roadway.
At locations where two or more pipes bring water to a drainage structure and one pipe carries the water away, there will have to be breaks in the profiles. One profile will continue through the common drainage structure and show the water leaving the structure, while the other profiles will stop or start at the common structure. Draw a leader line between the representations of the common drainage structure with the note “same catch basin,” which is the tie between the profiles and completes each without having to draw the exit pipe a number of times. The information for the common structure will only be shown on one profile, usually the one that shows the outlet pipe. 400.06(15)(a)

Drainage Profile Information
Provide the following information on the drainage profiles: 1. Inlet and outlet flow line elevations of pipes—shown below the pipe profile. Inlet and Outlet flow line elevations are those elevations derived from pipe slopes carried to the center of drainage structure.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-43 Contract Plans
Division 4 2. Outflow treatments such as riprap, quarry spalls, and, if the ditch is other than a roadway or median ditch, ditch profiles. 3. Debris deflectors, standpipes, and headwalls. 4. The type of drainage structure and station and offset location of the structure—shown above the structure. 5. The rim elevation of manholes, catch basins, inlets, or other drainage structures—shown above the structure. 6. The horizontal distance between adjacent drainage structures from center of structure to center of structure. 7. The size of pipe in each run—you do not have to include the type of pipe. 8. The pipe slope—carried out to sufficient decimal places (generally three) so that when the calculation is made from the indicated inlet flow line, on the given grade, for the given distance, the result will be the outlet flow line indicated to 0.01 foot. 9. Finished ground line above the pipe. 10. Original ground line if pipes will be placed prior to embankment construction or if original ground differs from the finished ground line. 400.06(16)
Utility Plan
See Contract Plan Example 4-29.
When the contractor is to work on the existing utilities as part of the contract, plan sheets for utility structure notes, plans, and details will be required. These follow the same general guidelines as specified for Drainage Structure Notes/Plans/Details.
To locate utilities in areas where only a few utilities exist, consider using tables with stations and offsets in lieu of creating additional plan sheets.
RCW 19.122.040 requires WSDOT to identify and locate known underground utilities in our contracts. Make every effort to also identify and locate aboveground utilities.
RCW 19.122.040 “Underground facilities identified in bid or contract – Excavator's duty of reasonable care – Liability for damages – Attorneys' fees,” reads as follows: (1) Project owners shall indicate in bid or contract documents the existence of underground facilities known by the project owner to be located within the proposed area of excavation.
The following shall be deemed changed or differing site conditions: (a) An underground facility not identified as required by this chapter or other provision of law; and (b) An underground facility not located, as required by this chapter or other provision of law, by the project owner, facility operator, or excavator if the project owner or excavator is also a facility operator. (2) An excavator shall use reasonable care to avoid damaging underground facilities. An excavator shall:

Page 4-44
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 4
Contract Plans (a) Determine the precise location of underground facilities which have been marked; (b) Plan the excavation to avoid damage to or minimize interference with underground facilities in and near the excavation area; and (c) Provide such support for underground facilities in and near the construction area, including during backfill operations, as may be reasonably necessary for the protection of such facilities. (3) If an underground facility is damaged and such damage is the consequence of the failure to fulfill an obligation under this chapter, the party failing to perform that obligation is liable for any damages. Any clause in an excavation contract which attempts to allocate liability, or requires indemnification to shift the economic consequences of liability, that differs from the provisions of this chapter is against public policy and unenforceable. Nothing in this chapter prevents the parties to an excavation contract from contracting with respect to the allocation of risk for changed or differing site conditions. (4) In any action brought under this section, the prevailing party is entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees. [2011 c 263 § 8; 1984 c 144 § 4.]
Identified utilities are to be shown in the bid or contract documents as stated in the RCW. The
Site Preparation Plan series is where they would normally be shown (see 400.06(11), Site
Preparation). If the project is in an area with many utilities, as well as many other topographical features, it may be necessary to separate the utilities on a separate series of plans following the
Site Preparation Plan series. The best available information as to the location of underground and overhead utilities is to be used. Contract Plan Example 4-19 depicts how utilities are typically shown on a plan sheet.
Do not forget to include WSDOT utilities, such as traffic signal, illumination, and ITS conduits and fixtures.
The required amount of detail related to utility location is directly proportional to the amount of underground work involved in the contract and the proximity to the utility. A simple paver should require less utility detail than a project with excavation at or near a 24-inch natural gas line or a 96-inch sewer line. 400.06(17)
Contour Grading Plan

Contour Grading Plans provide finished ground contours. These plans require the Region
Landscape Architect's stamp (or the HQ Landscape Architect's stamp for regions without a
Landscape Architect), regardless of whether they are prepared by the design team or the landscape section. (See the Design Manual for more information.)

Wetlands, Mitigation Sites, Detention/Retention Site Plans and
Stream Plans 400.06(18)(a)
Wetlands
Show all wetlands on the construction plans, whether inside the right of way or not, that could be impacted by the construction work. Use standard symbols found in the Electronic
Engineering Data Standards Manual.
Wetlands within the right of way must be delineated in the field by a qualified wetland biologist and survey data collected. Delineated wetlands will, in most cases, have buffer zones associated with them. Construction contract plans must accurately show the location of wetlands and their buffers based on the survey data collected. Wetlands that are outside the right of way may have buffers that extend into the work areas shown on the construction contract plans. Impacts to buffers of off-site wetlands may result in indirect impacts to the wetland that reduces its functional value.
The buffer zone is established by the local jurisdiction and may not always be identified on the permit. For each wetland identified within a project area, check with the Region Environmental
Office to get the buffer zone information. The buffer zone is developed by adding the required buffer width to the surveyed wetland boundary.
If a contractor is allowed to work within an existing wetland or wetland buffer zone, delineate the allowable work area by the cut and fill line. The contractor shall possess a permit identifying each wetland in which work is allowed.
Show wetlands and their buffers on the Vicinity Map and all other construction contract plan sheets, such as those showing cut/fill lines, staging and stockpile locations, drainage, TESC, or other features that could impact them.
For further information, see the Roadside Policy Manual and the Environmental Manual Chapter
431 Wetlands. 400.06(18)(b)

Wetland Mitigation Sites
A wetland mitigation site is a wetland area that has been or is being established (created), restored, enhanced, or preserved to compensate for wetlands impacted by construction.
Show all wetland mitigation sites on the construction contract plans and identified as either “existing” or “to be constructed.” A mitigation site, whether existing or to be constructed, is always identified as a mitigation site on construction contract plan sheets. Wetlands in mitigation sites become subject to regulatory jurisdiction as soon as they are constructed.
If a contractor is allowed to work within an existing wetland mitigation site, delineate the allowable work area by the cut and fill line. The contractor shall possess a permit identifying each wetland in which work is allowed.
Contact RWPlans@wsdot.wa.gov with Township, Range, Section, State Route (SR), and
Mileposts (MP) of the project, to obtain copies of the Sundry Site Plans that show existing mitigation sites on record.

Detention/Retention Sites

Show all facilities related to the detention, retention, and treatment, filtration, or drainage of stormwater or surface water, whether existing or to be constructed, on the construction contract plans and labeled as Stormwater Treatment Areas. It is important to identify stormwater treatment areas so they will not be misconstrued to be wetlands or mitigation areas in the future. 400.06(18)(d) Stream Plans
See Contract Plan Examples 4-30, 4-31 and 4-32
When realigning or regrading a stream or river as part of the contract, a Stream Plan, Stream
Profile, and Stream Details are required. The Stream plan set requires the stamp of an Engineer from the HQ Hydraulics Office.
Show the following information on Stream Plan set: •
Stream slope breaklines, the limits of fill and or excavation, begin and end of channel grading, and the centerline of the new stream alignment, with stationing increasing from downstream to upstream. •
Existing contours and existing features shown outside of the perimeter of the new stream. If major roadway changes are proposed, new contours and features may be appropriate in lieu of the existing contours in the vicinity of the roadway. •
Large Woody Material (LWM), boulder clusters, and/or scour holes, if included in the stream design. The following note must be added to the Stream Plan if LWM is included: “LOCATIONS AND ORIENTATION OF LARGE WOODY MATERIAL (LWM)
STRUCTURES AS SHOWN ON THIS SHEET ARE APPROXIMATE AND WILL BE STAKED BY
THE ENGINEER.”

•
If a culvert is included in the design, show the inside width of the culvert and wing walls. Culvert details may be incorporated into the Stream Plan, Profile and Details series; however, this may require a dual stamped set of plan sheets as this work is not done by the HQ Hydraulics Office.
The stream profile sheets will show the new grade relative to the existing grade. The depth of the streambed material will be depicted, also the beginning and ending of walls, culverts, and grading.
Informational quantities for channel excavation, streambed sediment, streambed cobbles, boulder clusters, and LWM structures, as well as structure excavation, and shoring, when appropriate.
Stream Details will require stream sections drawn facing upstream and show the grading design for the stream. Provide slope and width of streambed slope breaks.
Provide an appropriate note for streambed material referencing the Special Provisions, for example: ‘SEE SPECIAL PROVISION “AGGREGATES FOR STREAMS, RIVERS, AND

Paving/Pavement Marking Plan
See Contract Plan Examples 4-34, 4-35, and 4-39.
Paving and pavement marking information will normally be combined on a single series of plans.
If the project requires the paving information to be separate from the pavement marking information, the Paving Plan will show the total roadway and shoulder widths described by the roadway sections, not lane widths. The Pavement Marking Plans will show the lane configuration and widths. The information is not to be repeated on both series of plans.
The Paving/Pavement Marking Plan series may be necessary when the work cannot be shown adequately on the roadway sections. If the roadway sections adequately describe most of the project, only the areas requiring more detailed or specific information need be shown in
Paving/Pavement Marking Plans.
Pavement marking criteria is found in the Design Manual and the pavement marking applications are shown in the Standard Plans. Pavement marking layout information is not required in the plans if the required pavement markings are as shown in the Standard Plans.
Pavement marking quantities are to be tabulated on Quantity Tabulation sheets if not accurately shown elsewhere.
When Paving/Pavement Marking Plans are included, they will show all lane and shoulder widths, information on pavement taper lengths and widths, widening for guardrail, and the locations of concrete barrier, guardrail, impact attenuators, and traffic islands. The various areas and types of pavement marking will be identified by General Notes in the Quantity Tabulation sheets; if there is only minor pavement marking, the beginning and ending stations could be shown in the plan for each type in the area.
The only existing information that will appear on the Paving/Pavement Marking Plans will be the existing roadways and approaches beyond the point where the new construction begins or ends to show the tie between the new and existing. The “old” roadway and lane lines through the construction area are not to be shown.
If there is only minor drainage, signing, or illumination work on the project, it can be shown on the Paving/Pavement Marking Plans, provided it does not compromise the clarity of the paving and pavement marking information being shown.
Paving or pavement marking details showing the layout of traffic islands or other features (such as curb ramps) may need to be drawn at a larger scale on separate detail sheets to provide

Page 4-48

Contract Plans sufficient information or required dimensioning. These details will follow immediately after the
Paving/Pavement Marking Plan series. 400.06(20)
Plan Detail Sheet
See Contract Plan Example 4-36
Provide Plan Details sheets to help ensure the contractor has a clear picture of the work to be performed.
Organize plan details on plan sheets so they are grouped according to plan series. Place the detail sheets as the last set of plans in the plan series. For example, all of the drainage details will be grouped on the appropriate number of sheets and will become the last sheets in the
Drainage Plan series—normally following the drainage profiles.
It is important that details be complete, meaningful, and necessary. It is also important that details be drawn at a scale that will clearly show the information when placed on the 11-inch by 17-inch plan sheets.
Plan details are not to be a redrawn Standard Plan. Many times, however, it is necessary to draw details showing a project-specific modification to a Standard Plan. In these instances, sufficient detail is to be provided to indicate the modification, but all of the information on the Standard
Plan that is still applicable is not to be redrawn. Instead, a note stating “FOR INFORMATION NOT
SHOWN, SEE STANDARD PLAN X-XX” is to be included on the detail.
Details that are not associated with a Standard Plan must be complete, because the contractor is only obligated to provide what is shown on the detail.
The Electronic Engineering Data Standards Manual contains a number of generic or standard details found in the CAD system. Many of these details can be used as is, or they may be modified to fit requirements for a specific application. Use of these details can save both the designer and the CAD operator considerable time over developing and inputting details from scratch.

400.06(21)
Minor Structures
For projects with quantities for minor structures, such as nonstructural retaining walls (see
Section 8-24 of the Standard Specifications) or other like items of work, use one of the following methods to show these quantities in the plans in: • Show Quantities on Quantity Tabulation sheet(s). • Show Quantities in tabular form (in data boxes) on the individual plan sheet(s). 400.06(22)

The following information is required for Illumination Plans: 1. The location of light standards: new and existing. 2. The light standard number for new luminaires. 3. The location of the power source: whether new or existing. 4. The layout of the conduit and electrical circuitry. 5. The mounting height for new luminaires: for existing if being relocated. 6. The mast arm length for new luminaires: for existing if being relocated. 7. Base requirements, fixed or slip, for new luminaires: for existing if being relocated. 8. Conduit size and fill for new installation: for existing affected by, or affecting, the project. 9. Service cabinet requirements for new: or modifications to existing. 10. Junction box locations and types for new: for existing affected by, or affecting, the project. 11. Luminaire light source, distribution, and voltage for new luminaires. 12. All other features unique to the specific project. 400.06(22)(b)
Stationing and Offsets
Stationing and offsets, shown in the foundation schedule for light standard locations, are to be reasonably accurate to ensure the design light levels are achieved. 400.06(23)
Traffic Signal Plan
Traffic Signal Plans are normally provided by either the Region Traffic Office or the HQ Traffic
Office, and the designer simply incorporates them into the project. The Traffic Signal Plans will follow the guidelines in the Design Manual. 400.06(24)
Intelligent Transportation System Plan
See Contract Plan Example 4-42.
The Region Traffic Office normally provides Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Plans, and the designer simply incorporates them into the project. ITS design criteria is found in the
Design Manual.
Provide the appropriate base maps to the HQ Traffic Office showing the locations of all new and existing features, such as utilities, drainage pipes, and structures, so that these features can be taken into account during the initial design. Keep the traffic designer aware of all design revisions made to the plans from the time the initial layout was given to the traffic designer.

Sign Specification Plan Sheet
See Contract Plan Examples 4-43 and 4-44.
Prepare Sign Specification Plan sheets as 11-inch by 17-inch sheets plotted from CAD or an Excel program.
A separate Sign Specification Plan sheet will normally be prepared for the installation of new signs, the removal of signs, and the relocation of signs. If the signing work is minor, it is permissible to combine the different types of work on a single sheet, but there should be a distinct, identifiable section of the sheet for each type of work presented.
There will be a separate sign-numbering system for each of the three types of signing work, and each will be continuous from the beginning of the project to the end.
The Sign Specification Plan sheets are to be completely filled out.
Remember that the material stock used for the signs comes in 48-inch by 96-inch sheets, so sign sizes need to be adjusted to make the most efficient use of the stock material. The following guidelines should be used: •

For signs having a horizontal dimension of 48 inches or less, specify all dimensions in inches. •
For signs having a horizontal dimension of greater than 48 inches, specify all dimensions in feet and inches.
Wood posts are to be called out as nominal dimensions. A 4 x 4 (the common name for a 3-1/2" x 3-1/2" piece of lumber), 4 x 6, and so on, as long as there is no reference to inches.
When a sign installation requires multiple steel posts, specify which base type is to be used (see the Standard Plans for each multiple-post installation). 400.06(26)
Signing Plan
See Contract Plan Examples 4-45, 4-46, 4-47 and 4-48.
Signing design criteria is found in the Design Manual.
Signing will always be shown in a plan view; however, assess the need for the Signing Plan series. In many cases, there are not sufficient signs to require a separate series of plans. In these cases the signing information can be combined with another series, such as the
Paving/Pavement Marking Plan series, without affecting the clarity of the overall plan.
Signing Plans do not normally require a great deal of roadway detail. The centerline and edge of the roadway is normally all that is required for two-lane highways. For multilane highways, additional detail and roadway information may be required.
For region-wide signing projects, where an extensive area is covered, a smaller scale (even a strip map) can be used for directional sign placements. However, even in these instances, largerscale details may be required to show sign installations at intersections and other areas where there are numerous signs being installed in a small area.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Page 4-51 Contract Plans
Division 4
Signs will be located in the plans and identified using the plan sign number. For new installations, the plan sign number will be enclosed in an oval. The plan sign number for sign removals will be enclosed in a rectangle and “R-” will preceded the number. Sign relocations will show both the original and relocated locations of the sign and the plan sign number will be enclosed in a square. There will be a leader line from the plan sign number to the sign location.
Sign relocations will have two leader lines: a dashed line from the plan sign number to the original location and a solid line from the plan sign number to the relocated location.
Show the following on the Signing Plans: • Construction centerlines—all that is required for signing, such as destination and speed limit. • Basic roadway layout in areas where detail is required, such as intersections with considerable signing. • Sign locations. • Small-scale layout of directional and special signs, showing required details, such as where upper- and lower-case lettering is to be used, location of directional arrows, and so on.
Details may be placed on a separate sheet to avoid overcrowding of the plan. • Small-scale layout of standard control signs may be shown in the plans. This can be very helpful to both the contractor and the inspector. • Plan sign number with leader line pointing to sign location. • WSDOT Sign Fabrication code number adjacent to plan sign number. • Signs to be installed. • Signs to be removed. • Signs to be relocated. Show the sign locations for both the original, using a dashed leader line, and the relocated, using a solid leader line. • Power source for all illuminated signs. If the source is coincidental to an illumination or traffic signal system and shown on those plans, a construction note referencing the sheet where the source is identified will suffice. 400.06(27)
Signing Details
When overhead signs are being installed on a sign bridge or cantilever structure, show the following information on the Sign Specification and/or Sign Detail:
Page 4-52 •
Simple drawing of the new structure and signs

•
Distance between signs
Distance between signs and end supports or posts
Location of overhead signs in relation to lanes
Sign light spacing, when sign light(s) are required
Maintenance walkway position
Other data called for in the plans

Bridge Plan

Bridge Plans are prepared by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office. The designer may be required to provide field information for use by the HQ Bridge and Structures Office during the design.
Required data/guidelines are shown in the Design Manual.
Most projects with bridge construction will have items of work required because of the bridge work, but are indicated on the Bridge Plans as “not included in bridge quantities.” Provide the required PS&E information for these items.
Following are some of the items typically “not included in bridge quantities”: •
Drains •
Gravel backfill for drain •
Gravel backfill for wall •
Underdrain pipe behind or around abutments or walls •
Drain pipe in embankments at bridge ends •
Utility conduits and anchorage

•
Slope protection
Concrete barrier
Guardrail connections
The bridge designer will provide a list of items that are not included in the bridge work. 400.06(29)
Traffic Control Plan
See Contract Plan Examples 4-49 through 4-57.
As required in the highway administration rules and regulations (23 CFR 630 Subpart J), every project shall have a Transportation Management Plan (TMP) with a minimum requirement being a Temporary Traffic Control Plan or Traffic Control Plans (TCPs). The TCPs may be typical, sitespecific, or project-specific plans with a primary consideration for public safety, worker safety, and maintaining mobility for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians (including pedestrians with disabilities) through or around a work zone. (See the Design Manual for further guidance.)
The Plan Sheet Library includes many typical TCPs to consider as a starting point for developing contract traffic control plans. The Work Zone Traffic Control Guidelines Manual for Maintenance
Operations, and figures in the MUTCD Part 6H have additional examples, though not specifically intended to contract use.
Contract TCPs need to provide a biddable and constructable method for managing road user impacts and completing the work. The contractor is required to adopt the contract plans in writing or develop their own for the engineer’s acceptance. Because of the complexity of balancing public and worker safety, maintaining a level of mobility and project constructability needs, TCPs need to be developed with a great deal of thought by a designer with an understanding of all the project features to be constructed, how they will be constructed, as well as an understanding of temporary traffic control principles and requirements. The TCP

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 4-53 Contract Plans
Division 4 designer should be aware of any design changes to ensure the TCPs developed will still address all the project’s work zone impacts.
Bid item(s) need to be included for all devices shown on the TCPs and specific traffic control labor items like flaggers, Traffic Control Supervisor, and other traffic control labor. The standard specifications may need to be revised or supplemented with General Special Provision (GSPs) or project special provisions to include all items or revise standard item use. Review the TCPs to ensure all items required for traffic control and bidding are shown as either separate bid items or included in bid items for a lump sum bid if approved by the proper delegated authority. 400.07
Example Plan Sheets
This section provides examples of typical PS&E plan sheets showing general plan requirements.
These examples are strictly for informational purposes. Final approval of plan sheets will be in accordance with this manual and the Region Plans Review Office.

When all mining is completed in this quarry site , all disturbed areas shall be seeded, fertilized, and mulched with special erosion control mix. 5. Drainage shall be towards the south end of the site. 6. Scalpings shall be used on the quarry floor and on the sides to obtain the side slope. It may be necessary to haul additional borrow material into site to construct the side slopes for ultimate reclamation. 7. All pit boundaries shall be fenced with Type 2 wire fencing including a 20 foot wide gate at the haul road as first order of work. ,..., 0::

Notes to the Designer: 1) The need for this plan is to show right of way boundaries and provide data for surveying in right of way. '°I~ 2) This example shows right of way as a separate plan. This was done because combining right of way with other plan information such as alignment would have made it too busy for one plan. If your project's right of way can be shown with alignment information without creating plan confusion then do so. Refer to Division 400.06(9) of the
Plans Preparation Manual for information on what a right of way plan should show. :Ji,., ""SECTION CORNER FOUND
IRON PIPE 3) In this example the right of way alignment is the same as the construction alignment.
When the right of way alignment is coincidental with the construction centerline, an equation is provided at the begin of project to tie right of way and construction stationing together. Construction stationing is then used to show offset distances to right of way and other contract information. Refer to Division 400.06(9) of the Plans Preparation Manual.

Note to the Designer: 2) In most situations, alignment information will be combined with right of way information on one plan sheet unless showing both would create too much congestion on the plans, or other conditions listed in PPM DIV. 400.06(9) are met. llN;;­SEE SHEET
AL7 3) In this example the right of way alignment is the same as the construction alignment.
When the right of way alignment is coincidental with the construction centerline then an equation is provided at the begin of project to tie right of way and construction stationing together. Construction stationing is then used to show offset distances to right of way and other contract information.
THE BASIS OF BEARINGS AND DISTANCES ARE DETERMINED FROM
WASHINGTON COORDINATE SYSTEM NAD 83(91) SOUTH ZONE.
THE COMBINED FACTOR IS DERIVED BY MULITIPLING THE ELEVATION
FACTOR OF 0.99998687 BY THE SCALE FACTOR OF 0.99998159.

NOTE TO DESIGNER:
REFER TO INFORMATION IN DIVISION 400.06(9) OF THE
PLANS PREPARATION MANUAL FOR HELP IN PREPARING
AN ALIGNMENT PLAN.
IN THIS EXAMPLE THE ALIGNMENT INFORMATION WAS
COMBINED WITH THE SITE PREPARATION
INFORMATION TO FORM ONE PLAN SHEET. COMBINING
THIS INFORMATION IS ACCEPTABLE, (REFER TO DIVISION 400.06(9) OF THE PLANS
PREPARATION MANUAL) AND WAS DONE BECAUSE
THERE WERE EXTENSIVE CONSTRUCTION
EASEMENTS AND RIGHT OF WAY REVISIONS THAT WERE
BEST VIEWED ON A SEPARATE RIGHT OF
WAY PLAN. IN MOST SITUATIONS, ALIGNMENT
INFORMATION WILL BE COMBINED WITH RIGHT
OF WAY INFORMATION ON ONE PLAN SHEET UNLESS
SHOWING BOTH WOULD CREATE TOO
MUCH CONGESTION ON THE PLANS, OR OTHER
CONDITIONS LISTED IN SECTION 460.09 ARE MET.

Introduction
Special Provisions
Format
600.01 Introduction
Contract Provisions are legally enforceable specifications to contracts formed between the
Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and contractors.
The HQ Construction Office desires to maintain consistency, accuracy, and legality with project specifications. For this reason, a project designer should always try to use the specifications listed in the Standard Specifications or General Special Provisions (GSPs). It is not uncommon for a project to have a method of work or a working window of time that differs from those listed in the Standard Specifications. There are also items of work that are region-specific and as such aren’t covered in the Standard Specifications. In the case of a region nonstandard item of work, the region may write Region General Special Provisions (RGSPs) to describe the work.
In some cases where there is a nonstandard item of work in a project, a Project-Specific Special
Provision may be written to describe the work. Consult with your Region Plans office or ASCE prior to writing a Project-Specific Special Provision. Approval of Project-Specific Special
Provisions or revisions to already established Standard Specifications, GSPs or RGSPs must be given by the HQ Construction Office for Divisions 1-8 or any standalone provisions, and HQ
Materials Lab for changes to Division 9. Consult with the Assistant State Construction Engineer (ASCE) for assistance in obtaining approval from the Approval Authority. Approval authorities for
Project-Specific Special Provisions or changes to the Standard Specification, GSPs or RGSP, are all listed in the Construction Manual. In the case of federally funded projects, changes to Standard
Specifications, and GSPs and RGSPs in Divisions 1-02 though 1-09 that change policy, intent or potentially affect Federal eligibility will also require FHWA approval (see Section 600.02(4)). The
Region and ASCE work collaboratively when FHWA approval is required.
Once a new RGSP has been approved by the HQ Construction Office or Materials Lab, if not modified, it can then be used on future projects without being submitted for another approval, unless the instructions for the RGSP state that approval is required for each project.
Project-specific Special Provisions, when approved are only to be used on the project for which they were written. They cannot be used on another project without reacquiring HQ approval.
When referencing the Standard Specifications in a Project-Specific Special Provision, the headings from the Standard Specifications are never to be changed. When a section of the
Standard Specifications is “Vacant,” do not to use these sections when drafting a Project-Specific
Special Provision.

2. 3. 4. 5. 600.01(2) PS&E Word Program
This section discusses the PS&E Word Program, GSPs, RGSPs and project-specific provisions.
The Special Provisions sections of the Contract Provisions are created using the WSDOT “PS&E
Word Program”. Each GSP and RGSP is given a unique file name. That file name is a number that corresponds to the section of the Standard Specifications being supplemented or revised by the document. Project-specific provisions are assigned a unique file name by the writer of the document.
The designer makes a list, called the run-list, of the applicable file names, and the computer system compiles the actual documents in the order requested on the run-list.
The PS&E Word Program is a Microsoft Word based macro program that creates uniform project specifications using pre-loaded templates and pre-approved special provisions. The program allows the designer to access the GSPs through the region’s computer network system and enables designers to: •
Read the documents. •
Compile the run-list. •
Write the project-specific information.

600.02 Special Provisions 600.02(1) General
The Special Provisions consist of the General Special Provisions (GSPs), Region General Special
Provisions (RGSPs), and the project-specific provisions. 600.02(2) General Specical Provisions (GSPs)
GSPs are provisions that are written to cover legal and construction requirements that may occur on a project. They supplement or revise the Standard Specifications and are written to provide statewide standardization for the work covered. The State Construction Engineer, or delegated authority, is the approving authority for all changes made to the Standard
Specifications, including GSPs. Consequently, after approval, these are available for use, in their original state, for multiple projects without modification beyond the fill-ins.
The Index to the GSPs contains the file name, section heading, date of last revision, and instructions for use.
The GSP file names are directly related to the divisions in the Standard Specifications. For example, 8-01.3.OPT1.GR8 would be a GSP that either revises or supplements Section 8-01.3.
The extension GR (General Roadway) is followed by the division number of the Standard
Specification. The file name 8-01.3 refers to the section (8-01) and subsection (03) in the division. A FR extension (ie. FR8) indicates that a fill in is required by the designer which will be described in the GSP index.) A GB or FB extension indicates that the bridge office is the author of the GSP.
Use the GSP as is if it is applicable to the project being developed. HQ Construction Office approval is needed for any revisions to GSPs. After HQ approval, any GSP that is revised will become a Project-Specific Special Provision and the date will be removed and replaced with (******).

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 6-3 Contract Provisions and PS&E Word Users Guide
Division 6 600.02(3) Region General Special Provisions (RGSPs)
RGSPs are provisions that are written to cover the legal and construction requirements that occur on projects that correspond to region needs. They supplement or revise the Standard
Specifications and are written to provide regionwide standardization for the work covered.
RGSPs are approved for region use by the Assistant State Construction Engineer or delegated authority. After initial approval, an RGSP can be incorporated into your contract package. Any modifications to an already approved RGSP require resubmittal to the Assistant State
Construction Engineer or delegated authority.
The Index to the RGSPs contains the file name with a region identifier, section heading, date of last revision, and instructions for use.
The RGSP file extension has a region identifier assigned to each region after the file name. The identifier is .DT1 through .DT6 depending on what region is applicable. For example, 8-01.DT1 would be for the Northwest Region.
The file extensions for each region are provided on the following table.

600.02(4) Project-Specific Special Provisions
The project-specific provisions are written by the designer to supplement or revise information in the Standard Specifications to make them fit the project being developed. Project-specific provisions are not to duplicate information contained in the Standard Specifications, GSPs, or plans.
Approval of project-specific specifications that alter the Standard Specifications (WSDOT Spec. book) is required prior to inclusion in the contract. Send all project-specific specifications, along with justification, to the Assistant State Construction Engineer, or delegated authority for concurrence and approval.
Special provisions prepared by a support group must be reviewed to ensure they fit within the specifications/Special Provisions of the project. Any changes to a support group Special
Provision must have concurrence and approval prior to sending it to the State Construction
Engineer, or delegated authority.
FHWA retains approval authority for any modifications to Division 1-02 through 1-09 of the
Standard Specifications, General or Region General Special Provisions, and any Project-Specific
Special Provisions on Federal-aid contracts that: Change policy, Change content that may
Page 6-4

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 6
Contract Provisions and PS&E Word Users Guide materially affect the specification’s intent, or Change content that may affect federal eligibility or involve federal regulations. Therefore, any proposed revisions to Divisions 1-02 through 1-09 must be presented to the State Construction Office as early as possible to determine if FHWA approval will be required. If FHWA approval of a Project-Specific Special Provision is required, allow a minimum of 30 days to submit the changes and receive comments or FHWA acceptance.
If FHWA approval of a Project-Specific Special Provision is required, the project cannot be advertised prior to receiving that approval.
Project-specific provisions are actually project-specific supplements or revisions to the Standard
Specifications. Base the content of Project-SpecificSpecial Provision on the related information provided in the Standard Specifications. Because field inspectors and others refer to the
Standard Specifications during the course of construction, and are accustomed to the style and approach used there, consider using that document as a template and design tool when writing
Project-Specific Special Provisions.
Project-specific provisions will include six asterisks in parentheses (******). See the PS&E Word
User Guide for more information.
If there is a missing heading or subheading file from the standard specifications, contact
Standard Specifications@WSDOT.wa.gov to set up another one that can be added.

600.03 Format 600.03(1) General
Special Provisions follow the format of the Standard Specifications. Most of the information will appear under the same main headings as the division headings in the Standard Specifications.
Generally, Divisions 2 through 8 in the Standard Specifications each have the following five sections: 1. Description 2. Materials 3. Construction Requirements 4. Measurement 5. Payment
There will be occasions when the work being performed does not fall under one of the divisions in the Standard Specifications and the designer will have to write a complete new specification called a stand alone special provision. However, when drafting a special provision always provide information for all five sections listed. Stand Alone Special Provisions do not revise or supplement divisions. In these types of specials, do not include a reference to a division being supplemented or revised. Whenever possible, include references to established standard specifications to avoid conflicts between the standard specifications and language in the stand alone special provision.
Prior to writing a special provision, first assess the need to for it based on a thorough analysis of the related section(s) of the Standard Specifications. When drafting a Special Provision, strike a balance between providing too much information and too little information, with the goal of addressing the issue raised by the original need for the provision, without creating undue burden on the contractor or inspector in their effort(s) to implement it.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 6-5 Contract Provisions and PS&E Word Users Guide
Division 6 600.03(2) Description
The description is a brief statement of what the work is, written in the following format example: “This work shall consist of removing and disposing of concrete inlets.”
If the work is “furnishing and installing modified catch basins,” a description would not be required, since the description in Section 7-05 of the Standard Specifications covers the construction of all kinds of manholes, inlets, and catch basins. The writer could move on to the materials section and explain any differences in the materials for the modified catch basin.
If a description is required, it will not contain: •
Detailed information, such as station limits of the work or quantities. •
Phrases like “as detailed in the Plans,” “as shown in the Plans,” or “as directed by the
Engineer.” (see below)
Note that the location of items of work are required to be in the plans. It is not necessary to keep stating this in the Special Provisions.
Engineers do not direct the work on the project—they administer the project. The only work that is “directed” by the Engineer is force account work and work that is done off the project; for example, “the Contractor shall deliver the salvaged material to the maintenance site and stack it as directed by the Engineer.”

600.03(3) Materials
The Materials section will normally reference the appropriate section of the Standard
Specifications or the appropriate section of a nationally recognized material specification such as
AASHTO or ASTM.
Provide all information about materials in the Materials section of the Special Provisions. If a detail in the plans has materials information on it, do not repeat the information in the Special
Provisions. However, provide a reference to that information in the Special Provisions to let the reader know where to find the information. For example, a statement such as “Materials requirements for (work item X) are on the detailin the Plans” is all that is required. Do not indicate a specific plan sheet number, but rather reference a series of plans (such as Drainage
Plans or Drainage Details) using the same wording as shown on the Index sheet, so the information can be easily found.
The Standard Specifications defines the requirements for materials used in road and bridge construction. There are occasions when the regions have the need to change these requirements by Special Provision. Consult with the Construction Materials Engineer at the HQ
Materials Laboratory and request concurrence with the specification change prior to including the Special Provision in the contract documents.
In some situations, the regions may have a need to reduce the testing frequency of certain materials. This can be accomplished by one of the two following methods: •
Before construction: Contact the Construction Materials Engineer at the HQ Materials
Laboratory and request concurrence with the frequency change prior to reducing the testing frequency. •
During construction: Follow the guidance in Section 9-1.1B of the Construction Manual,
Reducing Frequency of Testing.

Page 6-6
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 6
Contract Provisions and PS&E Word Users Guide
To change the testing requirements of a material, such as testing aggregate by visual inspection, request and obtain approval from the HQ Construction Materials Engineer.
When writing a materials specification that includes a revision to Division 9 materials requirements, include the materials requirements within the Special Provision it pertains to—do not place the materials specification in Division 9. 600.03(4) Construction Requirements
Write the construction requirements section so that it clearly describes the work to be performed, and requirements that need to be met, in order for the work to be considered complete. Do not specify how to do perform the work, or explain why the work needs to be done.
When possible, construction requirements are to be shown in the order in which the work is to be performed.
In cases where a detail in the plans is a useful resource for the contractor related to the special, provide a statement in this section such as “construct the (work item X) as detailed in the
Plans.” 600.03(5) Measurement
The measurement statement describes how the work or material will be measured, not the pay item name. For example, write “measure the removal of linear feet of drainage structures,” not “Removing Drainage Structures,” (pay item name), or “measure culvert pipe,” not “Schedule A
Culv. Pipe 12 In. Diam.” (pay item name).
Review the measurement statement found in the Standard Specifications prior to drafting this section. Many times, that section will apply to items that may seem project-specific. For example, if the project has the item "Special Culv. Pipe 12 In. Diam.," the measurement statement found in the Standard Specifications applies to all culvert pipe: standard, special, modified, and so on.
To be complete, the measurement statement needs to include not only the unit of measure, but information as to when and where the measurement will be made. For example, “The length of culvert pipe or pipe arch will be the number of linear feet of completed installation measured along the invert.”

600.03(6) Payment
Write the bid item in the payment statement in quotes, followed by the unit of measure.
The bid item must exactly match the same name found in the Summary of Quantities; for example, “Adjust Catch Basin”, per each. Generally this is all that would be required for the payment statement.
If there is additional work associated with the item, the payment statement needs to also describe the work included. For example: “Removing Manhole”, per each.
The unit contract price per each for “Removing Manhole” shall include all costs for sawcutting existing pavement associated with the removal.
For example, if sawcutting is required and is to be included in the cost of the catch basin removal, make sure that the work is described in the appropriate section of the Special
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 6-7 Contract Provisions and PS&E Word Users Guide
Division 6
Provision, and not only found as a statement in the Payment section as being required and included in the cost of the item.

600.03(7) Text General Guidelines
Special Provisions and the plans shall adhere to the following general guidelines: 1. Write in a clear, concise, and complete manner. 2. Avoid the use of nonstandard words or numerous cross-references to other specifications. Use terminology consistent with the Standard Specifications, WSDOT Manuals, or other Industry
References. 3. When cross-referencing is necessary, ensure the provision is capable of standing alone as an explanatory document. 4. Place punctuation outside the quotation marks used with a bid item. 5. Capitalize the defined words within the text. Defined words are listed in Section 1-01 of the
Standard Specifications. 6. Use "all costs" or "all expenses," but not both. 7. Use "as shown in the Plans" rather than "as shown on the Plans." 8. Avoid repetition of information available from other parts of the contract document, including the Standard Specifications. 9. Avoid abbreviations, except for those included within a bid item name. 10. Use the word "shall" to denote work to be done by the Contractor. 11. Use the word "will" to denote something the State is to do. 12. Do not use "Incidental to and included in" as a combination phrase. "Incidental to" refers to a general type of work, such as earthwork or paving, whereas "included in" links payment to a specific item of work. 13. Avoid "As directed by the Engineer." Both "As designated by the Engineer" or "As staked by the
Engineer" are applicable within the project limits. 14. Avoid using "to the satisfaction of the Engineer." If enough information is available to describe a standard of work, the description is preferable. 15. Avoid "and/or" where possible. For example, "steel, wood, or both" is preferable to "steel and/or wood." 16. Avoid "as per" as a substitute for "in accordance with." 17. Use alpha notation when referring to a number of things; for example, install two catch basins. 18. Express all measurement units in Arabic numerals; for example, 6 inches, 20 feet, 1.5 miles, and so on. 19. Express counted numbers as follows: •
Spell out numbers 1 through 10 (for example, six working days, seven catch basins, and so on). •
Use Arabic numerals for numbers larger than 10 (for example, 35 working days, 24 hours, and so on).
Page 6-8

Contract Provisions and PS&E Word Users Guide • •

Spell out all numbers that begin a sentence. If your sentence starts with a large number, try to reconfigure your sentence.
Do not use Arabic and spelled-out numbers together.

700.01 General Requirements 700.01(1) Federal and State Contract Participation Goals
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goals for federally funded projects are condition of award goals. In order for the bid to be considered responsive, the low bidder must either meet the established goal or demonstrate Good Faith Efforts in meeting the goal. The HQ External
Civil Rights Office is part of the HQ Office of Equal Opportunity (OEO). This group establishes these goals and monitors DBE participation. State funded projects have participation goals including Disadvantaged Minority, Small, Veterans, and Women Owned Business Enterprises.
Prior to Advertisement, contact the OEO to establish goals, obtain Special Training hours, and determine which WSDOT General Special Provision (GSP) is needed for your project.
Contact email: WSDOT OEO Goal Requests
For more information, see the Construction Manual, Advertisement and Award Manual and
Standard Specifications. 700.01(2) Alternate/Cumulative Bids 700.01(2)(a)
Alternate Bids
It is, at times, desirable to solicit bids using alternates for specific bid items for work to be performed under the contract. The contract Estimate, Proposal, and Summary of Quantities will be divided into sections. One section will contain the base information, and there will be a section for each of the alternates. This requires the contractor to bid the base portion of the project and to bid the alternates as required by the Special Provisions. By comparing the base bid plus the alternate bids, WSDOT is able to determine the most economical combination.
One of the conditions of setting up a project in this manner is that WSDOT has to treat each of the alternates as equal, and make the decision regarding which is the best bid based on the lowest cost Alternate Plus Base Bid.
This is different than allowing the contractor the latitude to choose between different material options available for a contract item.
For additional information concerning alternates, refer to the EBASE Users Guide. 700.01(2)(b)

Cumulative Alternative Bids
Use in contracts when the award process is modified to include Cumulative Alternates. The
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.08
Page 7-1 Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
Division 7 region shall determine and notify the Ad and Award Office of the Funds Available. The bid items shall be segregated into a Base Bid and Alternates, as appropriate. Fill-ins consist of a brief description of the portion of the project or of the work that is included in the noted Alternates.
The specification language may be adjusted to suit the number of Alternates.
For further information on how this is to be used in a project, see Division 1-02.6, General
Special Provisions. 700.01(3) Addenda
Addenda are revisions to the plans and contract provisions that are made during the advertising period. Addenda are to be issued only when the revision will affect the contractor’s ability to provide a responsive bid. Consult with the Region Plans Office to coordinate preparation and notification of addenda to plan holders.
Items to be considered for preparing addenda, which would affect the scope of work and the contractor’s ability to accurately bid the project, might include: • Material specification changes. • New bid item(s). • A substantial quantity revision (generally, a 25% or greater increase or decrease) for an item in the bid documents. • A revision to a legal requirement in the contract. • A new supplement or a revision to the Special Provisions. • Contract errors and omissions that create conflicts.
Small adjustments to quantities, spelling, and punctuation, and design changes that do not affect quantity and relocation of items of work within the project will not normally require an addendum because they will not affect the way the contractor bids the project. These items are not to be ignored, but the information, in the form of revised plan sheets, need only be passed along to the office of the construction project engineer, so they can be incorporated into the project and given to the contractor that is awarded the project.
For example: • Addenda Not Required: The advertised project has 23 catch basins to be installed, and it is discovered that an additional catch basin, not shown on the plans, will be required. This would not warrant an addendum if this were the only change being made. The small change in quantity will not impact the contractor’s bid. This can be handled under construction as any other increase in quantity. • Addenda Required: The addition of the one catch basin causes the 18-inch-diameter pipe item to increase from 985 feet to 1,250 feet. This increase in pipe length is greater than 125% of the original, which could cause this item to be renegotiated under the contract, so the addendum would be justified. Since the addendum is required for the pipe, the additional catch basin would also be included in the addendum.
For instructions and procedures on preparing addenda, see the Appendices.

700.01(4) Reference Information
Reference Information is information available to the contractor during the bidding period that is not part of contractual documents (see Standard Specification 1-04.3). Reference information needs to be provided electronically on WSDOT’s ftp directory linked to the Contract’s
Page 7-2
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 7
Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
Advertisement webpage. Reference Information to be provided includes, but is not limited to: 1. Survey Information: If you provide electronic data Reference Information, it is recommended you provide the existing ground DTM, the finished grade DTM, and alignment and project control file. The electronic DTMs can be provided in XML format that is universally accepted by other earthwork software. 2. Cross sections or Roll plots. 3. Structural Reference Information: Include bridge inspection reports for all bridges within the project limits and as-built plans for all bridges which are being modified as part of the
Project scope including but not limited to widening, repair, retrofit (rail, seismic, etc.), painting, overlay and paving. Structural Reference Information should be listed by bridge number. 4. Geotechnical Reports - Include full reports electronically including all supplements, amendments, test pit data, and borings. For all reports include the title, author, and date.
The Summary of Geotechnical Considerations and borings should be included in the
Appendices of the Contract to ensure they are a contractual document. 5. Final Hydraulics Design Reports. 6. Other Text Reports.
No guarantee or warranty is made by the Contracting Agency that the content of Reference
Information is accurate. For further detailed information, review Division 1-04 of the WSDOT
Construction Manual and the WSDOT Advertisement and Award Manual. Contact your Assistant
State Design Engineer (ASDE) for more information.
There are rare cases where the project office may want to keep the information on the website after ad and award. In this case, special fees may apply. Contact the HQ Contract Ad & Award
Office for additional information.

700.01(5) Standard Plans
WSDOT’s Standard Plans are made a part of contracts by reference in the Special Provisions.
Whenever possible, utilize the Standard Plans in conjunction with Standard Pay Items.
Standardized work results in less documentation, fewer change orders, reduced construction costs, and greater maintainability. Do not draw plan details that duplicate Standard Plans. In certain circumstances a plan detail may need to be developed that is very closely modeled off a
Standard Plan in order to make a construction feature work with site specific constraints. In these cases, consult with Region and HQ subject matter experts to determine feasibility and potential documentation needs. 700.01(6) Competitive Bidding, Proprietary Items, and Use of the Qualified
Products List (QPL) 700.01(6)(a)
Competitive Bidding
WSDOT uses competitively acquired products to fulfill the requirements of a contract whenever feasible. This helps achieve the lowest prices, the best product quality, and the most efficient use of resources.
There are several ways to specify bid items or materials in a contract that create a competitive bidding environment. Following are three different methods, listed in order of preference:
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Page 7-3 Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
Division 7 1. Specifying by Standard or Nonstandard Bid Items
This method does not use brand names. The contractor is allowed to choose the product, as long as it meets the requirements of the Standard Specifications and contract provisions. This method fosters a competitive bidding environment and does not require approval for proprietary items. 2. Specifying Brand Names and Allowing for Approved Equals
When brand name specifying, provide the bidder with options by naming at least two products or manufacturers that are acceptable and allow for “approved equals” followed by a performance specification. When this is done, no approval is required for usage; it is not considered a proprietary item.
A good specification for brand name specifying will read as follows:
The (type of product) furnished shall be (brand name, model), (brand name, model), or an approved equal having the following features (functions): a. (feature) b. (feature) c. (feature)
In order to find the two acceptable items, look for certain features or functions. These features or functions are the ones that need to be clearly identified in the Special
Provision. 3. Specifying at Least Three Brand Names
Listing a reasonable number (three or more) of brand names/models that are acceptable is a competitive bidding environment also and doesn’t require approval. A performance specification is not required. 700.01(6)(b)
Specifying Proprietary Items

There are instances in which competitive bidding may not or cannot be provided and a specific proprietary product is allowed. This applies to temporary items/ materials as well as permanent items/materials incorporated into the project.
WSDOT has adopted the following policy for use of proprietary items on all projects. Use of proprietary items must meet at least one of the following and are approved at the region level: 1. It is purchased or obtained through competitive bidding with equally suitable other items (the three methods found above). 2. It is certified and approved that: a. The proprietary item is essential for synchronization with existing highway facilities.
Synchronization may be based on: • Function (the proprietary product is necessary for the satisfactory operation of the existing facility. A product could be essential due to the fact that it has been tested with other components and is documented to work with existing components or that it is a one-of-a-kind item. A product or manufacturer could be essential because using anything else would require replacing other components of the existing highway system,
Page 7-4
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 7
Miscellaneous Contract Considerations • Aesthetics (the proprietary product is necessary to match the visual appearance of existing facilities), • Logistics (the proprietary product is interchangeable with products in an agency’s maintenance inventory), or • Any combination thereof with region approval.
Or, with region approval: b. No other equally suitable alternative exists: • The product (or manufacturer) is one of a kind. • Other workable alternative products or manufacturers are not equal in longevity, cost, delivery, durability, compatibility, warranty, and so on. 3. It is used for research or for a distinctive type of construction on relatively short sections of road. It is for experimental purposes to obtain experimental information on a product or manufacturer for the public good. When requesting this type of usage, approval documentation showing the scheduling, monitoring, results, and conclusion are needed. 700.01(6)(c)
Using Proprietary Items in Contracts
Before inclusion in the PS&E and prior to advertisement, request and receive written region approval for any proprietary material, work, manufacturer, or product included in a project.
Submit a memorandum of justification to the approval authority in sufficient time for it to be reviewed and acted upon.
There are two basic types of requests that can be submitted for approval: • Use of the proposed proprietary item will be allowed for regionwide or statewide use, referred to as a “blanket certification” (this is usually valid for a biennium). Place a copy of the original certification in the Project File.
Find all current blanket certification memos by selecting the Tools templates & links tab on the Design tools & support website. • Use of the proposed proprietary item will be allowed for a specific project only (just for the duration of the project). Retain the original signed region approval in the Project File.
Approval of a proprietary item does not override the federal specification for foreign steel (Buy
America) or the applicable General Special Provisions (GSP, Division 1).
When a proprietary item has been certified or approved, provide in the Special Provisions the product manufacturer, model, model number, and any additional information required to ensure only the specified item will be furnished. There will usually be only one item named in the Special Provisions when listing a proprietary item. The phrase “or approved equal” will never follow the naming of a proprietary item in a Special Provision. There are no options allowed. The contractor’s bid is to reflect the price to supply and incorporate the one item specified. 700.01(6)(d)

Using the Qualified Products List (QPL)
There is a definite difference between specifying a proprietary item and specifying a brand name, and using the Qualified Products List (QPL) which has nothing to do with either proprietary or brand name specifying.
The QPL is a list of products and materials that have been preapproved for use on WSDOT
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 7-5 Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
Division 7 projects. If the contractor chooses to provide items listed on the QPL, there is no need to submit a Request for Approval of Materials. For some products or materials on the QPL, there is no requirement to submit the items for testing prior to using the product or material on the project. However, the listing of a product in the QPL does not preclude the need for a proprietary item request if the conditions described in the previous sections apply.
The preapproval of items in the QPL does not mean they are the only products or materials that will be allowed. The contractor can provide any product or material that meets the specifications, whether they are listed in the QPL or not. 700.01(7) Buy America
For projects with federal funding in any phase (Right of Way, Design, or Construction), Buy
America obligates steel and iron construction material permanently incorporated into the project greater than $2,500, to be manufactured in the United States of America. Incorporate
GSPs associated with Buy America requirements as necessary. Check with the HQ Design Office during project development to verify whether or not Buy America is required for the project.
Check with HQ Construction Office for contract compliance related inquiries during construction. Use this link to review the Buy America memorandum from FHWA and the HQ
Design/Construction Offices:  https://wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2021­ 12/BuyAmericaMemo.pdf.
Due to the conditions set forth by Buy America, both new and salvaged materials fall under the same requirements when applied to Buy America.
Buy America requirements do not apply to steel items that are considered to be temporary, such as form work or false work. Projects involving Federal Transit Administration funds have
Buy America requirements as well.
For more information see the following links for Buy America requirements. •

FHWA: https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/construction/contracts/buyam_qa.cfm •
FTA: https://www.transit.dot.gov/buyamerica 700.01(8) Legal Relations and Responsibilities to the Public
Section 1-07 of the Standard Specifications requires the contractor to comply with all federal,
Tribal, state, or local laws and regulations that affect work under the contract. These laws and regulations do not need to be identified in the contract. However, certain project-specific regulations, such as permits, agreements, MOUs, licenses, variances, or others, and our commitment to meet them need to be identified in the contract. Examples of such regulations with conditions that need to be part of the contract are: HPA, EIS, Noise Variance, Shoreline
Permit, Department of Ecology MOU, and other documents that would affect or restrict work on the contract.
In many cases, the GSPs will trigger the need for the text of such documents to be listed in the
Special Provision, either as a fill-in or as an appendix. When construction activities require the need for a permit, variance, agreement, MOU, or other regulations, always discuss the need for such documents to be put in the contract with the appropriate region support personnel or region plans office.

Decommissioning of Wells Procedure
The Geotechnical Design Manual Chapter 3 and the Design Manual Chapter 610 provide policy and procedure for protection and decommissioning of wells. Contact the Geotechnical office for support on decommissioning wells during project development.
See Plans Preparation Manual Division 4 Contract Plans for instruction on showing wells in the plans. The Electronic Engineering Data Standards Manual provides symbology for wells. 700.01(9) Washington State Laws
Following is a partial listing of laws that are frequently used in the administration of WSDOT contracts: 1. RCW 4.24.360: Any clause in a construction contract that disallows a contractor, subcontractor, or supplier any damages due to unreasonable delays in performance caused by WSDOT is void and unenforceable. 2. RCW 18.27.090: Contractors are exempt from contractor registration laws provided they are prequalified by WSDOT. 3. RCW 18.104.048: Prior notice of well construction, reconstruction, or decommissioning of wells is required (see 700.01(8)(a)). 4. RCW 19.122.040: Existing utility locations (see 400.06 for the contents of this RCW). 5. RCW 39.12: Wages (see Section 1-07.9 of the Standard Specifications). 6. RCW 39.19: See the GSP concerning minority and women’s businesses. 7. RCW 46.44: Vehicle weight limitations within project boundaries. 8. RCW 47.28.030: State Force Work and materials (see 700.09(10)(a)). 9. RCW 47.28.035: Related to RCW 47.28.030, State Force Work and materials (see 700.09(10)(b)). 10. RCW 47.28.070: Prequalification of contractors (see Section 1-02.1 of the Standard
Specifications). 11. RCW 47.28.100: Contractors are allowed 20 days after award to execute a contract. WSDOT may extend this time no more than an additional 20 days (see Sections 1-03.3 and 1-03.5 of the Standard Specifications). 12. RCW 47.28.120: Contractors must file their claims within 180 days after acceptance (see
Section 1-09.9 of the Standard Specifications). 13. RCW 47.30: Requirements for paths and trails. 14. RCW 49.28: Wages – overtime. 15. RCW 60.28.011: WSDOT must hold 5% of the contract amount in reserve for material and worker claims. Contractors can post a bond in lieu of the reserve fund (see Section 1-09.9 of the Standard Specifications). 16. RCW 78.44: A Contract Reclamation Plan is required for every WSDOT contract that contains a WSDOT-furnished materials source (see 400.06).
Some of the laws are referenced in the Standard Specifications or the GSPs; some are not. In either case, these laws are not to be altered. All Special Provisions that appear to alter a law

should be questioned. 700.01(10) Asbestos
There are GSPs that are to be included in the contract provisions regarding asbestos presence or absence in the project work. Provide the asbestos Good Faith Inspection report as part of the bid package to notify contractors of the presence or absence of asbestos containing materials prior to bid opening. Consult Environmental Manual Chapter 447 for detailed policy. 700.01(11) Permits
Ensure all permits necessary for the project are completed and signed prior to the project going to Ad. However, in the event this cannot be accomplished, it is the responsibility of the region to determine the risk involved in going to Ad without the completed permit, in accordance with the Advertisement and Award Manual. Refer to the Design Manual and Environmental Manual for more information on types of permits and associated requirements. 700.01(12) Training Goals
The bid item for “Training” is to be provided on most federal-aid projects. For projects with federal-aid dollars, 23 CFR Part 230.111 requires all state highway agencies to review projects to determine their ability to support the inclusion of “Training Special Provisions” hours. The training goals, in terms of the total number of training hours required, are established by the
HQ External Civil Rights Office. The number of training hours, if assigned to a project, is based on the following: • Total estimated project labor hours • Availability of minorities, women, and other disadvantaged individuals • Potential for effective training • Duration of the contract • Dollar value of the contract • Anticipated workforce size • Project location • Scopes of work
The region may submit a training recommendation for consideration by the HQ External Civil
Rights Office. If the region is submitting a training recommendation, it needs to provide an estimation of total projected project labor hours.
Note: If you have any questions regarding either of the two programs referred to above, please contact the WSDOT Office of Equal Opportunity at 360-705-7090. 700.01(13) Assigning the Risk
It is important that the contractor be able to determine whether the risks on the project will be the contractor’s responsibility or will be borne by WSDOT. In most cases, it is best to assign the risk to WSDOT. This keeps the contractor from having to inflate bid prices to offset the possible risks of doing the work. These inflated prices cost WSDOT extra dollars when the problem does not materialize.
Page 7-8

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 7
Miscellaneous Contract Considerations • For example, do not say, “The contractor may encounter obstructions during the excavation.” The contractor has to assume that obstructions will be encountered and that they will be the contractor’s problem when they are. The unit price for the excavation will include the cost of obstruction removal, and WSDOT will pay for the removal even if there are no obstructions encountered. • Instead say, “If obstructions are encountered during excavation, the Engineer will pay for the removal of the obstruction in accordance with Section 1-09.4 of the Standard
Specifications.” Now the contractor can bid the actual cost of doing the excavation work and be confident that if something out of the ordinary is encountered, the cost of removal will be dealt with fairly, and if there are no obstructions encountered, there is no cost to
WSDOT. 700.01(14) Agreements
An agreement (for the purpose of this section) is a written contract between WSDOT and another party or parties (public, private, or both) establishing an exchange of benefits and/or obligations.
Another party may be financially responsible for some of the work in WSDOT’s contract, such as the construction of sidewalks, utility installations, signal systems, pavement markings, intersection improvements, and so on.
Agreements that include work that WSDOT’s contractor will perform, or work performed by others that WSDOT will reimburse a third party for, need to be addressed by Standard
Specifications or in the project Special Provisions.
Ensure that the quantities, bid item names, units of measurement, and prices in the agreement are the same as those in the PS&E.
Each bid item needs to be set up with a separate bid item name and placed in a separate group in the Summary of Quantities. If a nonstandard bid item is used, a project-specific provision will be required with prior approval from the Assistant State Construction Engineer. Each bid item needs to be addressed, clearly, in the Standard Specifications or Special Provisions.
When preparing the estimate of cost for an agreement for work under the contract that is the financial responsibility of an outside agency, include mobilization, engineering, and contingencies.
Complete and sign all agreements necessary for the project before the project is advertised. If this cannot be accomplished, it is the responsibility of the region to determine the risk involved in going to Ad without the completed agreement, in accordance with the Advertisement and
Award Manual.
See the Agreements Manual for guidance on agreement elements, structure and processes or contact region personnel responsible for processing agreements or the HQ Utilities, Railroad, and Agreements Section. 700.01(14)(a)

Haul Road and Detour Agreements
When the project provides a materials source, or requires traffic to be detoured from the state highway, the region may be required to acquire agreements with the owners of the roads that will be used as the haul road or the detour route. (See the Haul Road/Detour Agreements chapter in the Agreements Manual for guidance.) The process of generating an agreement should be started as early in the design phase as possible. Discuss with region personnel
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 7-9 Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
Division 7 responsible for processing agreements. The lack of a completed agreement may cause a project
Ad date to be delayed. It is the responsibility of the region to determine the risk involved in going to Ad without the completed agreement, in accordance with the Advertisement and
The agreement will normally provide compensation to the owner of the haul road or detour for damage done to the road by the hauling equipment or by the extra traffic on the roadway. The compensation may be in the form of work to be done under the contract to bring the roads back to precontract conditions, or the owner may be paid a cash settlement and would be responsible for making the repairs.
All haul roads and detours are to be clearly shown and labeled on the Vicinity Map. 700.01(15) Vehicle Weight Limitations Within Project Boundaries
Review each individual project to determine whether the vehicles employed in the construction that exceed the gross weight limitations, per RCW 46.44, can be tolerated.
When existing bridges or major drainage structures are involved, obtain overweight clearance from the HQ Bridge and Structures Office and include it in the Project File.
Use the information in the Standard Specifications section 1-07.7, or include the appropriate
GSP in the contract provisions, to inform the contractor of the load limit restrictions for the project.

700.01(16) Working Days
Give careful consideration to the number of working days allowed for a project. Too many working days can cause as many problems as not enough working days.
The following are example considerations for working days that can make a difference between a one and two season project. Evaluate working days with these types of restrictions in mind. •
The time of advertisement •
Materials procurement time •
Restrictions to the duration and when closures can occur •
Water work windows restrictions
The determination of working days for the different work items is to be based on production rates and other considerations (see the Appendices). Using the time required for the individual work items, the Critical Path Method (CPM) (see Appendix 6) is then used to determine how the project work will fit together, and the total number of working days will be determined.
The working days required for bridge construction are to be coordinated with the working days required for the other construction.
Place the CPM in the Project File.

Miscellaneous Contract Considerations 700.01(17) Liquidated Damages 700.01(17)(a)
HQ Construction Office Approval Required
Liquidated damages are monies assessed or withheld from the contractor’s payment for failure to complete the project within a specified period of time. Liquidated damages are not to be considered a penalty, but reimbursement for the costs to the contracting agency for the contractor’s failure to perform within the time frame of the project.
There are two types of liquidated damages to be considered for a project: 1. Contract Time-Related Liquidated Damages
Liquidated Damages are calculated for each WSDOT Design-Bid-Build project for failure to complete the physical work within the allotted contract time. Liquidated Damages are not to be considered a penalty, but reimbursement for the costs to the contracting agency associated with administering the contract beyond the specified contract time.
The design team is responsible for completing the Design Liquidated Damages
Calculation Sheet to determine the liquidated damages (LD) amount, which will be used in a fill-in for Special Provision 1-08.9.OPT3.FR1. Within the calculation sheet workbook are instructions and a completed example calculation sheet, for reference.
This calculation should be accomplished near to the 90% design milestone. The Design
Project Engineer should coordinate with the Construction Project Engineer to evaluate workforce projections, as well as any other available information, such as per diem, overtime, and travel time, to fill out the calculation sheet.
It is recognized that work force fluctuates during the life of the project. Review the work force for the duration of the project and select a day that best represents the staffing levels anticipated for the majority of the project. Document the workforce assumptions in the Comments/Assumptions/Staffing Notes section at the bottom of the form.
The Liquidated Damages Calculation Sheet will be kept in the Project File documentation in the region. 2. Interim Completion of Phases (Staging)
Interim liquidated damages are monies assessed or withheld from the contractor’s payment for failure to complete a part (phase or stage) of the project within a specific period of time identified in the Special Provisions.
Large or complex projects often have interim completion times, with liquidated damages for such things as failure to open a closed lane(s), ramp(s), or detour(s) to all traffic by a specified time, or for completion of all work identified for a specific stage or phase of a project as defined in the Special Provisions. These types of liquidated damages can be assessed in time increments that range from 15-minute to full-day segments.
Liquidated damages assessed for failure to have a lane, ramp, or roadway open to traffic, or to have an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) operational at the specified time, are an estimate of the actual cost to the contracting agency and the traveling public for not having that portion of the road or ITS available. Transportation Data, GIS, and Modelling Group (TDGMG) has standardized methodology for calculating the cost, based on traffic counts. This is the only acceptable way of calculating these costs.

Division 7
Download and complete WSDOT Form 312-001 to request interim liquidated damages from TDGMG.
Once these calculated costs are received from TDGMG, the region determines whether or not the damages represent a sufficient benefit to the state to put them in the contract.
Interim liquidated damages for two or more separate reasons can be additive for the same time period.
Place copies of the data used to justify liquidated damages and the TDGMG information in the Project File. 700.01(18) Fuel Cost Adjustment
The GSP Instructions contain guidance for use of the Fuel Cost Adjustment item.
Check with the HQ Construction Office to verify whether or not this item is required for the project. 700.01(19) Steel Cost Adjustment
The Steel Cost Adjustment item can be used in projects which contain 50,000 pounds or more of steel. Instructions for its use are contained in the GSP Instructions. The Steel Cost Worksheet
Template can be used to calculate this adjustment. Follow instructions for the General Special
Provisions in Division 1.

700.01(20) Force Account Work amount of money spent on force account work. This standard item, with the appropriate fill-in information, is to be used for all force account bid items, except for those that already have a standard item number.
If work can be measured and clearly identified, the design should use existing standard bid items. If the work is not quantifiable or cannot be easily measurable, the use of this item may be appropriate.
The use of this standard item number does not preclude the need for a project-specific provision to describe the work to be accomplished.
Place the force account item in the appropriate section on the Summary of Quantities. (A force account removal item would be placed with the other removal items; a force account structure item would be placed with the other structure items.) 700.01(21) Lump Sum Bid Items
A lump sum bid item may include several items of work or the same item of work at different locations. The Special Provisions must cover the complete item of work, including the description of work, materials, construction requirements (which includes the approximate quantities for bidding purposes), and payment statements. Double check quantities listed to avoid contractor claims.
Only include lump sum items work that can be easily defined by quantity, amount of effort, and equipment and labor requirements. If any of these items are unknown/uncertain, payment at unit prices or by force account would be more appropriate.

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 7
Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
Place backup data used to determine the estimated cost for lump sum bid items in the Project
File.
Decide whether each lump sum bid item is to be prorated or whether individual Summary of
Quantities column costs are to be assigned for each lump sum bid item.

700.02 Earthwork 700.02(1) Earthwork Measurement
Measurement of earthwork other than as specified in the Standard Specifications for Road,
Bridge, and Municipal Construction (Standard Specifications) requires the approval of the HQ
Construction Office. (See Division 6 for more information on developing a Special Provision.) 700.02(2) Clearing and Grubbing
When estimating quantities, calculate clearing as being performed 10 feet, and grubbing 7 feet, beyond the toe of slope for embankments and the upper limit of slope treatment in cuts.
Coordinate with the Region Landscape and Environmental offices on the proposed limits, and show these limits on the proper plan sheets. If clearing and grubbing limits are near trees contact the Region Landscape Architect to adjust limits of clearing to reduce the risk of leaving danger trees.
If clearing requires the cutting of merchantable timber amounting to at least one log truck load (approximately 5,000 board feet) from within the right of way, the General Special Provision (GSP) for Timber Export Restrictions is to be included in the contract provisions. This GSP notifies the contractor that they will be required to pay to the Department of Revenue the forest excise tax on the harvested lumber. 700.02(3) Removal of Pavement, Sidewalks, or Curbs
The method of measuring and paying for work requiring removal of pavement, sidewalk, or curb, is determined by where work is occurring: within or outside the limits of an excavation area. 700.02(3)(a)
Outside
When pavement, sidewalk, or curb removal is required outside the limits of an excavation area, it can be included in the lump sum price for “Removal of Structures and Obstructions,” or separate bid items may be established for the work.
If the work is included as part of the lump sum item, the Special Provisions will indicate the approximate locations and quantities. If separate bid items for removal are established, the individual items will appear on the Quantity Tabulation sheets, where the approximate locations and quantities will be indicated. In either case, indicate the locations of the removal items on the plans as well. 700.02(3)(b)

Within
When pavement, sidewalk, or curb removal is required within the horizontal and vertical limits of an excavation area, nothing is required on the plans or in the Special Provisions. All costs for the removal of the pavement, sidewalk, or curb are included in the excavation work, and no additional compensation is made to the contractor.
If the contract specifies staging the work to remove the pavement, sidewalk, or curb that lies

Division 7 within an excavation area prior to performing the excavation, the work would be handled as described above for removal outside an excavation area. 700.02(4) Borrow Material
Because WSDOT is committed to conserving valuable mineral resources, give careful consideration to the earthwork portion of every project, to ensure the most efficient and costeffective use of the material from the roadway excavations.
If there is insufficient roadway excavation material due to a shortage of on-site material or a portion of, the on-site material is known to be unacceptable for constructing embankments, material will be imported, and a borrow item will be included in the project.
If the borrow is required because the roadway excavation material is not acceptable for embankment construction, the Special Provisions shall identify the locations of the unacceptable roadway excavation material. Consult with the Region Plans Office on how this information is to be presented.
If WSDOT’s intent to have borrow and roadway excavation materials used together, note if a single type of borrow material is required to supplement the quantity of roadway excavation material. It will be the contractor’s responsibility to determine the most efficient and costeffective means and operations of using the on-site material and the borrow to construct the embankments. In this situation, the borrow material quantities will appear only on the Summary of Quantities and will not be shown as a quantity on the roadway profile sheets. Note in the
Contract Plans or the Special Provisions that the quantity of borrow shown in the Summary of
Quantities is to be used to supplement the quantity of roadway excavation at the contractor’s discretion for constructing embankments.
If the borrow material is being used only at specific, well-defined locations on the project (bridge end embankments, for example), identify the exact locations on the roadway profile by showing the quantity arrow, indicating the station-to-station limits and quantity of borrow material needed for the embankment construction. If profiles are not included in the project, the Special Provisions are to contain a statement such as, “Gravel borrow shall be used to construct the bridge end embankments, L X+XX to L X+XX.”
If two or more types of borrow material are required, the specific locations for all but one of the types of borrow shall be identified on the profiles, or in the Special Provisions, as described above. For example: • If gravel borrow is required for the construction of bridge end embankments, and common

borrow is required to supplement the roadway excavation material to construct other embankments, the station-to-station limits of the gravel borrow material are to be shown on the profiles or in the Special Provisions. It will remain the contractor’s responsibility to determine the most efficient and cost-effective way to use the common borrow and the roadway excavation material to construct the remaining embankments. Therefore, show the common borrow quantity only in the Summary of Quantities.
In all cases, the quantities for roadway excavation and embankment shall appear on the
Summary of Quantities and on the Profile sheets or, on smaller projects, tabulated on Quantity
Tabulation sheets.
Page 7-14
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 7
Miscellaneous Contract Considerations 700.02(5) Embankment In Place
This bid item is to be used on projects where earthwork consists mainly of borrow excavation. It provides payment for acquiring, excavating, hauling, placing, and compacting borrow materials to construct the embankment.
If there are minor quantities of roadway excavation included in the project, this work can be included in the item “Embankment In Place.” Measurement for payment will be by the cubic yard volume between the original ground line and the neat lines of the embankment template.
No allowance is made for subsidence or settlement.
The use of this item requires a Special Provision and approval by the HQ Construction Office.
Include the following information when requesting to use this item: • Assurance that the foundation on which the embankment material is to be placed is

unyielding. • Estimated quantities of excavation, embankment compaction, and roadway excavation. 700.02(6) Aeration
If it is found necessary or desirable to include the bid item “Aeration” in a project, approval by the Headquarters (HQ) Construction Office is required. Include a copy of this written approval in the Project File. 700.02(7) Shoring or Extra Excavation
All excavations of 4 feet or more in depth shall be shored, protected by cofferdams, or shall meet the open-pit requirements specified in the Standard Specifications.
RCW 39.04.180 requires that a separate bid item for shoring or extra excavation be included in the estimate and proposal. NOTE: in no case shall the costs for shoring or extra excavation be included in other bid items.
700.03 Production From Quarry and Pit Sites and Stockpiling 700.03(1) Materials Sources and Waste Sites
Materials sources provided by the contracting agency can be either mandatory or nonmandatory sites. For mandatory sites, verify with the region ASDE on the appropriate documentation needed, and refer to Design Manual Chapter 300 for approval authority of mandatory sites.
When mandatory materials sources or waste sites are specified, the region shall provide a memorandum of justification. For mandatory materials sources, justification shall be made in accordance with 23 CFR 635.407, showing a definite finding that it is in the public's best interest to require the use of the mandatory sites furnished or designated by the contracting agency.
The use of mandatory sites can also be designated based on environmental considerations, provided the environment would be substantially enhanced without excessive cost. Place the memorandum of justification is in the Project File.
When nonmandatory sites are specified, the contracting agency makes the site available to the contractor, but the contractor has the option to use or not use the site.
For any mandatory source or waste site to be used, coordinate with the Region Plans, Materials, and Environmental offices.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Page 7-15 Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
Division 7
Bid items for work to be performed within a nonmandatory site are to be site-specific; for example, “Wire Fence Type 1 – QS-X-XX.” (See the GSP for State Furnished Material Sources in
Division 3 for more information.) This allows the contractor the opportunity to bid zero for these site-specific items if they do not intend to use the site. If the contractor decides later to use the site, the work specified by the site-specific items will be performed, and the contractor will be paid at the bid amount of $0.00.
Site-specific items are not required for work to be performed on mandatory sites.
Set up a separate column, under the appropriate group, for each material source or waste site provided by the contracting agency. This allows the contractor to easily identify the work to be performed within a site and also allows for easy accounting of the work by WSDOT.
The region shall prepare a Haul Road Agreement if the haul route to or from the site is other than a state highway. 700.03(2) Stockpiling Aggregates
Under the construction contract, the regions are authorized to spend M5 funds for acquisition of aggregates, provided the region’s biennial M5 allocation is not exceeded.
The following Headquarters offices need to be advised by the region of all M5 aggregate stockpile acquisitions made under a construction contract: • Administrative Services Office, Purchasing and Inventory Branch • Comptroller’s Office, Budget Management Branch • Program Management Office, Program Manager • Pre-Contract Administration Office 700.03(3) Amortization of Materials and Stockpile Sites
If a state source of materials is provided, the project report form is to include the dollar amount to be amortized, providing the region intends that amortization be included in the project.
The estimate will include the dollar amount so that federal-aid participation can be obtained on federal-aid projects, or so that proper accounting procedures can be followed when only state funds are involved.

700.03(4) Royalties on Materials Sites
If the contracting agency furnishes a materials site owned by others, and the owner requires that a royalty be paid for materials removed from the site, specify the dollar amount of the royalty, and who will be responsible to pay the royalty, in the Special Provisions. FHWA has authorized federal-aid participation in royalty payments.

Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
700.05 Surface Treatments and Pavements 700.05(1) Asphalt for Fog Seal
The item “Asphalt for Fog Seal" is normally associated with bituminous surface treatment (BST) projects and the shoulders of paving projects that place only HMA in the traffic lanes, and it is required on all open-graded HMA projects as well. 700.05(2) Soil Residual Herbicide
The item “Soil Residual Herbicide” should be used prior to the application of BST and in conjunction with HMA, asphalt concrete sidewalks and paths, or parking lots only when very aggressive weeds that are capable of breaking through pavement are in the vicinity. Those weeds include equisetum and knotweeds. Check with the Maintenance Superintendent responsible for the area for a recommendation on whether soil residual herbicide is required.

700.05(3) Commercial HMA
If approved by the Region Materials Engineer, any quantity (tons) of Commercial HMA may be used for the following applications: • Prelevel • Sidewalks • Ditches • Paths • Gores • Digouts • Road Approaches • Slopes • Trails • Other nonstructural applications approved by the Project Engineer. 700.05(4) HMA for Preleveling
Provide the bid item “HMA for Preleveling Cl. ____ PG ____” when a project requires preleveling of the existing roadway surface.
Base the quantity of preleveling on a survey of field conditions. In some regions, this survey may be made by the Materials Laboratory and it may provide the prelevel rate or quantity.
The roadway sections should show in the typical sections where and what type of prelevel is to be completed (wheel rutting or on a lane to correct a super rate issue) so that the contractor knows how to bid and what equipment is expected to be used. 700.05(5) HMA for Approach
Use the item “HMA for Approach Cl.____ PG____” when there are road approaches to be paved on the project. This is not to be confused with county roads and city street intersections. Include county road and city street intersections in main line paving quantities.
Identify road approaches by approach sections on the roadway section sheets, and on the
Paving Plans, if they are present, so the contractor is aware of the number, locations, and paving

Division 7 requirements. Place HMA quantities for each approach either in a table or in the Quantity
Tabulation sheets. 700.05(6) Asphalt Cost Price Adjustment
Asphalt Cost Price Adjustment is required for all projects containing Hot Mix Asphalt. Use the
Instructions Tab on the Payment Calculator Spreadsheet for information on how to determine the estimate. The references costs and Payment Calculator Spreadsheet is located at:  https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/how-do-business-us/public-works­ contracts/payments-reporting/escalation-clauses 700.05(7) Other Price Adjustments
Check with the HQ Construction Office to verify whether or not any other price adjustments are required for the project.
To determine the Engineer’s Estimate for other price adjustment bid item use the Payment
Calculator Spreadsheet located at:  https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/how-do-business-us/public-works­ contracts/payments-reporting/escalation-clauses 700.05(8) HMA Quality Assurance
As an incentive for contractors to provide superior quality HMA, the Washington State
Department of Transportation (WSDOT) will pay a bonus of up to 8% of the unit bid price of the
HMA. The bonus is comprised of 3% for the mixture and 5% for compaction. When a project calls for paving with HMA, the item “Job Mix Compliance Price Adjustment” (JMCPA) will be required, with the exception of HMA accepted by Visual Evaluation. For HMA accepted by Visual
Evaluation, this item is only used when there is nonconforming mix resulting in a credit. For
HMA accepted by Visual Evaluation, the JMCPA will be -$1 for the estimate. For HMA accepted by statistical evaluation, the JMCPA will be calculated using the following formula:
JMCPA = (0.03) (TEC)
Where:
TEC = Summation of the Total Estimated Cost of HMA accepted by statistical evaluation.
Example:
Description Quantity Unit Price Est. Cost
HMA Cl. ½ IN. PG_ (2,600 tons) ($70.00) = $182,000
Summation of Total Est. Costs (TEC) = $182,000
JMCPA = (0.03)($182,000)
JMCPA = $5,460
Use $5,500 for “Job Mix Compliance Price Adjustment”
When a project calls for paving with HMA, the item “Compaction Price Adjustment” (CPA) will be required, regardless of the tonnage, if the total compacted depth for a class of HMA placed in the traffic lanes is greater than 0.10 foot.

Page 7-18
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 7
Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
The price adjustment will be calculated using the following formula:
CPA = (0.05) (TWTEC)
Where:
TWTEC = Travel Way Total Estimated Cost of HMA with a total depth greater than 0.10 foot.
Note: If the same compaction effort is required on the shoulders, the shoulders will be included in the calculations for “Compaction Price Adjustment” (for example, where the shoulders are currently being constructed full depth because they will become a driving lane in the future or where shoulder driving is going to be allowed). If this is the case, see GSP 5-04.3(10)opt1.gr5.
Example:
HMA CL ½ IN. PG_:
Length: 500'
Width: 2 lanes @ 12' and 2 shoulders @ 10.0'
Depth: 1 lift @ 0.20' depth

700.06 Structures 700.06(1) Structural Reference Information
The region will be responsible to provide prospective bidders with reference information needed for evaluating all bridges, within the project limits, as to their potential ability to carry loads or materials that exceed the load limits specified in the Standard Specifications 1-07.7.
Bidders will then be able to make adjustment to bid costs associated with any engineering requirements if they anticipate using loads exceeding the allowable limits during construction.
The following items should be included as Structural Reference Information: • •
The most recent Inspection Report for all existing bridges and buried structures located within the Project limits.
As-built plans and shop drawings for all existing bridges and buried structures which are being modified as part of the project scope including but not limited to widening, repair, retrofit (rail, seismic, substructure, etc.), painting, overlay and paving.
Reference information for most structures is available on Bridge Engineering Information
System ( beist.wsdot.loc/InventoryAndRepair/Inventory/BRIDGE) and Enterprise Content
Management ( wsdotecm/portal). For information not available at these sources, contract HQ
Bridge and Structures Office.
For HQ ad and award projects, the project office should send the collected reference information to the HQ Contract Ad and Award (CAA) Office. The HQ CAA Office will issue a notice to prospective bidders, once the project is advertised, indicating the availability of the structural reference information.

700.06(2) Retaining Walls
When a project contains standard retaining walls, as detailed in the Standard Plans for Road,
Bridge, and Municipal Construction (Standard Plans), the Contract Plans shall include: • A plan and profile of the wall, with original and proposed ground profiles at the front and back faces of the wall. • All existing utilities in the vicinity of the wall. • Wall geometry. • Right of way limits. • Construction sequence and stage construction sequence requirements. • Highest permissible elevation for foundation construction. • Location, depth, and extent of unsuitable material. • Quantities for the wall and backfill materials. • Details of wall appurtenances such as traffic barriers; coping; wall face treatment and limits of treatment; drain outlets; and location of signs and lighting, including conduit locations.
In general, a site that will support a standard cantilever retaining wall will also support a proprietary retaining wall. If the region decides to provide preapproved proprietary retaining wall systems as an alternate, consult the HQ Materials Laboratory Foundation Engineer and the
HQ Bridge and Structures Office Bridge Project Engineer on the selection of suitable wall systems for the conditions. In order to evaluate aesthetic considerations, submit a rough site
Page 7-20
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 7
Miscellaneous Contract Considerations plan to the HQ Bridge Project Engineer for review.
The region will be required to contact the suppliers of the selected retaining wall systems to confirm the adequacy of the systems for the given situation. Contact the HQ Materials
Laboratory Foundation Engineer to provide assistance in evaluating the systems for overall stability and to provide soil criteria for design.
The HQ Bridge and Structures Office will prepare the Special Provisions for preapproved proprietary retaining walls, including design criteria. The HQ Foundation Engineer will be consulted for establishing the criteria for design. The Special Provisions will require the proprietary wall manufacturer selected by the contractor to submit shop plans, design criteria, and calculations to the HQ Foundation Engineer for approval. The HQ Bridge and Structures
Office will then review the design submitted by the preapproved proprietary wall manufacturer.
In addition, keep in mind that these retaining wall alternates may be selected by the contractor and that all of these alternates are proprietary. On all federal-aid projects, two alternates must be selected, or reasons for using fewer alternates must be submitted for approval to the
Assistant State Design Engineer assigned to the region. Proprietary retaining wall systems are preapproved for certain heights. Walls that exceed the preapproved height will be considered special designs and each must be submitted to the HQ Bridge and Structures Office for review and approval.

700.06(3) Contractor Supplied Designs for Buried Structures
When a project includes a contractor supplied design for a buried structure, the Contract
Documents shall include: • Location of the buried structure, headwall and wingwalls and their geometry, including alignment, length, profile and elevations • The location of the Structure Free Zone and the 500 year scour surface • The streambed section including buried structure bedding material • Barrier and fall protection locations and configuration • Approach slab locations when they are anticipated (when the top surface of the structure will be the driving surface) • Any restrictions on the type of buried structure • Any restrictions on headwall, wingwall, barriers and fall protection types • Buried structure staging requirements • The project geotechnical report referenced in the design • Whether the site is Marine, Non-Marine: Corrosive or Non-Marine: Non-Corrosive as defined in the WSDOT Bridge Design Manual Section 6.7, and the specific pH, resistivity, chloride and sulfate measurements of existing soil and water. • Environmental requirements of the structure • Aesthetic requirements of the structure • A schedule for construction that can accommodate placement, backfill, structural connections/deck placement, approach slab construction, etc.

700.08 Miscellaneous Construction 700.08(1) Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Plans
The Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Manual (TESCM) provides detailed information on
Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control (TESC) planning associated with Construction
Stormwater General Permit. The goal of TESC planning is to prevent erosion damage and sediment-laden runoff during construction that can harm the environment and waters of the state. A TESC Plan (includes a narrative section and plan sheets) describes the site-specific erosion risks associated with the project and list the best management practices (BMPs) selected to reduce or eliminate the identified risks. Refer to the Temporary Erosion and
Sediment Control Manual (TESCM).
Multiple resources for TESC Plan design exist, including the TESCM, Design Manual, Highway
Runoff Manual, Roadside Manual, Hydraulics Manual, Standard Specifications (Division 8-01), and Standard Plans. Other resources include the Environmental Guidance website and Region
Environmental or Hydraulics staff and Environmental Services Office Stormwater and
Watersheds Program staff.
Proper planning can reduce stormwater-related erosion risks on construction sites. Use the
Temporary Erosion and Sediment Control Manual, templates, checklists, and policy guidance to get and transfer permit coverage, develop contracts, write erosion control plans, and submit discharge monitoring reports for your project.

700.08(2) Roadside Restoration and Considerations
The roadside blends the highway facility into the natural and built environment and provides operational, visual, and environmental functions. For all projects requiring work outside the shoulders, restoration of the roadside asset is required. Contact the Region Landscape Architect (LA) or HQ Landscape Architect (for regions without one) early in the project to assist in meeting the functional needs and to determine ways to avoid, minimize and mitigate impacts to the roadside.
The roadside work will require coordination with Maintenance to identify problem areas that can be addressed with project work, such as areas where long-term weed control issues exist, areas where future restoration is desirable, and areas with deficiencies. The project can ensure these concerns are addressed when performing restoration. This avoidance and minimization work may require consultation on and edits to plan sheets outside of the planting plans.
If areas of noxious weeds exist within the project limits, the designer may arrange to have
Page 7-22
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 7
Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
WSDOT maintenance forces treat them prior to earth-moving activities using construction funding, or the project can include weed control prior to this work, when project timing is not adversely affected. Including treatment prior to earthwork can avoid spreading noxious and invasive species of weeds, if they exist in the project vicinity. For projects that last through multiple seasons, weed control throughout the duration of the project should be specified for all areas within the right of way and all maintenance activities need to be planned for within the project limits. If the project needs weed control (outside of planting areas), the separate weed control standard bid item must be included.
Sometimes, minor modifications to grading or adjustments to equipment location can help to reduce vegetation or environmental impacts, areas that are not usually considered in the firstpass of putting together project plans. It is important to preserve existing desirable vegetation and to minimize disturbance and compaction of existing soils as much as possible. This will minimize water runoff, reduce erosion during the project, and reduce impacts that require restoration and mitigation.
Site preparation is more effective if it is noted on the major project site preparation plans, as the prime contractor is most likely to see that information prior to any required activity.
Additionally, the LA may add site preparation plans to cover the roadside work when the site is more complicated than a single preparation strategy such as simply clearing and grubbing.
The Roadside Policy Manual outlines requirements for vegetation preservation and revegetation. The Landscape Architect can assist the designer in fulfilling these requirements.
The Roadside Restoration Worksheet or coordination with the Region Landscape Architect, should be referenced to determine the impacts and restoration needs that were determined for the project during the scoping process. The Roadside Restoration Worksheet is a vehicle for planning the necessary budget to cover costs of restoration, but cannot fully predict the costs generated by unanticipated clearing, to accommodate such issues as site access. It is not necessary to complete the Worksheet when projects only require small items such as seeding; however, it is important that the scoper, or designer, consult with the LA office to ensure that the budget will be adequate for the project.
Consider the various elements of the project that are viewed by the highway user and from adjacent areas. Elements such as lighting standards, sign bridge types, traffic barriers, rockfall protection, bridge and wall design, textures and colors, contour grading, stormwater treatment and storage facilities, and vegetation blend the project into the context of the environment and provide a unified visual experience through the corridor. Consult with the region LA or the
Headquarters Roadside and Site Development office, where the region does not have its own
LA, to provide guidance. The LA works with the HQ Bridge and Structures Architect to ensure continuity with architectural features.
Permanent vegetation provides erosion control, slope stabilization, weed minimization, stormwater treatment and storage, and can reduce traffic-related pollutants and protect the public from air pollution. The Landscape Architect can provide expertise to identify and blend visual elements.
All site components that are made available to the public must comply with the Americans with

700.08(3) Earthwork for Roadside Installations
Estimate and include in the contract earthwork quantities associated with features installed outside the typical shoulder break point. These installations include, but are not limited to,
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 7-23 Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
Division 7 guardrail terminals, luminaires, and ITS equipment. Refer to the layout and dimensions shown in the Standard Plans or project details when calculating quantities, and provide a separate tabulation for each location. Alternatively, quantities may be made incidental to the item being installed, if that approach provides an advantage in project contracting or construction inspection.
Note that earthwork for widening is not normally included in the roadway earthwork calculations, and therefore needs to be tracked and documented separately.
700.09 Other Contract Considerations 700.09(1) Combining Bid Items
In an effort to streamline projects to make them easier for WSDOT to manage, as well as easier for the contractors to bid, some thought should be given on each project to doing similar, or associated, work under a single bid item instead of having two or more items under which to work.
The lump sum item “Removal of Structure and Obstruction” has always been made up of a combination of various removal items, and this will not change. This item is not governed by an estimated cost limit for work that can be included. As long as each different removal item is precisely described as to the actual work to be performed, the locations of the work, and the estimated quantity of work, there are no limits to the removal work that can be combined in the single “Removal of Structure and Obstruction” item. (See 700.09(4) for additional discussion on lump sum items.)
Work that is measurable—estimated cost of $5,000 or greater—will be a separate bid item.
However, if the work is minor—estimated cost of less than $5,000— and there is a logical item of work with which to associate the minor work, the items may be combined and the cost of the minor work included in the cost of the associated work. A nonstandard bid item is created to capture all of the work involved when combining bid items.
When combining items of work, additional information is required to describe the work involved, to clearly identify what items are being combined, and that the quantities provided for the combined items need be more accurately calculated.
For example, do not combine the cost of structure excavation with the cost of the pipe without giving a reasonably accurate estimated quantity for the structure excavation required for each pipe. Giving the total estimated quantity for the structure excavation does not provide the contractor a clear enough picture of the work required to make a responsible bid.
Accuracy of estimating quantities is also important because it can be difficult to address overruns, underruns, or added work when only one portion of the item combination is involved in the overrun or underrun, or work is added to only one of the items of work.
Care must be taken to ensure that by combining the items of work, additional problems will not be encountered during construction because of changes in conditions or work methods.
Items being combined shall relate to each other well and the quantities shall be dependent on each other, so if one changes in the field, the associated quantities would be affected uniformly. 700.09(1)(a)

Example of Combining Similar Items
If the project had a few locations where stormwater pipes were to be installed, and depth of trenches were approximately the same, it would be acceptable to include the cost of structure
Page 7-24
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 7
Miscellaneous Contract Considerations excavation with the per-foot price for the size and type of stormwater pipes. This could be a good combination because the items are closely associated and the quantities may be dependent on one another. The quantity for structure excavation is dependent on the amount of pipe installed and will increase or decrease as the length of pipe actually installed increases or decreases. • Even though this combination of items is logical, it is imperative that the quantities for the structure excavation be calculated to a higher degree of accuracy than if the two items were separate. • This higher accuracy of the structure excavation quantity is necessary because once the quantity is calculated for the planned length of pipe, that relationship of cubic foot of structure excavation per foot of pipe never changes. If the calculated structure excavation quantity is too high, the contracting agency is overpaying for the work actually performed. If the calculated structure excavation quantity is too low, the contractor is not being fairly compensated for the work performed. In either case, there is no way to make adjustments to the structure excavation. • If there was a separate pay item for the structure excavation, and the quantity for the item was miscalculated, the contractor will be paid for the actual work performed, so the estimated quantity is a basis for the contractor’s bid only. • The structure excavation quantity will appear on the Structure Note sheet as “informational only” for each associated structure code. 700.09(1)(b)
Example - Do not Combine Dissimilar Items
Do not combine clearing and grubbing with embankment compaction, even though the plan is to clear and grub only where the embankments are to be constructed. The two items are not closely associated with each other and therefore not combined. The quantity for either of these items could be increased or decreased without impacting the quantity of the other item and their costs could be vastly different. • If the items above are combined under a cubic yard pay item, and during construction it is determined that additional slope flattening is necessary within the original clearing and grubbing limits, it would be difficult to determine and justify an increase. The difficulty lies in the fact that clearing and grubbing is generally around $6,000 per acre, whereas embankment compaction is around $2.00 per cubic yard. In this case, the contractor would be receiving a premium price for the additional embankment. • If the items above are combined under a per acre pay item, and during construction it is determined that additional clearing, grubbing, and embankment compaction is necessary, again, it would be difficult to determine and justify an increase. The problem is, how is a square acre converted to a cubic measurement? 700.09(1)(c)
Incorporating Combined Items
To maintain consistency in the combining of items statewide, consult the Region Plans Office or
ASCE in advance of incorporating combined items into projects. In addition to consistency, this will provide a single office to monitor which items are routinely being combined and which item combinations work and which do not, allowing for responsible decisions in the future.
Note: Two items that cannot, by law, be combined with any other item of work are “Shoring or
Extra Excavation Class A” and “Shoring or Extra Excavation Class B.”

Division 7 700.09(2) Equipment Acquisition Through Construction Contracts
The practice of WSDOT acquiring, through a construction contract, items that would normally be acquired or purchased through the equipment fund or IT contracts is only allowed with written approval from CPDM through the Assistant State Design Engineer.
Specific examples of these items are: survey equipment, computers and other IT equipment, vehicles, maintenance equipment, radios, workboats, and truck-mounted impact attenuators. 700.09(3) Geotechnical Project Documentation (a)
The Region Project Development Office or Terminal Engineering Department for WSF is responsible for notifying the HQ Geotechnical Office at least 12 to 14 weeks in advance of the Ad or Shelf Date, when the final project geotechnical documentation is due for each pertinent project. (b)
When a PS&E document is near completion, all of the available geotechnical design memoranda and reports are compiled to form the Final Geotechnical Project
Documentation. The summary of geotechnical conditions and boring logs and associated data will be included as an appendices to the Special Provisions to be published for the use of prospective bidders. (c)
The Region Project Development Office or Terminal Engineering Department for the
Washington State Ferries (WSF) will identify who has been designated to receive, handle, and continue the publication process of the report.

(d)
It is desirable that the final geotechnical documentation be available for printing 10 weeks prior to the Ad or Shelf Date; however, it absolutely must be available no later than two
Fridays prior to the Ad or Shelf Date. (e)
When transmitting the final project geotechnical documentation, the HQ Geotechnical
Office will explicitly identify the geotechnical documentation as final and camera-ready.
Likewise, the region materials section will concurrently send a camera-ready final copy of region-generated reports, to be included as part of the geotechnical documentation for the project. (f)
For Headquarters Ad and Award projects, when the region has received the report, the
Region Project Development Office sends the complete package to the HQ Printing
Services Office for final publication and to be made available to prospective bidders for purchasing. For WSF projects, the WSF Contracts/Legal Services Office is responsible for copying and making the report available to prospective bidders. (g)
The HQ Contract Ad and Award Office will issue a notice indicating the availability of the geotechnical documentation to bidders.

(h)
In addition, some geotechnical information shall be included as part of the contract. It will generally consist of the final project boring logs and/or a Summary of Geotechnical
Conditions when applicable. Both of these items are provided by the HQ Geotechnical
Office. 700.09(4) Items a Designer “Might” Need
Avoid including items in the project that "might" be needed. This is particularly important for items such as borrow or excavation below grade, because the contractor bids, at a high price, the small quantity shown, and then finds a way to use a considerable quantity of the item on the
Page 7-26
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 7
Miscellaneous Contract Considerations project.
If it is unknown whether or not the item is required, it is best to leave it out of the project and let the Construction Office add the item by change order if necessary. History shows that this is the easiest, most cost-effective way of handling these items.
There may be times when it will be appropriate to include an item that might be needed. In these rare cases, it should be included as a force account item so the Engineer has complete control of the work.

700.09(5) Managed Access Highways and Construction Rights
For work on managed access highways outside of incorporated areas, refer to Design Manual 540.08(2)(b), “Department Construction Projects,” for additional guidance. Reach out to your region access contact or the HQ Access and Hearings Manager prior to beginning your PS&E.
See: https://wsdot.wa.gov/business-wsdot/highway-access-requests-training 700.09(6) Paths and Trails
WSDOT tracks expenditures for pedestrian and bicycle facility improvements so this information can be reported to the Legislature and the public, per chapter 47.30 RCW. The information is also used to measure the performance of WSDOT’s transportation system.
For WSDOT Design-Bid-Build projects: Include the paths and trails percentage in your 100%
PS&E turn-in cover memo when submitted to the Region Plans Office. Also, send the percentage, and documentation for how the percentage was calculated, to region program management. Region program management will convey this information to CPDM for tracking.
For projects with no paths and trails calculation, use 0%. Communicating 0% ensures the review of the paths and trails percentage occurred.
For WSDOT Design-Build projects: The paths and trails percentage shall be calculated by the
Design-Builder and submitted with the Released for Construction (RFC) plans. This percentage will be provided to the WSDOT Engineer for submittal to CPDM. For projects with no paths and trails calculation, use 0%. Communicating 0% ensures the review of the paths and trails percentage occurred.
Please contact CPDM for guidance on reporting related to Paths and Trails when there is a
WSDOT contribution on a project but is not the lead agency.

X = The summation of paths and trails-related items* (including mobilization, sales tax, engineering, and contingencies).
Y = The grand total of the project cost. *Includes (but is not limited to) the items listed below.
Features that are specifically for pedestrian and/or bicycle facilities need to be included in the paths and trails calculations. Overlaying an existing shoulder with HMA or bituminous surface treatment (BST) does not constitute the need for paths and trails calculations. Widening of a shoulder(s) that is part of a larger roadway-widening project is not to be included in the paths

Division 7 and trails calculations, except as noted below.
The following are example types of work that are to be included in the paths and trails calculations. (See the Design Manual for definitions of terminology and additional information.) • Shared-use path • Structures (specifically for active transportation use) • Sidewalk • Bike lane • New curb ramp (or replacement of curb ramps) • Retrofitting curb or altering a curb ramp (simply replacing truncated domes would not be

included) • Curb extension • Pedestrian refuge island • Buffer strip (only a planter strip that is a minimum of 3 feet wide between the sidewalk and curb can be included)
Following MUTCD guidelines, signing and pavement markings associated with pedestrian and bicycle facilities may include: • Crosswalks • School crossings • In-pavement flashing warning devices • Preferential lane symbols and signing • Pedestrian signals/detectors • Bicycle-specific signals/detectors • Pedestrian-scale lighting • Bicycle facilities lighting
For these types of features, the paths and trails calculations shall include the entire cost to complete the work of each feature.
Constructing a dedicated bicycle or pedestrian facility is always preferable to widening shoulders, especially in urban or urbanizing areas. However, paths and trails calculations for bicycle and pedestrian facility improvements shall be calculated for roadway shoulders when all of the following conditions are met: • The route is identified in a local, regional, or state plan as a bicycle connection. • The existing shoulder is widened to at least the minimum widths outlined in the Design
Manual for accommodating bicyclists and pedestrians. • The paths and trails calculations for this shoulder-widening work shall be 50% of all the costs included to complete the shoulder widening.

Miscellaneous Contract Considerations 700.09(7) Salvaged Materials
Salvaged materials are items that do not become the contractor’s property when removed as part of the contract. This material is to be used in future projects. For federal-aid projects, salvage credits are governed by state procedures; however, they are subject to the requirements set forth by Buy America (see Section 700.01(7)). In accordance with FHWA
Contract Administration Core Curriculum guidance, WSDOT has established the following procedure on salvaged material.
WSDOT procedure does not require a salvage credit on state-funded projects. Therefore, a salvage credit on a federal-aid-funded project is also not required.
In accordance with FHWA Contract Administration Core Curriculum guidance, WSDOT has established the following procedure on salvaged material. 700.09(7)(a)

Use of Salvaged or State-Furnished Material
The Use of Salvaged or State-Furnished Material flow chart (Exhibit 7-1) details the procedures to follow when these types of materials are proposed to be incorporated in a contract.
The use of material acquired in other than competitive bidding may be waived under specific conditions if it is found to be in the public’s interest. On federally funded projects, a Public
Interest Finding (PIF) is required to be approved by HQ CPDM. The PIF will consist of a written document outlining the basis for the request and supporting documentation such as cost/benefit analysis, discussion of compatibility, logistical concerns, etc. For details on what is required for a PIF, refer to 23 USC 112 and 23 CFR 635, and Appendix 8B of the Program
Management Manual M 3005-01.
For state-funded projects, the use of salvaged or state-furnished materials must be approved by the Region Administrator or to the delegated regional authority.

Miscellaneous Contract Considerations 700.09(8) Specialing Out Right of Way Parcels
It may be necessary to identify right of way parcels that are unavailable to the contractor for construction at the time the contract is awarded by “specialing” such parcels out.
The Special Provisions shall be specific regarding the location of these parcels and the estimated dates of availability to the contractor. Region Real Estate Services can provide a reasonable availability date to go in the Special Provisions. There is no problem if the property becomes available early. The contract may be impacted if the property is not available by the date stated in the contract.
Right of way parcels that are “specialed out” must also be indicated on the Right of Way or
Alignment/Right of Way Plans by drawing in the appropriate property lines and by cross­ hachuring the parcels. The plans shall indicate that the cross-hachured parcels are unavailable with a note referencing the Special Provisions.
When right of way is specialed out, the order of work has to be examined to ensure the project sequencing is not adversely affected by portions of right of way not available for immediate use. 700.09(9) Standard Items
The Standard Bid Item Table is a complete list of items tracked by UBA and includes Standard
Items, GSP items, and items requiring a special Provision. Refer to the Item Use Column within the table. When a standard item exists, it should be used.
Standard items are those items that appear in the payment statements in the Standard
Specifications. Many of these payment statements, like the following, are written with blanks: • “HMA for Preleveling Cl. ____ PG ____,” per ton. • “Catch Basin Type ____,” per each. • “Manhole Additional Height ____ In. Diam. Type ____,” per foot.

If the blanks are filled in with the expected information and the information in the Standard
Specifications applies, they are standard items even though they may be a size, type, or class not shown in the Standard Bid Item Table.
Minor revisions that have little or no impact on the cost can be made to the material or construction requirements in the Standard Specifications, and they can remain standard items.
Care must be taken, however, not to mislead the contractor by making major revisions that could substantially affect the cost of the item and calling it the standard item. In these cases, it is best to develop a nonstandard item. Nonstandard bid items require a project specific provision approved by the ASCEs. 700.09(9)(a) Disputes Review Board
Include the standard bid item Disputes Review Board in projects with an estimated construction cost of $10 million or greater. For projects under $10 million, the use of the item is encouraged, but it is not mandatory. 700.09(10) State Force Work or State-Furnished Materials

RCW 47.28.030
As of 2015, the complete RCW reads as follows:
RCW 47.28.030 Contracts—State forces—Monetary limits—Small businesses, veteran, minority, and women contractors—Rules—Work on ferry vessels and terminals, ferry vessel program. (1)(a) A state highway shall be constructed, altered, repaired, or improved, and improvements located on property acquired for right-of-way purposes may be repaired or renovated pending the use of such right-of-way for highway purposes, by contract or state forces. The work or portions thereof may be done by state forces when the estimated costs thereof are less than fifty thousand dollars and effective July 1, 2005, sixty thousand dollars. (b) When delay of performance of such work would jeopardize a state highway or constitute a danger to the traveling public, the work may be done by state forces when the estimated cost thereof is less than eighty thousand dollars and effective July 1, 2005, one hundred thousand dollars. (c) When the department of transportation determines to do the work by state forces, it shall enter a statement upon its records to that effect, stating the reasons therefor. (d) To enable a larger number of small businesses and veteran, minority, and women contractors to effectively compete for department of transportation contracts, the department may adopt rules providing for bids and award of contracts for the performance of work, or furnishing equipment, materials, supplies, or operating services whenever any work is to be performed and the engineer's estimate indicates the cost of the work would not exceed eighty thousand dollars and effective July 1, 2005, one hundred thousand dollars. (2) The rules adopted under this section: (a) Shall provide for competitive bids to the extent that competitive sources are available except when delay of performance would jeopardize life or property or inconvenience the traveling public; and (b) Need not require the furnishing of a bid deposit nor a performance bond, but if a performance bond is not required then progress payments to the contractor may be required to be made based on submittal of paid invoices to substantiate proof that disbursements have been made to laborers, material suppliers, mechanics, and subcontractors from the previous partial payment; and (c) May establish prequalification standards and procedures as an alternative to those set forth in RCW 47.28.070, but the prequalification standards and procedures under RCW 47.28.070 shall always be sufficient. (3) The department of transportation shall comply with such goals and rules as may be adopted by the office of minority and women's business enterprises to implement chapter 39.19 RCW with respect to contracts entered into under this chapter. The department may adopt such rules as may be necessary to comply with the rules adopted by the office of minority and women's business enterprises under chapter 39.19 RCW. (4)(a) Work for less than one hundred thousand dollars may be performed on ferry vessels and terminals by state forces. (b) When the estimated cost of work to be performed on ferry vessels and terminals is between
Page 7-32 Division 7
Miscellaneous Contract Considerations one hundred thousand dollars and two hundred thousand dollars, the department shall contact, by mail or electronic mail, contractors that appear on the department's small works roster as created pursuant to procedures in chapter 39.04 RCW to do specific work the contractors are qualified to do to determine if any contractor is interested and capable of doing the work. If there is a response of interest within seventy-two hours, the small works roster procedures commence. If no qualified contractors respond with interest and availability to do the work, the department may use its regular contracting procedures. If the secretary determines that the work to be completed is an emergency, procedures governing emergencies apply. (c) The department shall hire a disinterested, third party to conduct an independent analysis to identify methods of reducing out-of-service times for vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement projects. The analysis must include options that consider consolidating work while vessels are at shipyards by having state forces perform services traditionally performed at Eagle
Harbor at the shipyard and decreasing the allowable time at shipyards. The analysis must also compare the out-of-service vessel times of performing services by state forces versus contracting out those services which in turn must be used to form a recommendation as to what the threshold of work performed on ferry vessels and terminals by state forces should be. This analysis must be presented to the transportation committees of the senate and house of representatives by December 1, 2010. (d) The department shall develop a proposed ferry vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement program and present it to the transportation committees of the senate and house of representatives by December 1, 2010. The proposed program must: (i) Improve the basis for budgeting vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement costs and for projecting those costs into a sixteen-year financial plan; (ii) Limit the amount of planned out-of-service time to the greatest extent possible, including options associated with department staff as well as commercial shipyards; and (iii) Be based on the service plan in the capital plan, recognizing that vessel preservation and improvement needs may vary by route. (e) In developing the proposed ferry vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement program, the department shall consider the following, related to reducing vessel out-of-service time: (i) The costs compared to benefits of Eagle Harbor repair and maintenance facility operations options to include staffing costs and benefits in terms of reduced out-of-service time; (ii) The maintenance requirements for on-vessel staff, including the benefits of a systemwide standard; (iii) The costs compared to benefits of staff performing preservation or maintenance work, or both, while the vessel is underway, tied up between sailings, or not deployed; (iv) A review of the department's vessel maintenance, preservation, and improvement program contracting process and contractual requirements; (v) The costs compared to benefits of allowing for increased costs associated with expedited delivery; (vi) A method for comparing the anticipated out-of-service time of proposed projects and other projects planned during the same construction period; (vii) Coordination with required United States coast guard dry dockings;

Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
RCW 47.28.035
The complete RCW reads as follows:
Cost of project, defined.
The cost of any project for the purposes of RCW 47.28.030 shall be the aggregate of all amounts to be paid for labor, material, and equipment on one continuous or interrelated project where work is to be performed simultaneously. The department shall not permit the construction of any project by state forces by dividing a project into units of work or classes of work to give the appearance of compliance with RCW 47.28.030. [1984 c 194 § 2.] 700.09(10)(c)
Justifications
If the project is new/reconstruction on the Interstate, the justification for state-furnished materials and for State Force Work requires FHWA approval.
RCW 47.28.030 requires that WSDOT have documentation on file for all State Force Work/
Furnished Materials. The justification and estimate for work to be done by state forces and state-furnished materials is to be processed per region policy in sufficient time to allow for review and approval prior to advertising of the project. When FHWA approval is required, the justification must also include a request for federal funding participation. Also, it must be reported to the Headquarters Office of Capital Program Development and Management when State Force Work is performed on federal-aid projects.
The justification for both state-furnished materials and State Force Work must show that it is economically cost-effective to provide the materials or to perform the work with state forces. It does not matter how or when the state-furnished material was purchased or whether it was purchased through competitive bidding or not, the cost of the state-furnished material is to be incorporated into the State Force Work/Furnished Materials total costs, and the limitations per
RCW 47.28.030 apply. Once an item is purchased and furnished to another contract, that item becomes state-furnished material. Refer to Exhibit 7-2 and the EBASE Users Guide for guidelines when engineering and contingencies are used (when other state agencies do the State Force
Work) or when engineering and contingencies are not used (when WSDOT state forces do the work) in regard to State Force Work and for state-furnished materials.
As of July 1, 2005, the maximum total dollar value of work done by state forces per construction project, including labor, materials, and equipment, is $60,000 or up to $100,000 if it is an emergency, as stated in RCW 47.28.030. An increase in the dollar amounts in the RCW must go before the Legislature; currently, there are no additional increases built into the law. 700.09(10)(d)

Blanket Approval Items
There are a few items of work that have received a blanket approval to be performed by state forces and receive FHWA funding participation. They are: striping, pavement marking, secondstage fertilizing, and one-way piloted traffic control. With blanket approval items, WSDOT must still have documentation on file, and the dollar limitations also apply to this work. 700.09(10)(e)
Exceptions
When the state provides materials and/or equipment and there is NO state labor performed by state forces on the project, the dollar limitation per RCW 47.28.030 does not apply. For example, if WSDOT provides a $90,000 sign bridge, as long as there is no state force labor, this dollar amount can be approved. If there is any state force labor (even for unrelated work such
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 7-35 Miscellaneous Contract Considerations
Division 7 as removal of silt fence) on the project that is going to be a below-the-line item, then the aggregate total of materials and labor would exceed the $60,000 per RCW 47.28.030 and therefore cannot be approved.
Work performed off the state roadway right of way may not be subject to RCW 47.28.030; therefore, no limit on state-furnished materials or state force labor would apply. If work is done outside the WSDOT transportation corridor (state right of way, fence line to fence line), and state force thresholds in RCW 47.28 do not apply (as with wetland mitigation sites, sundry sites, and other capital facilities), then RCW 39.04 applies. This applies only to those areas outside of and unattached to existing state highway right of way.
Work that is not to be considered State Force Work includes: inspection of any type; materials testing; surveying; monitoring; public relations work; or any kind of investigation or research. If state forces do these types of work, they are to be included in the engineering and contingencies. If the cost of this work is substantial, it can be used as justification to increase the engineering and contingency percentage to offset the costs. • Inspection is defined as work performed to ensure material or contractor installations meet the specifications outlined in the contract after the contract has been awarded. Inspection does not include work performed to correct the deficiency or failure to meet specifications. • Surveying is part of the inspection requirements. It shall be considered as construction engineering and is not subject to state force thresholds. • Material testing is defined as work performed prior to contract award, or prior to the material being delivered to the contractor, to ensure the material meets the specifications outlined in the contract. Material testing includes diagnostic testing and/or modifications to the material or equipment to ensure compatibility and interoperability with the existing infrastructure. For example, when electronic equipment is procured, materials testing would include assembling the equipment into a system and modifying software or hardware components as necessary to ensure the system operates as specified and is compatible with existing electronic equipment and/or software (see Exhibit 7-2, State Force
Work/Materials).

700.09(10)(f) 1.
Questions Asked by WSDOT and Answered by the Attorney General’s Office (AGO)
WSDOT: If work is not related, but on the same project, does the RCW limit apply to each unrelated item of State Force Work or is all the unrelated State Force Work added together for the aggregate total for the project?
AGO: All State Force Work activities (labor, equipment, and materials), related or not, are included in the aggregate total and are subject to state force thresholds. 2.
WSDOT: Has the Legislature looked at the excessive increase in costs and considered raising the dollar limitation in the RCW accordingly?
Work to $250,000. Under this request, the limit was raised by $10,000 only, with a few step raises in the RCW in later years. The state Legislature would prefer work to be contracted out and the dollar limit on State Force Work kept low. 3.
WSDOT: How does the RCW apply to contractually purchased materials used by state maintenance labor and equipment—for example, on BST projects where the aggregate is purchased through contract and stockpiled, State Force Work is requested for the labor and equipment to place the BST, and the labor and equipment is less than the dollar limitation?
Page 7-36
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 7
Miscellaneous Contract Considerations

AGO: If Maintenance purchases materials (such as crushed rock), regardless of whether this material is purchase through a competitive bidding process or not, it is considered to be from a supplier and is not considered a WSDOT construction contract. Therefore, the material is included in the aggregate total of labor, equipment, and materials and is subject to state force cost thresholds. 4.
WSDOT: What determines a contractor versus a supplier? If we have a competitively bid contract for rock chips for chip seal jobs that we can use whenever we need to in a one-year or two-year period, is this a contractor or a supplier?
AGO: A supplier. 5.
WSDOT: If there is no state labor, does the RCW dollar limit apply?
AGO: If there is no state labor in the project and only state-furnished materials are being purchased, the dollar limitation per RCW 47.28.030 does not apply. If there is any
State Force Work labor on the project, whether or not it is relevant to the materials acquisition, then the RCW 47.28.030 dollar limitations apply to the aggregate total. 6.
WSDOT: If there are overruns during State Force Work on labor, material, or equipment costs that are covered under the State Force Work request and that exceed the RCW dollar limitation, is this a violation of the law? Should this be documented and, if so, how?
AGO: A good faith effort is required to justify and document the state force request during the project development phase. If, during construction, the actual costs exceed the estimated costs, this is considered an incremental increase. If this happens on a consistent basis, the original estimate will not be considered a good faith effort and the law has not been followed. 7.
WSDOT: Who has the authority to authorize State Force Work in excess of the monetary limit set in RCW 47.28?
AGO: No one outside the Legislature has the authority to approve State Force Work in excess of the monetary limit set in RCW 47.28.030. Exceeding the RCW is a violation of the law. The law would have to be changed by the Legislature to increase the monetary limit in RCW 47.28.

8.
WSDOT: When does State Force Work have to be documented and kept on file?
AGO: Per the law, all State Force Work must have documentation on file justifying the work. RCW 47.28.030 states, “When the department of transportation determines to do the work by state forces, it shall enter a statement upon its records to that effect, stating the reasons therefore” (see Exhibit 7-2, State Force Work/Materials).

Miscellaneous Contract Considerations 700.09(11) Strip Maps
Strip maps may be used on projects when a great deal of detail is not required, such as overlays, fog seal, BST, stockpiling, signing, safety, and similar projects.
Many times a strip map can be used for a series of plans within a set of plans, such as for the signing series, if the signing is simple destination-type signing and requires no real detail. In most cases, by simply showing the construction centerline with stationing and the required signing information, it is possible to stack the information on the sheet such that twice the information can be displayed on each sheet. Keep in mind that most of the information shown on strip maps is not really alignment-dependent; that is, a curve in the highway is not going to affect the showing of a sign at the correct station, so the centerline can appear as a straight line on the strip map.
The use of strip maps when feasible is not only an option, but is also a recommended procedure to help reduce the total number of plan sheets in the project.
The use of photographic strip maps is allowed if the work can be shown adequately and if a clear copy can be ensured. 700.09(12) Truck Measurement of Earthwork Quantities
Truck measurement can be utilized on projects with 5,000 cubic yards or less of embankment to be constructed or when the project consists of numerous small embankment areas where crosssectioning is not practical.

700.09(13) Truck Weigh Sites
The components of a truck weigh station for which federal funds can be used are: • Additional right of way. • The construction of access lanes and vehicle standing and storage areas. • The illumination of access lanes and vehicle standing and storage areas.
The construction of the scale house and its service facilities, scale pit, and scale are not eligible for federal-aid participation.
For additional information on truck weigh sites, see the Design Manual. 700.09(14) Warranties and Guarantees
WSDOT may choose to include warranty clauses in federal-aid highway construction contracts as specified in Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 23, Volume 1 (revised April 1, 2001), Part 635, under Subpart D – General Material Requirements Section 635.413, Guaranty and warranty clauses. An excerpt from the CFR text reads as follows:
The State DOT may include warranty provisions in National Highway System (NHS) construction contracts in accordance with the following: (a) Warranty provisions shall be for a specific construction product or feature. Items of maintenance not eligible for Federal participation shall not be covered. (b) All warranty requirements and subsequent revisions shall be submitted to the Division
Administrator for advance approval. (c) No warranty requirement shall be approved which, in the judgment of the Division
Administrator, may place an undue obligation on the contractor for items over which

There may be occasions when the regions have the need to include warranty and/or guarantee clauses in state-funded contracts. The region will notify the Construction Materials Engineer at the HQ Materials Laboratory and request concurrence with the specification prior to including the Special Provision in the contract documents.
The contractor is required to pass along to WSDOT all manufacturers’ normal guarantees and warranties for products and equipment installed on the project. 700.09(15) Washington State Patrol Work Zone Enforcement and Assistance
If Washington State Patrol (WSP) use is warranted on a project, include an estimated dollar amount in the project estimate as a below-the-line item. If WSP assistance is to be used as a required element of the traffic control plans, it should be identified on the plans and provided as a resource to the contractor with a General Special Provision.

Contract Estimate

800.1 Introduction
800.2 Estimate Content
800.3 Estimate Preparation
800.1 Introduction
A detailed cost estimate shall be prepared for a project in order to obligate funds for the construction activity and to determine a fair price for the work and a basis for evaluating contractors’ bids. Estimates are comprised of various bid items arranged in a logical order, with a variety of payment options (see Division 7 for special considerations). A complete estimate lists all work to be done by the contractor, showing quantity, unit of measure, unit cost, and total cost for each item. Cost estimates are prepared using one of two basic approaches, or a combination thereof, and each method has advantages and limitations. Bid-based estimating is usually easier and faster. Items without an adequate historical base must be estimated using the cost-based method. (See the Cost Estimating Manual for WSDOT Projects for more information.) (1)
Bid-Based Estimating
Bid-based estimating utilizes historical bid prices. The procedures are typically based on the concept of comparable work—that is, choosing a price by finding similar projects in the same locality with a similar quantity as the item involved. The Washington State Department of
Transportation (WSDOT) maintains historical bid data broken down by bid item, region, contract number, plan quantity, and the bid prices of the three lowest bidders. Bid Tabs Professional works with the Estimate Bid Analysis System (EBASE) and gives the designer the ability to use current bid history to produce and update project estimates. Numerous analysis scenarios can be generated. For information and a User’s Guide for this program, go to: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/engineering-applications/technicalsupport-guidance (2)
Cost-Based Estimating
Cost-based (scratch) estimating utilizes labor, equipment, and material cost information. Costbased estimating directly incorporates cost and productivity factors relevant to the project into the estimation process.
Note: Other than the estimate range included in the advertisement for bids, estimate information is to be kept confidential until bids have been received and opened.

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page 8-1 Contract Estimate
Division 8
800.2 Estimate Content
The contract estimate shall include the following: 1. A list of all bid items in correct order, showing contract item number, standard bid item number (if applicable), unit of measurement, estimated unit price, estimated quantity, and total estimated cost for each. The total amount of all items is designated the “Contract
Total.” 2. Washington State sales tax (if applicable). 3. Work by others at WSDOT expense. 4. Construction engineering costs. 5. Contingency costs. 6. Work by WSDOT at WSDOT expense – State Force Work (see Division 7). 7. The value of materials furnished by WSDOT (see Division 7). 8. Calculated amortization of materials sites and stockpile sites, even though the costs may not be known at the time the estimate is prepared. 9. Estimated amount for royalty payments.
800.3 Estimate Preparation
The region enters contract estimates into EBASE. A job number unique to each project identifies the estimate for each contract. The same PS&E job number used to identify the Contract
Provisions should be used to identify the estimate.
The following elements should be considered in preparation of the estimate, as appropriate: 1. Previous unit bid prices. To develop base prices for estimating the value of the work, upcoming projects should be matched to the most recent projects for which bids have been received, according to type, size, and location. 2. An adjustment to the base prices based upon the ages, quantities, and individual conditions of the similar projects. 3. Inflation rates may be considered to update past information, but past inflation rates should not be projected into the future unless based on circumstances that can reasonably be expected to occur, such as anticipated changes in the cost of labor, equipment, and materials. 4. Surveys of local market prices for labor, equipment, and materials for unusual items of work or those with fluctuating prices.
For complete instructions on developing estimates in the EBASE system, and for the
Mobilization and Highway Preservation and Improvement tables, see the EBASE User’s Guide. It may be accessed directly from EBASE by selecting “Help” or through the following website:

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Division 8
Contract Estimate https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/engineering-applications/technicalsupport-guidance (1)
Mobilization
Mobilization is a contract pay item used to cover a contractor’s preconstruction expenses and the costs of preparatory work and operations. Since there is no clear list defining this work effort, and since contractors have the ability to adjust their bids as needed to cover these expenses, there are no true rules as to what percentage should be used per contract. Therefore, when starting an estimate for a project, enter 10% as a beginning point for mobilization and adjust it up or down before final PS&E submittal. To calculate the appropriate mobilization percentage, see the mobilization table in the EBASE manual: https://wsdot.wa.gov/engineering-standards/design-topics/engineering-applications/technicalsupport-guidance
When determining mobilization for a project, consideration should be given to location, complexity, the need for specialized equipment, the type of work, and the working season if it extends over more than one construction season. Projects that would probably require a higher mobilization percentage include rural vs. urban; projects with multiple work sites; projects with numerous preparatory removal items; projects with large quantities of excavation; or projects extending over two seasons where the contractor would be expected to shut down operations and move out. (2)
Engineering and Contingency Percentages “Contingency percentages” are set up to handle unforeseen changes in a project during construction, including additional work, quantity over-runs, and additional items. Contingencies are currently limited to 4% of the total contract amount for all WSDOT contracts. For local agency projects administered by WSDOT off the state highway system, no contingency percentage will be set up. “Engineering percentages” are the monies set up in each contract for WSDOT’s operating costs to administer that project. These percentages will vary by type of work and total dollar amount of the contract. On average, the department has been running around 15% engineering on all projects in the Improvement and Preservation programs. Therefore, when starting an estimate for a project, enter 15% as a beginning point for construction engineering and adjust it up or down before final PS&E submittal. To choose the appropriate engineering percentage, see the engineering tables in the EBASE manual.
The Region Program Development/Management staff can, based on appropriate justification, approve any changes in the construction engineering percentages for a project different from the rates listed.
Copies of the approved justification letter shall be submitted with the final PS&E submittal for advertisement.

Applying Professional Stamps
A2.01 Introduction
On July 1, 2021, the State Design Engineer issued Project Delivery Memo #21-02 – Applying
Professional Stamps. The purpose of this memo was to establish a statewide process for applying professional stamps to contract plan sets that allows full electronic delivery.
Appendix 2 hereby incorporates this Memo and instruction.
Professional licenses have historically been applied to WSDOT plan sheets using a wet signature.
Working remotely highlighted the need for an efficient, electronic means of stamping documents.
Applying Professional Stamps to Plan Sets. The Board of Registration was consulted on this approach and indicated that it meets the intent of WAC 196-23, which requires: 1. Final documents must contain a stamp, signature, and date 2. Preliminary documents noted as “preliminary” and stamped, but not signed 3. Every page must contain the stamp, signature, and date.
If you have questions or need more information on how to implement this, please contact your
Assistant State Design Engineer.

A2.02
Applying Professional Stamps to Plan Sets
A2.02(1) Background
For years, professional licenses have been applied to WSDOT plan sheets by having a technician apply the licensee’s stamp and the professional applying their wet signature over the stamp and have found the process of creating a plan set that complies with WAC 196-23 more difficult.
More specifically, WAC 196-23-020 requires: 1. Final documents must contain a stamp, signature, and date; 2. Preliminary documents noted as “preliminary” and stamped, but not signed; and 3. Every page must contain the stamp, signature, and date.
To follow this requirement, it required that a licensee apply a digital signature to each page.
Doing so, the software would create a copy (or reference point) to show what the file looked like when that signature was applied. For a 100-sheet plan set, this meant the software would create 100 different copies or reference points. Further complications would come from passing the plan set to another licensee. In the end, this effort complicated our project delivery process causing us to investigate a new method of applying stamps. This document presents the new method that meets the intent of WAC 196-23 and attempts to protect the licensee and the public.
A2.02(2) Preliminary Documents
All preliminary documents will be noted as “PRELIMINARY” and have the licensee’s stamp applied by the technician drafting the plan set. The stamps on the preliminary documents will
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Page A2-1 Applying Professional Stamps
Appendix 2 not be signed. Stamps can be applied by the technician assembling the plans. Preliminary documents shall be developed under the licensed engineer whose stamp will appear on the plan set.
A2.02(3) Final Documents
All final documents will have a stamp applied by a technician drafting the plan set. In addition, an image of the licensee’s signature will be applied over the licensee’s stamp. This signature will be a transparent signature where you can see the licensee’s stamp through the signature.
To apply these signatures, begin with the 100% plan sheet and follow these steps: 1. Technician applies the PE Stamp to all plan sheets. 2. In the Date, insert the text “SEE SHEET CT1”. See Figure 1 below. 3. Licensed Professional applies a transparent signature to all plan sheets over the PE stamp using Adobe Stamp. See Figure 1 for an example of the plan sheet PE stamp image. To control file size, it is important that this be a transparent signature image in
PNG format and NOT a photo or a digital signature. For information on how to create a transparent signature in PNG format, see the IT How-To’s on insideDOT. a. Adobe Stamp can be found by going to TOOLS and selecting the Stamp icon: b. Create a custom stamp with your transparent signature. This can be done by using the Custom Stamps icon: c. For ease of use when applying your stamp to several plans, utilize the Stamps
Palette: d. When complete, the stamp, signature, and date should appear as follows:
Figure 1: Plan Sheet PE Stamp Image 4. Insert a sheet after the index sheet of the contract titled CERTIFICATION SHEET labeled sheet CT#. The # will begin with 1 and be sequentially assigned (e.g. CT1, CT2, etc.) if there are too many signatures to fit on one page. There is a cell in MicroStation for the
Page A2-2
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09

Appendix 2
Applying Professional Stamps
Certification Sheet found using the Place WSDOT Items menu. There is no PE stamp on the Certification Sheet (see Step 7 for an example of the signature block on a CT sheet). 5. Once the plan set is final, the Region Plans Review Engineer (or designee) assembles all of the PDF files from the different licensed professionals and uses Adobe Sign to acquire digital signatures. 6. The steps for using Adobe Sign are the sub-bullets below. These steps must be completed by the Region Plans Review Engineer (or designee) and the individual must have access to Adobe Sign. Adobe Sign access is granted through HQ Development
Division (currently Lesli Rodeheaver). Consultants that are GECs and have been granted a WSDOT email address can use Adobe Sign, but must use their email address that ends with @wsdot.wa.gov. a. Acquire the email address of all licensed professionals that stamped the plans.
On multi-volume contracts, licensed professionals need only apply their signature to those volumes that contain their plan sheets. Therefore, on multivolume contracts, there will be a separate process for each volume that contains their stamp. b. Open Adobe Sign and select “Go to Adobe Sign” c. Enter the email addresses for all licensed professionals under Recipients i. Make sure the “Complete in Any Order” box is checked. d. Fill in the boxes under Message. What you fill in here will be in the email that all licensed professionals receive when they are asked to sign. e. Drag and drop the complete plan set (or volume) under Files. Note, the file will be uploaded to Adobe’s cloud and can take several minutes on large files. NOTE:
The file size limit is 100 MB. f.
OPTIONAL: If you need to have the plan set password protected, you may select the checkbox under “Options”. g. When all prior steps are complete, check the box “Preview & Add Signature
Fields” at the bottom of the page and click “Next”.
Page A2-3 Applying Professional Stamps
Appendix 2

h. Find the CT sheet in the plan set. Drag and drop the Signature, Name, and Date fields into the CT sheet for each recipient into a box on the CT sheet. When finished, it should appear like this: i.
Click “Send”. j.
You can monitor the process of your document under the “Manage” tab in
Adobe Sign. 7. The professionals who need to certify the plan set must do the following: a. Look for an email from the individual who completed Step 6. The email will come from Adobe’s email server and therefore will appear as an “External” email: b. Click “Review and sign” in the email. This will open up your internet browser and take you to Adobe’s website for reviewing the document. c. Scroll to the Certification Sheet in the plan set and click “Click here to sign”. d. A popup will appear that allows you to customize your signature. Select “Image” and find the file that represents your handwritten signature. Make sure that your name in the lower left is the same as the name on your PE stamp.
Page A2-4
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Appendix 2
Applying Professional Stamps e. Select “Apply” and the popup will close. f.
Select “Click to Sign” at the bottom of the window. g. This completes the process for a professional to certify the plan set. The signed version of the document is automatically sent back to Adobe Sign. The person who completed Step 6 will get an email stating you have signed and also inform them when the certificate sheet has been signed by all individuals. The completed signatures on the certification sheet will look like this: 8. After all professionals have signed, send the completed plan set(s) to Printing Services for advertisement. 9. Printing Services will call this first set of plans received from the Region the “Bid Set” and process Bid Set along with the other contract documents for advertisement. 10. Addendum will be certified in a similar manner. If any addenda have plan sheet modifications, they will have a Certification Sheet labeled CTA#. The # will represent the addendum number … Addendum #4 will be CTA4. If an addendum does not have a plan revision, then there will be no CTA# for that addendum and that CTA# is skipped. For example, if only addenda 3 and 7 have plan set revisions, then you will only have CTA3 and CTA7 and the other CTA# will not exist. 11. At Award, the Bid Set will be combined with all Addendum and this set will be called the “Conformed Set”. The Conformed Set will be assembled with the pages of the
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09
Page A2-5

Applying Professional Stamps
Appendix 2
Addendum inserted into the contract to make one complete PDF plan set. Addendum
CTA# sheets will be inserted behind the original CT# sheet associated with the Bid Set.
The contract page numbers will not be renumbered with the insertion of the CTA# sheets. To keep the signatures visible on all the certification sheets, the original electronic sheets will be printed from the original electronic plan sets and these will be inserted into the Conformed Set. 12. The Conformed Set will be attached to the Award documents that are sent to the successful bidder. 13. The Bid Set, Addenda, and Conformed Set will all be archived in ECM by Engineering
Records. 14. As-builts will be created by the Construction Office by importing the PDF from either the
Bid Set, Addenda, or Conformed Set into MicroStation and making the as-built modifications as appropriate. An as-built set may make use of Certification Sheets at the discretion of the Construction Office.

Transmittal Memorandums

Contracting Project Support Offices
Beginning early in the design phase of a project, the designer will need to contact various support offices within and outside the region seeking input for the design of the project. Which support office needs to be contacted can depend on the type of program the project is being improved under; for example, I1, P1, P2, I2, I3, and so on.
Some of the more common support offices contacted by designers are: Region Utilities,
Headquarters (HQ) Materials Laboratory, Region Traffic, Region Environmental, Region
Hydraulics, HQ Geotechnical, HQ Bridge, Region Plans Office, Region Right of Way, Region Local
Programs, and Region Soils Engineer.
Memorandums are the usual means by which a designer requests information from and/or exchanges information with a support office. Following is information a memorandum should include, if known: •
Originating memorandum from Project Engineer’s Office •
State Route •
Project Title •
Project MP •
PIN No. and/or WIN No. •
Location No. •
Project Description: a paragraph or two on what the project improvements are •
Whether federal funds are involved in the project •
Program •
What is being requested by memorandum: a paragraph or two on what is needed by the design team and a time duration to receive information •
Ad date •
Contact person •
Attachments: Vicinity Map and/or other information that may be of help to the support office in understanding the request
Designers should contact their Region Plans Office for examples of memorandums, if needed.

(2)
PS&E Review Period
After the Plans, Specifications, and Estimate (PS&E) documents have been compiled by the designer, the PS&E is sent to the Region Plans Office for review. The review period is known as “Status” and is normally ten weeks in duration before Ad. Many Region Plans Offices have Ad &
Award Guide Manuals that detail what information needs to be in the memorandum transmitting the PS&E for the Status period of review.
Designers should contact their Region Plans Office early in the PS&E phase of a project for guidance on transmitting PS&E documents for the Status period.

Addendum Preparation
General
When addenda are needed, they should be numbered chronologically as they are compiled and sent to bidders/planholders so the number of addenda sent can be tracked. Work closely with the Region Plans Office in preparing addenda. Great care should be used to ensure all plan sheets affected by an addendum are identified and included in the addendum; one minor change can have a ripple effect on other sheets.
Contract specification revisions or new contract specifications, created while a contract is on Ad, shall be stamped by the engineer directly responsible for the work. Those stamped specifications shall be filed in the Project File for the project. The addendum, which transmits revised or new specifications, does not need to show the stamp, provided the stamped originals are in the Project File. Plan revisions or new plans (in accordance with Division 4) sent out by an addendum need to be stamped by the engineer, and copies of those stamped plans will be sent out with the addendum.

A5-2
Notes to the Designer
For design-bid-build projects the start of the addendum should say:
Addendum Number _______________
The Contract is hereby modified as follows:
For design-bid-build projects the following paragraph shall to be placed on all addenda:
Bidders shall furnish the Secretary of Transportation with evidence of the receipt of this addendum.
For design-build projects the start of the addendum should say:
The RFP is hereby modified as follows:
For design-build projects the following paragraph shall to be placed on all addenda:
Proposers shall furnish the Secretary of Transportation with evidence of the receipt of this addendum.
The following paragraph should be placed on an addendum when changes are made to the Proposal and the addendum does not transmit a new Proposal as an attachment to the bidders:
Bidders are instructed to revise pages ___ and ___ of the Proposal as revised pages have not been prepared for attachment to this addendum. If the bidder fails to make these corrections on the Proposal, the items will be corrected by the
Department.

Appendix 5
The following example shows how to notify the bidder that the contract wage rates are to be deleted and replaced in an addendum:
Wage Rates:
Federal Wage Determination WA________, Modification___, page___, is deleted and replaced with WA02000___, Modification____, page___.
This statement shows how the wage rate addendum would be worded when the wage rate determination is an attachment:
Attachment:

February___, 2002)

A5-3
Guidelines for Preparing Addendum Plan Sheets
A5-3(1)
Deletions
The item, line, figure, or detail to be deleted is completely removed from the sheet. The area where the deletion occurred shall NOT contain any addendum clouds. The deletion is to be noted in the revision block and shall be shaded. When a plan sheet requires a
P.E.’s stamp, the revision block date is to be dated on or before the date it is signed by the P.E. authorizing the change.
On Summary of Quantity, Qtabs, Structure Notes, and Sign Specification sheets, delete the line item(s), but leave the row or column in place as a blank placeholder.
A5-3(2)
Added/Replacement Sheets
An added sheet is a sheet that previously did not exist. It is to be numbered and inserted in its proper location, adding an alphabetical character to its sheet designation; for example, the “A” in D6, D6A, D7.
A replacement sheet is a sheet on which the changes are so massive, a cloud(s) would cover a substantial portion (over 50%) of the sheet, or the changes could not be clearly defined with a cloud(s).
These sheets are noted in the revision block by the note "Added Sheet" or "Replacement
Sheet," whichever is applicable. Only the revision block shall be shaded.

A5-3(3)
Revisions/Additions
The revision/addition note shall be placed in the revision block, and all revisions, including additions, shall be shaded.
A5-3(4)
Addendum Cloud (for Plan/Profile/Section/Detail Sheets Only)
On CAD-produced sheets (plan view, profile view, sections view, and detail), use the cloud line tool to identify an item(s) or area(s) to be changed. To cloud an addendum, in
MicroStation version V8, from the WSDOT MENU, browse to “Sheet Items > GI General
Page A5-2
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.09 Appendix 5
Addendum Preparation

Sheet Items,” select “Addendum Cloud,” and draw a boundary line around the item(s) or area(s) to be changed.
Addendum cloud line attributes will have an arc radius of 0.1, arc angle of 145°, line style of 0, line weight of 5, and line color of 15 (RBG value = R:120, B:120, G:120).
Refer any questions about addendum cloud(s) to your region CAD coordinator or the HQ
CAE Office.
A5-3(5)
Shading
On Summary of Quantity, Qtabs, Structure Notes, and Sign Specification sheets, shade the cell(s) and revision block with a gray color Red, Green, Blue (RGB) value = R:180,
B:180, G:180).
All PS&E submittals for Contract Advertisement and addenda shall be only original plots from printers that use stippling to produce gray.
Reproductions or photocopies will not be allowed as they make poor quality prints when reproduced. Some variation in shade density may be noticed when comparing output from various printers.

A5-4
Examples
Examples of addendum letters (and plan sheets) are available at your Region Plans
Office.

A6-1
Determination of Contract Time

Background
A6-1(1) Contract Time
Contract time is the maximum time allowed in the contract for completion of all work contained in the contract documents. Contract time often arises as an issue when the traveling public is being inconvenienced and the contractor does not appear to be aggressively pursuing the work.
There may be a number of reasons for a project to appear dormant, such as weather limitations, concrete curing times, materials arriving late, and so on. However, all too often the causes are traceable to excessive time originally established by the contracting agency to complete the project or poor contractor scheduling of operations.
A6-1(2) Duration of Construction Projects
The duration of highway construction projects in many instances is more critical today than it was in the past. Some of the reasons are: 1. Traffic volumes on most highways are generally continuing to increase. This is creating a greater impact on the motoring public in both safety considerations and costs. 2. Proper selection of contract time allows for optimizing construction engineering costs and other resources.
A6-2
Elements in Determining Contract Time
A6-2(1) Written Procedures
Written procedures for the determination of contract time are important so that production rates and other considerations are applied uniformly throughout the state. These procedures should account for significant geographic and climatic differences throughout the state, which could affect contractor productivity rates. The fact that some types of work can be undertaken during certain times of the year while other types of work cannot should be addressed. Where applicable, the effects of working under traffic also need to be considered.

A6-2(2) Reasonableness of Contract Time
The reasonableness of the contract time included in contracts is important. If time is insufficient, bid prices may be higher and there may be an unusual number of time overruns and contractor claims. If, on the other hand, the time allowed is excessive, there may be inefficiencies (costs) by both the state and the contractor. Also, the public may be inconvenienced unnecessarily and subjected to traveling on roadways where safety is less than desirable for an extended period of time. In establishing contract time, the state should strive for the shortest feasible traffic interruptions to the road user. If the time set is such that all work on a project may be stopped for an extended period—not including necessary winter shutdowns—and the contractor can still complete the project on schedule, it means the contract time allowed was excessive. There may be some exceptions, as indicated in “Factors That Influence Contract Time” and “Other Factors
That Influence Contract Time” below.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.05
Page A6-1 Determination of Contract Time
Appendix 6
A6-2(3) Reasonableness of Contract Time
For most projects, the essential elements in determining contract time are: 1. Establishing production rates for each controlling item. 2. Adapting production rates to a particular project. 3. Computing of contract time with a progress schedule.
EXPERIENCE AND JUDGMENT SHOULD BE USED IN THE FINAL
DETERMINATION OF CONTRACT TIME.

A6-3
Establishing Production Rates
A6-3(1) Production Rate
A production rate is the amount or quantity produced/constructed over a specific time period. The application of realistic production rates is key in setting an appropriate contract completion time.
Production rates for the same item of work will vary considerably across the state, from small to large construction projects and from rural to urban areas. Production rate ranges should be established based on project size, type (such as grading and structures), and location (urban or rural) for controlling items of work.
Typical production rates follow this text.
A6-4
Factors That Influence Contract Time
A6-4(1) Determining Contract Time
In addition to production rates, the following items should be considered when determining contract time: 1. Effects of the maintenance of traffic requirements on scheduling and the sequence of operations. 2. Curing time and waiting periods between successive paving courses or between concrete placement operations, as well as specified embankment settlement periods. 3. Seasonal limitations for certain items need to be considered when determining both the number of days the contractor will be able to work and the production rates. 4. Conflicting operations of adjacent projects, both public and private. 5. Review time for falsework plans, shop drawings, post-tensioning plans, mix designs, and so on. 6. Time for fabrication of structural steel and other specialty items. 7. Time for fabrication and procurement of signal and illumination equipment. 8. Coordination with utilities. 9. Time to obtain permits. 10. Effects of permit conditions and/or restrictions. 11. Restrictions for nighttime and/or weekend operations. 12. Time of year of the letting as well as duration of the project.
Page A6-2

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.05 Appendix 6
Determination of Contract Time 13. Special local area events (such as parades, festivals, athletics, fairs, and races). 14. Canadian and neighboring states’ holidays. 15. Location. 16. Work hour/noise restrictions. 17. Other pertinent items as determined by the designer.
A6-4(2) Working Days
Zero working days may be indicated during the winter months, while 20 to 22 working days per month are common during the summer. Bridge work is generally assigned the greatest number of working days in a month. If historical working day data are not available, historical rain and temperature data are available from the National Weather Service to develop average working days per month.
A6-5
Adapting Production Rates to a Particular Project
A6-5(1) Management Decisions
Before time durations for individual work items can be computed, certain project-specific information should be determined and some management decisions made. A determination should be made relative to the urgency of the completion of the proposed project. The traffic volumes affected and the effect of detours should be analyzed. The size and location of the project should be reviewed as well as the effects of staging, working double shifts, the feasibility of night work, and the restrictions on closing lanes. Also, the availability of material for controlling items of work should be investigated. For example, it might be appropriate to consider the need for multiple crews on a specific item to expedite the completion when there are exceptionally large quantities or when there is a large impact on traffic.
A6-5(2) Accelerating Project Completion
Procedures that would accelerate project completion should be considered when construction will affect traffic substantially or when project completion is crucial. This is especially important in urban areas that have high traffic volumes. Realizing that public inconvenience needs to be minimized, the production rates applied in setting the contract time for these types of projects should be based on that of an efficient contractor working more than 8 hours per day, more than 5 days per week, and possibly with additional workers. The development and application of a separate set of production rates for these critical types of projects is recommended.

A6-6
Computation of Contract Time: Developing a Progress
Schedule
A6-6(1) Progress Schedule
The contract time for most construction projects can be determined by developing a progress schedule. The progress schedule basically shows the production durations associated with the chosen production rates for the items of work. The time to complete each critical item (those items essential to total project completion) of work included in the progress schedule is computed based on the production rates applicable to that project. Critical items should be arranged by chronological sequence of construction operations. Minor items that may be performed concurrently with critical items do not need to be analyzed.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.05
Page A6-3 Determination of Contract Time
Appendix 6
A6-6(2) Starting and Ending Time
In determining a progress schedule, it should be remembered that the starting and ending time for each critical item needs to be based on the earliest time in which work on that item will begin and how long it will take to complete. The earliest start time for each activity will be determined by the completion of the activities that precede it, allowing for the fact that some activities can begin before the preceding activity is entirely completed. Along with the time established for all critical items, additional time should be allowed in the contract for initial mobilization.

A6-7
Critical Path Method (CPM)
A6-7(1) Using CPM to Determine Number of Working Days
The CPM must be used to determine the number of working days. The CPM used to determine working days for a project shall be transmitted to the Plans Office with the Plans, Specifications, and Estimates (PS&E) transmittal.
A6-7(2) Using CPM to Determine Contract Time
A brief description of the application of the CPM technique to determine contract time is as follows: 1. The first step in applying the CPM method is to separate a project into the tasks or operations necessary for project completion. Each of these separate operations or processes is called an activity. The completion of an activity is called an event. 2. Once all the activities necessary to complete a project have been listed, the relationship of these activities to one another needs to be determined. In some cases, several activities can be undertaken concurrently. At other times, certain activities cannot be undertaken until others have been completed. In determining the sequence of operations, the question needs to be asked: "What needs to be done before proceeding with this activity, and what can be done concurrently?" Every activity has a definite event to mark its relationship with others, with respect to completing a project. 3. In working with this procedure, a network (a diagrammatic representation of the project to be undertaken) is developed. The network shows the correct sequence and relationship to activities and events. Each separate activity is shown by its own arrow and the start of all activities leaving a node depends on the completion of all activities entering a node,
Therefore, the event represented by any node is not achieved until all activities leading to the node have been completed. The resulting diagram will be a schematic representation of a project, showing all the relevant activates and events in correct sequence. 4. An actual time can be set to each activity based on production rates and other appropriate factors. The time to complete each activity is shown on each arrow to indicate the duration. The "early start" for each activity is the earliest point in time that it will start, provided that all activities before it have finished. This is not necessarily the point in time it will start; however, it is the earliest time it can start. The "early finish" for an activity is merely the duration of the activity after its "early start." As is the case with the "early start," this is not necessarily the point in time the work represented by the activity will be over, but is the earliest point in time it can occur. A "finish" date in CPM is defined as the first day upon which no further work is to be done for an activity; it is the first day after the physical completion of the activity. The completion time of a project is, therefore, the sum of the longest time path through the network leading to completion of the project.

WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.05 Appendix 6
Determination of Contract Time

5. The optimum time and cost for performing the project can be evaluated by assigning resources (such as equipment, labor hours, and materials) to each activity. The diagrammatic representation of the project then provides a means to evaluate the costs incurred with respect to the completion of specified activities.
A6-7(3) Advantages of Using the CPM
This brief summary gives an indication of how this method can be applied to each project.
Several advantages of using such a schedule are: 1. It is an accurate technique for determining contract time and verifying that the project can be constructed as designed and with identified construction sequences. 2. It is a useful tool for project managers in monitoring a project, especially when dealing with relationships of work items with respect to time. 3. Activities responsible for delays can be identified and corrective measures to keep a project on schedule can be determined.
A6-7(4) Drawbacks of Using the CPM
Several drawbacks of CPM schedules are: 1. They need to be developed by someone knowledgeable in using CPM scheduling. 2. They need to be updated regularly to ensure the contractor's operation is accurately represented.
A6-7(5) WSDOT Classes in Design Scheduling
Two classes offered by WSDOT for design scheduling are listed below: 1. CB5 GEN: Intro to Scheduling • 2. CIL •
See ATMS for course description
DES: Contract Working Days Requires CB5

Courses may change, so designers should always check with their region trainers for the latest courses offered.
A6-8
Other Factors That Influence Contract Time
A6-8(1) Conditional Notice to Proceed
Construction time on some projects, such as illumination or signalization, may be governed by the long lead time necessary to obtain materials. To minimize traffic disruption, the contract may specify a completion date several months after the notice to proceed, but the contractor should be limited to a relatively short on-site time. This may be accomplished by including in the contract a "conditional notice to proceed" clause, which would allow a specified amount of time to purchase and assemble materials. This would be followed by issuance of a full work order, which would be issued upon expiration of the assembly period or sooner, at the contractor's request.
WSDOT Plans Preparation Manual M 22-31.05
Page A6-5 Determination of Contract Time
Appendix 6
A6-8(2) Scheduling the Contract in Consideration of Other Work
Another approach in which greater flexibility may be allowed would be to include in the contract a combination of an overall completion date and a specified number of consecutive available working days, which would be changed once construction had started. It is sometimes advantageous to allow a contractor to set the actual construction dates within a given construction season. An example would be a typical small paving job that may only require the contractor to be on-site for a few weeks. For a project let in the spring, the completion date can be set for the end of the construction season, but the contractor's on-site time may be limited in the contract to a month. This allows the contractor to schedule this contract with consideration of other work the contractor may have in the same paving season. Net benefits include lower project inspection costs and a minimal disruption to traffic.

A6-8(3) Dividing the Project into Phases
An option that may be applicable to some projects is dividing a project into phases, with each phase having its own completion date. This may be applicable when coordinating with other projects or activities in the area in order to meet tight deadlines.
A6-9
Production Rate Tables
The following production rates should be used in computing contract completion time.
Production rates vary depending on the amount of traffic, the complexity of the project, and/or other restrictions.
Rates have been produced based on data furnished by districts with disregard to the size or complexity of the project or the quantity of a particular item.
Generally, large quantities in a particular project will have high production rates.

Cement Concrete Pavement Items 1. Concrete paving rates are based on a single drum batch plant. A single drum batch plant produces 10 CY per minute, with 90% efficiency. 2. Concrete paving “Rule of Thumb” is 1 mile of 24-foot-wide pavement per day (slip form). 3. Unfinished concrete pavement usually has irregular areas that require more forming and handwork. 4. Allow time for forming, if required, and curing. 5. Cement Conc. Approaches are usually incidental to sidewalk work.
